    <h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
    
    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
    <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
    <p>In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. Examples include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.</p>
    
    <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
    <p>Unsupervised learning algorithms find patterns in data without labeled examples. Common techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule mining.</p>
    
    <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
    <p>Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.</p>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Image recognition and computer vision</li>
        <li>Natural language processing</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems</li>
        <li>Fraud detection</li>
        <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
        <li>Medical diagnosis</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Understanding machine learning requires familiarity with concepts such as training data, feature engineering, model validation, overfitting, underfitting, and cross-validation. These concepts form the foundation for building effective machine learning systems.</p>
