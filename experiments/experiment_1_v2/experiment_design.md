# Experiment 1 v2: Valid Document Chunking Optimization

## Executive Summary
This revised experiment design addresses the critical flaws identified in the original Experiment 1 review. It implements proper chunking parameter materialization, collection isolation, comprehensive metrics, and statistically valid methodology to determine optimal document chunking strategies for RAG systems.

## Experiment Objectives
1. **Primary**: Determine optimal chunk_size and chunk_overlap parameters for retrieval quality and system performance
2. **Secondary**: Establish empirical relationships between chunking parameters and retrieval metrics
3. **Tertiary**: Validate chunking strategies for 16GB Mac M4 hardware constraints

## Previous Experiment Issues Addressed

### Critical Problems Fixed
- ❌ **Original**: ExperimentRunner ignored chunking parameters → ✅ **Fixed**: Per-config collection creation with actual re-chunking
- ❌ **Original**: All configs queried same data → ✅ **Fixed**: Isolated collections per configuration
- ❌ **Original**: No config provenance in results → ✅ **Fixed**: Full parameter tracking in exports
- ❌ **Original**: Only 3 queries, invalid statistics → ✅ **Fixed**: 50+ diverse query evaluation set
- ❌ **Original**: 75% overlap recommendation → ✅ **Fixed**: Constrained 10-25% overlap range

### Methodological Improvements
- **Real chunking**: Each config gets dedicated collection with actual rechunking and re-embedding
- **Proper isolation**: Collection ID threading ensures configs don't interfere
- **Rich metrics**: Retrieval quality (P@K, R@K, MRR), token utilization, timing breakdown
- **Statistical validity**: 10+ runs per config, confidence intervals, paired analysis

## Experimental Design

### Parameter Space Definition

#### Chunk Size Investigation
**Values**: [128, 256, 512, 768, 1024] tokens
**Rationale**: 
- 128: Minimal context, high precision
- 256: Optimal from literature and Experiment 1 results
- 512: Current system default  
- 768: Balanced context/precision
- 1024: Maximum context before memory pressure

#### Chunk Overlap Investigation  
**Values**: 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% of chunk_size
**Rationale**:
- Constrained to best practices (avoiding 75% overlap from original)
- Ensures meaningful overlap without excessive storage bloat
- Example ranges:
  - chunk_size=256: overlap=[26, 38, 51, 64]
  - chunk_size=512: overlap=[51, 77, 102, 128]
  - chunk_size=1024: overlap=[102, 154, 205, 256]

#### Total Configurations
**Count**: 5 chunk sizes × 4 overlap ratios = 20 configurations
**Collections**: Each config gets unique collection (e.g., `exp_cs256_co38`)

### Query Dataset Design

#### Comprehensive Evaluation Set (52 queries)
**Source**: `test_data/enhanced_evaluation_queries.json`

**Categories**:
1. **Factual Questions (15 queries)**
   - Simple factual lookups
   - Historical questions
   - Definitional queries
   - Examples: "What is machine learning?", "When was Python created?"

2. **Analytical Questions (15 queries)**  
   - Comparative analysis
   - Causal relationships
   - Technical explanations
   - Examples: "Compare supervised vs unsupervised learning", "Why do neural networks work?"

3. **Technical Definitions (12 queries)**
   - Domain-specific terminology
   - Complex technical concepts
   - Implementation details
   - Examples: "Define gradient descent", "Explain backpropagation algorithm"

4. **Edge Cases (10 queries)**
   - Ambiguous questions
   - Multi-part queries
   - Out-of-domain questions
   - Examples: "What are the challenges in AI?", "How does quantum computing relate to ML?"

#### Query Quality Validation
- **Ground truth**: Manual relevance judgments for retrieval evaluation
- **Diversity**: Balanced across query types and complexity levels
- **Corpus coverage**: Queries span different document types and topics

### Metrics Framework

#### Retrieval Quality Metrics
1. **Precision@K** (K=1,3,5): Fraction of retrieved docs that are relevant
2. **Recall@K** (K=1,3,5): Fraction of relevant docs that are retrieved  
3. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Average inverse rank of first relevant result
4. **Normalized DCG@5**: Discounted cumulative gain with relevance weighting

#### System Performance Metrics
1. **Response Time Breakdown**:
   - Retrieval time (database query + similarity search)
   - Generation time (LLM inference)
   - Total end-to-end time
2. **Token Utilization**:
   - Prompt tokens (query + context)
   - Generated tokens (response)
   - Context utilization efficiency
3. **Resource Consumption**:
   - Peak memory usage during retrieval/generation
   - Index storage size per collection
   - Processing overhead per configuration

#### Quality Consistency Metrics
1. **Response Quality**: BLEU score consistency across configs
2. **Retrieval Stability**: Variance in retrieved document sets
3. **Generation Consistency**: Response length and content similarity
