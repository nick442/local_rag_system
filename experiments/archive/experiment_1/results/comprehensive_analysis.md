## Performance Analysis

### 1. Response Time by Chunk Size

| Chunk Size | Average Time | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|------------|-------------|---------|-----|-----|
| 256 tokens | 8.45s | 2.89s | 5.40s | 12.42s |
| 512 tokens | 9.49s | 3.45s | 6.57s | 14.43s |
| 1024 tokens | 9.42s | 3.45s | 6.52s | 14.36s |

**Insight:** Chunk size 256 shows best performance with lowest average response time and least variability.

### 2. Response Time by Chunk Overlap

| Chunk Overlap | Average Time | Std Dev | Best Query Time |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| 32 tokens | 9.48s | 3.64s | 6.60s |
| 64 tokens | 9.46s | 3.71s | 6.60s |
| 128 tokens | 7.74s | 3.19s | 4.14s |
| 192 tokens | 6.18s | 2.38s | 3.79s |

**Key Finding:** Chunk overlap 192 provides 35% better performance than 32-token overlap and shows most consistent response times.

### 3. Query-Specific Performance Patterns

**"What is machine learning?" (Simple factual)**
- Consistent 35-word responses across all configurations
- Response time range: 4.79s - 7.01s
- Most stable performance across parameters

**"Define neural networks." (Complex technical)**  
- Consistent 88-word detailed responses
- Response time range: 9.95s - 15.06s
- Most sensitive to parameter changes

**"What is deep learning?" (Brief technical)**
- Consistent 7-10 word responses
- Response time range: 1.84s - 6.74s
- Fastest overall but highest variability

## Quality Assessment

### Response Consistency
- **Perfect consistency:** All configurations produced identical content for each query
- **Retrieval reliability:** 100% success rate (5 sources per query)
- **Generation reliability:** 100% response generation success
- **Content quality:** Maintained across all parameter combinations

### Retrieval Performance
