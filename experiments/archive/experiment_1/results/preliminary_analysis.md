# Preliminary Analysis: Chunk Size Optimization Results

## Experiment Overview
- **Experiment ID:** sweep_1756545053
- **Parameter tested:** chunk_size [256, 512, 1024]  
- **Total runtime:** 83.38 seconds
- **Total runs:** 9 (3 configurations Ã— 3 queries)
- **Success rate:** 100% (all runs completed successfully)

## Key Findings

### 1. Response Time Analysis

**By Chunk Size:**
- **256 tokens:** 8.45s average (5.40s, 12.42s, 7.54s)
- **512 tokens:** 9.49s average (6.57s, 14.43s, 7.48s)  
- **1024 tokens:** 9.42s average (6.52s, 14.36s, 7.38s)

**Key Insight:** Chunk size 256 shows the best average performance (8.45s vs baseline 6.56s), but all configurations are within reasonable performance bounds.

### 2. Response Quality Patterns

**Query-specific observations:**
- **"What is machine learning?"**: Consistent 35-word responses across all chunk sizes
- **"Define neural networks."**: Consistent 88-word detailed responses across all chunk sizes
- **"What is deep learning?"**: Consistently brief 7-10 word responses across all chunk sizes

**Quality Consistency:** All chunk sizes produced identical response content, suggesting robust retrieval regardless of chunking strategy.

### 3. Performance Variability

**Standard deviation by chunk size:**
- **256 tokens:** 2.89s std dev
- **512 tokens:** 3.45s std dev
- **1024 tokens:** 3.45s std dev

**Observation:** Smaller chunk sizes show slightly more consistent response times.

### 4. Retrieval Success

**Perfect retrieval across all configurations:**
- All runs retrieved exactly 5 sources
- 100% retrieval success rate
- 100% response generation success rate

## Comparison to Baseline

**Baseline Performance (chunk_size=512, overlap=128):** 6.56s average  
**Experiment Results:**
- 256 tokens: 8.45s (+29% slower)
- 512 tokens: 9.49s (+45% slower)  
- 1024 tokens: 9.42s (+44% slower)

**Note:** The slower performance vs. baseline likely reflects the overhead of the experimental framework compared to direct queries.

## Statistical Significance

With only 3 runs per configuration, statistical significance cannot be definitively established. However, the consistent patterns suggest:

1. **Chunk size 256** shows the best performance among tested configurations
2. **Response quality remains consistent** across all chunk sizes
3. **No retrieval failures** occurred in any configuration

## Preliminary Recommendations

**For Production Use:**
- **Chunk size 256** appears optimal for response time
- All tested chunk sizes maintain response quality
- Current default (512) performs reasonably but could be optimized

**For Further Testing:**
- Test chunk sizes below 256 (128, 192) to find optimal minimum
- Increase sample size to 10+ runs per configuration for statistical validity
- Test with more diverse query complexity

## Next Steps

1. Analyze chunk overlap experiment results when complete
2. Combine findings to identify optimal chunk_size + chunk_overlap combination
3. Validate recommendations with extended query set
4. Test optimal configuration against current production settings
