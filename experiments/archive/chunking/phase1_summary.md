# Chunking Optimization Experiment Infrastructure - Complete Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete: Infrastructure Setup** 

**1. Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring System:**
- `experiment_logger.py`: Real-time experiment tracking with system resource monitoring
- Structured JSONL metrics output with timestamps
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Automatic report generation

**2. Automated Experiment Runner:**
- `experiment_runner.py`: Handles ingestion, parameter sweeps, and experiment orchestration
- Built-in error recovery and retry mechanisms  
- Resource usage monitoring during experiments
- Support for all planned chunk sizes (128, 256, 512, 768, 1024, 1536, 2048) and overlap ratios

**3. Statistical Analysis & Visualization:**
- `analysis_tools.py`: Comprehensive statistical analysis with significance testing
- Automated visualization generation (heatmaps, performance curves, distributions)
- Optimal configuration identification with confidence intervals
- Markdown report generation

**4. Complete Orchestrator:**
- `run_experiments.py`: Main pipeline coordinator for all 5 experimental phases
- Interactive execution with user confirmations at each phase
- Estimated 14-18 hours total runtime for complete experiment

## ‚úÖ **System Validation Complete:**
- ‚úÖ Models properly symlinked and accessible
- ‚úÖ Corpus files extracted (FIQA: ~8K financial docs, SciFact: ~5K scientific docs)  
- ‚úÖ Query set created (30 evaluation queries across 6 categories)
- ‚úÖ System health verified - embedding models load correctly
- ‚úÖ Pipeline validated - ingestion system recognizes files and processes them
- ‚úÖ Logging system tested and working

## üìä **Ready for Execution:**

The system is now ready to execute the complete experimental pipeline:

**Phase 1**: System Preparation (2 hours)
- ‚úÖ Complete - all infrastructure validated

**Phase 2**: Full Corpus Ingestion (3-4 hours)  
- Ready to ingest ~13,000 documents total
- Estimated storage: ~3.5GB

**Phase 3**: Baseline Establishment (1 hour)
- Ready to run 30 queries across 2 collections

**Phase 4**: Parameter Sweep (6-8 hours)
- Ready to execute ~720 experiments
- 7 chunk sizes √ó 5 overlap ratios √ó 30 queries √ó 2 collections

**Phase 5**: Analysis & Reporting (2 hours)
- Automated statistical analysis and visualization
- Comprehensive markdown report generation

## üöÄ **To Execute the Full Experiment:**

```bash
cd experiments/chunking
source ~/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate rag_env
python run_experiments.py
```

This will run the complete 14-18 hour experimental pipeline with:
- **Real-time progress tracking** and logging
- **User confirmations** at each phase
- **Automatic error handling** and recovery options
- **Comprehensive documentation** throughout
- **Final statistical analysis** and recommendations

## üìã **Expected Deliverables:**
- Complete experimental data (720+ configurations)
- Statistical significance analysis 
- Performance optimization curves
- Optimal chunk size recommendations
- Production-ready configuration files
- Comprehensive research report

## üìù **Files Created:**
- `experiments/chunking/experiment_logger.py` - Logging and monitoring system
- `experiments/chunking/experiment_runner.py` - Experiment execution engine
- `experiments/chunking/analysis_tools.py` - Statistical analysis and visualization
- `experiments/chunking/run_experiments.py` - Complete pipeline orchestrator
- `test_data/chunking_queries.json` - 30 evaluation queries across 6 categories
- `models/` - Symlinked models (embeddings + LLM)
- `corpus/technical/fiqa/` - 8,000+ financial documents extracted
- `corpus/narrative/scifact/` - 5,000+ scientific documents extracted

## üéØ **Success Criteria Met:**
- ‚úÖ Complete infrastructure with elaborate documentation
- ‚úÖ Test validation completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Time estimations provided for each phase
- ‚úÖ Resource monitoring and error handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Statistical analysis framework ready
- ‚úÖ Production-ready experiment pipeline

**Status**: Infrastructure complete and validated. Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Full Corpus Ingestion.

**Next Step**: Execute `python run_experiments.py` to start Phase 2 or run individual phases as needed.
