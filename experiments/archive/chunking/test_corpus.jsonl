Under the DFA banks can no longer solely rely on credit ratings as due diligence to buy a financial instrument, so that's a plus.

The only reason the libertarians get away with pushing their tripe as a rational philosophy is because no one will point out what it is wrong with their thinking. Why? Well, for most of my lifetime, their \"\"philosophy\"\" was considered nuttery in line with the John Birchers and so why bother.

{"_id": "108", "title": "", "text": "Futures contracts are a member of a larger class of financial assets called derivatives. Derivatives are called such because their payoffs depend on the price of other assets (financial or real). Other kinds of derivatives are call options, put options. Fixed income assets that mimic the behavior of derivatives are callable bonds, puttable bonds etc.  A futures contract is a contract that specifies the following: Just like with any other contract, there are two parties involved. One party commits to delivering the underlying asset to the other party on expiration date in exchange for the futures price. The other party commits to paying the futures price in exchange for the asset. There is no price that any of the two parties pay upfront to engage in the contract. The language used is so that the agent committing to receiving the delivery of the underlying asset is said to have bought the contract. The agent that commits to make the delivery is said to have sold the contract.  So answer your question, buying on June 1 a futures contract at the futures price of $100, with a maturity date on August 1 means you commit to paying $100 for the underlying asset on August 1. You don't have to pay anything upfront. Futures price is simply what the contract prescribes the underlying asset will exchange hands for.", "metadata": {}}
