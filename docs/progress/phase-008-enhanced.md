## Proposed Comprehensive Benchmarking Suite (Next Phase)

### Current Gaps Analysis

**1. Limited Query Diversity**
- Current: Mostly simple ML/AI queries
- Gap: Domain-specific queries, multi-language, technical depth variations

**2. No Scalability Testing**
- Current: Only tests with small corpus (10 documents)
- Gap: Performance across corpus sizes (100, 1K, 10K, 100K documents)

**3. No Stress Testing**  
- Current: Sequential query processing only
- Gap: Concurrent users, resource exhaustion, sustained load

**4. Limited Retrieval Analysis**
- Current: Fixed k values, basic relevance
- Gap: Dynamic k optimization, cross-domain retrieval effectiveness

**5. No Comparative Analysis**
- Current: Single-point measurements
- Gap: Baseline comparisons, regression detection, A/B testing framework

**6. Missing Edge Cases**
- Current: Happy path scenarios
- Gap: Malformed queries, empty results, network failures, corrupted data
