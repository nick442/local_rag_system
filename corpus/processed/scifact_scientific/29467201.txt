CYP18A1, a key enzyme of Drosophila steroid hormone inactivation, is essential for metamorphosis.

Ecdysteroids are steroid hormones, which coordinate major developmental transitions in insects. Both the rises and falls in circulating levels of active hormones are important for coordinating molting and metamorphosis, making both ecdysteroid biosynthesis and inactivation of physiological relevance. We demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster Cyp18a1 encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) with 26-hydroxylase activity, a prominent step in ecdysteroid catabolism. A clear ortholog of Cyp18a1 exists in most insects and crustaceans. When Cyp18a1 is transfected in Drosophila S2 cells, extensive conversion of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) into 20-hydroxyecdysonoic acid is observed. This is a multi-step process, which involves the formation of 20,26-dihydroxyecdysone as an intermediate. In Drosophila larvae, Cyp18a1 is expressed in many target tissues of 20E. We examined the consequences of Cyp18a1 inactivation on Drosophila development. Null alleles generated by excision of a P element and RNAi knockdown of Cyp18a1 both result in pupal lethality, possibly as a consequence of impaired ecdysteroid degradation. Our data suggest that the inactivation of 20E is essential for proper development and that CYP18A1 is a key enzyme in this process.
