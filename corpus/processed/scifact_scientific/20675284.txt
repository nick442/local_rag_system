TGF-beta inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation: alteration of EGF binding and EGF-induced growth-regulatory (competence) gene expression.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits the growth of endothelial cells derived from various sources, including human umbilical vein, bovine aorta, and rat heart. Long-term exposure of rat heart endothelial cells to TGF-beta also induces dramatic changes in morphology that are characteristic of senescent cells. These changes are accompanied by a decrease in the number of high-affinity receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF), with almost no change in total receptor number. Additionally, the EGF-induced expression of specific competence genes (c-myc, JE, KC) is decreased, whereas the induction of c-fos gene expression by EGF is unaltered by TGF-beta treatment. These data suggest that growth inhibitors such as TGF-beta may act by altering the cell's response to growth-stimulatory factors.
