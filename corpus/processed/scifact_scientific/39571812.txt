Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism: A Trait Shared by Several Complex Neurodevelopmental Disorders.

Reproductive function depends on the activity of the gonadotropic axis, which is controlled by a hypothalamic neural network whose main function is to regulate the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This endocrine network is not mature at birth, and several phases of activation-inactivation of the gonadotropic axis are necessary for its normal development. The postnatal maturation of the GnRH network lies under the control of a neurodevelopmental program that starts in fetal life and ends at puberty. There are many clinical situations in which this program is interrupted, leading to congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and an absence of puberty. For many years, attention has mainly been focused on the genetics of isolated CHH. More recently, the emergence of new genomics techniques has led to the description of genetic defects in very rare syndromes in which CHH is associated with complex neurological dysfunctions. Here, we review the clinical phenotype and genetic defects linked to such syndromic CHH. This analysis highlights the close link between the ubiquitin pathway, synaptic proteins and CHH, as well as unexpected mutations in genes encoding nucleolar proteins.
