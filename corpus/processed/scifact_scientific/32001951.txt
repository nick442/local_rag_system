Regulation of the expression of alkaline phosphatase in a human breast-cancer cell line.

Treatment of the cultured human breast-cancer cells BC-M1 with dexamethasone induced a placental-type alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Both the ALP activity and the mRNA level in the cells were increased. The induction of ALP activity by dexamethasone was time- and dose-dependent. The accumulation of ALP mRNA was inhibited by both actinomycin D and cycloheximide, indicating that its induction is a complex event and may involve other regulatory proteins. Retinoic acid showed opposing effects with dexamethasone on the expression of alkaline phosphatase. Retinoic acid (RA) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also substantially reduced the dexamethasone-induced expression of ALP. Studies on thermostability and sensitivity to various amino acid inhibitors indicated that the BC-M1 ALP is most similar to the placental form. Northern hybridization analysis also revealed that ALP mRNA transcripts in BC-M1 and term placenta are similar in size and are distinct from that of the placental-like mRNA transcript in choriocarcinoma cells. Analysis of the degradation of BC-M1 ALP mRNA showed a similar half-life of 27 h in the untreated and in dexamethasone- or RA-treated cells. These findings demonstrated that the induction of ALP in BC-M1 cells by dexamethasone is mainly due to the increase in the transcription of the ALP gene.
