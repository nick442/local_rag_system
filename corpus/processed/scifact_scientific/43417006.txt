Comparative risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus for antihypertensive drugs: A network meta-analysis.

New-onset diabetes mellitus (NOD) refers to forms of diabetes mellitus that develop during the therapeutic processes of other diseases such as hypertension. This study has been conducted in a network meta-analysis to compare antihypertensive drugs by identifying both the advantages and disadvantages on NOD by focusing on their respective effect rates. Odd ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals or credible intervals were calculated within pairwise and network meta-analysis. A total of 38 articles with 224 140 patients were included to evaluate the preventive effect of hypertension drugs on NOD. From the network meta-analysis it was evident that both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as well as angiotensin receptor blocker treatments are associated with a lower risk of developing NOD compared with placebo, with ranking probabilities of 79.81% and 72.77%, respectively, while β-blockers and calcium channel blockers may significantly increase the probability of developing NOD (β-blockers: odds ratio, 2.18 [95% credible intervals: 1.36-3.50]; calcium channel blockers: odds ratio, 1.16 [95% credible intervals, 1.05-1.29]). In conclusion, angiotensin receptor blockers have an advantage over the other treatments regarding the NOD.
