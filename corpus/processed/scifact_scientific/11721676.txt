Proteomic identification of a novel isoform of collapsin response mediator protein-2 in spinal nerves peripheral to dorsal root ganglia.

Primary afferent fibers are originated from pseudounipolar sensory cells in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and transmit external stimuli received in the skin to the spinal cord. Here we undertook a proteomic approach to uncover the polarity of primary afferent fibers. Lumbar spinal nerve segments, peripheral and central to DRG, were dissected from 5-wk-old Wistar rats and the lysates were subjected to large-sized 2-DE at pH 5-6. Among approximately 800 protein spots detected in the central and peripheral fractions, one of the unique spots in the peripheral fraction with MW of 60 kDa and pI of 5.6 was identified as an isoform of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) by MALDI-TOF MS and Western blots with anti-CRMP-2 antibodies that recognize 1-17 and 486-528 residues. Since this novel spot was detected only in the peripheral fraction, but not in the central fraction, DRG, and other regions of the brain, it was named periCRMP-2. The C-terminal fragment of CRMP-2 was not detected in periCRMP-2 by MS analyses. Expression of periCRMP-2 decreased following sciatic nerve injury. These results suggest that periCRMP-2 is a C-terminal truncated isoform polarized in the peripheral side of spinal nerves and may be involved in nerve degeneration and regeneration.
