Cerebral perfusion and stroke.

Stroke is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by multiple disease mechanisms, but all result in a disruption of cerebral blood flow with subsequent tissue damage. This review covers the mechanisms responsible for regulation of the normal cerebral circulation, and how they are disrupted in disease states. A central concept in treating patients with acute ischaemic stroke is the existence of an ischaemic penumbra of potentially salvageable tissue, and the evidence for its existence in humans is reviewed.
