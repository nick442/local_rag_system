Using the yeast gene deletion collection to customize gene expression.

Substitute Teacher Despite the relative ease of genome manipulation in S. cerevisiae, researchers are always looking to learn still more convenient and rapid methods for substituting yeast promoters. Replacing a gene's native promoter with a heterolo-gous promoter of choice allows regulated expression and simplifies the task of discerning functional relevance. Although a host of clever chromosomal insertion strategies have been described over the years, the advent of the S. cerevisiae Genome Deletion Project provides an incredible resource for a further streamlined workflow. The strategy, explained by Liko et al. on p. 728 is appealingly simple. The genome deletion project resulted in a collection of strains in which a single ORF is replaced with a kanamycin resistance module. Although the purpose of the collection is to have a comprehensive resource of essentially all possible knockouts, the authors point out that for almost any given yeast promoter of interest there will be a strain in which the ORF imm..
