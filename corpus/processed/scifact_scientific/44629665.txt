The Supporting Independent Immunization and Vaccine Advisory Committees (SIVAC) initiative: a country-driven, multi-partner program to support evidence-based decision making.

Multiple health priorities, limited human resources and logistical capacities, as well as expensive vaccines with limited funds available increase the need for evidence-based decision making in immunization programs. The aim of the Supporting Independent Immunization and Vaccine Advisory Committees (SIVAC) Initiative is to support countries in the establishment or strengthening of National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) that provide recommendations on immunization policies and programs (e.g., vaccination schedules, improvements of routine immunization coverage, new vaccine introduction, etc.). SIVAC, a program funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is based on a country-driven, step-by-step process that ensures its support is tailored to country needs and emphasizes NITAG sustainability. SIVAC supports countries by reinforcing the capacities of the NITAG scientific and technical secretariat and by providing specific support activities established in consultation with the country and other international partners. Additionally, SIVAC and partners have built an electronic platform, the NITAG Resource Center, that provides information, tools, and briefings to NITAGs and the immunization community.
