Effects of Thiazolidinediones on Stroke Recovery: A Case-Matched Controlled Study

Anti-inflammatory therapy decreases infarct size and enhances stroke recovery. Thiazolidinedione peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma agonists have potent anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing anti-diabetic actions. Thirty stroke patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute inpatient stroke rehabilitation receiving pioglitazone or rosiglitazone were matched for age, sex, initial FIMTM score and interval post-stroke with 30 stroke patients with type 2 diabetes not receiving thiazolidinediones. Relevant outcome variables were compared for both groups. The thiazolidinedione treated group showed significantly greater mean improvement in FIMTM score compared to control group (25.6 ± 10.2 SD vs. 19.8 ± 10.5, respectively, P = 0.015). There was no significant difference in length of rehabilitation hospital stay (24.2 ± 7.6 vs. 25.1 ± 7.4 days, P = 0.657) or final discharge destination (home/institution, 19/11 versus 17/13, P = 0.792). Use of thiazolidinediones was associated with enhanced functional recovery in stroke patients with type 2 diabetes.
