Phorbol esters and cytokines regulate the expression of the NEMO-related protein, a molecule involved in a NF-kappa B-independent pathway.

The NF-kappaB signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the immune, inflammatory, and apoptotic responses. Recently, we identified the NF-kappaB Essential Modulator (NEMO) as an essential component of this pathway. NEMO is a structural and regulatory subunit of the high molecular kinase complex (IKK) responsible for the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB inhibitors. Data base searching led to the isolation of a cDNA encoding a protein we called NRP (NEMO-related protein), which shows a strong homology to NEMO. Here we show that NRP is present in a novel high molecular weight complex, that contains none of the known members of the IKK complex. Consistently, we could not observe any effect of NRP on NF-kappaB signaling. Nonetheless, we could demonstrate that treatment with phorbol esters induces NRP phosphorylation and decreases its half-life. This phosphorylation event could only be inhibited by K-252a and stauroporin. We also show that de novo expression of NRP can be induced by interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha and that these two stimuli have a synergistic effect on NRP expression. In addition, we observed that endogenous NRP is associated with the Golgi apparatus. Analogous to NEMO, we find that NRP is associated in a complex with two kinases, suggesting that NRP could play a similar role in another signaling pathway.
