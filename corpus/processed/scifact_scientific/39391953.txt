Determination of chloramphenicol residues in milk by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: improvement by biotin-streptavidin-amplified system.

A sensitive biotin-streptavidin amplified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BA-ELISA) method was developed for the determination of chloramphenicol residues in milk. The biotin-streptavidin system was applied to enhance the sensitivity. After optimization, the detection limit of the method was found to be 0.042 +/- 0.006 ng mL(-1), which is 8-fold more sensitive than the traditional competitive ELISA using the same antibody and coating antigen. The amplification mechanism of the biotin-streptavidin system and the major factors affecting the sensitivity of detection are discussed. This method was successfully applied to determine the chloramphenicol residues in milk samples with a simple and rapid extraction procedure, and good recoveries (85.66-109.67%) were obtained. The result indicated that the biotin-streptavidin system may be a valuable tool to improve the specific detection of trace veterinary drug residues and could be widely used for routine monitoring of food samples.
