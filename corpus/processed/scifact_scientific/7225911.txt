The human long non-coding RNA-RoR is a p53 repressor in response to DNA damage

It is well known that upon stress, the level of the tumor suppressor p53 is remarkably elevated. However, despite extensive studies, the underlying mechanism involving important inter-players for stress-induced p53 regulation is still not fully understood. We present evidence that the human lincRNA-RoR (RoR) is a strong negative regulator of p53. Unlike MDM2 that causes p53 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, RoR suppresses p53 translation through direct interaction with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein I (hnRNP I). Importantly, a 28-base RoR sequence carrying hnRNP I binding motifs is essential and sufficient for p53 repression. We further show that RoR inhibits p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate a RoR-p53 autoregulatory feedback loop where p53 transcriptionally induces RoR expression. Together, these results suggest that the RoR-hnRNP I-p53 axis may constitute an additional surveillance network for the cell to better respond to various stresses.
