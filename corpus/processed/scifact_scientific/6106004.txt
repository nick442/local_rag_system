Separation of mother and daughter cells.

Publisher Summary The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ) divides asymmetrically. In vegetative growth, yeast cells reproduce by budding, and the position where the bud forms ultimately determines the plane of cell division. This chapter describes the detailed procedures for the separation and isolation of mothers and daughters. These protocols have been used by investigators studying aging, bud site selection, and other aspects of asymmetric cell division. The chapter describes the procedures for performing life span analysis by micromanipulation and the steps for the large-scale collection of old cells. At the beginning and the end of a life span, it can be difficult to distinguish mothers from daughters. At most points in the life span, daughter cells are smaller than the mothers that produced them. In addition, mother cells will generally bud a second time before their daughter cells form their first bud. One method for effective isolation of virgin daughter cells from mother cells, but not for recovery of old mothers, is called a “baby machine. ” Mother cells are attached to a membrane and allowed to divide. Daughter cells from these attached cells are eluted continuously by washing the membrane.
