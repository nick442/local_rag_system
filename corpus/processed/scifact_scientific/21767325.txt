Influence of lifestyle modification on arterial stiffness and wave reflections.

Arterial stiffness and wave reflections exert a number of adverse effects on cardiovascular function and disease risk and are associated with a greater rate of mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure and essential hypertension. Accordingly, the prevention and treatment of arterial stiffness are of paramount importance. Because arterial stiffening is being recognized as a critical precursor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is essential to understand the role of lifestyle modifications on preventing and reversing arterial stiffening. Available evidence indicates that lifestyle modifications, in particular aerobic exercise and sodium restriction, appear to be clinically efficacious therapeutic interventions for preventing and treating arterial stiffening. Thus, sufficient evidence is available to recommend lifestyle modifications as part of a first-line therapeutic approach for arterial stiffening. However, more information is needed for a full understanding and optimal use of lifestyle modifications in the management of arterial stiffening.
