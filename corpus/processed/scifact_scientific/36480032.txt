Role of ocular pigment epithelial cells in immune privilege

The ocular microenvironment is both immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory in nature. Pigment epithelial (PE) cells isolated from the eye possess the ability to suppress the T cell receptor-dependent activation of T cells and the induction of regulatory T cells in vitro. This property is dependent on the cells’ capacity to produce cell-surface and soluble inhibitory molecules, for example CD86 (B7-2), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, thrombospondin-1, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1/B7-H1), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 2α. Cultured ocular PE cells from the iris, ciliary body, and retina can individually suppress T-cell activation via mechanisms that partially overlap. Moreover, PE-derived regulatory T cells acquire functions that play a role in establishing immune regulation in the eye. Multiple strategies are employed within the eye to control immune-mediated inflammation. This phenomenon is known as immune privilege and is instrumental in helping to prevent extensive damage to bystander cells that would otherwise lead to blindness. This review focuses on the immunosuppressive property and role of ocular PE cells in immune privileged sites.
