The Assumption of Caregiving: Grandmothers Raising the Children of the Crack Cocaine Epidemic:

In this article, selected findings are presented from a study of the experiences of 71 African American women who have become the sole caregivers for at least one grandchild or great-grandchild as a result of the involvement of the parent in use of crack cocaine. Despite the unique circumstances of each situation, three patterns of the assumption of caregiving emerged from analysis of the intensive interviews and participant observation: sudden assumption, negotiated assumption, and inevitable assumption of the permanent caregiver role. Each pattern is described along six dimensions: forewarning, initiation, the trigger event, the caregiver's goal, her assumed trajectory of the caregiving period, and her perceived influence on her own destiny. These accounts provide important information for those who work with women, children, and families, as well as unique insight into the consequences of the crack cocaine epidemic.
