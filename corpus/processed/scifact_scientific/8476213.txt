A general model to explore complex dominance patterns in plant sporophytic self-incompatibility systems.

We developed a general model of sporophytic self-incompatibility under negative frequency-dependent selection allowing complex patterns of dominance among alleles. We used this model deterministically to investigate the effects on equilibrium allelic frequencies of the number of dominance classes, the number of alleles per dominance class, the asymmetry in dominance expression between pollen and pistil, and whether selection acts on male fitness only or both on male and on female fitnesses. We show that the so-called "recessive effect" occurs under a wide variety of situations. We found emerging properties of finite population models with several alleles per dominance class such as that higher numbers of alleles are maintained in more dominant classes and that the number of dominance classes can evolve. We also investigated the occurrence of homozygous genotypes and found that substantial proportions of those can occur for the most recessive alleles. We used the model for two species with complex dominance patterns to test whether allelic frequencies in natural populations are in agreement with the distribution predicted by our model. We suggest that the model can be used to test explicitly for additional, allele-specific, selective forces.
