Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 is a transcriptional factor regulating the gene expression of SALL4.

Both signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and SALL4 are important in maintaining the pluripotent and self-renewal state of embryonic stem cells. We hypothesized that STAT3, a latent transcriptional factor, may regulate the gene expression of SALL4. In support of this hypothesis, DNA sequence analysis of the SALL4 gene promoter revealed four putative STAT3-binding sites. Using a SALL4-luciferase reporter gene assay, we found that modulation of the STAT3 activity significantly up-regulated the luciferase activity. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, the segment of the SALL4 promoter showing the highest affinity to STAT3 was localized to -366 to -163, in which there was only one putative STAT3 binding site starting at -199. Site-directed mutagenesis of all four putative STAT3-binding sites in the SALL4 promoter significantly reduced its responsiveness to STAT3, although the most dramatic effect was seen at the binding site starting at -199. We further tested the functional relationship between STAT3 and SALL4 using MDA-MB-231, a breast cell line carrying constitutive SALL4 expression and STAT3 activity. Down-regulation of the STAT3 activity using a dominant-negative construct resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of SALL4. To conclude, our data suggest that STAT3 and SALL4 probably cooperate in both physiological and pathological states.
