Implementation of contemporary oral antiplatelet treatment guidelines in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a report from the GReek AntiPlatelet rEgistry (GRAPE).

BACKGROUND Few data exist about the implementation of contemporary oral antiplatelet treatment guidelines in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS GReek AntiPlatelet rEgistry (GRAPE), initiated on January 2012, is a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study focusing on contemporary use of P2Y12 inhibitors. In 1434 patients we evaluated appropriateness of P2Y12 selection initially and at discharge by applying an eligibility-assessing algorithm based on P2Y12 inhibitors' contraindications/specific warnings and precautions. RESULTS Appropriate, less preferable and inappropriate P2Y12 inhibitor selections were made initially in 45.8%, 47.2% and 6.6% and at discharge in 64.1%, 29.2% and 6.6% of patients, respectively. The selection of clopidogrel was most commonly less preferable, both initially (69.7%) and at discharge (75.6%). Appropriate selection of newer agents was high initially (79.2%-82.8%), with further increase as selection at discharge (89.4%-89.8%). Inappropriate selection of the newer agents was 17.2%-20.8% initially, decreasing to 10.2%-10.6% at discharge. Conditions and co-medications related to increased bleeding risk, presentation with ST elevation myocardial infarction and the absence of reperfusion within the first 24h were the most powerful predictors of appropriate P2Y12 selection initially, whereas age â‰¥75 years, conditions and co-medications related to increased bleeding risk and regional trends mostly affected appropriate P2Y12 selection at discharge. CONCLUSIONS In GRAPE, adherence with the recently released guidelines on oral antiplatelet therapy was satisfactory. Clopidogrel was most commonly used as a less preferable selection, while prasugrel or ticagrelor selection was mostly appropriate. Certain factors may predict initial and at discharge guideline implementation. Clinical Trial Registration-clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01774955 http://clinicaltrials.gov/.
