Electron microscopic studies of macrophages in early human yolk sacs.

Distribution and fine structure of macrophages were studied in 10 human embryos in the 6th and 7th week of gestation, 5.5 to 12 mm in crown-rump length. The yolk sac macrophages were found in the extravascular mesenchymal tissues and intravascular spaces long before the first appearance of bone marrow and lymphatic tissues in the embryos. In addition to the macrophages, the fibroblastic cells and the cells of erythropoietic series were also present in the extravascular space. The macrophages showed a variety of cellular structures suggesting transition from immature cell type with no heterophagolysosomes to mature cell type in phagocytosis. The mature macrophages avidly phagocytized the primitive erythroblasts and occasionally platelets. They were positively stained for lysosomal enzymes and were characterized by numerous pleomorphic heterophagolysosomes which exhibited various stages of digestion of phagocytized blood cells. The origin of intravascular macrophages may be in either migrated extravascular macrophages or phagocytic endothelial cells. The phagocytosis and degradation of erythroblasts appear to be one of the main functions of yolk sac macrophages. The presence of the macrophages in mitosis indicates their proliferation in situ.
