The in vitro effect of dandelions antioxidants on microsomal lipid peroxidation.

Dandelions have long been used in herbal medicine for their choleretic, diuretic, antiinflammatory, appetite-stimulating and laxative properties. An antioxidant property can be supposed as a basis of their-therapeutic effects. To understand the mechanism of the drug's action, the effects of natural extracts on a microsomal fraction of rat liver were examined. The extracts diminished the enzymatically induced-lipid peroxidation and reduced the cytochrome c with and without NADPH in a concentration dependent manner.
