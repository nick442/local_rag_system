ROS-induced R loops trigger a transcription-coupled but BRCA1/2-independent homologous recombination pathway through CSB

Actively transcribed regions of the genome are protected by transcription-coupled DNA repair mechanisms, including transcription-coupled homologous recombination (TC-HR). Here we used reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce and characterize TC-HR at a transcribed locus in human cells. As canonical HR, TC-HR requires RAD51. However, the localization of RAD51 to damage sites during TC-HR does not require BRCA1 and BRCA2, but relies on RAD52 and Cockayne Syndrome Protein B (CSB). During TC-HR, RAD52 is recruited by CSB through an acidic domain. CSB in turn is recruited by R loops, which are strongly induced by ROS in transcribed regions. Notably, CSB displays a strong affinity for DNA:RNA hybrids in vitro, suggesting that it is a sensor of ROS-induced R loops. Thus, TC-HR is triggered by R loops, initiated by CSB, and carried out by the CSB-RAD52-RAD51 axis, establishing a BRCA1/2-independent alternative HR pathway protecting the transcribed genome.
