OPA1 gene therapy prevents retinal ganglion cell loss in a Dominant Optic Atrophy mouse model

Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is a rare progressive and irreversible blinding disease which is one of the most frequent forms of hereditary optic neuropathy. DOA is mainly caused by dominant mutation in the OPA1 gene encoding a large mitochondrial GTPase with crucial roles in membrane dynamics and cell survival. Hereditary optic neuropathies are commonly characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, leading to the optic nerve atrophy and the progressive loss of visual acuity. Up to now, despite increasing advances in the understanding of the pathological mechanisms, DOA remains intractable. Here, we tested the efficiency of gene therapy on a genetically-modified mouse model reproducing DOA vision loss. We performed intravitreal injections of an Adeno-Associated Virus carrying the human OPA1 cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promotor. Our results provide the first evidence that gene therapy is efficient on a mouse model of DOA as the wild-type OPA1 expression is able to alleviate the OPA1-induced retinal ganglion cell degeneration, the hallmark of the disease. These results displayed encouraging effects of gene therapy for Dominant Optic Atrophy, fostering future investigations aiming at clinical trials in patients.
