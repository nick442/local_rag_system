Pre-eclampsia: connecting angiogenic and metabolic pathways.

Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disease of pregnancy with a worldwide incidence of 5-8%. This review focuses on recent developments in pre-eclampsia research related to angiogenesis and metabolism. We first address the 'angiogenic imbalance' theory, which hypothesizes that pre-eclampsia results from an imbalance of factors that promote or antagonize angiogenesis, such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt1), 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Next, we analyze the association between pre-eclampsia and dysfunctional metabolism of both homocysteine and placental glycogen. We hope that illuminating some of the various connections existing between angiogenesis and metabolism in pre-eclampsia will facilitate the update or reconsideration of old models of pathogenesis.
