Long‐Term Follow‐up of CD19 CAR Therapy in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

Background CD19‐specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells induce high rates of initial response among patients with relapsed B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and long‐term remissions in a subgroup of patients. Methods We conducted a phase 1 trial involving adults with relapsed B‐cell ALL who received an infusion of autologous T cells expressing the 19‐28z CAR at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Safety and long‐term outcomes were assessed, as were their associations with demographic, clinical, and disease characteristics. Results A total of 53 adults received 19‐28z CAR T cells that were manufactured at MSKCC. After infusion, severe cytokine release syndrome occurred in 14 of 53 patients (26%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15 to 40); 1 patient died. Complete remission was observed in 83% of the patients. At a median follow‐up of 29 months (range, 1 to 65), the median event‐free survival was 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 11.5), and the median overall survival was 12.9 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 23.4). Patients with a low disease burden (<5% bone marrow blasts) before treatment had markedly enhanced remission duration and survival, with a median event‐free survival of 10.6 months (95% CI, 5.9 to not reached) and a median overall survival of 20.1 months (95% CI, 8.7 to not reached). Patients with a higher burden of disease (≥5% bone marrow blasts or extramedullary disease) had a greater incidence of the cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxic events and shorter long‐term survival than did patients with a low disease burden. Conclusions In the entire cohort, the median overall survival was 12.9 months. Among patients with a low disease burden, the median overall survival was 20.1 months and was accompanied by a markedly lower incidence of the cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxic events after 19‐28z CAR T‐cell infusion than was observed among patients with a higher disease burden.
