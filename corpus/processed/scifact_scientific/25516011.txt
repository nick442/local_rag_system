Purification and characterization of mouse hematopoietic stem cells.

Mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells were isolated with the use of a variety of phenotypic markers. These cells can proliferate and differentiate with approximately unit efficiency into myelomonocytic cells, B cells, or T cells. Thirty of these cells are sufficient to save 50 percent of lethally irradiated mice, and to reconstitute all blood cell types in the survivors.
