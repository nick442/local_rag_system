Functional insights into the role of nuclear-retained long noncoding RNAs in gene expression control in mammalian cells

The mammalian genome harbors thousands of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes. Recent studies have indicated the involvement of several of these lncRNAs in the regulation of gene expression. lncRNAs play crucial roles in various biological processes ranging from epigenetic gene regulation, transcriptional control, to post-transcriptional regulation. lncRNAs are localized in various subcellular compartments, and major proportion of these are retained in the cell nucleus and could be broadly classified as nuclear-retained lncRNAs (nrRNAs). Based on the identified functions, members of the nrRNAs execute diverse roles, including providing architectural support to the hierarchical subnuclear organization and influencing the recruitment of chromatin modifier factors to specific chromatin sites. In this review, we will summarize the recently described roles of mammalian nrRNAs in controlling gene expression by influencing chromatin organization, transcription, pre-mRNA processing, nuclear organization, and their involvement in disease.
