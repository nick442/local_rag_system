COX-2 and survivin are overexpressed and positively correlated in endometrial carcinoma.

OBJECTIVES To investigate the expressions of survivin and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and their possible correlations in the development of endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC). We also looked at their association with classical prognostic factors in EC. To our knowledge, this is the first time survivin expression is investigated in terms of its relation to COX-2 in the developmental pathway of EC. METHODS Archived tissue samples of 50 EC, 30 endometrial hyperplasia and 20 proliferative endometrium were selected and immunohistochemically analyzed for survivin and COX-2 expression. RESULTS Both survivin and COX-2 were overexpressed in hyperplasia and endometrial adenocarcinoma cases compared to proliferative endometrium, which was statistically significant (p=0.01, p=0.02, respectively). Among EC cases, survivin and COX-2 were strongly positive in 38 (76%) and 30 (60%) patients, respectively. Furthermore, we found survivin and COX-2 to be positively correlated, which was also statistically significant (p=0.0001, r=0.46). Neither survivin nor COX-2 expression was correlated with classical prognostic factors of endometrial carcinoma such as myometrial invasion, grade or lymph node metastasis (p>0.05). Neither COX-2 nor survivin had an impact on overall survival (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Both survivin and COX-2 are overexpressed, and they seem to be early events in the occurrence of EC. Moreover, protein products of these two genes are positively correlated. COX-2 and survivin might share a common molecular pathway or enhance each other's actions in the developmental pathway of EC. Molecular basis of such a relationship should be further investigated in endometrial carcinogenesis.
