Detection of Sugarcane bacilliform virus isolate and its influence on yield and quality of cane in Yunnan

Sugarcane bacilliform virus(SCBV) was detected by PCR from sugarcane showing chlorosis and mottle symptom from Kaiyuan,Yunnan Province. Part sequence of replicase gene of the isolate SCBV-Kaiyuan was determined. Sequence analysis indicated that the 589 bp of SCBV-Kaiyuan shared identities of 73.2%-74.0% and 83.1%-84.1% at nucleotide and amino acid levels with SCBV-Australia respectively,66.7%-68.4% and 65.6%-67.7% with SCBV-Morocco. The quality and yield of the sugarcane infected with SCBV-Kaiyuan was also investigated. The juice extraction,sucrose content,gravity purity and average stalk weight were decreased 1.55%,1.24%,2.22% and 0.26 kg in plants infected with SCBV-Kaiyuan,but reducing sugar was increased by 0.21% in infected plants.
