Internal fixation versus nonoperative treatment of displaced 3-part proximal humeral fractures in elderly patients: a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to report the 2-year outcome after a displaced 3-part fracture of the proximal humerus in elderly patients randomized to treatment with a locking plate or nonoperative treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS We included 60 patients, mean age 74 years (range, 56-92), 81% being women. The main outcome measures were the Constant and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) according to the EQ-5D. RESULTS At the final 2-year follow-up, the results for range of motion (ROM), function and HRQoL were all in favor of the locking plate group. The mean flexion in the locking plate group was 120째 compared to 111째 in the nonoperative group (P = .36) and the mean abduction was 114째 compared to 106째 (P = .28). The corresponding values for the Constant score were 61 versus 58 (P = .64), for DASH 26 versus 35 (P = .19), and the mean EQ-5D (index) score was 0.70 compared to 0.59 (P = .26). In spite of good primary reduction in 86% of the fractures in the locking plate group, 13% of the patients had a fracture complication requiring a major reoperation and 17% had a minor reoperation. CONCLUSION The results of our study indicate an advantage in functional outcome and HRQoL in favor of the locking plate compared to nonoperative treatment in elderly patients with a displaced 3-part fracture of the proximal humerus, but at the cost of additional surgery in 30% of the patients.
