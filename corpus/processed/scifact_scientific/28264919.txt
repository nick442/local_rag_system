Site of action of a ribosomal RNA methylase responsible for resistance to erythromycin and other antibiotics.

The enzyme which confers resistance to erythromycin in the producing organism Streptomyces erythraeus dimethylates a single adenine residue in Bacillus stearothermophilus 23 S rRNA. This corresponds to residue Ade 2058 in Escherichia coli 23 S RNA. The methylase responsible for resistance to macrolides, lincomycin, and streptogramin B-related antibiotics in Staphylococcus aureus also acts at this site.
