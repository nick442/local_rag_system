Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of IMCgp100, a first-in-class soluble TCR-antiCD3 bispecific t cell redirector with solid tumour activity: Results from the FIH study in melanoma.

3016Background: T cell-based bispecific agents have shown activity in hematologic cancers, but solid tumor efficacy remains elusive. IMCgp100 is a bispecific biologic comprising an affinityenhanced TCR specific for gp100 and an anti-CD3 scFV. In vitro, IMCgp100 binds gp100+ melanoma cells causing redirection of cytotoxicity and induction of potent immune effects. Methods: The Phase I was conducted in HLA-A2+ pts with advanced melanoma, using a 3+3 design to define the MTD. Pts were treated with IMCgp100 (iv) weekly (QW, Arm 1) or daily (4QD3W, Arm 2) to evaluate safety, PK and efficacy. The recommended phase 2 regimen (RP2D-QW) was defined. Results: In the Ph I dose escalation,31 pts received doses from 5ng/kg to 900ng/kg. In arm 1 dose-limiting toxicity of gr 3 or 4 hypotension was seen and associated with rapid trafficking of peripheral lymphocytes to skin and tumor. The MTD was determined to be 600ng/kg QW. IMCgp100 has an approximately dose-proportional profile with a plasma T1/2 of 5-6 hrs at the RP2..
