Vegetarian vs. conventional diabetic diet – A 1-year follow-up

Abstract Objective Our previous 6-month, randomized study demonstrated the beneficial effect of a vegetarian (V) compared to a conventional diet (C) with similar caloric restriction on cardiovascular risk factors for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), namely increased insulin sensitivity, reduced body weight, reduced volume of visceral and subcutaneous fat, decreased LDL-cholesterol and improved oxidative stress markers and chosen adipokines. We conducted post-trial monitoring to determine whether the improved outcomes persisted 1 year after the end of the study. Methods 62 subjects with T2D who completed the study were asked to come for a 1-year follow-up to measure weight, waist circumference, HbA1c and blood lipids. No attempts were made to maintain their previously assigned diets. Results 44 patients (71%) attended the post-trial monitoring. Hypoglycemic agents were increased by 14% in V and by 26% in C; insulin therapy was introduced in 5% in V and in 13% in C one year after the end of the intervention. Neither weight nor waist circumference changed significantly in either group. HbA1c increased ( p ≤ 0.05) similarly in both groups (+0.49 ± 1.04% in V vs. +0.42 ± 0.8% in C). Blood lipids did not change in either group. Conclusion One year after the end of the intervention, the positive effects of a vegetarian diet on cardiovascular risk factors compared to a conventional diet were partially maintained.
