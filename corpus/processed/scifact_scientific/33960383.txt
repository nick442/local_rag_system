The role of oral antidiabetic agents: why and when to use an early-phase insulin secretion agent in Type II diabetes mellitus

Abstract Evidence obtained in the 1990's strongly supports the notion that glycaemic control is important not only in Type I (insulin-dependent), but also in Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Although measurement of HbA1c is the standard for assessing the effect of glucose control in the occurrence and prevention of diabetic sequelae, more recent evidence indicates that other glucose parameters are also important. Postchallenge and postprandial hyperglycaemic peaks seem to be prospective determinants of vascular damage in early Type II diabetes. Currently, there is no overall accepted standard approach for the pharmacological management of Type II diabetes. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study has shown that reaching a near-normal glycaemic target is critically important and the pharmacotherapy of this progressive disease is difficult. Loss of endogenous insulin secretion has been substantiated to cause the progression of Type II diabetes in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. Early insulinization, however, was not advantageous over other forms of therapy. The advent of polypharmacy in recent years has greatly strengthened the treatment of this disease. This synergy has been extended of late with the development of early-phase insulin secretion agents. Two such agents, nateglinide and repaglinide, can be used to reduce mealtime glucose excursions and HbA1c as monotherapy, and in combination with metformin; their antidiabetic potential is similar to the combination treatment with glibenclamide and metformin. Additional substantiation of their long-term effect on improving life expectancy and reducing diabetic complications in Type II diabetic patients is now required.
