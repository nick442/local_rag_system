Sequence features surrounding the translation initiation sites assigned on the genome sequence of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 by amino-terminal protein sequencing.

To characterize the sequence features surrounding the translation initiation sites on the genome of Synechocystis sp. strain 6803, the total proteins extracted from the cell were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the amino-terminal sequences of the relatively abundant protein spots were determined. By comparison of the determined amino-terminal sequences with the nucleotide sequence of the entire genome, the translation initiation sites of a total of 72 proteins were successfully assigned on the genome. The sequence features emerged from the nucleotide sequences at and surrounding the translation initiation sites were as follows: (1) In addition to the three initiation codons, ATG, GTG, and TTG, evidence was obtained that ATT was also used as a rare initiation codon; (2) the core sequences (GAGG, GGAG and AGGA) of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence were identified in the appropriate position preceding the 35 initiation sites (48.6%); and (3) the preferential sequence surrounding the initiation codons was formulated as 5'-YY[..]R-3' where Y and R denote pyrimidine and purine nucleotides, respectively, and three dots represent the initiation codons. The result obtained would provide valuable information for improvement of the gene-finding software, and the approach used in this study should be applicable for comprehensive analysis of the expression profiles of cellular proteins.
