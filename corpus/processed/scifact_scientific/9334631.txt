C-reactive protein decreases interleukin-10 secretion in activated human monocyte-derived macrophages via inhibition of cyclic AMP production.

OBJECTIVE C-Reactive protein (CRP), a cardiovascular risk marker, could also participate in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaques express CRP and interleukin (IL)-10, a major antiinflammatory cytokine. IL-10 deficiency results in increased lesion formation, whereas IL-10 delivery attenuates lesions. We tested the effect of CRP on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-10 secretion in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs). METHODS AND RESULTS Incubation of HMDMs with CRP significantly decreased LPS-induced IL-10 mRNA and intracellular and secreted IL-10 protein and destabilized IL-10 mRNA. Also, CRP alone increased secretion of IL-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor from HMDMs and did not inhibit LPS-induced secretion of these cytokines. Fc gamma receptor I antibodies significantly reversed CRP-mediated IL-10 inhibition. CRP significantly decreased intracellular cAMP, phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB), and adenyl cyclase activity. cAMP agonists reversed CRP-mediated IL-10 inhibition. Overexpression of wild-type and constitutively active CREB in THP-1 cells revealed attenuation of the inhibitory effect of CRP on LPS-induced IL-10 levels. CRP also inhibited hemoglobin:haptoglobin-induced IL-10 and heme oxygenase-1. Furthermore, administration of human CRP to rats significantly decreased IL-10 levels. CONCLUSIONS This study provides novel evidence that CRP, by decreasing IL-10 alters the antiinflammatory/proinflammatory balance, accentuating inflammation, which is pivotal in atherothrombosis.
