THE GLYOXAL BIS(2-HYDROXYANIL) METHOD MODIFIED FOR LOCALIZING INSOLUBLE CALCIUM SALTS.

TO enable staining of insoluble calcium salts with glyoxal bis(2-hydroxyanil) (GBHA), the original solution containing 2 ml of 0.4% GBHA in absolute ethanol, and 0.3 ml of aqueous 5% NaOH, and limited to staining only soluble calcium salts, was modified as follows: 1, 2 ml of 0.4% GBHA in absolute ethanol in 0.6 ml of 10% aqueous NaOH; 11, 0.1 gm GBHA in 2 ml of 3.4% NaOH in 75% ethanol. To prevent diffusion and loss of calcium, the tissues were processed by the freeze-substitution or freeze-dry method and sections stained without removing the paraffin. Modification I is effective only when 1 or 2 drops placed on the section are evaporated gradually to dryness, concentrating the GBHA and NaOH on the insoluble calcium salts. Modification II is effective when dried or poured on the the section and allowed to stain for 5 min. The stained slides are immersed for 15 min in 90% ethanol saturated with KCN and Na2CO3 for specificity to calcium; rinsed and counterstained in 95% ethanol containing 0.1% each of fast..
