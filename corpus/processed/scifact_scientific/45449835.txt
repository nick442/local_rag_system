Interleukin-17 mRNA expression in blood and CSF mononuclear cells is augmented in multiple sclerosis.

Myelin-directed autoimmunity is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Increased production of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is a common finding in MS. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a recently described cytokine produced in humans almost exclusively by activated memory T cells, which can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from parenchymal cells and macrophages. In situ hybridisation with synthetic oligonucleotide probes was adopted to detect and enumerate IL-17 mRNA expressing mononuclear cells (MNC) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with MS and control individuals. Numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing blood MNC were higher in patients with MS and acute aseptic meningoencephalitis (AM) compared to healthy individuals. Higher numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing blood MNC were detected in MS patients examined during clinical exacerbation compared to remission. Patients with MS had higher numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing MNC in CSF compared to blood. This increase in numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing MNC in CSF was not observed in patients with AM. Our results thus demonstrate increased numbers of IL-17 mRNA expressing MNC in MS with higher numbers in CSF than blood, and with the highest numbers in blood during clinical exacerbations.
