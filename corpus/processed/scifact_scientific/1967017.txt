A Candidate Gene Approach Identifies the TRAF1/C5 Region as a Risk Factor for Rheumatoid Arthritis

Correction for: Kurreeman FAS, Padyukov L, Marques RB, Schrodi SJ, Seddighzadeh M, et al. (2007) A Candidate Gene Approach Identifies the TRAF1/C5 Region as a Risk Factor for Rheumatoid Arthritis. PLoS Med 4(9): e278. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040278 In Table 1, the allele ratio in column eight (Allele Ratiosb: Cases, Controls) refers to allele A: allele B and not allele1:allele2 as described in footnote b, with Allele A being the Susceptibility Allele as denoted in column seven. The footnote should read: bNumber of alleles were compared in cases versus controls: allele A: allele B cases, allele A: allele B controls. Allele A refers to the susceptibility alleles as given in column seven.
