Replisome stalling and stabilization at CGG repeats, which are responsible for chromosomal fragility

Expanded CGG repeats cause chromosomal fragility and hereditary neurological disorders in humans. Replication forks stall at CGG repeats in a length-dependent manner in primate cells and in yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Tof1 and Mrc1 facilitate replication fork progression through CGG repeats. Remarkably, the fork-stabilizing role of Mrc1 does not involve its checkpoint function. Thus, chromosomal fragility might occur when forks stalled at expanded CGG repeats escape the S-phase checkpoint.
