Survival in a case of massive paraquat ingestion.

Serious exposure to the herbicide paraquat usually results in death, either due to gastrointestinal caustic lesions, shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome or related to the progressive development of pulmonary fibrosis associated with refractory hypoxemia. We report a case of suicidal paraquat ingestion in a 59-year-old man. Most of the indicators of poor prognosis were encountered in this patient. Treatment consisted of early digestive decontamination and hemodialysis, followed by antioxidant therapy, including the administration of deferoxamine (100 mg/kg in 24 h) and a continuous infusion of acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg/d during 3 weeks). The patient only developed a nonoliguric acute renal failure, a mild alteration of liver tests, and an impairment of CO transfer factor without any respiratory complaint. Renal and hepatic disturbances completely resolved within 1 month, whereas CO transfer factor remained altered 14 months later. This observation suggests that early administration of an antioxidant therapy, including deferoxamine and acetylcysteine could be usefully associated with measures that prevent digestive absorption or enhance elimination to limit systemic toxicity in potentially fatal paraquat poisoning.
