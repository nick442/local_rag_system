Premature chromosome condensation: evidence for in vivo cell fusion in human malignant tumours.

Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) was studied in direct preparations of tissues from patients with haematological diseases and carcinomas of various histological types. PCC was found in 6 out of 166 malignancies (128 haematological cases, 35 carcinomas and 3 malignant effusions) analysed with the GTG-technique. Chromosome analysis revealed S-phase and G1-phase PCC in each case; the frequency of PCC varied between 1, 4 and 8.6% of the metaphases analysed. It is suggested that PCC chromosomes, which represent cell fusion in vivo, are not very rare in naturally-occurring human malignancies, and that cell fusion may affect the malignant phenotype. In conjunction with other factors they may also explain the heterogeneity of tumour cell populations.
