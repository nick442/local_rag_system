cDNA and genomic cloning of lacritin, a novel secretion enhancing factor from the human lacrimal gland.

Multiple extracellular factors are hypothesized to promote the differentiation of unstimulated and/or stimulated secretory pathways in exocrine secretory cells, but the identity of differentiation factors, particularly those organ-specific, remain largely unknown. Here, we report on the identification of a novel secreted glycoprotein, lacritin, that enhances exocrine secretion in overnight cultures of lacrimal acinar cells which otherwise display loss of secretory function. Lacritin mRNA and protein are highly expressed in human lacrimal gland, moderately in major and minor salivary glands and slightly in thyroid. No lacritin message or protein is detected elsewhere among more than 50 human tissues examined. Lacritin displays partial similarity to the glycosaminoglycan-binding region of brain-specific neuroglycan C (32 % identity over 102 amino acid residues) and to the possibly mucin-like amino globular region of fibulin-2 (30 % identity over 81 amino acid residues), and localizes primarily to secretory granules and secretory fluid. The lacritin gene consists of five exons, displays no alternative splicing and maps to 12q13. Recombinant lacritin augments unstimulated but not stimulated acinar cell secretion, promotes ductal cell proliferation, and stimulates signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation and release of calcium. It binds collagen IV, laminin-1, entactin/nidogen-1, fibronectin and vitronectin, but not collagen I, heparin or EGF. As an autocrine/paracrine enhancer of the lacrimal constitutive secretory pathway, ductal cell mitogen and stimulator of corneal epithelial cells, lacritin may play a key role in the function of the lacrimal gland-corneal axis.
