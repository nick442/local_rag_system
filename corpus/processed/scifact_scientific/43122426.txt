131-I radioiodine therapy for hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease, uninodular goitre and multinodular goitre.

We studied 201 consecutive patients who received a relatively fixed dose of radioiodine for the treatment of hyperthyroidism between the years 1981-6. Patients with Graves' disease (170) were initially treated with a mean (SE) dose of 369 (10) MBq 131-I with a remission rate of 94% at 6 months and a cumulative relapse rate of 12% at one year and 21% at 5 years. The cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism was 26% at 3 months, 55% at 6 months, 61% at 1 year and 66% at 5 years. Patients with a uninodular goitre (10) were initially treated with a mean (SE) dose of 438 (85) MBq 131-I with a remission rate of 100% at 6 months, without relapse at 1 year but relapsing in 17% at 5 years. The cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism was 26% at 3 months, 30% at 6 months, 40% at 1 year and 40% at 5 years. Patients with a multinodular goitre (21) were initially treated with a mean (SE) dose of 613 (77) MBq 131-I with a remission rate of 79% at 6 months and a cumulative relapse rate of 26% at 1 year and 39% at 5 years. The cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism was 5% at 3 months, 14% at 6 months, 24% at 1 year and 24% at 5 years.
