The relationship of the level of cyclic amp to differentiation in primary cultures of chick muscle cells.

Abstract The effect of increased levels of cAMP upon the differentiation of primary cultures of chick myo blasts has been investigated. 0.1 mM But 2 cAMP or 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was added to the cultures 24 h after plating and maintained throughout the 70 h period of culture examined. Both reagents were found to markedly delay the time of fusion of the myoblasts but had no observable effect upon the increase in activity of creatine phosphokinase. Morphological examination of the cells revealed no difference in the relative numbers of myoblasts and fibroblasts between the control, But 2 cAMP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine cultures, but the latter reagent appeared to cause some inhibition of cell proliferation.
