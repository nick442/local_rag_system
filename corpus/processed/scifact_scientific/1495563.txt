[Clinical study on the therapeutic effect of acupuncture in the treatment of post-stroke depression].

OBJECTIVE To observe the therapeutic effect of "Xingnao Kaiqiao Zhenfa" (Acupuncture Technique for Restoring Consciousness) in the treatment of post-stroke depression. METHODS A total of 256 stroke patients were divided into acupuncture group (n = 180, male 138, female 42) and medication group (n = 76, male 57 and female 19) according to their visiting sequence to our hospital. Acupoints used were Neiguan (PC 6), Renzhong (GV 26), Baihui (GV 20), Yintang (EX-HN 3) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6,the affected side) and the needles were retained for 20 min every time. Patients of medication group were asked to take Amitriptyline (50 mg/d at first, 200 mg/d). Acupuncture treatment was conducted twice daily, and after one month's treatment the therapeutic effect was evaluated. Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) were used to assess the patient's state of depression. RESULTS After the treatment, of the 180 and 76 cases in acupuncture and medication groups, 31 (17.2%) and 13 (17.1%) were cured, 73 (40.6%) and 18 (23.7%) had a marked improvement in their depression state, 27 (15.0%) and 12 (15.8%) had an improvement, 49 (27.2%) and 33 (43.4%) failed, with the effective rates being 72.8% and 56.6% respectively. The markedly effective rate and the total effective rate of acupuncture group were significantly higher than those of medication group (P < 0.05). After the treatment, the total scores of SDS and HRSD and the severity index of two groups decreased pronouncedly in comparison with those of their individual pre-treatment; and the therapeutic effects of acupuncture group were significantly better than those of medication group in reducing SDS, HRSD and severity index (P < 0 .05). In addition, the decreased values of depression, pessimistic mood and irritability of acupuncture group were all bigger than those of medication group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between two groups in the decreased value of insomnia (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION "Acupuncture Technique for Restoring Consciousness" can effectively improve depression patients' symptoms and the therapeutic effect of acupuncture is markedly superior to that of medication for post-stroke patients.
