Metformin Normalizes Type 2 Diabetes-Induced Decrease in Cell Proliferation and Neuroblast Differentiation in the Rat Dentate Gyrus

In this study, we observed the effects of metformin, one of the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, on cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (SZDG) in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, which are a model for type 2 diabetes. For this, metformin was administered orally once a day to 14-week-old ZDF rats for 2 weeks and the animals were sacrificed at 16 weeks of age. During this period, blood glucose levels were higher in the vehicle-treated ZDF rats than in the Zucker lean control (ZLC) rats. Metformin treatment significantly decreased the blood glucose levels from 15.5 weeks of age. In the SZDG, Ki67 (a marker for cell proliferation)- and doublecortin (DCX, a marker for differentiated neuroblasts)-immunoreactive cells were much lower in the vehicle-treated ZDF rats than in the ZLC rats. In the metformin-treated ZDF group, Ki67- and DCX-immunoreactive cells were significantly increased in the SZDG compared to those in the vehicle-treated ZDF group. These results suggest that diabetes significantly reduces cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the SZDG and that metformin treatment normalizes the reduction of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the SZDG in diabetic rats.
