A model of multiple myeloma: culture of 5T33 murine myeloma cells and evaluation of tumorigenicity in the C57BL/KaLwRij mouse.

The 5T33 multiple myeloma is one of a series of transplantable murine myelomas arising spontaneously in C57BL/KaLwRij mice. This study describes the establishment and characterisation of the 5T33 murine myeloma in vitro as a cultured cell line in terms of its morphology, growth rate, expression of paraprotein (IgG2b) and tumorigenicity in syngeneic animals. The 5T33 cell line has been in continuous culture for over 10 months and has achieved more than passage 34. In culture, 5T33 myeloma grows as single cells or in small clusters of loosely adherent cells on an adherent stromal cell layer. Maximum doubling time is approximately 25 h, and over 90% of the cells express cytoplasmic IgG2b paraprotein. The cultured 5T33 myeloma cells are highly tumorigenic in C57BL/KaLwRij mice with as few as 500 cells inducing paralysis and death as early as day 36 post-tumour inoculation. Kinetics of tumour development and detection of IgG2b paraprotein are dose dependent. Two weeks following intravenous inoculation of 5 x 10(5) cultured 5T33 myeloma cells, tumour cells were readily identified in the bone marrow. By 3 weeks post-tumour inoculation, 5T33 myeloma cells were found in various tissues throughout the animal. Studies are now underway to determine the sensitivity of this cell line to various therapeutic modalities.
