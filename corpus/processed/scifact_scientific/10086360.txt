High-resolution sperm typing of meiotic recombination in the mouse MHC Ebeta gene.

Meiotic crossovers detected by pedigree analysis in the mouse MHC cluster into hotspots. To explore the properties of hotspots, we subjected the class II E(beta) gene to high-resolution sperm crossover analysis. We confirm the presence of a highly localized hotspot 1.0-1.6 kb wide in the second intron of E(beta) and show that it is flanked by DNA which is almost completely recombinationally inert. Mice heterozygous for haplotype s and another MHC haplotype show major haplotype-dependant variation in crossover rate but always the same hotspot, even in crosses including the highly diverged p haplotype. Crossovers in reciprocal orientations occur at similar rates but show different distributions across the hotspot, with the position of centre points in the two orientations shifted on average by 400 bp. This asymmetry results in crossover products showing biased gene conversion in favour of hotspot markers from the non-initiating haplotype, and supports the double-strand break repair model of recombination, with haplotype s as the most efficient crossover initiator. The detailed behaviour of the E(beta) hotspot, including evidence for highly localized recombination initiation, is strikingly similar to human hotspots.
