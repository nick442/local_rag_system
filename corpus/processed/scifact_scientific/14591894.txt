A talin-dependent LFA-1 focal zone is formed by rapidly migrating T lymphocytes

Cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells migrate through the coordinated responses of discrete integrin-containing focal adhesions and complexes. In contrast, little is known about the organization of integrins on the highly motile T lymphocyte. We have investigated the distribution, activity, and cytoskeletal linkage of the integrin lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on human T lymphocytes migrating on endothelial cells and on ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The pattern of total LFA-1 varies from low expression in the lamellipodia to high expression in the uropod. However, high affinity, clustered LFA-1 is restricted to a mid-cell zone that remains stable over time and over a range of ICAM-1 densities. Talin is essential for the stability and formation of the LFA-1 zone. Disruption of the talin–integrin link leads to loss of zone integrity and a substantial decrease in speed of migration on ICAM-1. This adhesive structure, which differs from the previously described integrin-containing attachments displayed by many other cell types, we have termed the “focal zone. ”
