Predictors of survival after acute paraquat poisoning.

Acute paraquat poisoning is often fatal. Many studies have investigated successful treatment modalities, but no standard treatment yet exists. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of survival after acute paraquat poisoning in 602 patients. The paraquat exposure was assessed based on the amount of ingested paraquat and a semiquantitative measure of the urine level of paraquat. Initial clinical parameters including vital signs, hemoglobin, white-blood-cell count, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, amylase, and glucose were obtained at the time of arrival at the emergency room. Outcomes after acute paraquat poisoning were categorized as survivors and nonsurvivors. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the predictors of survival after acute paraquat poisoning. Some patients (55.5%) survived after oral ingestion of paraquat, whereas all those exposed to paraquat percutaneous or inhalational route survived. The amount of paraquat (24.5% concentrate of 1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridium dichloride) ingested was 45.6 +/- 74.1 mL (mean +/- SD). In addition to degree of paraquat exposure, survival after acute paraquat poisoning was associated with age, respiratory rate, pH, PaCO2, hemoglobin, white-blood-cell count, blood urea nitrogen, amylase, and the number of failed organs in multiple logistic regression analysis. In conclusion, young age, percutaneous or inhalational route, exposure to less paraquat, and lesser degrees of leukocytosis, acidosis, and renal, hepatic, and pancreatic failures on admission are good prognostic factors of survival after acute paraquat poisoning.
