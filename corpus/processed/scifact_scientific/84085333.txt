The Growth and Sporulation of the Benign and Malignant Tertian Malarial Parasites in the Culture Tube and in the Human Host

Researches on the cultivation of the parasites of malaria in Liverpool were commenced some time ago at my suggestion by Dr. Sinton, and then, with better success, by Drs. J. G. Thomson and McLellan, and by Dr. D. Thomson. We are greatly obliged to Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence, Bart., for giving us the services of Dr. J. G. Thomson for this important enquiry.â€” Ronald Ross, 21st May, 1913.
