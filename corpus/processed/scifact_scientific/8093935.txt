Structure of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor Sec7 Domain of Human Arno and Analysis of the Interaction with ARF GTPase

Sec7-related guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) initiate vesicle budding from the Golgi membrane surface by converting the GTPase ARF to a GTP-bound, membrane-associated form. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic Sec7 homology domain of Arno, a human GEF for ARF1, determined at 2.2 angstroms resolution. The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1 have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.
