Electrical, optical, and structural properties of indium-tin-oxide thin films for organic light-emitting devices

High-quality indium–tin–oxide (ITO) thin films (200–850 nm) have been grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on glass substrates without a postdeposition annealing treatment. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of these films have been investigated as a function of target composition, substrate deposition temperature, background gas pressure, and film thickness. Films were deposited from various target compositions ranging from 0 to 15 wt % of SnO2 content. The optimum target composition for high conductivity was 5 wt % SnO2+95 wt % In2O3. Films were deposited at substrate temperatures ranging from room temperature to 300 °C in O2 partial pressures ranging from 1 to 100 mTorr. Films were deposited using a KrF excimer laser (248 nm, 30 ns full width at half maximum) at a fluence of 2 J/cm2. For a 150-nm-thick ITO film grown at room temperature in an oxygen pressure of 10 mTorr, the resistivity was 4×10−4 Ω cm and the average transmission in the visible range (400–700 nm) was 85%. For a 170-n..
