Mutations among Italian mucopolysaccharidosis type I patients

A group of 27 Italian patients was screened for Î±-L-iduronidase mucopolysaccharidosis type I mutations. Mutations were found in 18 patients, with 28 alleles identified. The two most common mutations in northern Europeans (W402X and Q70X) accounted for 11% and 13% of the alleles, respectively. The R89Q mutation, uncommon in Europeans, was found only in one patient, accounting for 1 of 54 alleles (1.9%). The other mutations, P533R, A327P and G51D, accounted for 11%, 5.6% and 9.3% of the total alleles, respectively. Interestingly, the high frequency of the P533R mutation seems to be confined to Sicily and is higher than the 3% reported in a British/Australian study.
