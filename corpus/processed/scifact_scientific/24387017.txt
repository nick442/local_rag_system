Notch promotes survival of pre–T cells at the β-selection checkpoint by regulating cellular metabolism

Notch signals are necessary for the functional outcomes of T cell receptor β-selection, including differentiation, proliferation and rescue from apoptosis. The mechanism underlying this requirement for T cell development is unknown. Here we show that Notch receptor and Delta-like 1 ligand interactions promoted the survival of CD4−CD8− pre–T cells through the maintenance of cell size, glucose uptake and metabolism. Furthermore, the trophic effects of Notch signaling were mediated by the pathway of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase and the kinase Akt, such that expression of active Atk overcame the requirement for Notch in β-selection. Collectively, our results demonstrate involvement of Notch receptor–ligand interactions in the regulation of cellular metabolism, thus enabling the autonomous signaling capacity of the pre–T cell receptor complex.*Note: In the version of this article initially published online, in the fourth sentence of the abstract, the term "Atk" was a misspelling; this should be "Akt. " In the fourth sentence of the second paragraph of the introduction, the name of the second kinase mentioned, "PI(3)K-dependent kinase 1," was incorrect; this should read "phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1. " These errors have been corrected for the HTML and print versions of the article.
