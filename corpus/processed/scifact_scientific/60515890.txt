The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates

" The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates" is the most widely used and cited atlas of the mouse brain in print. It provides researchers and students with both accurate stereotaxic coordinates for laboratory use, and detailed delineations and indexing of structures for reference. The accompanying DVD provides drawings of brains structures that can be used as templates for making figures for publication. The 3rd edition is both a major revision and an expansion of previous editions. Delineations and photographs in the horizontal plane of section now complement the coronal and sagittal series, and all the tissue sections are now shown in high resolution digital color photography. The photographs of the sections and the intermediate sections are also provided on the accompanying DVD in high-resolution JP 2000 format. The delineations of structures have been revised, and naming conventions made consistent with Paxinos and Watson's "Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, 6th Edition". The 3rd edition of this atlas is now in more practical 14"x11" format for convenient lab use. This edition is in full color throughout. It includes a CD of all plates and diagrams, as well as Adobe Illustrator files of the diagrams, and a variety of additional useful material. Coronal and sagittal diagrams are completely reworked and updated. Rhombomeric borders are included in sagittal figures, for the first time in mammals. Microscopic plates are scanned with a new method in much higher quality.
