Fusion proteins for versatile antigen targeting to cell surface receptors reveal differential capacity to prime immune responses.

Targeting of proteins to APCs is an attractive strategy for eliciting adaptive immune responses. However, the relationship between the choice of the targeted receptor and the quality and quantity of responses remains poorly understood. We describe a strategy for expression of Ags including hydrophobic proteins as soluble fusion proteins that are optimized for proteasome-dependent MHC class I-restricted cross-presentation and form stable complexes with a wide variety of targeting Abs. Upon s.c. immunization, these complexes were initially taken up by CD169+ lymph node subcapsular sinus macrophages. In the OVA model system, receptor-targeted antigenic complexes primed specific T and B cell responses in vitro and in vivo at least 100-fold more efficiently than Ag alone. Comparison of 10 targeting receptors allowed us to establish a ranking with respect to priming of CD8+ T cell responses and demonstrated striking differences with respect to the relative efficacy of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subset and B cell priming. The described fusion proteins should help in developing optimized strategies for targeted delivery of protein Ags in the context of tolerization or vaccination.
