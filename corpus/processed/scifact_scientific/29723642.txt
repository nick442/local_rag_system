A functional polymorphism in the prodynorphin gene promotor is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.

The prodynorphin gene (PDYN) encoding the anticonvulsant peptide dynorphin is a strong candidate for a seizure suppressor gene and thus a possible modulator of susceptibility to temporal lobe epilepsy. We performed a case control association study in 155 patients with nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy and 202 controls and found that PDYN promotor low-expression L-alleles confer an increased risk for temporal lobe epilepsy in patients with a family history for seizures. Irrespective of the familial background, L-homozygotes display a higher risk for secondarily generalized seizures and status epilepticus.
