A literature review of the safety of medical body area network devices in magnetic resonance imaging

Electro-magnetic fields and wireless technology are part of modern life. The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines for clarification of internal human structures and function in healthcare is increasing. The rapid development of wireless devices, their miniaturization and their application as clinical tools creates an expanding intersection zone. Although safety standards for devices in MRI machines have been previously published, it is not clear that newer wireless technologies, including devices used in Medical Body Area Networks (MBAN) have been rigorously tested or disclosed. We undertook a review of the clinical scientific literature and the United States Food and Drug Administration adverse events database to discover whether this is a significant issue. There are currently no published studies specifically addressing the safety of wireless devices potentially used in MBAN in MRI machines. We suggest the addition of a research track to clarify the safety of MBAN devices in MRI machines. Informed design of current and future MBAN components, devices and systems can avoid potential patient adverse events due to the un-intended consequences of the concurrent use of these technologies in MRI machines.
