A Sequential splicing mechanism promotes selection of an optimal exon by repositioning a downstream 5' splice site in preprotachykinin pre-mRNA.

To explore the structural basis of alternative splicing, we have analyzed the splicing of pre-mRNAs containing an optional exon, E4, from the preprotachykinin gene. This gene encodes substance P and related tachykinin peptides by alternative splicing of a common pre-mRNA. We have shown that alternative splicing of preprotachykinin pre-mRNA occurs by preferential skipping of optional E4. The competing mechanism that incorporates E4 into the final spliced RNA is constrained by an initial block to splicing of the immediate upstream intervening sequence (IVS), IVS3. This block is relieved by sequential splicing, in which the immediate downstream IVS4 is removed first. The structural change resulting from the first splicing event is directly responsible for activation of IVS3 splicing. This structural rearrangement replaces IVS4 sequences with E5 and its adjacent IVS5 sequences. To determine how this structural change promoted IVS3 splicing, we asked what structural change(s) would restore activity of IVS3 splicing-defective mutants. The most significant effect was observed by a 2-nucleotide substitution that converted the 5' splice site of E4 to an exact consensus match, GUAAGU. Exon 5 sequences alone were found not to promote splicing when present in one or multiple copies. However, when a 15-nucleotide segment of IVS5 containing GUAAGU was inserted into a splicing-defective mutant just downstream of the hybrid exon segment E4E5, splicing activity was recovered. Curiously, the 72-nucleotide L2 exon of adenovirus, without its associated 5' splice site, activates splicing when juxtaposed to E4. Models for the activation of splicing by an RNA structural change are discussed.
