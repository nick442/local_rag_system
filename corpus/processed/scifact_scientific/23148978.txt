The influence of some metabolic inhibitors on phagocytic activity of mouse macrophages in vitro.

The action of different metabolic inhibitors on phagocytosis by macrophages from mouse peritoneal exudate cultured in vitro was studied. The following metabolic inhibitors were tested: sodium iodoacetate, sodium fluoride, sodium fluoroacetate, sodium malonate, 2-4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide, ouabain and cycloheximide, all at the concentration of 10(-3) M. Iodoacetate caused a strong inhibitory effect on phagocytosis; this observation confirms that glycolysis is the main source of energy for the phagocytic process. On the contrary, fluoride, although it is an effective inhibitor of glycolysis, did not exert any effect. This difference may be explained by the fact that sodium fluoride blocks anaerobic glycolysis only in vitro at an unphysiological temperature (0 degrees C). Fluoroacetate and malonate, two compounds which interfere with the Krebs cycle, did not inhibit phagocytosis, but it is known that the Krebs cycle activity is poorly developed in the macrophagic cells. Sodium azide and 2-4-dinitrophenol, two inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, showed an effect on phagocytosis only after 3 h of contact with the cell cultures. Ouabain blocks Na+ and K+ transport across the plasma membrane and, probably, it inhibited phagocytosis by interfering with the movements of the cell membrane. Finally, the mode of action of cycloheximide on phagocytosis is uncertain. This compound inhibits the protein synthesis and, perhaps, it can act by preventing the renewal of the cell membrane.
