Genomic organization and chromosomal location of the human dsRNA adenosine deaminase gene: the enzyme for glutamate-activated ion channel RNA editing.

The structure of the human gene encoding the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) adenosine deaminase (DRADA) was characterized. This nuclear localized enzyme is involved in the RNA editing required for the expression of certain subtypes of glutamate-gated ion channel subunits. The DRADA gene span 30 kb pairs and harbors 15 exons. The transcription of the DRADA gene driven by the putative promoter region, which contains no typical TATA or CCAAT box-like sequences, is initiated at multiple sites, 164 to 216 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon. The three dsRNA binding motifs (DRBM), 70 amino acid residues long, are each encoded by two exons plus an intervening sequence that interrupts the motif at the identical amino acid position. This finding is consistent with the notion that the dsRNA binding domains may be composed of two separate functional subdomains. Fluorescent in situ hybridization localized the DRADA gene on the long arm chromosome 1, region q21. The gene structure and sequence information reported in this study will facilitate the investigation of involvement of DRADA in hereditary diseases that may be the result of malfunction of glutamate-gated ion channels.
