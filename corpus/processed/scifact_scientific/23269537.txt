Cyclin D1 activation in B-cell malignancy: association with changes in histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and RNA polymerase II binding to both promoter and distal sequences.

Cyclin D1 expression is deregulated by chromosome translocation in mantle cell lymphoma and a subset of multiple myeloma. The molecular mechanisms involved in long-distance gene deregulation remain obscure, although changes in acetylated histones and methylated CpG dinucleotides may be important. The patterns of DNA methylation and histone acetylation were determined at the cyclin D1 locus on chromosome 11q13 in B-cell malignancies. The cyclin D1 promoter was hypomethylated and hyperacetylated in expressing cell lines and patient samples, and methylated and hypoacetylated in nonexpressing cell lines. Domains of hyperacetylated histones and hypomethylated DNA extended over 120 kb upstream of the cyclin D1 gene. Interestingly, hypomethylated DNA and hyperacetylated histones were also located at the cyclin D1 promoter but not the upstream major translocation cluster region in cyclin D1-nonexpressing, nontumorigenic B and T cells. RNA polymerase II binding was demonstrated both at the cyclin D1 promoter and 3' immunoglobulin heavy-chain regulatory regions only in malignant B-cell lines with deregulated cyclin D1 expression. Our results suggest a model where RNA polymerase II bound at IgH regulatory sequences can activate the cyclin D1 promoter by either long-range polymerase transfer or tracking.
