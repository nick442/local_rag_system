Treatment outcome of an unselected cohort of tuberculosis patients in relation to human immunodeficiency virus serostatus in Zomba Hospital, Malawi.

There is little information about treatment outcome in patients with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) or extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) treated under routine programme conditions in subsaharan Africa. A prospective study was carried out to determine treatment outcome in an unselected cohort of TB patients admitted to Zomba General Hospital, Malawi. Eight hundred and twenty-seven adult TB patients (451 men and 376 women) were registered between 1 July and 31 December 1995. Standardized treatment outcomes of treatment completion, death, default, and transfer to another district were assessed in relation to type of TB, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus, age and gender. Two hundred and fifty-four patients (31%) died by the end of treatment, half of the deaths occurring in the first month. Death rates were 19% among 386 patients with smear-positive PTB, 46% among 211 patients with smear-negative PTB, and 37% among 230 patients with EPTB; 77% of the patients were HIV seropositive. Among new patients, HIV-positive patients had higher death rates than HIV-negative patients (hazard ratio [HR] 2.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.6-3.8). Smear-negative patients had the highest death rates (HR 3.9; 95% CI 2.7-5.5 compared to smear-positive patients), followed by EPTB patients (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.8-3.7 compared to smear-positive patients). Death rates increased with age but were similar in men and women. Adult patients in Malawi with smear-negative PTB and EPTB have low treatment completion and high death rates, related to high levels of HIV infection. National TB control programmes in areas of high HIV prevalence should no longer ignore treatment outcomes in patients with smear-negative PTB or EPTB.
