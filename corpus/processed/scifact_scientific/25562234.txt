Association Between High Serum Soluble Corin and Hypertension: A Cross-Sectional Study in a General Population of China.

BACKGROUND Corin has been suggested to be associated with hypertension by cell- and animal-based studies. However, the association still lacks population-based evidence which critically promotes translation from basic research to clinical and preventive practice. Here, we aimed to explore the association in a general population of China. METHODS From January to May 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional study in 2,498 participants aged above 30 years, residing in Gusu district of Suzhou. Serum soluble corin and blood pressure were measured. RESULTS Hypertensive participants had a higher level of serum corin than nonhypertensive participants (median (interquartile range): 1,836.83 (1,497.85-2,327.87) pg/ml vs. 1,579.14 (1,322.18-1,956.82) pg/ml, P < 0.001). Higher serum corin was positively associated with prevalent hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 2.01, P < 0.001). In the multiple analysis, participants in the third (OR = 1.43, P = 0.007) and fourth (OR = 1.96, P < 0.001) quartiles had significantly increased odds of hypertension compared to those in the lowest quartile of serum corin. ORs of hypertension positively and significantly increased with serum corin levels (P for trend <0.001). Further subgroup analysis showed that ORs of hypertension associated with high corin (over the median level of serum corin: 1,689.20 pg/ml) were still significant in subgroups by age, body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that hypertensive participants had an increased serum corin level compared to those without hypertension. This ﬁnding suggests that corin may play a role in the pathology of hypertension.
