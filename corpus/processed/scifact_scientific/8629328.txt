Peripheral B cell subsets.

Our understanding of the origins and the biological functions of different peripheral B cell subsets continues to evolve. Some understanding has been obtained regarding the synergy between BCR-derived signals and other receptors and signaling pathways that drive the development of follicular, marginal zone, and B-1 B cells, but this remains a complex and poorly understood issue. More recent information regarding the origins of B-1 and B-2 B cells, the ability of follicular B cells to mature both in the bone marrow and the spleen, the existence of a definable precursor for MZ B cells, and the ability of follicular B cells to occupy two distinct niches are all highlighted in this review.
