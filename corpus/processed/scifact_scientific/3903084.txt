Health workers cohort study: methods and study design.

Objective: To examine different health outcomes that are associated with specific lifestyle and genetic factors. Materials and methods: From March 2004 to April 2006, a sample of employees from three different health and academic institutions, as well as their family members, were enrolled in the study after providing informed consent. At baseline and follow-up (2010-2013), participants completed a self-administered questionnaire, a physical examination, and provided blood samples. Results: A total of 10 729 participants aged 6 to 94 years were recruited at baseline. Of these, 70% were females, and 50% were from the Mexican Social Security Institute. Nearly 42% of the adults in the sample were overweight, while 20% were obese. Conclusion: Our study can offer new insights into disease mechanisms and prevention through the analysis of risk factor information in a large sample of Mexicans.
