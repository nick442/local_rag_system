The modulation of human natural killer cell activity by prostaglandins.

Prostaglandins (PGs) have been implicated as a regulator of tumor growth in mice and humans. Since natural killer cell (NK) cytotoxicity may be an important component of immune surveillance against cancer, it is appropriate to study whether the amount of PGs produced by tumors may be sufficient to suppress NK activity. Accordingly, the effect of various PGs on the NK activity of human peripheral mononuclear cells was investigated. The percentage cytotoxicity was measured by the release of Cr51 from labeled K562 and other target cells. At very high concentrations of PG (10(-6) M), suppression was seen with PGE2, PGD2, PGA2, and PGF2 alpha. However, at concentrations of PG in the physiologic range (10(-8) M), significant suppression was seen with PGE2 and PGD2 only. The percentage suppression with PGE2 ranged from 77% to 9.5% over a range of concentrations from 10(-5) to 10(-9) M (45% at 10(-8) M). Significant suppression was observed at 10(-8) M PGE2 with 4 different targets and at effector:target ratios varying from 50:1 to 12.5:1. To assess whether the suppressive effect of PGE2 was directed at the effector and/or target cell, K562 cells or effector cells were pretreated with PGE2. Significant suppression was seen with effector cell pretreatment but not with target cell pretreatment. Finally, the suppressive effects of supernatants obtained from tumor cell lines (polyoma virus-transformed murine fibroblast cell line, PY3T3) was determined. The marked suppressive effect of the supernatant could be attributed to its content of PGE. Thus, it appears that the production of PGE by tumor cells may be an important modulator of human NK activity.
