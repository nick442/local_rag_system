Depletion of glutathione induces 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts and hydroxyurea teratogenicity in the organogenesis stage mouse embryo.

Glutathione (GSH) homeostasis is important during organogenesis. To elucidate the impact of GSH depletion in organogenesis stage embryos on oxidative stress and drug teratogenicity, l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) was given to timed pregnant CD-1 mice 4 h before exposure to a model teratogen, hydroxyurea (HU) [400 mg/kg (HU-400) or 600 mg/kg (HU-600)]. Treatment with BSO or HU alone or with BSO plus HU-400 did not alter the ratios of glutathione disulfide/GSH in the embryo; in contrast, the combination of BSO plus HU-600 did increase this ratio at both 0.5 and 3 h post-HU, indicating the induction of oxidative stress in the embryos. Immunoreactivity to a product of lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adducts, was detected in saline-treated embryos; the intensity and nuclear localization of 4-HNE protein adduct immunoreactivity in specific regions in the embryo was significantly increased by exposure to BSO alone or BSO and either dose of HU. BSO pretreatment increased the spectrum and incidence of external and skeletal malformations (curly tail, hind limb malformations, hydrocephaly, exencephaly, open eye, spina bifida, and gastroschisis) induced by HU-400 and HU-600; BSO exposure did not alter the effects of HU on fetal mortality or fetal weights or HU induction of c-Fos heterodimer-dependent activator protein 1 DNA binding activity. The formation of 4-HNE protein adducts in teratogen-exposed embryos was localized to regions of the embryo that were highly susceptible to insult, namely the somites and caudal neural tube, correlating the presence of 4-HNE adducts with the disruption of pattern formation during organogenesis.
