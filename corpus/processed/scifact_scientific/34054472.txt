Association between serum corin levels and risk of acute myocardial infarction.

BACKGROUND Accumulating evidence has indicated that corin plays critical roles in regulating salt-water balance, blood pressure and cardiac function by activating natriuretic peptides. The present case-control study was designed to evaluate the association of serum soluble corin with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS We enrolled 856 consecutive AMI patients and 856 control subjects and explored the possible relation between serum corin levels and AMI risk using logistic regression model. RESULTS Patients with AMI had higher BMI, were less physically active, and were more likely to have histories of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and smoking compared with the controls. Serum levels of corin were remarkably reduced in AMI patients (825±263pg/ml) compared with those in healthy controls (1246±425pg/ml). Odds ratios of ST elevation (STEMI) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) were significantly decreased with the increasing levels of serum corin in both men and women (P for trend, <0.001) after adjustment for body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that serum levels of corin are significantly decreased in AMI patients, and it is inversely associated with the incidences of STEMI and NSTEMI in both men and women.
