The Liverpool uveal melanoma liver metastases pathway: outcome following liver resection.

AIM To determine the outcome of patients that underwent liver resection for metastases from uveal melanoma. METHODS Over a 9-year period, patients referred with uveal melanoma metastases were included. Following treatment of primary uveal melanoma, high-risk patients were offered to be enrolled into a 6-monthly non-contrast liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance. Following detection of liver metastases, patients were staged with a contrast-enhanced (Primovist(Â®)) liver MRI, computer tomography (CT) of the thorax and staging laparoscopy. RESULTS 155 patients were referred with uveal melanoma liver metastases, of which 17 (11.0%) patients had liver resection and one patient was treated with percutaneous radio-frequency ablation. The majority of patients undergoing liver resection were treated with multiple metastectomies (n = 8) and three patients had major liver resections. The overall median survival for patients treated with surgery/ablation was 27 (14-90) months, and this was significantly better compared to patients treated palliatively [median = 8(1-30) months, P < 0.001]. Following surgery, 11 patients had recurrent disease [median = 13(6-36) months]. Patients who had undergone a major liver resection had a significantly poorer disease-free survival (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS Patients who can undergo surgical resection for metastatic uveal melanoma have a more favorable survival compared to those who do not.
