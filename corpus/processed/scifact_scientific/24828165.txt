Promiscuous gene expression and the developmental dynamics of medullary thymic epithelial cells.

Thymic epithelial cells (TEC) form the structural and functional microenvironment necessary for the establishment and quality control of the T cell repertoire. In addition, they provide an ectopic source of numerous tissue-restricted antigens (TRA), a feature called promiscuous gene expression (pGE). How the regulation of pGE is related to the cell biology of TEC subset(s), e.g. their turnover and developmental interrelationship is still poorly understood. The observation that pGE is foremost a property of phenotypically and functionally mature medullary TEC (mTEC) implies that the full implementation of pGE is contingent on mTEC differentiation. Here, we show that the emergence of TEC subsets and pGE is tightly correlated during ontogeny and we provide evidence that mature CD80pos mTEC develop from an immature CD80neg subset. This differentiation step proceeds continuously in the postnatal thymus. While mature mTEC turnover in 2 to 3 weeks, immature mTEC encompass a smaller cycling and a larger non-cycling pool. The latter might serve as a reservoir of committed precursors, which sustain this renewal process. Our data document that mTEC represent a highly dynamic cell population, and they imply that the availability and display of TRA in the thymus undergoes a perpetual temporal and spatial reorganization.
