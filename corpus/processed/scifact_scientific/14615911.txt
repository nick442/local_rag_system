Nuclear Factor-�B Affects Tumor Progression in a Mouse Model of Malignant Pleural Effusion

We developed a novel mouse model of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) by injecting Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells directly into the pleural space of syngeneic C57B/6 mice. The pleural effusions in this model share common cellular and biochemical features with human MPEs. Implantation and growth of pleural tumors triggers a host inflammatory response characterized by a mixed inflammatory cell influx into the pleural fluid. LLC cells exhibited high basal nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity in vitro and in vivo, which we used to drive expression of a NF-κB–dependent green fluorescent protein-firefly luciferase fusion reporter construct. NF-κB–dependent reporter expression allowed intravital tracing of pleural tumors. Inhibition of NF-κB in LLC cells did not affect cell viability in culture; however, injection of LLC cells expressing a dominant NF-κB inhibitor resulted in decreased tumor burden, decreased pleural effusion volume, and decreased pleural effusion TNF-α levels. These studies indicate that tumor NF-κB a..
