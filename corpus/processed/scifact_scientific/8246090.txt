TRP channels of intracellular membranes.

Ion channels are classically understood to regulate the flux of ions across the plasma membrane in response to a variety of environmental and intracellular cues. Ion channels serve a number of functions in intracellular membranes as well. These channels may be temporarily localized to intracellular membranes as a function of their biosynthetic or secretory pathways, i.e., en route to their destination location. Intracellular membrane ion channels may also be located in the endocytic pathways, either being recycled back to the plasma membrane or targeted to the lysosome for degradation. Several channels do participate in intracellular signal transduction; the most well known example is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Some organellar intracellular membrane channels are required for the ionic homeostasis of their residing organelles. Several newly-discovered intracellular membrane Ca(2+) channels actually play active roles in membrane trafficking. Transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins are a superfamily (28 members in mammal) of Ca(2+)-permeable channels with diverse tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and physiological functions. Almost all mammalian TRP channels studied thus far, like their ancestor yeast TRP channel (TRPY1) that localizes to the vacuole compartment, are also (in addition to their plasma membrane localization) found to be localized to intracellular membranes. Accumulated evidence suggests that intracellularly-localized TRP channels actively participate in regulating membrane traffic, signal transduction, and vesicular ion homeostasis. This review aims to provide a summary of these recent works. The discussion will also be extended to the basic membrane and electrical properties of the TRP-residing compartments.
