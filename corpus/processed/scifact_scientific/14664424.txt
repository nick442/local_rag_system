The assessment of the prognostic value of tumor markers and cytokines as SCCAg, CYFRA 21.1, IL-6, VEGF and sTNF receptors in patients with squamous cell cervical cancer, particularly with early stage of the disease

The aim of this study is to determine the prognostic value of tumor markers, as squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCAg) and cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21.1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF RI), and sTNF RII in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. The subjects of analysis were 138 patients with stage I-IVA according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification. The collected research material comes from one oncology center. During the 10 years of follow-up, 56 relapses and 53 deaths were observed, and recurrent disease in early stage was confirmed in 45 % of patients. The pretreatment serum levels of SCCAg and CYFRA 21.1, and cytokines IL-6, VEGF, sTNF RI, and sTNF RII were determined in all patients. The probability of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using the log-rank test and the Cox regression model. Based on the ROC curve analysis for patients with recurrence, the largest area under the curve was demonstrated for SCCAg and IL-6 and for patients who died, for SCCAg and VEGF. Cox analysis demonstrated that independent prognostic factor for DFS was only SCCAg and for OS cytokine IL-6 and SCCAg, but in patients with early stage the prognostic value for DFS was VEGF, whereas IL-6 and CYFRA 21.1 for OS. Serum level of VEGF, CYFRA 21.1 and IL-6 before treatment in patients with early stage cervical cancer appears to be an important prognostic factor.
