Differential transcription of the orphan receptor RORbeta in nuclear extracts derived from Neuro2A and HeLa cells.

An important model system for studying the process leading to productive transcription is provided by the superfamily of nuclear receptors, which are for the most part ligand-controlled transcription factors. Over the past years several 'orphan' nuclear receptors have been isolated for which no ligand has yet been identified. Very little is known about how these 'orphan' receptors regulate transcription. In this study we have analysed the biochemical and transcriptional properties of the neuronally expressed orphan nuclear receptor RORbeta (NR1F2) and compared them with the retinoic acid receptor heterodimer RXRalpha-RARalpha (NR2B1-NR1B1) and Gal-VP16 in vitro. Although RORbeta binds to its DNA-binding sites with comparatively low affinity, it efficiently directs transcription in nuclear extracts derived from a neuronal cell line, Neuro2A, but not in nuclear extracts from non-neuronal HeLa cells. In contrast, RXRalpha-RARalpha and the acidic transcription factor Gal-VP16 support transcription in Neuro2A and HeLa nuclear extracts equally efficiently. These observations point to a different (co)factor requirement for transactivation by members of the NR1 subfamily of nuclear receptors.
