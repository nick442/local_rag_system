Trabecular bone score as an indicator for skeletal deterioration in diabetes.

CONTEXT Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a novel texture index that evaluates the pixel gray-level variations in lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry images and is related to bone microarchitecture independent of bone mineral density (BMD). OBJECTIVE We investigated lumbar spine TBS as an indicator for skeletal deterioration in diabetes. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional data were collected from subjects participating in an ongoing prospective, community-based, cohort study from 2009 to 2010. PARTICIPANTS We included 1229 men and 1529 postmenopausal women older than 50 years in the Ansung cohort. OUTCOME MEASURES Biochemical parameters, lumbar spine TBS, and BMD from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry images were measured. RESULTS Lumbar spine TBS was lower in men with diabetes than in nondiabetic men (1.287 ± 0.005 vs 1.316 ± 0.003, P < .001), whereas lumbar spine BMD was higher in men with diabetes (1.135 ± 0.010 vs 1.088 ± 0.006 g/cm(2)). Lumbar spine TBS was lower in women with diabetes than in nondiabetic women only in an unadjusted model (1.333 ± 0.004 vs 1.353 ± 0.003). However, women younger than 65 years (n = 707) with diabetes had a lower TBS than those without diabetes, even after adjusted for covariates (P < .001). Diabetes was not associated with BMD at femur sites in both genders. TBS was negatively correlated with glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance but not with homeostasis model assessment for β-cell function in both genders. CONCLUSIONS The inverse association between lumbar spine TBS and insulin resistance may make it an indicator for determining skeletal deterioration in diabetic patients who have high BMD.
