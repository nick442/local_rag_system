Folic acid improves endothelial function in coronary artery disease via mechanisms largely independent of homocysteine lowering.

BACKGROUND Homocysteine is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), although a causal relation remains to be proven. The importance of determining direct causality rests in the fact that plasma homocysteine can be safely and inexpensively reduced by 25% with folic acid. This reduction is maximally achieved by doses of 0.4 mg/d. High-dose folic acid (5 mg/d) improves endothelial function in CAD, although the mechanism is controversial. It has been proposed that improvement occurs through reduction in total (tHcy) or free (non-protein bound) homocysteine (fHcy). We investigated the effects of folic acid on endothelial function before a change in homocysteine in patients with CAD. METHODS AND RESULTS A randomized, placebo-controlled study of folic acid (5 mg/d) for 6 weeks was undertaken in 33 patients. Endothelial function, assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), was measured before, at 2 and 4 hours after the first dose of folic acid, and after 6 weeks of treatment. Plasma folate increased markedly by 1 hour (200 compared with 25.8 nmol/L; P<0.001). FMD improved at 2 hours (83 compared with 47 microm; P<0.001) and was largely complete by 4 hours (101 compared with 51 microm; P<0.001). tHcy did not significantly differ acutely (4-hour tHcy, 9.56 compared with 9.79 micromol/L; P=NS). fHcy did not differ at 3 hours but was slightly reduced at 4 hours (1.55 compared with 1.78 micromol/L; P=0.02). FMD improvement did not correlate with reductions in either fHcy or tHcy at any time. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that folic acid improves endothelial function in CAD acutely by a mechanism largely independent of homocysteine.
