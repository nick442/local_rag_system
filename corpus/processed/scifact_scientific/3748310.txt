SLP-65 regulates immunoglobulin light chain gene recombination through the PI(3)K-PKB-Foxo pathway

Although the essential role of the adaptor protein SLP-65 in pre-B cell differentiation is established, the molecular mechanism underlying its function is poorly understood. In this study, we uncover a link between SLP-65–dependent signaling and the phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)–protein kinase B (PKB)–Foxo pathway. We show that the forkhead box transcription factor Foxo3a promotes light chain rearrangement in pre-B cells. Our data suggest that PKB suppresses light chain recombination by phosphorylating Foxo proteins, whereas reconstitution of SLP-65 function counteracts PKB activation and promotes Foxo3a and Foxo1 activity in pre-B cells. Together, these data illuminate a molecular function of SLP-65 and identify a key role for Foxo proteins in the regulation of light chain recombination, receptor editing and B cell selection.
