Do Montelukast Sodium and N-Acetylcysteine Have a Nephroprotective Effect on Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction? A Placebo Controlled Trial in a Rat Model.

PURPOSE We assessed the nephroprotective effects of montelukast sodium and N-acetylcysteine on secondary renal damage due to unilateral ureteral obstruction in a rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study 30 Wistar albino male rats were randomized into 3 groups, including placebo, N-acetylcysteine and montelukast sodium. Three rats served as the control group. The left ureter of the rats was sutured with 4-zero polyglactin sutures. Medications were given 3 days before obstruction and continued for 15 days. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy was performed before obstruction and on day 15. Rats were sacrificed on day 15 and histopathological examinations were done. We biochemically assessed oxidative stress markers (myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde), sulfhydryl and total nitrite for lipid peroxidation, oxidative protein damage and antioxidant levels, respectively. RESULTS On pathological examination inflammation and tubular epithelial damage in the N-acetylcysteine and montelukast sodium groups were less than in the placebo group (p <0.05). No difference was seen in normal kidneys. Myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and total nitrite levels in the N-acetylcysteine group, and myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde levels in the montelukast sodium group were lower than in the placebo group (p <0.05). No statistical difference was seen in sulfhydryl levels (p >0.05) or among the N-acetylcysteine, montelukast sodium and placebo groups on scintigraphy (p >0.05). No pathological, chemical and scintigraphic differences were seen among the N-acetylcysteine, montelukast sodium and sham treated groups (p >0.05). CONCLUSIONS N-acetylcysteine and montelukast sodium have a protective effect against obstructive damage of the kidney. However, further investigations are needed.
