The cryoprotective effect of trehalose supplementation on boar spermatozoa quality.

In order to improve boar sperm quality during frozen-thawed process, the influence of the presence of trehalose on success of cryopreservation of boar sperm were investigated. We evaluated freeze-thawing tolerance of boar spermatozoa in a base cooling extender with the addition of different trehalose concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100 and 200mmol/l), and tried to determine the optimum concentration of trehalose. We chose sperm motility, acrosome integrity, membrane integrity and cryocapacitation as parameters to evaluate cryopreservation capacity of boar spermatozoa. We obtained the best results for 100mmol/l trehalose-supplemented extenders, with values of 49.89% for motility, 66.52% for acrosome integrity and 44.61% for membrane integrity, while freeze-thawing tolerance was diminished significantly for 200mmol/l of trehalose. Before and after capacitation, the CTC score for semen diluted by extender containing 100mmol/l trehalose was 3.68% and 43.82%, respectively. In conclusion, trehalose could confer a greater cryoprotective capacity to boar spermatozoa. Trehalose-supplementation with 100mmol/l concentration in basic extender could significantly improve sperm motility, membrane integrity and acrosome integrity parameters, and reduce boar spermatozoa cryocapacitation during the cryopreservation process.
