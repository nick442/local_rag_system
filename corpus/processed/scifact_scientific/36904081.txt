The yeast ribosomal protein L32 and its gene.

The yeast ribosomal protein gene RPL32 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is of particular interest for two reasons: 1) it is adjacent to another ribosomal protein gene, RP29, whose divergent transcription may be driven from the same control sequences, and 2) it appears that the splicing of its transcript is regulated by the product of the gene, ribosomal protein in L32. RPL32 has been analyzed in detail. It is essential for cell growth. Its sequence predicts L32 to be a protein of 105 amino acids, somewhat basic near the NH2 terminus, rather acidic near the COOH terminus, and homologous to ribosomal protein L30 of mammals. The reading frame has been confirmed by partial NH2-terminal analysis of L32. The nucleotide sequence also predicts an intron of 230 nucleotides, which begins with the unusual sequence GTCAGT and ends 40 nucleotides downstream of the consensus sequence TAC-TAAC. The intron has been confirmed by determination of the sequence of a cDNA clone. Transcription initiates 58 nucleotides upstream of the AUG initiation codon, and the polyadenylation site occurs 100 nucleotides downstream of the termination codon. Regulation of the transcription of ribosomal protein genes has been linked to two related consensus sequences. Analysis of the intergenic region between RP29 and RPL32 reveals three copies of these sequences. A deletion removing all three sequences reduces synthesis of a L32-LacZ fusion protein by more than 90%. Some residual activity, however, remains.
