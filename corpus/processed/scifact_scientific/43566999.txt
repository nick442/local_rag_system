Exercise blood flow patterns within and among rat muscles after training.

This study was designed to determine the influence of a long-term, moderate-intensity treadmill training program on the distribution of blood flow within and among muscles of rats during exercise. One group (T) of male Sprague-Dawley rats trained for 1 h/day for 13-17 wk at 30 m/min on a motor-driven treadmill. A second group (UT) of rats was conditioned for 10 min/day for 4 wk at the same speed. Muscle succinate dehydrogenase activities were higher in T than UT rats indicating a significant training effect. Blood flows (BFs) in 32 hindlimb muscles or muscle parts and other selected organs were measured in the two groups with radiolabeled microspheres during preexercise and while the rats ran for 30 s, 5 min, or 15 min at 30 m/min on the treadmill. The data indicate 1) there were no differences in total hindlimb muscle BF between UT and T rats at any time; however, 2) T rats had higher preexercise heart rates and higher muscle BFs in the deep red extensor muscles, suggesting a greater anticipatory response to the impending exercise; 3) T rats demonstrated more rapid elevations in BF in the red extensor muscles at the commencement of exercise; 4) T rats had higher BFs in red extensor muscles during exercise, whereas UT rats had higher BFs in white muscles; and 5) T rats maintained higher BFs in the visceral organs during exercise. These findings demonstrate that exercise training results in changes in the distribution of BF within and among muscles and among organs during exercise. Specifically, data indicate the high-oxidative motor units that are primarily recruited in the muscles during the initial stages of moderate treadmill exercise receive higher blood flows in the trained rats; this presumably contributes to increased resistance to fatigue.
