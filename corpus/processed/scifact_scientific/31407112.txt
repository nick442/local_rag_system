Deficiency in l-serine deaminase results in abnormal growth and cell division of Escherichia coli K-12.

The loss of the ability to deaminate l-serine severely impairs growth and cell division in Escherichia coli K-12. A strain from which the three genes (sdaA, sdaB, tdcG) coding for this organism's three l-serine deaminases had been deleted grows well in glucose minimal medium but, on subculture into minimal medium with glucose and casamino acids, it makes very large, abnormally shaped cells, many of which lyse. When inoculated into Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with or without glucose, it makes very long filaments. Provision of S-adenosylmethionine restores cell division in LB broth with glucose, and repairs much of the difficulty in growth in medium with casamino acids. We suggest that replication of E. coli is regulated by methylation, that an unusually high intracellular l-serine concentration, in the presence of other amino acids, starves the cell for S-adenosylmethionine and that it is the absence of S-adenosylmethionine and/or of C1-tetrahydrofolate derivatives that prevents normal cell division.
