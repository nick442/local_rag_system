Model for unidirectional movement of axonemal and cytoplasmic dynein molecules

A model for the unidirectional movement of dynein is presented based on structural observations and biochemical experimental results available. In this model, the binding affinity of dynein for microtubule is independent of its nucleotide state and the change between strong and weak microtubule-binding is determined naturally by the variation of relative orientation between the stalk and microtubule as the stalk rotates following nucleotide-state transition. Thus the enigmatic communication from the ATP binding site in the globular domain to the far MT-binding site in the tip of the stalk, which is prerequisite in conventional models, is not required. Using the present model, the previous experimental results such as the effect of ATP and ADP bindings on dissociation of dynein from microtubule, the processive movement of single-headed axonemal dyneins at saturating ATP concentration, the load dependence of step size for the processive movement of two-headed cytoplasmic dyneins and the dependence of stall force on ATP concentration can be well explained.
