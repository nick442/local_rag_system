How to control residual cardiovascular risk despite statin treatment: focusing on HDL-cholesterol.

Lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary target in the management of dyslipidemia in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. However, patients who have achieved LDL-C levels below the currently recommended targets may still experience cardiovascular events. This may result, in part, from elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Low HDL-C and high TG levels are common and are recognized as independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by low levels of HDL-C, high TG, and small, dense LDL particles, is a typical phenotype of dyslipidemia in subjects with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, to reduce further the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), raising HDL-C and lowering TG may be the secondary therapeutic target for patients who achieve LDL-C levels below the currently recommended targets but are still at risk of CHD. However, whether increasing HDL-C levels alone reduces CHD has not yet been confirmed in large randomized clinical trials, and whether functional HDL is more important than HDL-C in reducing CHD remains controversial. Large CHD endpoint trials that include many patients with diabetes are underway to compare combination treatments with statin and niacin, fibrates, or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors with statin alone treatments. In this review, we discuss the rationale and importance of increasing HDL-C levels with and without lowering TG levels in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular events.
