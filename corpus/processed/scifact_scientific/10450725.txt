Pamidronate induced anti-proliferative, apoptotic, and anti-migratory effects in hepatocellular carcinoma.

BACKGROUND/AIMS The small GTPase of Ras and Rho families are widely involved in human tumorgenesis and metastasis. It has recently been reported that pamidronate inhibits the mevalonate pathway, which is required for the prenylation of the small GTPase. We demonstrated a possible beneficial use of pamidronate in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS The effect of pamidronate on cell proliferation was analyzed with five hepatoma cell lines using MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by staining with DAPI and a histon ELISA assay. A cell migration assay was performed using the Modified Boyden Chamber. To analyze anti-proliferation effect of pamidronate in vivo, tumor volumes were monitored with the intraperitoneal injection of pamidronate after subcutaneous inoculation of PLC/PRF/5 cells into nude mice. RESULTS Pamidronate inhibited cell growth for all hepatoma cell lines. The amount of membrane associated Ras and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK 2) were reduced after pamidronate treatment. Pamidronate increased apoptosis and cleavage of Caspase-3, and -9. Pamidronate suppressed membrane associated RhoA and cell motility. In vivo, tumor volumes were significantly suppressed by pamidronate at three weeks (P<0.03). CONCLUSIONS We conclude that pamidronate has therapeutic potential in inducing anti-proliferative, apoptotic, and anti-migratory effects in HCC.
