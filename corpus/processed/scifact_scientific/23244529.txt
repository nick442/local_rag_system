A core subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 1 is broadly conserved in function but not primary sequence.

Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins mediate heritable gene silencing by modifying chromatin structure. An essential PcG complex, PRC1, compacts chromatin and inhibits chromatin remodeling. In Drosophila melanogaster, the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region of PSC (PSC-CTR) mediates these noncovalent effects on chromatin, and is essential for viability. Because the PSC-CTR sequence is poorly conserved, the significance of its effects on chromatin outside of Drosophila was unclear. The absence of folded domains also made it difficult to understand how the sequence of PSC-CTR encodes its function. To determine the mechanistic basis and extent of conservation of PSC-CTR activity, we identified 17 metazoan PSC-CTRs spanning chordates to arthropods, and examined their sequence features and biochemical properties. PSC-CTR sequences are poorly conserved, but are all highly charged and structurally disordered. We show that active PSC-CTRs--which bind DNA tightly and inhibit chromatin remodeling efficiently--are distinguished from less active ones by the absence of extended negatively charged stretches. PSC-CTR activity can be increased by dispersing its contiguous negative charge, confirming the importance of this property. Using the sequence properties defined as important for PSC-CTR activity, we predicted the presence of active PSC-CTRs in additional diverse genomes. Our analysis reveals broad conservation of PSC-CTR activity across metazoans. This conclusion could not have been determined from sequence alignments. We further find that plants that lack active PSC-CTRs instead possess a functionally analogous PcG protein, EMF1. Thus, our study suggests that a disordered domain with dispersed negative charges underlies PRC1 activity, and is conserved across metazoans and plants.
