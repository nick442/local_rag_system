Application of growth technologies in enhancing food security and sustainability

Anabolic steroids have been widely used in the beef cattle industry for over 50 years as safe and effective growth-promoting agents, and today, more than 90% of all feedlot cattle in the US receive some type of steroidal implant during their lifetime (NAHMS, USDA 2000). A list of approval of growth promotants by the FDA is shown in Table 1. Generally, implants have been shown to increase growth rate 8 to 28%, improve feed efficiency 5 to 20%, and enhance lean tissue mass of the carcass 3 to 10% (Duckett and Owens, 1997). This improvement in production efficiency has multiple benefits: 1) it clearly and dramatically reduces production costs by reducing the amount of feed required per unit of gain (Avery and Avery, 2007); 2) it reduces the amount of land necessary to produce equivalent amounts of food for consumers; 3) it limits the production of greenhouse gases by reducing the number of animals required to produce equivalent amounts of beef (Avery and Avery, 2007); and 4) it extends cost savings to consumers by providing a year-round, affordable supply of beef at reduced prices (Lawrence and Ibarburu, 2006). Since animal products contribute significantly to the total caloric and nutrient intake in the human population, altering the composition of growth toward more lean tissue and less adipose tissue results in a healthier product with fewer calories that still is rich in beneficial nutrients. In addition to steroidal implants, a newer class of orally active growth promotants, known as b-adrenergic agonists (BAA; Ractopamine-HCl; 2003 and Zilpaterol-HCl; 2006), have been approved for use in finishing beef cattle in the last decade. These products provide similar production benefits as steroidal implants, but differ in application and mode of action. Beta-adrenergic agonists are fed during the last 20 to 42 days of the cattle finishing period, depending on the specific product. The purpose of this paper is to explain how anabolic implants and BAA work and their benefits to beef cattle production.
