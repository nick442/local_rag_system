Young adolescents' nutrition assessment on computer (YANA-C)

Objective:To assess the relative validity and acceptability of the computerised 24-h recall ‘Young Adolescent's Nutrition Assessment on Computer (YANA-C)’.Design:Food and nutrient intakes assessed with YANA-C were compared with food records (study 1) and 24-h dietary recall interviews (study 2).Main outcome measures:Intakes of food groups (fruit, fruit juice, vegetables, potatoes, bread, cereals, milk, cheese, other milk products, soft drinks, diet soft drinks, sugar/sweets, pastry/cookies, savoury snacks, butter/sauces, eggs, fish, meat) and nutrients (energy, carbohydrates, protein, fat, fiber, calcium, vitamin C and iron).Subjects and setting:A total of 237 pupils (11–14 y) from two primary and four secondary schools (study 1: n=136; study 2: n=101) in Belgium-Flanders. Results:YANA-C proved to agree well with both standard methods in categorizing subjects in consumers and nonconsumers (κstudy 1=0.48–0.92; κstudy 2=0.38–0.90). Spearman's correlations for energy and nutrient intakes ranged between 0.44 and 0.79 for study 1 and between 0.44 and 0.86 for study 2. Nutrient and energy intakes were in general (excluding calcium) significantly higher in YANA-C in comparison with the food record, but not in comparison with the interview (only fiber). Statistics used to investigate whether YANA-C agreed with the other methods in ranking portions/amounts in consumers only were fair to moderate for most of the food groups (weighted κ study 1=0.11–0.55; study 2=0.04–0.73); amounts in consumers only, were significantly lower in YANA-C against both standards for cereals; amounts were significantly higher in YANA-C against the food record for milk, soft drinks, sugar/sweets and savoury snacks and against the interview for potatoes. Only a few pupils evaluated the program negatively. Conclusion:YANA-C is a promising method to collect detailed dietary information from young adolescents with relatively low staff resources, useful in many nutrition research applications.
