VARNA: Interactive drawing and editing of the RNA secondary structure

DESCRIPTION VARNA is a tool for the automated drawing, visualization and annotation of the secondary structure of RNA, designed as a companion software for web servers and databases. FEATURES VARNA implements four drawing algorithms, supports input/output using the classic formats dbn, ct, bpseq and RNAML and exports the drawing as five picture formats, either pixel-based (JPEG, PNG) or vector-based (SVG, EPS and XFIG). It also allows manual modification and structural annotation of the resulting drawing using either an interactive point and click approach, within a web server or through command-line arguments. AVAILABILITY VARNA is a free software, released under the terms of the GPLv3.0 license and available at http://varna.lri.fr. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
