A plasma membrane component able to bind and alter virions of poliovirus type 1: studies on cell-free alteration using a simplified assay.

Abstract Intact HeLa cells can bind virions of poliovirus type 1 and can subsequently convert them to altered particles by incubation at 37Â°. Altered particles sediment more slowly than virions, have lost VP-4, and are disrupted by sodium dodecyl sulfate, but their RNA is intact and ribonuclease insensitive. These characteristics allow assay of altered particles and of particles that have released their RNA, using nuclease digestion with or without sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. With this simple assay procedure, quantitative parameters of binding and alteration can be measured. The binding-altering activity can be localized in plasma membranes, and pure membranes can be shown to carry out alteration. The membrane-bound activity is abolished by proteases and by nonionic detergents. Only altered particles are formed by membranes; release of RNA is not caused by membranes but is caused by intact cells. Binding and alteration are processes that are closely associated; it is possible that alteration is a consequence of binding by multiple receptors in a fluid membrane.
