Effect of hyperosmolality on alkaline phosphatase and stress-response protein 27 of MCF-7 breast cancer cells

MCF-7, a continuous cell line derived from a human breast carcinoma, exhibits very low alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The enzyme is heat-stable and is inhibited by L-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanylgly-cylglycine, but not by L-homoarginine, 1-bromotetramisole, or levamisole. These data indicate that MCF-7 produces term-placental ALP, the oncodevelopmental enzyme form inappropriately expressed by a variety of human tumors. In contrast to human cancer cells that produce this enzyme monophenotypically, ALP activity of MCF-7 cells is not significantly increased by glucocorticoids or sodium butyrate. By comparison, exposure to hyperosmolality causes a striking increase in enzyme activity. Cycloheximide blocks this effect. The results obtained with cell-free assays were confirmed by cytochemical and immunocytochemical assays on whole cells. Because some of the agents tested in the enzyme modulation experiments affect cell proliferation, their possible effect on two stress-response proteins (srp 27 and srp 72) was also examined; specific immunocytochemical assays were used. These tests revealed that neither protein is affected by glucocorticoids; that sodium butyrate has no effect on srp 27, but alters the intracellular distribution of srp 72; and that hyperosmolality, while not significantly affecting srp 72, causes an increase in srp 27.
