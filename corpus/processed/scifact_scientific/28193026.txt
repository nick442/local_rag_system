A unified concept of species and its consequences for the future of taxonomy

Contemporary species concepts are diverse. Nonetheless, all share the fundamental idea that species are segments of lineages at the population level of biological organization. They differ in the secondary properties (e.g., intrinsic reproductive isolation, monophyly, diagnosability) that are treated as necessary for considering lineages to be species. A unified species concept can be achieved by interpreting the common fundamental idea of being a separately evolving lineage segment as the only necessary property of species and viewing the various secondary properties either as lines of evidence relevant to assessing lineage separation or as properties that define different subcategories of the species category (e.g., reproductively isolated species, monophyletic species, diagnosable species). This unified species concept has a number of consequences for taxonomy, including the need to acknowledge that undifferentiated and undiagnosable lineages are species, that species can fuse, that species can be nested within other species, that the species category is not a taxonomic rank, and that new taxonomic practices and conventions are needed to accommodate these conclusions. Although acceptance of a unified species concept has some radical consequences for taxonomy, it also reflects a change in the general conceptualization of the species category that has been underway for more than a half-century â€” a shift from viewing the species category as one member of the hierarchy of taxonomic ranks to viewing it as a natural kind whose members are the units at one of the levels of biological organization. This change is related to a more general shift in the primary concern of the discipline of systematics (including taxonomy), from the utilitarian activity of classifying organisms to the scientific activity of testing hypotheses about lineage boundaries and phylogenetic relationships. The unified species concept is a natural outcome of this conceptual shift and represents the more complete acceptance of the idea that species are one of the fundamental units of biology. As such, the unified species concept is central to the future of taxonomy.
