Hepatitis C virus and blood transfusion: past and present risks.

The risk of HCV transmission by blood and blood products has been greatly reduced since the early 1980's. Selection of non-remunerated donors, donor selection to prevent HIV transmission, initial surrogate testing in some regions, and introduction of anti-HCV testing have all contributed to this. ALT surrogate testing has become obsolete since the introduction of anti-HCV testing. The residual risk of HCV transmission due to donations in the anti-HCV window period at present is about 1 in 100 000 transfusions of cellular products, and transmission of HCV by plasma products treated with modern inactivation methods such as solvent-detergent treatment, has not been reported. Hemovigilance programmes, which are presently being installed, will provide more data on the safety of blood transfusion. Introduction of HCV nucleic amplification technology (NAT) as a quality control of manufacturing pools for plasma products or as a form of blood donor screening by minipools is anticipated in many European countries for the coming year. Given industrial developments, NAT testing of individual blood donations may become available within the next 2 years. HCV NAT testing will further annihilate the residual risk, and the cost-effectiveness will become relatively low in comparison with other public health measures.
