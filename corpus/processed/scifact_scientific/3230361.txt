Generation and characterization of methyl-lysine histone antibodies.

Publisher Summary This chapter summarizes the development and characterization of rabbit polyclonal antibodies named histone that are directed against the methylated H3-K9 position. It provides protocols for peptide design, rabbit immunizations, and quality controls of methyl-lysine histone antibodies, followed by their in vivo characterization using indirect IF of inter-and metaphase chromatin in wild-type (wt) and mutant mouse cells that are deficient for the Suv39h histone methyltransferases (HMTases). Histone amino-termini (tails) protrude from the nucleosome core and are subject to a variety of post-translational modifications, including acetylation (on lysine residues), phosphorylation (on serine and threonine residues), methylation (on lysine and arginine residues), ubiquitination (on lysine residues), and ADP-ribosylation (on glutamic acid residues). In addition to their structural roles, histones play important functions in the control of gene expression by regulating access to the underlying nucleosomal template. It is without doubt that the development of high-quality, position-specific methyl-lysine histone antibodies can provide important tools for the further decoding of the epigenetic information, which is in part, indexed by distinct methylation states of selective lysine residues in the histone amino-termini. A comparative analysis indicates significant discrepancies in the specificity and avidity of the available methyl-lysine histone antibodies and highlights the need for extensive quality controls, such that experimental data can be correctly interpreted despite the exquisite complexity of histone lysine methylation.
