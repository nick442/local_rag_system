Involvement of cortical fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive basket cells in epilepsy.

GABAergic interneurons of the parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cells subtype (PV INs) are important regulators of cortical network excitability and of gamma oscillations, involved in signal processing and cognition. Impaired development or function of PV INs has been associated with epilepsy in various animal models of epilepsy, as well as in some genetic forms of epilepsy in humans. In this review, we provide an overview of some of the experimental data linking PV INs dysfunction with epilepsy, focusing on disorders of the specification, migration, maturation, synaptic function, or connectivity of PV INs. Furthermore, we reflect on the potential therapeutic use of cell-type specific stimulation of PV INs within active networks and on the transplantation of PV INs precursors in the treatment of epilepsy and its comorbidities.
