The effect of information related to fat content and taste on consumer responses to a reduced-fat frankfurter and a reduced-fat chocolate bar

The effects of product information on responses to frankfurter sausages and chocolate bars were studied by comparing sensory and hedonic ratings in two conditions: blind tasting and tasting with information present. Furthermore, the effect of information alone was investigated by having the subjects rate the expected sensory and hedonic intensities of the products on the basis of packages with different claims. Three groups of subjects were tested by giving them different information: The basic group (no added claims, n = 31), the reduced-fat group (products claimed to have reduced-fat, n=29) and the flavorful group (products claimed to have full meat/chocolate flavor, n = 31). Product information increased the rated pleasantness of the frankfurter in all three information groups compared to the blind ratings. The information did not affect the pleasantness of the chocolate bars. The expected attribute intensities of the frankfurters and chocolates were rated lower by the reduced-fat group than by the other groups. Overall, the effect of product information was more clearly seen in ratings of sensory attributes than in pleasantness ratings.
