Genetic Variants at Newly Identified Lipid Loci Are Associated with Coronary Heart Disease in a Chinese Han Population

BACKGROUND Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped several novel loci influencing blood lipid levels in Caucasians. We sought to explore whether the genetic variants at newly identified lipid-associated loci were associated with CHD susceptibility in a Chinese Han population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We conducted a two-stage case-control study in a Chinese Han population. The first-stage, consisting of 1,376 CHD cases and 1,376 sex and age- frequency matched controls, examined 5 novel lipid-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from GWAS among Caucasians in relation to CHD risk in Chinese. We then validated significant SNPs in the second-stage, consisting of 1,269 cases and 2,745 controls. We also tested associations between SNPs within the five novel loci and blood lipid levels in 4,121 controls. We identified two novel SNPs (rs599839 in CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1 and rs16996148 in NCAN-CILP2) that were significantly associated with reduced CHD risk in Chinese (odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) in the dominant model 0.76 (0.61-0.90; P = 0.001), 0.67 (0.57-0.77; P = 3.4×10(-8)), respectively). Multiple linear regression analyses using dominant model showed that rs599839 was significantly associated with decreased LDL levels (P = 0.022) and rs16996148 was significantly associated with increased LDL and HDL levels (P = 2.9×10(-4) and 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE We identified two novel SNPs (rs599839 and rs16996148) at newly identified lipid-associated loci that were significantly associated with CHD susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.
