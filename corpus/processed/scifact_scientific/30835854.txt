Complex formation of SMAP/KAP3, a KIF3A/B ATPase motor-associated protein, with a human chromosome-associated polypeptide.

We have recently isolated SMAP (Smg GDS-associated protein; Smg GDS: small G protein GDP dissociation stimulator) as a novel Smg GDS-associated protein, which has Armadillo repeats and is phosphorylated by Src tyrosine kinase. SMAP is a human counterpart of mouse KAP3 (kinesin superfamily-associated protein) that is associated with mouse KIF3A/B (a kinesin superfamily protein), which functions as a microtubule-based ATPase motor for organelle transport. We isolated here a SMAP-interacting protein from a human brain cDNA library, identified it to be a human homolog of Xenopus XCAP-E (Xenopus chromosome-associated polypeptide), a subunit of condensins that regulate the assembly and structural maintenance of mitotic chromosomes, and named it HCAP (Human chromosome-associated polypeptide). Tissue and subcellular distribution analyses indicated that HCAP was ubiquitously expressed and highly concentrated in the nuclear fraction, where SMAP and KIF3B were also present. SMAP was extracted as a ternary complex with HCAP and KIF3B from the nuclear fraction in the presence of Mg-ATP. The results suggest that SMAP/KAP3 serves as a linker between HCAP and KIF3A/B in the nucleus, and that SMAP/KAP3 plays a role in the interaction of chromosomes with an ATPase motor protein.
