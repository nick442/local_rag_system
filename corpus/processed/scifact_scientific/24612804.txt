Requirement of endogenous stem cell factor and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor for IL-17-mediated granulopoiesis.

IL-17 is a novel, CD4+ T cell-restricted cytokine. In vivo, it stimulates hematopoiesis and causes neutrophilia consisting of mature granulocytes. In this study, we show that IL-17-mediated granulopoiesis requires G-CSF release and the presence or induction of the transmembrane form of stem cell factor (SCF) for optimal granulopoiesis. However, IL-17 also protects mice from G-CSF neutralization-induced neutropenia. G-CSF neutralization completely reversed IL-17-induced BM progenitor expansion, whereas splenic CFU-GM/CFU-granulocyte-erythrocyte-megakaryocyte-monocyte was only reduced by 50% in both Sl/Sld and littermate control mice. Thus, there remained a significant SCF/G-CSF-independent effect of IL-17 on splenic granulopoiesis, resulting in a preservation of mature circulating granulocytes. IL-17 is a cytokine that potentially interconnects lymphocytic and myeloid host defense and may have potential for therapeutic development.
