Babies driving robots: self-generated mobility in very young infants

Self-generated mobility via locomotion is a key for the cognitive, social and motor development of young infants. For certain children with special needs, self-generated mobility is only attained via assistive technology such as a power wheelchair. Up until recently, infants under 24 months of age were not considered candidates for training in power mobility. Recent work in our labs and others suggest that younger infants can utilize their reaching and grasping ability to learn power mobility. This interdisciplinary study combines our previous work in motor development and learning in infants with special needs, and the application of robot technology for rehabilitation to determine whether young infants without structured training, would drive a mobile robot, and if so, to determine how their driving would change over multiple sessions. The two infants that were seen for the most sessions were the focus of this pilot study. Both infants increased their total session time, percentage of session time spent driving, and total path length. These results suggest that, without training, young infants will independently move themselves using a mobile robot. These results provide the foundation for training studies to advance the self-generated mobility in young infants with special needs. Our future studies will explore the multiple training and technology combinations to reduce the barriers to exploration via self-generated mobility, and advance the general development of infants with special needs.
