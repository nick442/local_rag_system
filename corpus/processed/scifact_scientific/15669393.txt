brain organization

Transient activation of estrogen receptors (ER) in the developing brain during a limited perinatal "window of time" is recognized as a key mechanism of defeminization of neural control of reproductive function and sexual behavior. Two major ER isoforms, alpha and beta, are present in neural circuits that govern ovarian cycle and sexual behavior. Using highly selective ER agonists, this study provides the first evidence for distinct contribution of individual ER isoforms to the process of estrogen dependent defeminization. Neonatal activation of the ERalpha in female rats resulted in abrogation of cyclic ovarian activity and female sexual behavior in adulthood. These effects are associated with male-like alterations in the morphology of the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA), as well as refractoriness to estrogen-mediated induction of sexual receptivity. Exposure to an ERbeta-selective agonist induced persistent estrus and had a strong defeminizing effect on the hypothalamic gonadotropin "surge generator" AVPV. However, neonatal ERbeta activation failed to alter female sexual behavior, responsiveness to estrogens and morphometric features of the behaviorally relevant SDN-POA. Thus, although co-present in several brain regions involved in the control of female reproductive function, ER isoforms convey different, and probably not synergistic, chemical signals in the course of neonatal sex-specific brain organization.
