Targeting TLR4 signaling by TLR4 Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-derived decoy peptides: identification of the TLR4 Toll/IL-1 receptor domain dimerization interface.

Agonist-induced dimerization of TLR4 Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domains initiates intracellular signaling. Therefore, identification of the TLR4-TIR dimerization interface is one key to the rational design of therapeutics that block TLR4 signaling. A library of cell-permeating decoy peptides, each of which represents a nonfragmented patch of the TLR4 TIR surface, was designed such that the peptides entirely encompass the TLR4 TIR surface. Each peptide was synthesized in tandem with a cell-permeating Antennapedia homeodomain sequence and tested for the ability to inhibit early cytokine mRNA expression and MAPK activation in LPS-stimulated primary murine macrophages. Five peptides--4R1, 4R3, 4BB, 4R9, and 4αE--potently inhibited all manifestations of TLR4, but not TLR2 signaling. When tested for their ability to bind directly to TLR4 TIR by Förster resonance energy transfer using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, Bodipy-TMR-X-labeled 4R1, 4BB, and 4αE quenched fluorescence of TLR4-Cerulean expressed in HeLa or HEK293T cells, whereas 4R3 was partially active, and 4R9 was least active. These findings suggest that the area between the BB loop of TLR4 and its fifth helical region mediates TLR4 TIR dimerization. Moreover, our data provide direct evidence for the utility of the decoy peptide approach, in which peptides representing various surface-exposed segments of a protein are initially probed for the ability to inhibit protein function, and then their specific targets are identified by Förster resonance energy transfer to define recognition sites in signaling proteins that may be targeted therapeutically to disrupt functional transient protein interactions.
