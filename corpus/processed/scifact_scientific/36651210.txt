Establishment and in vitro differentiation of a new embryonic stem cell line from human blastocyst.

Embryonic stem cells have the ability to remain undifferentiated and proliferate indefinitely in vitro while maintaining the potential to differentiate into derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers. These cells have, therefore, potential for in vitro differentiation studies, gene function, and so on. The aim of this study was to produce a human embryonic stem cell line. An inner cell mass of a human blastocyst was separated and cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts in embryonic stem cell medium with related additives. The established line was evaluated by morphology; passaging; freezing and thawing; alkaline phosphatase; Oct-4 expression; anti-surface markers including Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81; and karyotype and spontaneous differentiation. Differentiated cardiomyocytes and neurons were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Here, we report the derivation of a new embryonic stem cell line (Royan H1) from a human blastocyst that remains undifferentiated in morphology during continuous passaging for more than 30 passages, maintains a normal XX karyotype, is viable after freezing and thawing, and expresses alkaline phosphatase, Oct-4, Tra-1-60, and Tra-1-81. These cells remain undifferentiated when grown on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers in the presence or absence of recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor. Royan H1 cells can differentiate in vitro in the absence of feeder cells and can produce embryoid bodies that can further differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes as well as neurons. These results define Royan H1 cells as a new human embryonic stem cell line.
