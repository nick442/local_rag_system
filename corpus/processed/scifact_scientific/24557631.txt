Prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis in Isfahan, Iran

Background: The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) shows considerable variability all over the world. According to Kurtzke, Iran is considered to have a low prevalence. Objective: To estimate the period prevalence and risk factors of MS in Isfahan, central part of Iran. Methods: A cross-sectional case register study conducted between 2004 and 2005. In the province of Isfahan, Iran, all patients known to have definite MS during 2004 and 2005, being alive and resident within Isfahan as well as being a member of the Isfahan MS Association were included in the study. Demographic and case-related information was recorded. 1,391 definite MS patients (308 men and 1,083 women) from the Isfahan MS Association, Iran, have been identified. The disease was confirmed using clinical information and MRI findings by a neurologist and radiologist. The patients were evaluated by interview and a questionnaire. Population data were obtained from the year 1999 Iran Census. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 32.5 (9.3) years with a mean (SD) duration of the disease of 6.4 (5.1) years for men and 6.9 (5.3) years for women. Results: The period prevalence of MS was 35.5 per 100,000 [95% confidence interval (CI) 33.6–37.3] in a population of 3,923,255, with a higher rate in women than men [54.5 (95% CI: 51.1–57.8) for women and 14.9 (95% CI: 13.3–16.6) for men]. The female/male ratio was 3.6 (95% CI: 3.2–4.1). The direct age-adjusted period prevalence was 59.5 per 100,000 (95% CI: 44.8–75.2) for women and 17.0 per 100,000 (95% CI: 8.9–25.1) for men. MS rates were highest among 30- to 39-year-olds and decreased with increasing age. Sensory and visual disturbances were the most common initial presentations with a prevalence of 51.1% (95% CI: 48.4–53.7) and 47.0% (95% CI: 44.4–49.7), respectively. Conclusion: Isfahan could be considered as an area with a medium to high risk of MS. This is in sharp contrast with the gradient hypothesis.
