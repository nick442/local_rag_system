Human artificial chromosomes containing chromosome 17 alphoid DNA maintain an active centromere in murine cells but are not stable.

Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) are autonomous molecules that can function and segregate as normal chromosomes in human cells. De novo HACs have successfully been used as gene expression vectors to complement genetic deficiencies in human cultured cells. HACs now offer the possibility of studying the regulation and expression of large genes in a variety of cell types from different tissues and correcting gene deficiencies caused by human inherited diseases. Complementary gene expression studies in mice, especially in mouse models of human genetic diseases, are also important in determining if large human transgenes can be expressed appropriately from artificial chromosomes. Toward this aim we are establishing artificial chromosomes in murine cells as novel gene expression vectors. Initially we transferred HAC vectors into murine cells, but were unable to generate de novo HACs at a reasonable frequency. We then transferred HACs previously established in human HT1080 cells to three different murine cell types by microcell fusion, followed by positive selection. We observed that the HACs in murine cells bound centromere protein C (CENP-C), a marker of active centromeres, and were detected under selection but rapidly lost when selection was removed. These results suggest that the HACs maintain at least a partially functional centromere complex in murine cells, but other factors are required for stability and segregation. Artificial chromosomes containing mouse centromeric sequences may be required for better stability and maintenance in murine cells.
