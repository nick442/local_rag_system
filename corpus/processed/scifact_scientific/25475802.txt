Nitroxergic nerves mediate vagally induced relaxation in the isolated stomach of the guinea pig.

Here we show that the relaxation induced by stimulation of the vagus nerve in the presence of cholinergic (muscarinic) and adrenergic blockade in the isolated stomach of the guinea pig is mediated by nitric oxide (NO). This is substantiated by inhibition of vagal relaxation by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NO synthesis. The effect of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine was partially reversed by coincubation with L-arginine but not with D-arginine. NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase, and relaxation of the stomach induced by vagal stimulation was prevented by an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, methylene blue, further supporting our conclusions. The relaxant effect of vagal stimulation was also ablated by hexamethonium, an inhibitor of ganglionic nicotinic receptors, thereby showing that ganglionic transmission did not rely on NO, through its release from preganglionic neurons. However, hexamethonium did not inhibit the gastric relaxation brought about by increasing the intragastric pressure, which is also mediated by NO as previously described by us. The selective inhibition by hexamethonium of only the vagally mediated relaxation but not of the pressure-induced relaxation of the stomach indicates the existence of at least two separate neuronal pathways able to generate NO and bring about gastric accommodation of food or fluid.
