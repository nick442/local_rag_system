Exercise-induced asthma.

The effect of exercise on ventilatory function was studied in 7 patients with asthma. Three showed appreciable decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) after exercise. The degree of hyperventilation produced by exercise correlated with the postexercise decrease in FEV 1. Voluntary hyperventilation at rest produced a decrease in FEV 1 in all patients with asthma. Breathing 5.6 per cent carbon dioxide during voluntary hyperventilation instead of room air induced a larger ventilation and greater decrease in FEV1. Neither exercise nor voluntary hyperventilation had any significant effect on the FEV 1 in normal subjects and patients with chronic bronchitis. Both exerciseÂ·induced and hyperventilation-induced decrease in FEV 1 were inhibited by prior administration of isoproterenol but not by atropine. It is postulated that exercise-induced asthma is probably hyperventilation-induced asthma. Several underlying mechanisms by which airway obstruction is produced are possible.
