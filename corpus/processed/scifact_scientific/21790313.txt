Effects of powered mobility on self-initiated behaviors of very young children with locomotor disability.

This study reports the effects of powered mobility on the self-initiated behavior of six children with various disabilities who, between 23 and 38 months of age, learnt to use motorized wheelchairs in less than three weeks. Using a multiple baseline design, two-hour observation periods were video-recorded at 10-day intervals before and after they achieved independent mobility. Frequency of self-initiated interaction with objects, spatial exploration and communication with care-giver were analyzed. Three children increased all three types of behavior; one increased in two types but decreased in interaction with objects; and two increased in spatial exploration only.
