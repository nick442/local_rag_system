The FASEB Journal express article 10.1096/fj.00-0815fje. Published online June 27, 2001. Essential role for cholesterol in synaptic plasticity and neuronal degeneration

SPECIFIC AIMSOur previous studies implied the relation between lipid metabolism and amyloid beta protein (Aβ) as ‘a missing link in Alzheimer’s puzzle’ [FASEB J., vol. 12, p. 1097 (1998)]. In the present study, we evaluated the role of cholesterol in synaptic plasticity and neuronal degeneration by a combination of adult rat hippocampal slice technology, a well-established procedure for limited cholesterol efflux, lipid metabolic labeling, extracellular recording of CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), and immunofluorescence. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Increased cholesterol efflux impairs short- and long-term synaptic plasticitySynaptic plasticity is a fundamental feature of the central nervous system (CNS) that allows synapses to ‘remember’ previous activity and express plastic changes to fine-tune current synaptic action. In this study, we asked whether an increased cholesterol efflux induced ex vivo by normal human CSF-HDL3 and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (a natural and model cholesterol ac..
