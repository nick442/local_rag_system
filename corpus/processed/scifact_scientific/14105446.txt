Inhibition of limb regeneration in the axolotl after treatment of the skin with actinomycin D.

In this experiment actinomycin D was used to explore the action of the wound epidermis on underlying tissues during limb regeneration. In axolotl forelimbs the skin was removed from the elbow to the shoulder. Skin from the right limbs was soaked for three hours in actinomycin D (5.0 or 10.0 μg/ml 0.6% NaCl). For controls, skin from left limbs was soaked in 0.6% NaCl for the same period of time. Each piece of skin was orthotopically replanted, and both limbs were amputated through the treated skin, proximal to the elbow. After an initial healing period, the control limbs regenerated normally. Except for a slightly paler color, limbs bearing actinomycin-treated skin were indistinguishable from the controls, both grossly and histologically, during the first week following amputation. While the control limbs formed early blastemas, no grossly visible evidence of regeneration was apparent in the experimental limbs, but histologically some dedifferentiation was occurring. Normally three to four digits were seen in the control regenerates before blastemas appeared on the experimental limbs. By 35–40 days blastemas had appeared on most experimental limbs. These developed very rapidly, and within a short time many of them had attained levels of development close to the controls. Actinomycin D temporarily suppresses formation of the apical epidermal cap and the subsequent aggregation of dedifferentiated cells into a blastema. When the effect wears off, an apical cap forms and the dedifferentiated cells quickly organize into a blastema and begin to differentiate.
