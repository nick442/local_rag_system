CD4+ T cell help guides formation of CD103+ lung-resident memory CD8+ T cells during influenza viral infection.

Tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells provide enhanced protection against infection at mucosal sites. Here we found that CD4(+) T cells are important for the formation of functional lung-resident CD8(+) T cells after influenza virus infection. In the absence of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells displayed reduced expression of CD103 (Itgae), were mislocalized away from airway epithelia, and demonstrated an impaired ability to recruit CD8(+) T cells to the lung airways upon heterosubtypic challenge. CD4(+) T cell-derived interferon-Î³ was necessary for generating lung-resident CD103(+) CD8(+) Trm cells. Furthermore, expression of the transcription factor T-bet was increased in "unhelped" lung Trm cells, and a reduction in T-bet rescued CD103 expression in the absence of CD4(+) T cell help. Thus, CD4(+) T cell-dependent signals are important to limit expression of T-bet and allow for the development of CD103(+) CD8(+) Trm cells in the lung airways following respiratory infection.
