The adverse consequences of unmet need among older persons living in the community: dual-eligible versus Medicare-only beneficiaries.

OBJECTIVE Our objective is to estimate and compare the prevalence of selected adverse consequences associated with unmet need for assistance among a socioeconomically and medically vulnerable subgroup of the older adult population, those who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, with those eligible for Medicare only. METHOD Using data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a representative survey of the older Medicare population, we calculated the prevalence of disability-related need for assistance with self-care, household tasks, and mobility activities and the prevalence of adverse consequences of unmet need by dually eligible and Medicare only status. RESULTS Over 2 million community-dwelling older persons experienced an adverse consequence due to unmet need for assistance with self-care (e.g., soiled their clothes), over 2 million experienced adverse consequences due to unmet need for assistance with household tasks (e.g., went without groceries), and over 3 million persons experienced at least one adverse consequence of unmet need for assistance with mobility-related activities (e.g., had to stay in bed) in the month prior to the NHATS interview. Dually eligible persons experienced higher rates of 6 of the 11 adverse consequences studied and were more likely to have at least one adverse consequence in all 3 domains than others. DISCUSSION Several care models are emerging with the goal of integrating medical care, behavioral health, and long-term services for the dual eligible population. Indicators of adverse consequences of unmet need could be used to monitor the quality and adequacy of such care systems.
