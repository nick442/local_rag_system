Lessons from sudden coronary death: a comprehensive morphological classification scheme for atherosclerotic lesions.

This review will reconsider the current paradigm for understanding the critical, final steps in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. That scheme, largely an outgrowth of observations of autopsy tissues by Davies and colleagues,1 2 asserts that the cause of death in atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is rupture of an advanced atherosclerotic lesion. Although this assumption may be partially true, recent autopsy studies suggest that it is incomplete. To reconsider this paradigm, we reexamined the morphological classification scheme for lesions proposed by the American Heart Association (AHA).3 4 This scheme is difficult to use for 2 reasons. First, it uses a very long list of roman numerals modified by letter codes that are difficult to remember. Second, it implies an orderly, linear pattern of lesion progression. This tends to be ambiguous, because it is not clear whether there is a single sequence of events during the progression of all lesions. We have therefore tried to devise a simpler classification scheme that is consistent with the AHA categories but is easier to use, able to deal with a wide array of morphological variations, and not overly burdened by mechanistic implications. The current paradigm is based on the belief that type IV lesions, or “atheromas,” described by the AHA are stable because the fatty, necrotic core is contained by a smooth muscle cell–rich fibrous cap. Virchow’s analysis5 in 1858 pointed out that historically, the term “atheroma” refers to a dermal cyst (“Grutzbalg”), a fatty …
