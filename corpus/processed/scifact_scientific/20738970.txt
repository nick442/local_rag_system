Non-receptor tyrosine kinase Etk is involved in the apoptosis of small cell lung cancer cells.

Epithelial and endothelial tyrosine kinase (Etk), also known as Bmx (bone marrow X kinase) plays an important role in apoptosis of epithelial cells. The goal of this study was to investigate whether Etk is involved in apoptosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells and correlated with the expression levels of apoptosis-associated proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and p53. One hundred and seventy-one cases of lung cancer specimens including seventy-one SCLCs and one hundred NSCLCs were immunostained for Etk, Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and p53. Parental SCLC H446 cell line, and its subline (H446-Etk) that overexpresses Etk, were used to study the role of Etk in apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. It was found that high expression of Etk occurs in 74.6% of SCLC cases, but only in 40% of NSCLC cases, and there is marked difference in the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and p53 between Etk-positive and Etk-negative SCLC cases. Furthermore, the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) significantly increased in H446-Etk cells than that in H446 cells after doxorubicin treatment, and were positively associated with Etk expression. However, p53 did not correspond with Etk expression although its expression decreased greatly with apoptosis both in H446-Etk and H446 cells. After doxorubicin treatment, the cell viability was significantly higher in H446-Etk cells than in parental H446 cells. Downregulation of Etk by Etk siRNA sensitized H446 cells to doxorubicin. Our results indicate that upregulation of tyrosine kinase Etk may be a new mechanism involved in protection of SCLC cells from apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) but not p53 may contribute to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis through Etk pathway.
