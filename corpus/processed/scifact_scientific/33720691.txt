The complete primary structure of the spermadhesin AWN, a zona pellucida-binding protein isolated from boar spermatozoa.

AWN is a boar protein which originates in secretions of the male accessory glands and which becomes sperm surface-associated upon ejaculation. It is one of the components thought to mediate sperm adhesion to the egg's zona pellucida through a carbohydrate-recognition mechanism. AWN may, thus, participate in the initial events of fertilization in the pig. In this report we describe its complete primary structure by combination of protein-chemical and mass spectrometric methods. AWN exists as two isoforms, AWN-1 and AWN-2, which differ in that AWN-2 is N-terminally acetylated. The amino acid sequence of AWN contains 133 amino acid residues and two disulphide bridges between nearest-neighbour cysteine residues. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the AWN proteins showed significant similarity only to AQN-1 and AQN-3, two other boar spermadhesins.
