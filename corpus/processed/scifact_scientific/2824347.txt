HIV-1 regulation of latency in the monocyte-macrophage lineage and in CD4+ T lymphocytes.

The introduction in 1996 of the HAART raised hopes for the eradication of HIV-1. Unfortunately, the discovery of latent HIV-1 reservoirs in CD4+ T cells and in the monocyte-macrophage lineage proved the optimism to be premature. The long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs constitute a major obstacle to the eradication of HIV-1. In this review, we focus on the establishment and maintenance of HIV-1 latency in the two major targets for HIV-1: the CD4+ T cells and the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Understanding the cell-type molecular mechanisms of establishment, maintenance, and reactivation of HIV-1 latency in these reservoirs is crucial for efficient therapeutic intervention. A complete viral eradication, the holy graal for clinicians, might be achieved by strategic interventions targeting latently and productively infected cells. We suggest that new approaches, such as the combination of different kinds of proviral activators, may help to reduce dramatically the size of latent HIV-1 reservoirs in patients on HAART.
