Chronic renal failure accelerates atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.

Cardiovascular mortality is 10 to 20 times increased in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). Risk factors for atherosclerosis are abundant in patients with CRF. However, the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in CRF remains to be elucidated. The effect of CRF on the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient male mice was examined. Seven-week-old mice underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (CRF, n = 28), unilateral nephrectomy (UNX, n = 24), or no surgery (n = 23). Twenty-two weeks later, CRF mice showed increased aortic plaque area fraction (0.266 +/- 0.033 versus 0.045 +/- 0.006; P < 0.001), aortic cholesterol content (535 +/- 62 versus 100 +/- 9 nmol/cm(2) intimal surface area; P < 0.001), and aortic root plaque area (205,296 +/- 22,098 versus 143,662 +/- 13,302 micro m(2); P < 0.05) as compared with no-surgery mice; UNX mice showed intermediate values. The plaques from uremic mice contained CD11b-positive macrophages and showed strong staining for nitrotyrosine. Systolic BP and plasma homocysteine concentrations were similar in uremic and nonuremic mice. Plasma urea and cholesterol concentrations were elevated 2.6-fold (P < 0.001) and 1.5-fold (P < 0.001) in CRF compared with no-surgery mice. Both variables correlated with aortic plaque area fraction (r(2) = 0.5, P < 0.001 and r(2) = 0.3, P < 0.001, respectively) and with each other (r(2) = 0.5, P < 0.001). On multiple linear regression analysis, only plasma urea was a significant predictor of aortic plaque area fraction. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that uremia markedly accelerates atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. This effect could not be fully explained by changes in BP, plasma homocysteine levels, or total plasma cholesterol concentrations. Thus, the CRF apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse is a new model for studying the pathogenesis of accelerated atherosclerosis in uremia.
