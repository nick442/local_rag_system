Influence of Steroid Hormone Signaling on Life Span Control by Caenorhabditis elegans Insulin-Like Signaling

Sterol-sensing nuclear receptors and insulin-like growth factor signaling play evolutionarily conserved roles in the control of aging. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, bile acid-like steroid hormones known as dafachronic acids (DAs) influence longevity by binding to and regulating the activity of the conserved nuclear receptor DAF-12, and the insulin receptor (InsR) ortholog DAF-2 controls life span by inhibiting the FoxO transcription factor DAF-16. How the DA/DAF-12 pathway interacts with DAF-2/InsR signaling to control life span is poorly understood. Here we specifically investigated the roles of liganded and unliganded DAF-12 in life span control in the context of reduced DAF-2/InsR signaling. In animals with reduced daf-2/InsR activity, mutations that either reduce DA biosynthesis or fully abrogate DAF-12 activity shorten life span, suggesting that liganded DAF-12 promotes longevity. In animals with reduced DAF-2/InsR activity induced by daf-2/InsR RNAi, both liganded and unliganded DAF-12 promote longevity. However, in daf-2/InsR mutants, liganded and unliganded DAF-12 act in opposition to control life span. Thus, multiple DAF-12 activities influence life span in distinct ways in contexts of reduced DAF-2/InsR signaling. Our findings establish new roles for a conserved steroid signaling pathway in life span control and elucidate interactions among DA biosynthetic pathways, DAF-12, and DAF-2/InsR signaling in aging.
