Preventing bacterial DNA release and absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome activation by a Legionella effector functioning in membrane trafficking.

Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' pneumonia, resides in a distinct vacuole structure called Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). The LCV resists fusion with the lysosome and permits efficient bacterial replication in host macrophages, which requires a Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system. Dot/Icm-translocated effector SdhA is critical for L. pneumophila intracellular growth and functions to prevent host cell death. Here, we show that the absence of SdhA resulted in elevated caspase-1 activation and IL-1Î² secretion as well as macrophage pyroptosis during Legionella infection. These inflammasome activation phenotypes were independent of the established flagellin-NAIP5-NLRC4 axis, but relied on the DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome. We further demonstrate that Legionella DNA was released into macrophage cytosol, and this effect was significantly exaggerated by the absence of SdhA. SdhA bears a functional Golgi-targeting GRIP domain that is required for preventing AIM2 inflammasome activation. Ectopically expressed SdhA formed a unique ring-shape membrane structure, further indicating a role in membrane trafficking and maintaining LCV membrane integrity. Our data together suggest a possible link, mediated by the function of SdhA, between LCV trafficking/maturation and suppression of host innate immune detection.
