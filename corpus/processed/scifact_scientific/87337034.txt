Construction of an antisense CYP86MF gene plasmid vector and production of a male-sterile Chinese cabbage transformant by the pollen-tube method

SummaryA plant expression vector pBIA9-AMF containing an antisense fragment of the CYP86MF gene and the tapetum-specific A9 promoter was constructed. Plasmid vectors were introduced by floral-dipping and pollen-tube transformation methods to Chinese cabbage pak-choi (Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis (L.) Makino var. communis Tsen et Lee, syn. B. rapa ssp. chinensis (L.) Makino var. communis Tsen et Lee) and flowering Chinese cabbage (B. campestris ssp. chinensis (L.) Makino var. parachinensis (Bailey) Tsen et Lee). Results showed that KanR seedlings could be obtained by the pollen-tube method through germination tests of T1 progeny seeds, but not by the floral-dipping method. One of the two KanR seedlings proved that the antisense fragment of the CYP86MF gene was integrated into the Chinese cabbage genome by PCR amplification and Southern blotting. Northern hybridization indicated that the CYP86MF gene, under the A9 promoter, was inhibited in the transformant, and self-infertility was found in the trans..
