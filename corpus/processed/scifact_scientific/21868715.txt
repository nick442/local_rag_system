A subset of 26S proteasomes is activated at critically low ATP concentrations and contributes to myocardial injury during cold ischemia.

Molecular mechanisms leading to myocardial injury during warm or cold ischemia are insufficiently understood. Although proteasomes are thought to contribute to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, their roles during the ischemic period remain elusive. Because donor hearts are commonly exposed to prolonged global cold ischemia prior to cardiac transplantation, we evaluated the role and regulation of the proteasome during cold ischemic storage of rat hearts in context of the myocardial ATP content. When measured at the actual tissue ATP concentration, cardiac proteasome peptidase activity increased by 225% as ATP declined during cold ischemic storage of hearts in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution for up to 48h. Addition of the specific proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin to the UW solution inhibited proteasome activity in the cardiac extracts, significantly reduced edema formation and preserved the ultrastructural integrity of the cardiomyocyte. Utilizing purified 20S/26S proteasome enzyme preparations, we demonstrate that this activation can be attributed to a subset of 26S proteasomes which are stable at ATP concentrations far below physiological levels, that ATP negatively regulates its activity and that maximal activation occurs at ATP concentrations in the low mumol/L range. These data suggest that proteasome activation is a pathophysiologically relevant mechanism of cold ischemic myocardial injury. A subset of 26S proteasomes appears to be a cell-destructive protease that is activated as ATP levels decline. Proteasome inhibition during cold ischemia preserves the ultrastructural integrity of the cardiomyocyte.
