Differential Effects of N-Acetylcysteine, Theophylline or Bicarbonate on Contrast-Induced Rat Renal Vasoconstriction

Background: Vasoconstriction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation following contrast media (CM) injection are the key factors triggering CM-induced nephropathy. We compared the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), theophylline or sodium bicarbonate on intrarenal vasoconstriction and ROS generation in a rat model of CM-induced nephropathy. Methods: Following a 3-day dehydration, Sprague-Dawley rats received CM (Telebrix) or sham ‘CM’ injection of 0.9% saline. Part of them received NAC, theophylline or bicarbonate prior to CM. Medullar renal blood flow was estimated by laser Doppler. The animals were sacrificed 1, 15 or 30 min after the respective treatments, their kidneys allocated and intrarenal STAT-8 isoprostane, PGE2 and NO assessed. Results: Vasoconstriction was significantly attenuated by NAC. Theophylline only mildly attenuated the perfusion drop at 15 min, and was ineffective following 30 min. Unlike theophylline or bicarbonate, NAC significantly augmented intrarenal PGE2. NAC, theophylline but not bicarbonate, gradually increased intrarenal NO. In all experimental variables, CM-induced ROS accumulation, represented by STAT-8 isoprostane estimation, progressed undisturbed. Conclusions: (1) CM-induced intrarenal vasoconstriction was efficiently prohibited by NAC but not bicarbonate or theophylline; (2) the vasodilatory effect of NAC was mediated via increased PGE2 synthesis, and (3) ROS accumulation was a primary renal response to CM-induced injury, not affected by any pharmacologic manipulations.
