Results of screening for intracranial aneurysms in patients with coarctation of the aorta.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE IAs are found in 2.3% of adults; the mean age at detection is 52 years. Prevalence is <0.5% in young adults. Early studies suggest that 10%-50% of patients with aortic coarctation have IAs. Screening recommendations are variable. We sought to examine the prevalence of IAs through screening with MRA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients older than 16 years of age with coarctation undergoing brain MRA between May 1999 and October 2007 were included. MRA was performed by using a 1.5T scanner with a 3D time-of-flight protocol; simultaneous MR imaging was performed of the heart and aorta. Cerebral MRAs were double-reported by a neuroradiologist. Statistics are described as mean ± SD and median ± range. Continuous variables were compared by using Student t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests (categoric variables, by using the Fisher exact test). RESULTS One hundred seventeen MRAs were double-reported. The median age was 29 ± 11 years (range, 16-59 years). IAs were found in 12 patients (10.3%). The mean diameter of IAs was 3.9 mm (range, 2.0-8.0 mm). Patients with aneurysms were older (median, 37 years; range, 16-50 years) than those without (median, 23 years; range, 16-59 years; Z = -2.01, P = .04). Hypertension was more common in those with IAs (IA 83% versus no IA 43%, P = .01). There was no association between ascending aortopathy, bicuspid aortic valves, and IAs. CONCLUSIONS Patients with coarctation have a higher prevalence of IAs, occurring at an earlier age than in population studies. Whether routine screening is appropriate for this group of patients is unclear. Hypertension is likely to be an important pathophysiologic factor.
