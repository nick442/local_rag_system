Interferon alpha and zidovudine therapy in adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma: response and outcome in 15 patients.

Adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive disease caused by the human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-I) with a short survival. Responses to interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and zidovudine (AZT) have been documented but not with long-term follow-up. We treated 15 ATLL patients with IFN and AZT. Eleven patients had acute ATLL, two had lymphoma and two smouldering ATLL, with progression. The main features were: organomegaly (14), skin lesions (10), high white blood cell (WBC) count (11) and hypercalcaemia (9). Eleven patients had previously received chemotherapy and one had received an autograft. At the time of the study, seven patients had progressive disease and eight were in partial or complete clinical remission. Responses (PR) lasting 2+ to 44+ months were seen in 67%; 26% did not respond (NR) and one patient was not evaluable. Hypercalcaemia predicted a poor outcome but differences were not significant. Eight of the 15 patients have died 3-41 months from diagnosis. Median survival for the 15 patients was 18 months. Survival of the NR ranged from 4 to 20 months; six PR patients are alive 8-82 months from diagnosis. The differences in survival between NR (median: 6 months) and PR (55% of patients alive at 4 years) were statistically significant (P = 0.002). In conclusion, IFN and AZT improves the outcome of ATLL patients and helps maintain responses.
