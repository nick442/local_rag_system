Myelodysplastic syndromes: revisiting the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in disease pathogenesis

Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and the propensity to leukemic transformation. Their pathogenesis is complex and likely depends on interplay between aberrant hematopoietic cells and their microenvironment. How niche cells play a role in disease evolution is poorly defined, but the delineation of the hematopoietic stem cell niche and the ability to interrogate its role in hematopoietic disease in animal models have furthered our insights in recent years. The data support a view in which the microenvironment can play an active role in the evolution of myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders, thus providing further rationale to explore therapeutic targeting of mesenchymalâ€“hematopoietic interactions in these diseases.
