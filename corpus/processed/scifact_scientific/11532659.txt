Phosphorylation of histone H3(T118) alters nucleosome dynamics and remodeling

Nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin structure, are regulators and barriers to transcription, replication and repair. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the histone proteins within nucleosomes regulate these DNA processes. Histone H3(T118) is a site of phosphorylation [H3(T118ph)] and is implicated in regulation of transcription and DNA repair. We prepared H3(T118ph) by expressed protein ligation and determined its influence on nucleosome dynamics. We find H3(T118ph) reduces DNA-histone binding by 2 kcal/mol, increases nucleosome mobility by 28-fold and increases DNA accessibility near the dyad region by 6-fold. Moreover, H3(T118ph) increases the rate of hMSH2-hMSH6 nucleosome disassembly and enables nucleosome disassembly by the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler. These studies suggest that H3(T118ph) directly enhances and may reprogram chromatin remodeling reactions.
