Stathmin overexpression identifies high-risk patients and lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer.

PURPOSE Overexpression of the oncogen Stathmin has been linked to aggressive endometrial carcinoma and a potential for PI3Kinase inhibitors in this disease. We wanted to validate the prognostic value of Stathmin expression in a large prospective multicenter setting. As lymph node sampling is part of current surgical staging, we also aimed to test if Stathmin expression in endometrial curettage specimens could predict lymph node metastasis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A total of 1,076 endometrial cancer patients have been recruited from 10 centers to investigate the biological tumor marker Stathmin in relation to clinicopathologic variables, including lymph node status and survival. Stathmin immunohistochemical staining was carried out in 477 hysterectomy and 818 curettage specimens. RESULTS Seventy-one percent of the patients (n = 763) were subjected to lymph node sampling, of which 12% had metastatic nodes (n = 94). Overexpression of Stathmin was detected in 37% (302 of 818) of the curettage and in 18% (84 of 477) of the hysterectomy specimens investigated. Stathmin overexpression in curettage and hysterectomy specimens were highly correlated and significantly associated with nonendometrioid histology, high grade, and aneuploidy. Stathmin analysis in preoperative curettage samples significantly correlated with, and was an independent predictor of, lymph node metastases. High Stathmin expression was associated with poor disease-specific survival (P â‰¤ 0.002) both in curettage and hysterectomy specimens. CONCLUSIONS Stathmin immunohistochemical staining identifies endometrial carcinomas with lymph node metastases and poor survival. The value, as a predictive marker for response to PI3Kinase inhibition and as a tool to stratify patients for lymph node sampling in endometrial carcinomas, remains to be determined.
