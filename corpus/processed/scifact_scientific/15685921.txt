Differential effects of charybdotoxin on the activity of retinal ganglion cells in the dark- and light-adapted mouse retina

Patch-clamp recordings were made from retinal ganglion cells in the mouse retina. Under dark adaptation, blockage of BK(Ca) channels increases the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and light-evoked On-EPSCs, while it decreases the light-evoked Off inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). However, under light adaptation it decreases the light-evoked On-EPSCs, the spontaneous IPSCs and the light-evoked On- and Off-IPSCs. Blockage of BK(Ca) channels significantly altered the outputs of RGCs by changing their light-evoked responses into a bursting pattern and increasing the light-evoked depolarization of the membrane potentials, while it did not significantly change the peak firing rates of light-evoked responses.
