Defining early lineage specification of human embryonic stem cells by the orchestrated balance of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin, Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling.

The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling has remarkably diverse roles in embryonic development, stem cell self-renewal and cancer progression. Here, we show that stabilized expression of beta-catenin perturbed human embryonic stem (hES)-cell self-renewal, such that up to 80% of the hES cells developed into the primitive streak (PS)/mesoderm progenitors, reminiscent of early mammalian embryogenesis. The formation of the PS/mesoderm progenitors essentially depended on the cooperative action of beta-catenin together with Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling pathways. Intriguingly, blockade of BMP signaling completely abolished mesoderm generation, and induced a cell fate change towards the anterior PS progenitors. The PI3-kinase/Akt, but not MAPK, signaling pathway had a crucial role in the anterior PS specification, at least in part, by enhancing beta-catenin stability. In addition, Activin/Nodal and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling synergistically induced the generation and specification of the anterior PS/endoderm. Taken together, our findings clearly demonstrate that the orchestrated balance of Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling defines the cell fate of the nascent PS induced by canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in hES cells.
