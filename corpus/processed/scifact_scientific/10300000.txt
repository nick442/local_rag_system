Knowledge and use of secondary contraception among patients requesting termination of pregnancy.

The results of a survey of 769 patients attending the St. James's University Fertility Control Clinic, England, for abortion services showed that patients seeing general practitioners were less knowledgeable than those attending specialist clinics. There was a demonstrated need for counseling on pill and condom use and protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Knowledge of postcoital methods was also found to be lacking. The survey was conducted between April 1, 1991, and January 31, 1992. Respondents included minorities such as Afro-Caribbean (8%) and Asian (9%). 307 of the cases were using a less effective form of contraception at the time of conception, usually a change from the pill to condoms. Of the 171 people reporting failure of contraception, 93 noted a split or leaking condom; 13, a condom falling off during intercourse; 32, inconsistent use of condoms;l 32, forgetting to take contraceptive pills or using antibiotics with the pill; and 1, a late injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate. 45 of the 309 people who had conceived while using condoms recognized a potential condom failure, and only 20 attempted any emergency contraceptive method such as the postcoital pill. Only 30% of the 171 patients with recognized condom failure and 12% of the 210 who had not used any contraception had adequate knowledge of the existence, timing, and source of postcoital pills; i.e., 20% of 381. Only 2% of the 171 nd 2% of the 381 patients, had knowledge of postcoital insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device. Given the choice between and unplanned pregnancy and postcoital contraceptive, most (718 out of 769) preferred using postcoital contraception. Contraceptive information was given to 501 by a general practitioner, to 102 by a community family planning clinic, and 163 had no medical advice. There was a range of knowledge of postcoital contraceptive methods. Knowledge of how to deal with forgotten pills, severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, and concurrent antibiotic treatment among the 422 patients who had ever used the combined pill also was variable. 19% of the 372 patients treated by general practitioners knew 4 correct answers, but 50% of the 50 patients in community family planning clinics answered correctly 4 times. Differences could not be explained by other demographic characteristics.
