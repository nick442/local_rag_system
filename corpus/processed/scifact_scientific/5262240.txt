Variations in the quality and sustainability of long-term glycaemic control with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

AIMS To investigate the pattern of changes in HbA1c in people with Type 1 diabetes managed by long-term Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. METHODS We studied HbA1c changes using computerized clinic records in 35 adult people with Type 1 diabetes and an elevated HbA1c (≥ 64 mmol/mol, 8.0%) on multiple daily insulin injections, who were then switched to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for at least 5 years. RESULTS We identified three subgroups with similar baseline HbA1c but different long-term responses to pump therapy: group A--those with improvement followed by deterioration (57%); group B--those with improvement that was sustained throughout the 5 years (31%); and group C-those where HbA1c did not change significantly from baseline (12%). The patients in group C had a higher BMI: 31.0 ± 5.2 vs. 25.9 ± 3.3 vs. 25.2 ± 3.1 kg/m² (group C vs. group A and group B; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Improved glycaemic control with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was maintained over 5 years by 88% of people with Type 1 diabetes in this study, but there were variations in the long-term efficacy, with some people improving and worsening, others maintaining strict control and a few subcutaneous insulin infusion 'non-responders'.
