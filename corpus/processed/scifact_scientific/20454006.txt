A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of diindolylmethane for breast cancer biomarker modulation in patients taking tamoxifen

Diindolylmethane (DIM), a bioactive metabolite of indole-3-carbinol found in cruciferous vegetables, has proposed cancer chemoprevention activity in the breast. There is limited evidence of clinically relevant activity of DIM or long-term safety data of its regular use. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the activity and safety of combined use of BioResponse DIM® (BR-DIM) with tamoxifen. Women prescribed tamoxifen (n = 130) were randomly assigned oral BR-DIM at 150 mg twice daily or placebo, for 12 months. The primary study endpoint was change in urinary 2/16α-hydroxyestrone (2/16α-OHE1) ratio. Changes in 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OHE1), serum estrogens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), breast density, and tamoxifen metabolites were assessed. Ninety-eight women (51 placebo, 47 DIM) completed intervention; compliance with treatment was >91%. BR-DIM increased the 2/16α-OHE1 ratio (+3.2 [0.8, 8.4]) compared to placebo (−0.7 [−1.7, 0.8], P < 0.001). Serum SHBG increased with BR-DIM compared to placebo (+25 ± 22 and +1.1 ± 19 nmol/L, respectively). No change in breast density measured by mammography or by MRI was observed. Plasma tamoxifen metabolites (endoxifen, 4-OH tamoxifen, and N-desmethyl-tamoxifen) were reduced in women receiving BR-DIM versus placebo (P < 0.001). Minimal adverse events were reported and did not differ by treatment arm. In patients taking tamoxifen for breast cancer, daily BR-DIM promoted favorable changes in estrogen metabolism and circulating levels of SHBG. Further research is warranted to determine whether BR-DIM associated decreases in tamoxifen metabolites, including effects on endoxifen levels, attenuates the clinical benefit of tamoxifen.
