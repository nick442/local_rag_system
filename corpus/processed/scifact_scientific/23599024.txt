Surfactant Protein B Suppresses Lung Cancer Progression by Inhibiting Secretory Phospholipase A2 Activity and Arachidonic Acid Production

Background/Aims: Radiotherapy is applied to patients with inoperable cancer types including advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and radioresistance functions as a critical obstacle in radiotherapy. This study was aimed to investigate the mechanism of radioresistance regulated by surfactant protein B (SP-B). Methods: To investigate the role of SP-B in radioresistance, ΔSFTPB A549 cell line was established and SP-B expression was analyzed. In response to ionizing radiation (IR), the change of SP-B expression was analyzed in A549 and NCI-H441 cell lines. Conditioned media (CM) from NSCLC cells were utilized to evaluate the downstream signaling pathway. The in vivo effects of SP-B were assessed through mouse xenograft model with intratumoral injection of CM. Results: In response to IR, NSCLC cell lines showed decreased SP-B regulated by the TGF-β signaling and decreased SP-B stimulated cell survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Treatment with CM from irradiated cells activated sPLA2, enhanced protein kinase Cδ-MAPKs signaling pathway, and increased arachidonic acid production. We confirmed the in vivo roles of SP-B through mouse xenograft model. Conclusion: Our results revealed that down-regulation of SP-B was involved in the radiation-induced metastatic conversion of NSCLC and provided evidence that SP-B acted as a suppressor of NSCLC progression.
