Kinesin-2 controls development and patterning of the vertebrate skeleton by Hedgehog- and Gli3-dependent mechanisms.

Hedgehog signaling plays an essential role in patterning of the vertebrate skeleton. Here we demonstrate that conditional inactivation of the Kif3a subunit of the kinesin-2 intraflagellar transport motor in mesenchymal skeletal progenitor cells results in severe patterning defects in the craniofacial area, the formation of split sternum and the development of polydactyly. These deformities are reminiscent of those previously described in mice with deregulated hedgehog signaling. We show that in Kif3a-deficient mesenchymal tissues both the repressor function of Gli3 transcription factor and the activation of the Shh transcriptional targets Ptch and Gli1 are compromised. Quantitative analysis of gene expression demonstrates that the Gli1 transcript level is dramatically reduced, whereas Gli3 expression is not significantly affected by kinesin-2 depletion. However, the motor appears to be required for the efficient cleavage of the full-length Gli3 transcription factor into a repressor form.
