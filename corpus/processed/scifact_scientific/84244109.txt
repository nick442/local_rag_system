Innate immunity to a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen.

The murine response to Listeria monocytogenes has long been considered a paradigm of T-cell-mediated immunity. There is, however, substantial evidence that T-cell-deficient mice are capable of surviving a L. monocytogenes challenge. Recently, advances have been made in our understanding of the cell biology and pathogenesis of infection.
