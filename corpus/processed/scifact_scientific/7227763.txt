Experimental and clinical studies on lactate and pyruvate as indicators of the severity of acute circulatory failure (shock).

The increase in lactate (L) and pyruvate (P) content of arterial blood during experimental and clinical shock states and the extent to which such increases serve as measures of oxygen deficit and irreversible injury were investigated on an empirical basis. A standardized method for production of hemorrhagic shock in the Wistar rat was employed. During a 4-hour bleeding period, oxygen consumption of the rat was reduced to approximately 40% of control value, pH was reduced from 7.39 to 7.08, and a concurrent increase in L from 0.80 to 6.06 mm and in P from 0.07 to 0.18 mm were observed. Cumulative oxygen debt correlated with log L (r = 0.50; P < 0.0005) and both were significantly related to survival. Correlation of cumulative oxygen debt and survival, both with P and with computed values of the lactate pyruvate ratio (L/P) and excess lactate (XL), were of no higher magnitude. Partial correlation analysis demonstrated that neither the measurement of P nor the computation of L/P or XL improved predictability..
