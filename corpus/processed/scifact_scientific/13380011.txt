Spare respiratory capacity rather than oxidative stress regulates glutamate excitotoxicity after partial respiratory inhibition of mitochondrial complex I with rotenone.

Partial inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I by rotenone reproduces aspects of Parkinson's disease in rodents. The hypothesis that rotenone enhancement of neuronal cell death is attributable to oxidative stress was tested in an acute glutamate excitotoxicity model using primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons. As little as 5 nM rotenone increased mitochondrial superoxide (O2*-) levels and potentiated glutamate-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ deregulation, the first irreversible stage of necrotic cell death. However, the potent cell-permeant O2*- trap manganese tetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium-2yl) porphyrin failed to prevent the effects of the inhibitor. The bioenergetic consequences of rotenone addition were quantified by monitoring cell respiration. Glutamate activation of NMDA receptors used the full respiratory capacity of the in situ mitochondria, and >80% of the glutamate-stimulated respiration was attributable to increased cellular ATP demand. Rotenone at 20 nM inhibited basal and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-stimulated cell respiration and caused respiratory failure in the presence of glutamate. ATP synthase inhibition by oligomycin was also toxic in the presence of glutamate. We conclude that the cell vulnerability in the rotenone model of partial complex I deficiency under these specific conditions is primarily determined by spare respiratory capacity rather than oxidative stress.
