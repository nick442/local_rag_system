Threonine as a carbon source for Escherichia coli.

Threonine can be used aerobically as the sole source of carbon and energy by mutants of Escherichia coli K-12. The pathway used involves the conversion of threonine via threonine dehydrogenase to aminoketobutyric acid, which is further metabolized by aminoketobutyric acid ligase, forming acetyl coenzyme A and glycine. A strain devoid of serine transhydroxymethylase uses this pathway and excretes glycine as a waste product. Aminoketobutyric acid ligase activity was demonstrated after passage of crude extracts through Sephadex G100.
