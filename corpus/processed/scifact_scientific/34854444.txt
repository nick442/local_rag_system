Expression of Golli mRNA during development in primary immune lymphoid organs of the rat

The gene-of-the-oligodendrocyte lineage (Golli)-MBP transcription unit contains three Golli-specific exons together with eight exons of the "classical" myelin basic protein (MBP) gene, yielding alternatively spliced proteins which share amino acid sequence with MBP. Unlike MBP, a late antigen expressed only in the nervous system, Golli gene products are expressed pre- and post-natally at many sites. In this study, we determined the sequence of Golli in rat by RT-PCR and 5' RACE and showed that Golli sequences are expressed in primary lymphoid organs as early as e16.5, which could explain the anergic rat T cell response we previously observed in Golli-induced meningitis.
