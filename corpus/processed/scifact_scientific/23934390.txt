MicroRNA-203 inhibits cellular proliferation and invasion by targeting Bmi1 in non-small cell lung cancer.

MicroRNAs are proposed to serve vital functions in the regulation of tumor progression and invasion. However, the expression levels of miR-203 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its clinical significance remain unknown. In the present study, the association between B-cell-specific moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1) and miR-203 was investigated. miR-203 was demonstrated to act as a tumor suppressor by regulating the expression of Bmi1. miR-203 expression levels were downregulated in NSCLC tissues while Bmi1 expression was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, downregulated Bmi1 or enhanced miR-203 expression inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. In addition, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed, which identified Bmi1 as a novel target of miR-203. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that miR-203 functions as a tumor suppressor and is important in inhibiting the proliferation of NSCLC cells through targeting Bmi1. These findings indicate that miR-203 may be useful as a novel potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.
