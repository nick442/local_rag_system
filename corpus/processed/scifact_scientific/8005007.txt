PRRSV receptors and their roles in virus infection

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has a restricted cell tropism and prefers to invade well-differentiated cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, such as pulmonary alveolar macrophages and African green monkey kidney cell line MA-104 and its derivatives, such as Marc-145, Vero and CL-2621. PRRSV infection of the host cells actually is a receptor-mediated endocytosis and replication process. The presence and absence of the cellular receptors decide whether the cell lines are permissive or non-permissive to PRRSV infection. Several PRRSV non-permissive cell lines, such as BHK-21, PK-15 and CHO-K1, have been shown to become sensitive to the virus infection upon expression of the recombinant receptor proteins. Up to now, heparin sulfate, sialoadhesin, CD163, CD151 and vimentin have been identified as the important PRRSV receptors via their involvement in virus attachment, internalization or uncoating. Each receptor is characterized by the distribution in different cells, the function in virus different infection stages and the interaction model with the viral proteins or genes. Joint forces of the receptors recently attract attentions due to the specific function. PRRSV receptors have become the targets for designing the new anti-viral reagents or the recombinant cell lines used for isolating the viruses or developing more effective vaccines due to their more conserved sequences compared with the genetic variation of the virus. In this paper, the role of PRRSV receptors and the molecular mechanism of the interaction between the virus and the receptors are reviewed.
