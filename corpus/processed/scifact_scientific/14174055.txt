Electroporation enables the efficient mRNA delivery into the mouse zygotes and facilitates CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing

Recent use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has dramatically reduced the time required to produce mutant mice, but the involvement of a time-consuming microinjection step still hampers its application for high-throughput genetic analysis. Here we developed a simple, highly efficient, and large-scale genome editing method, in which the RNAs for the CRISPR/Cas9 system are electroporated into zygotes rather than microinjected. We used this method to perform single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN)-mediated knock-in in mouse embryos. This method facilitates large-scale genetic analysis in the mouse.
