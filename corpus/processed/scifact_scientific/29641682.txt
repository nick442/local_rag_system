Reprogramming somatic cells towards pluripotency by cellular fusion.

Pluripotent cells arise within the inner cell mass (ICM) of mammals and have the potential to generate all cell types of the adult organism through a process of commitment and ordered differentiation. Despite many decades of investigation, the mechanisms that guide and stabilise cell fate choice as well as those that can be engineered to promote its reversal, remain only partially resolved. Reprogramming of somatic cells towards a pluripotent-like state can be achieved by several different experimental routes including nuclear transfer, the supply of a defined cocktail of transcription factors, or by fusing somatic cells with a pluripotent stem cell partner. These approaches have been used to demonstrate the remarkable intrinsic epigenetic plasticity of many terminally differentiated cell types, as well as to define the factors that are required for pluripotent conversion. In this review we summarise some recent advances using cell fusion-based studies to better understand the basis of pluripotency and the epigenetic mechanisms that promote cell type inter-conversion.
