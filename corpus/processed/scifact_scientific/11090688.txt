Genetic variability in GLP-1 receptor is associated with inter-individual differences in weight lowering potential of liraglutide in obese women with PCOS: a pilot study

The weight lowering potential of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) is inter-individually different and clinically unpredictable. The potential role of genetic variability of GLP-1R on body weight response to GLP-1 RAs in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not yet been evaluated. Fifty-seven obese women with PCOS (aged 30.7 ± 7.0, BMI 38.6 ± 5.3 kg/m2) were assigned to liraglutide 1.2 mg QD s.c. for 12 weeks and classified as strong responders regarding weight loss if they lost 5 % or more of their initial body weight. They were genotyped for common GLP-1R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6923761 and rs10305420. Changes of measures of obesity were measured before and at the end of the treatment. Twenty out of 57 subjects were strong responders and lost 7.38 ± 1.74 compared to 2.11 ± 2.17 kg lost in poor responders. Carriers of at least one polymorphic rs10305420 allele had poor treatment response compared to carriers of two wild type alleles (OR = 0.27, 95 % CI = 0.09–0.85, P = 0.025). Carriers of at least one polymorphic rs6923761 allele tended to have stronger treatment response compared to carriers of two wild type alleles (OR = 3.06, 95 % CI = 0.96–9.74, P = 0.058). Fasting glucose and glucose after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) comparably decreased in both groups when compared to baseline, whereas no within treatment differences were found in androgen profile. Gastrointestinal adverse events were transit and balanced between strong and poor responders. GLP-1R rs10305420 polymorphism explained some of the inter-individual differences in response to liraglutide regarding weight loss in obese PCOS women.
