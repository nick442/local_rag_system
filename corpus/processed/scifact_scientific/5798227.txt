SOCS1/JAB is a negative regulator of LPS-induced macrophage activation.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers innate immune responses through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. We show here that the suppressor of cytokine-signaling-1 (SOCS1/JAB) is rapidly induced by LPS and negatively regulates LPS signaling. SOCS1(+/-) mice or SOCS1(-/-) mice with interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-deficient background were more sensitive to LPS-induced lethal effects than were wild-type littermates. LPS-induced NO(2)(-) synthesis and TNFalpha production were augmented in SOCS1(-/-) macrophages. Furthermore, LPS tolerance, a protection mechanism against endotoxin shock, was also strikingly reduced in SOCS1(-/-) cells. LPS-induced I-kappaB and p38 phosphorylation was upregulated in SOCS1(-/-) macrophages, and forced expression of SOCS1 suppressed LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation. Thus, SOCS1 directly suppresses TLR4 signaling and modulates innate immunity.
