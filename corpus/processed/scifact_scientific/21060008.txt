Celiac disease screening by immunochromatographic visual assays: results of a multicenter study.

OBJECTIVE To assay the efficiency for celiac disease (CD) screening of 2 immunochromatographic visual stick assays based on human recombinant tissue transglutaminase (tTG). One was the antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (AtTGA) stick for IgA/G antibodies to tTG detection, the other was the AtTGA/antigliadin antibodies (AGA) stick for IgA antibodies for tTG and/or gliadins. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a prospective multicenter study, 4 pediatric gastroenterology units from Spain and 2 from Latin America enrolled 72 control children with a normal small bowel mucosa and 113 untreated patients with CD with Marsh type 3 lesions. RESULTS Evaluation of results by the gastroenterologists and by 2 independent observers at the coordination center showed a remarkably low interobserver variability. For the AtTGA stick, sensitivity was 96.5% and specificity was 98.6%. The AtTGA/AGA stick displayed a sensitivity of 94.5% and a specificity of 98.6% for AtTGA and a sensitivity of 63.1% and a specificity of 95.2% for AGA. The highest efficiency and positive likelihood ratio was obtained for the AtTGA stick, higher than for IgA AtTGA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One additional advantage was that previous investigation of total serum IgA levels could be eluded. The IgA AtTGA/AGA stick, with an efficiency of 95.1%, compared with 89.2% when the combined results of the 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were considered, turned out to be an excellent diagnostic tool for infants with no IgA deficiency. CONCLUSION These 2 assays are extremely efficient for CD screening, by combining a high diagnostic accuracy with the simplicity and rapidity of visual methods.
