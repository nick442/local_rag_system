A simple two-step protocol for the purification of human pancreatic beta cells

Isolated pure human beta cells would be helpful for a number of research purposes. However, lack of beta cell-specific surface antigens has been a major problem. We aimed to develop a simple method for human beta cell isolation based on the initial elimination of ductal cells by their expression of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), followed by positive selection of beta cells by their expression of polysialic acidâ€“neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM). Cell type-specific expression of CA19-9, NCAM and PSA-NCAM was studied in sections of adult human pancreas and in cultured primary endocrine and exocrine cells. Dispersed human islet cells were purified in two steps, after 4 days of suspension culture, by binding to magnetic microbeads coupled to antibodies against CA19-9 and PSA-NCAM. NCAM expression was detected in ducts and islets in the human pancreas. In contrast, PSA-NCAM immunoreactivity was detected only in islets. PSA-NCAM staining in dispersed cells revealed that the marker is expressed in all endocrine cell types, but not in duct cells. Purification of dispersed islet cells using PSA-NCAM microbeads alone did not completely eliminate contaminating duct cells. However, elimination of the duct cells by CA19-9 microbeads followed by positive sorting of the PSA-NCAM-positive cells in five consecutive islet preparations resulted in 90 to 98% pure endocrine cells, of which 89 to 97% were beta cells. We describe a simple and reproducible method for purification of viable human pancreatic beta cells devoid of exocrine acini and ducts.
