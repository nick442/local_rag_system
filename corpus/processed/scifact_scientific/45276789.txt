Extravasation injuries on regional neonatal units.

This survey of regional neonatal intensive care units determined a prevalence of 38 per 1000 neonates who sustained an extravasation injury that caused skin necrosis. Most injuries occurred in infants of 26 weeks gestation or less, with parenteral nutrition infused through intravenous cannulae. Common treatments were exposing wounds to the air, infiltration with hyaluronidase and saline, and occlusive dressings.
