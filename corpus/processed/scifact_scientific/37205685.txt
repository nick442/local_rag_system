Spread of chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum.

Malaria resistant to chloroquine has now been confirmed in more than 40 countries. The drug was introduced in 1934, but was not in large-scale use until the early 1950s. Anecdotal reports suggest that resistance emerged as early as 1957 both in Colombia and along the then Cambodia-Thailand border area. But by 1960, resistance in these areas was confirmed - and may represent two separate events. Resistance spread rapidly, with a new focus of resistance confirmed in East Africa by 1977. Chloroquine resistance represents a severe problem both for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria. In this aricle, David Payne traces the spread of resistance and discusses some of its implications.
