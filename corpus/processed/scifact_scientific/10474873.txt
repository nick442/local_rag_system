Recovery of visual response of injured adult rat optic nerves treated with transglutaminase.

Failure of axons of the central nervous system in adult mammals to regenerate spontaneously after injury is attributed in part to inhibitory molecules associated with oligodendrocytes. Regeneration of central nervous system axons in fish is correlated with the presence of a transglutaminase. This enzyme dimerizes interleukin-2, and the product is cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes in vitro. Application of this nerve-derived transglutaminase to rat optic nerves, in which the injury had caused the loss of visual evoked potential response to light, promoted the recovery of that response within 6 weeks after injury. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the concomitant appearance of axons in the distal stump of the optic nerve.
