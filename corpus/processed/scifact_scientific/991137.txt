The descent of memory T-cell subsets

The immune system has evolved by continuously increasing its complexity to provide the host with an advantage over infectious agents. The development of immunological memory engenders long-lasting protection and lengthens the lifespan of the host. The generation of subsets of memory T cells with distinct homing and functional properties increases our defensive capabilities. However, the developmental relationship of memory T-cell subsets is a matter of debate. In this Opinion article, in light of recent developments, we suggest that it is probable that two distinct lineages comprise the memory CD8+ T-cell population generated in response to infection.
