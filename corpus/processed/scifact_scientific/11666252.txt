Maintaining the norm: T-cell homeostasis

The persistence of naive and memory T cells has long been of interest to immunologists, but the factors that influence the survival and homeostasis of these subsets have remained obscure. In recent years, it has become evident that the homeostasis of both naive and memory T-cell pools is highly dynamic and tightly regulated by internal stimuli, including cytokines and self-peptideâ€“MHC ligands for the T-cell receptor. These homeostatic mechanisms might have a vital influence on the capacity of the T-cell pool to respond to both foreign and self-antigens.
