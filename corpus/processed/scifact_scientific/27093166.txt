Ketamine reduces LPS-induced HMGB1 via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and NF-κB suppression.

BACKGROUND Ketamine, as an anesthetic agent, has an anti-inflammatory effect. In the present study, we investigated whether ketamine inhibits release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a late-phase cytokine of sepsis, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages through heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction. METHODS Macrophages were preincubated with various concentrations of ketamine and then treated with LPS (1 μg/mL). The cell culture supernatants were collected to measure inflammatory mediators (HMGB1, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin 1β) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, HO-1 protein expression, the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α, and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 were tested by Western blot analysis. In addition, to further identify the role of HO-1 in this process, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), an HO-1 inhibitor, was used. RESULTS Ketamine treatment dose-dependently attenuated the increased levels of proinflammatory mediators (HMGB1, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 1β) and increased the HO-1 protein expression in LPS-activated macrophages. Furthermore, ketamine suppressed the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α as well as the LPS-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in macrophages. In addition, the present study also demonstrated that ketamine induced HO-1 expression through the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 in macrophages. The effects of ketamine on LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines production were partially reversed by the HO inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (SnPP). CONCLUSION Ketamine inhibits the release of HMGB1 in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and this effect is at least partly mediated by the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and NF-κB suppression.
