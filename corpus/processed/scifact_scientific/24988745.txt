Unmet needs mediate the relationship between symptoms and quality of life in breast cancer survivors

This study aimed to compare the symptoms, unmet needs, and QoL reported by women at 6 months to <2 years and 2 to 5 years following surgery and adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. It also evaluated the relationships among symptoms, unmet needs, and QoL using structural equation modeling. In this study, 113 and 137 survivors following breast cancer treatment 6 months to <2 years and 2 to 5 years, respectively, completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, the Supportive Care Needs Survey-34, and the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form Health Survey version 2.0 during their medical follow-up. The mean numbers of symptoms and unmet needs were 5.43 and 3.0, respectively, for survivors at <2 years, and 5.24 and 2.42, respectively, for survivors at 2 to 5 years following treatment. The most common reported symptoms were related primarily to physical domains. No significant differences were found between the two survivor groups on the MSAS scores. Survivors at <2 years reported significantly higher scores in Psychological and Health Care System/Information needs (p < 0.01), and lower composite scores in physical and mental QoL (p < 0.05) than those at 2 to 5 years post-treatment. Significant direct and indirect effects were found of symptom burden through unmet needs on survivors’ physical and mental QoL after adjustment for survival time, and the models showed a good fit. Results suggest that breast cancer survivors continue to endure many symptoms independent of the survivorship period. The unmet needs mediate the relationship between symptom burden and survivors’ QoL.
