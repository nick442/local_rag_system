Insertional mutagenesis in gene therapy and stem cell biology.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Recent preclinical and clinical studies revealed that the semirandom insertion of transgenes into chromosomal DNA of hematopoietic cells may induce clonal competition, which potentially may even trigger leukemia or sarcoma. Insertional mutagenesis caused by gene vectors has thus led to major uncertainty among those developing advanced hematopoietic cell therapies. This review summarizes novel studies of underlying mechanisms; these studies have demonstrated the possibility of improved gene vector biosafety and generated new insights into stem cell biology. RECENT FINDINGS The characteristic insertion pattern of various retroviral gene vector systems may be explained by properties of the viral integrase and associated cellular cofactors. Cell culture assays and animal models, including disease-specific and cancer-prone mouse models, are emerging that reveal the contributions of vector features and systemic factors to induction of clonal imbalance. Databases summarizing vector insertion sites in dominant hematopoietic clones are evolving as new tools to identify genes that regulate clonal homeostasis. SUMMARY Mechanistic studies of insertional mutagenesis by random gene vector insertion will lead to improved tools for advanced hematopoietic cell therapy. Simultaneously, fascinating insights into gene networks that regulate cell fitness will be generated, with important consequences for the fields of hematology, oncology and regenerative medicine.
