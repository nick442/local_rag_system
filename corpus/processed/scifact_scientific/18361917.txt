Expression profiles during dedifferentiation in newt lens regeneration revealed by expressed sequence tags

PURPOSE The adult newt can regenerate lens from pigmented epithelial cells (PECs) of the dorsal iris via dedifferentiation. The purpose of this research is to obtain sequence resources for a newt lens regeneration study and to obtain insights of dedifferentiation at the molecular level. METHODS mRNA was purified from iris during dedifferentiation and its cDNA library was constructed. From the cDNA library 10,449 clones were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS From 10,449 reads, 780 contigs and 1,666 singlets were annotated. The presence of several cancer- and apoptosis-related genes during newt dedifferentiation was revealed. Moreover, several candidate genes, which might participate in reprogramming during dedifferentiation, were also found. CONCLUSIONS The expression of cancer- and apoptosis-related genes could be hallmarks during dedifferentiation. The expression sequence tag (EST) resource is useful for the future study of newt dedifferentiation, and the sequence information is available in GenBank (accession numbers; FS290155-FS300559).
