CD28 delivers a unique signal leading to the selective recruitment of RelA and p52 NF-kappaB subunits on IL-8 and Bcl-xL gene promoters.

CD28 is one of the most important costimulatory receptors necessary for full T lymphocyte activation. The CD28 receptor can enhance T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signals, as well as deliver independent signals. Indeed, CD28 engagement by B7 can generate TCR-independent signals leading to IkappaB kinase and NF-kappaB activation. Here we demonstrate that the TCR-independent CD28 signal leads to the selective transcription of survival (Bcl-xL) and inflammatory (IL-8 and B cell activation factor, but not proliferative (IL-2), genes, in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner. CD28-stimulated T cells actively secrete IL-8, and Bcl-xL up-regulation protects T cells from radiation-induced apoptosis. The transcription of CD28-induced genes is mediated by the specific recruitment of RelA and p52 NF-kappaB subunits to target promoters. In contrast, p50 and c-Rel, which preferentially bind NF-kappaB sites on the IL-2 gene promoter after anti-CD3 stimulation, are not involved. Thus, we identify CD28 as a key regulator of genes important for both survival and inflammation.
