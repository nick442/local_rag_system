Self-Report and Tests of Memory Aging

Memory complaints have not correlated well with tests of memory. However, given self-report questions, which tap processes of everyday remembering. sixty volunteers aged 21-84 years adequately rated their memory competence. Categorized into four memory processes, self-report and six tests of verbal, faces, story and nonverbal auditory, visual, and tactual memory ,were canonically correlated (r = 0.67) and both sets of measures declined with age in parallel. Thc old were more accurate than the young in their ratings but by no means on all tests and expectation to perform poorly seemed to have influenced some performances.
