Regulation of poly(A) site choice of several yeast mRNAs

Several yeast genes produce multiple transcripts with different 3'-ends. Of these, four genes are known to produce truncated transcripts that end within the coding sequence of longer transcripts: CBP1 , AEP2 / ATP13 , RNA14 and SIR1 . It has been shown that the level of the truncated CBP1 transcript increases during the switch to respiratory growth while that of the full-length transcript decreases. To determine whether this phenomenon is unique to CBP1 , northern analysis was used to determine whether the levels of other truncated transcripts are regulated similarly by carbon source. The levels of the shortest transcripts of AEP2 / ATP13 and RNA14 increased during respiration while the shortest SIR1 transcript remained constant. However, two longer SIR1 transcripts were regulated reciprocally by carbon source. Mapping the 3'-ends of each transcript by sequencing partial cDNA clones revealed multiple 3'-ends for each transcript. Examination of the sequences surrounding the 3'-ends of the induced transcripts failed to identify a consensus sequence but did reveal weak putative 3'-end formation signals in all of the transcripts. Similarly, no consensus sequence was found when the sequences surrounding the 3'-ends of the longest transcripts were compared, but again weak putative 3'-end formation signals were identified. These data are suggestive of carbon source regulation of alternative poly(A) site choice in yeast.
