TatC is a specificity determinant for protein secretion via the twin-arginine translocation pathway.

The recent discovery of a ubiquitous translocation pathway, specifically required for proteins with a twin-arginine motif in their signal peptide, has focused interest on its membrane-bound components, one of which is known as TatC. Unlike most organisms of which the genome has been sequenced completely, the Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus subtilis contains two tatC-like genes denoted tatCd and tatCy. The corresponding TatCd and TatCy proteins have the potential to be involved in the translocation of 27 proteins with putative twin-arginine signal peptides of which approximately 6-14 are likely to be secreted into the growth medium. Using a proteomic approach, we show that PhoD of B. subtilis, a phosphodiesterase belonging to a novel protein family of which all known members are synthesized with typical twin-arginine signal peptides, is secreted via the twin-arginine translocation pathway. Strikingly, TatCd is of major importance for the secretion of PhoD, whereas TatCy is not required for this process. Thus, TatC appears to be a specificity determinant for protein secretion via the Tat pathway. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that the TatC-determined pathway specificity is based on specific interactions between TatC-like proteins and other pathway components, such as TatA, of which three paralogues are present in B. subtilis.
