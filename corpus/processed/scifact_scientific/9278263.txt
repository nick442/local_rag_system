MHC class I antigen presentation: learning from viral evasion strategies

The cell surface display of peptides by MHC class I molecules to lymphocytes provides the host with an important surveillance mechanism to protect against invading pathogens. However, in turn, viruses have evolved elegant strategies to inhibit various stages of the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway and prevent the display of viral peptides. This Review highlights how the elucidation of mechanisms of viral immune evasion is important for advancing our understanding of virusâ€“host interactions and can further our knowledge of the MHC class I presentation pathway as well as other cellular pathways.
