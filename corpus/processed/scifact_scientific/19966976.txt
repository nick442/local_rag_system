Dynamic regulation of heterochromatin function via phosphorylation of HP1-family proteins.

Heterochromatin is characterized by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, which is recognized by well-conserved HP1-family proteins. Heterochromatin participates in various chromosome functions, which include transcriptional gene silencing and sister-chromatid cohesion. These heterochromatic functions are carried out by various effector proteins that associate with HP1-family proteins; however, the regulation of this association with the effectors is not well understood. Recently, we showed that phosphorylation of the fission-yeast HP1 homolog Swi6 regulates the association of the transcriptional regulators differentially and changes the transcriptional activity of heterochromatin, without affecting sister-chromatid cohesion. This study, together with another study performed using other systems, indicates that phosphorylation of HP1/Swi6 provides a dynamic pathway for the differential regulation of heterochromatin in response to inter- and intracellular signals.
