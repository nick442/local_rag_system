Involvement of sympathetic nervous system and brown fat in endotoxin-induced fever in rats.

The object of this study was to assess the role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the sympathetic nervous system in the rise in heat production associated with endotoxin-induced fever. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was found to be significantly increased (28%) over a 4-h period after two doses of endotoxin (Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 0.3 mg/100 g body wt) given 24 h apart. Injection of a mixed beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol) reduced VO2 by 14% in endotoxin-treated rats, whereas the selective beta 1- (atenolol) or beta 2- (ICI 118551) antagonists suppressed VO2 by 10%. These drugs did not affect VO2 in control animals. BAT thermogenic activity assessed from measurements of in vitro mitochondrial guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) binding was elevated by 54% in interscapular BAT and by 171% in other BAT depots. Surgical denervation of one lobe of the interscapular depot prevented these responses. Endotoxin failed to stimulate GDP binding in rats fed protein-deficient diets. This may have been because BAT thermogenic activity was already elevated in control rats fed these diets or because endotoxin caused a marked suppression of food intake in the protein-deficient animals. The results indicate that sympathetic activation of BAT is involved in the thermogenic responses to endotoxin and that these can be modified by dietary manipulation.
