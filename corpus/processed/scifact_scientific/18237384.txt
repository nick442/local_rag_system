Inducing Tumor Immunity through the Selective Engagement of Activating Fcγ Receptors on Dendritic Cells

Induction of tumor-specific immunity requires that dendritic cells (DCs) efficiently capture and present tumor antigens to result in the expansion and activation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. The transition from antigen capture to T cell stimulation requires a maturation signal; in its absence tolerance, rather than immunity may develop. While immune complexes (ICs) are able to enhance antigen capture, they can be poor at inducing DC maturation, naive T cell activation and protective immunity. We now demonstrate that interfering with the inhibitory signal delivered by FcγRIIB on DCs converts ICs to potent maturation agents and results in T cell activation. Applying this approach to immunization with DCs pulsed ex-vivo with ICs, we have generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo and achieved efficient protective immunity in a murine melanoma model. These data imply that ICs may normally function to maintain tolerance through the binding to inhibitory FcγRs on DCs, but they can be converted to potent immunogenic stimuli by selective engagement of activating FcγRs. This mechanism suggests a novel approach to the development of tumor vaccines.
