Toll-like receptor 4 gene Asp299Gly polymorphism in myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of 15,148 subjects.

It remains controversial regarding the association between toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene Asp299Gly (+896 A/G) polymorphism and myocardial infarction (MI) risk. Thus, a large-scale meta-analysis evaluating the potential association between this gene variant and MI risk is required. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CBMdisc, CNKI, and Google Scholar were searched until February 6, 2013. All the statistical tests were performed using Stata 11.0. Nine articles involving 10 studies were included in the final meta-analysis, covering a total of 8299 MI cases and 6849 controls. Overall, no significant association was found between the TLR4 gene Asp299Gly polymorphism and MI risk (G allele vs. A allele: OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.74-1.22, p=0.71; G/G vs. A/A: OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.54-1.98, p=0.93; G/G vs. A/G+A/A: OR=1.05, 95% CI=0.55-2.03, p=0.87; G/G+A/G vs. A/A: OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.75-1.13, p=0.42). In the subgroup analysis based on source of controls, there was also lack of evidence for significant association between the TLR4 gene Asp299Gly polymorphism and MI risk. In summary, the present meta-analysis indicated that the TLR4 gene Asp299Gly polymorphism was not associated with MI risk.
