Subgrouping of patients with neuropathic pain according to pain-related sensory abnormalities: a first step to a stratified treatment approach.

BACKGROUND Patients with neuropathic pain present with various pain-related sensory abnormalities. These sensory features form different patterns or mosaics-the sensory profile-in individual patients. One hypothesis for the development of sensory profiles is that distinct pathophysiological mechanisms of pain generation produce specific sensory abnormalities. Several controlled trials of promising new drugs have produced negative results, but these findings could have been a result of heterogeneity in the patient population. Subgrouping patients on the basis of individual sensory profiles could reduce this heterogeneity and improve trial design. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS A statistical categorisation of patients with neuropathic pain showed that subgroups of patients with distinct sensory profiles who perceive their pain differently do exist across a range of neuropathic disorders, although some distinct disorder-specific profiles were also detected. Results of the first clinical trials to use the subgroup approach at baseline could show a superior effect of the study drugs in specific subgroups, rather than in the entire cohort of patients. WHERE NEXT?: A new classification of neuropathic pain should take into account subgroups of patients with different sensory profiles. Sensory phenotyping has the potential to improve clinical trial design by enriching the study population with potential treatment responders, and might lead to a stratified treatment approach and ultimately to personalised treatment.
