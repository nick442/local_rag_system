Economic impact of primary open-angle glaucoma in Australia.

BACKGROUND Glaucoma is the World's leading cause of irreversible blindness, and poses serious public health and economic concerns. DESIGN Review. SAMPLES Published randomized trials and population-based studies since 1985. METHODS We report the economic impact of primary open-angle glaucoma and model the effect of changes in detection rates and management strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The cost-effectiveness of different interventions to prevent vision loss from primary open-angle glaucoma was measured in terms of financial cost (Australian dollars) and disability-adjusted life years. RESULTS The prevalence of glaucoma in Australia is expected to increase from 208 000 in 2005 to 379 000 in 2025 because of the aging population. Health system costs over the same time period are estimated to increase from $AU355 million to $AU784 million. Total costs (health system costs, indirect costs and costs of loss of well-being) will increase from $AU1.9 billion to $AU4.3 billion in Australia. CONCLUSION Primary open-angle glaucoma poses a significant economic burden, which will increase substantially by 2025. This dynamic model provides a valuable tool for ongoing policy formulation and determining the economic impact of interventions to better prevent visual impairment and blindness from glaucoma.
