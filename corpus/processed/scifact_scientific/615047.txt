Fission yeast and other yeasts as emergent models to unravel cellular aging in eukaryotes.

In the past years, simple organisms such as yeasts and worms have contributed a great deal to aging research. Studies pioneered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were useful to elucidate a significant number of molecular mechanisms underlying cellular aging and to discover novel longevity genes. Importantly, these genes proved many times to be conserved in multicellular eukaryotes. Consequently, such discovery approaches are being extended to other yeast models, such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. In fission yeast, researchers have found links between asymmetrical cell division and nutrient signaling pathways with aging. In this review, we discuss the state of knowledge on the mechanisms controlling both replicative and chronological aging in S pombe and the other emergent yeast models.
