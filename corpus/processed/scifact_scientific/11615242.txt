Effect of a C/EBP gene replacement on mitochondrial biogenesis in fat cells.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta, are required for fat cell differentiation and maturation. Previous studies showed that replacement of C/EBPalpha with C/EBPbeta, generating the beta/beta alleles in the mouse genome, prevents lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, beta/beta mice lived longer and had higher energy expenditure than their control littermates due to increased WAT energy oxidation. The WAT of beta/beta mice was enriched with metabolically active, thermogenic mitochondria known for energy burning. The beta/beta allele exerted its effect through the elevated expression of the G protein alpha stimulatory subunit (Galphas) in WAT. Galphas, when overexpressed in fat-laden 3T3-L1 cells, stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis similar to that seen in the WAT of beta/beta mice, and effectively diminished the stored lipid pool.
