Thymic expression of the golli-myelin basic protein gene in the SJL/J mouse

The T cell antigen-specific repertoire is thought to be shaped by thymic expression of self molecules. Since a myelin basic protein (MBP)-like gene (golli-MBP) has been reported to be expressed by cells of the immune system, the present study was undertaken to determine whether the golli-MBP gene was expressed in the mouse thymus and, if so, to characterize transcripts of this gene in this organ. Using exon-specific primers for MBP and golli-MBP, cDNA from thymus and other tissues was amplified, and the amplified products analyzed by Southern blotting with exon-specific oligonucleotide probes. The amplified products were subcloned, and the inserts characterized by DNA sequencing. The thymic transcripts were found to contain golli-MBP exons 1, 2, 3, 5A, 5B, 5C, 6, 7, 8, and 11.
