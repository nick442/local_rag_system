Stage-Specific and Differential Notch Dependency at the αβ and γδ T Lineage Bifurcation

Summary Signals transduced by Notch receptors are indispensable for T cell specification and differentiation of αβ T lineage cells. However, the role of Notch signals during αβ versus γδ T lineage decision remains controversial. Here, we addressed this question by employing a clonal analysis of CD4 − CD8 − (DN) progenitor potential to position the divergence of αβ and γδ T cell lineages to the late DN2 to DN3 developmental stages. Accordingly, αβ and γδ precursor frequencies within these T cell progenitor subsets were determined, both in the presence and absence of Notch signaling through Delta-like 1. Notch signals were found to be critical for the DN to CD4 + CD8 + (DP) transition, irrespective of the identity (pTαβ or γδ) of the inducing T cell receptor complex, whereas γδ T cells developed from γδTCR-expressing T cell progenitors in the absence of further Notch ligand interaction. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a differential, stage-specific requirement for Notch receptor-ligand interactions in the differentiation of αβ and γδ T cells from T cell progenitors.
