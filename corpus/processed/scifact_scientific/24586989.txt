Role of beta adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in heart failure: systematic review and meta-analysis.

Heart Failure (HF) is a common disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. beta adrenergic receptors (betaAR) are the primary pathway through which cardiac function is influenced. Chronic beta(1)AR activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of HF and betaAR blockade improves survival in left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Common functional polymorphisms in beta adrenergic receptor genes (ADRB) have been associated with HF phenotypes, and with pharmacogenetic interaction with beta adrenergic receptor blockers (beta blockers). However, these associations have not been consistently replicated. The evidence for ADRB variant involvement in pathogenesis, progression and response to beta blockers in HF is reviewed. In addition, a meta-analysis of three studies analysing the effect of ADRB1 Arg389Gly polymorphism on left ventricular remodelling with the use of beta blockers, demonstrating a 5% improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction in Arg389 homozygotes, is presented. There is now accumulating molecular evidence for a different functional response to beta blockers associated with this polymorphism. In the future, confirmed genotypic associations may enable patients to be identified who are either at greater risk of developing HF, whose HF may rapidly progress, or who are unlikely to benefit from beta blockers, and such patients may benefit from targeted aggressive therapy.
