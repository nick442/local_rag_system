Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the epitope vaccine CTB-UA against Helicobacter pylori infection in a BALB/c mice model

Epitope vaccine based on the enzyme urease of Helicobacter pylori is a promising option for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination against H. pylori infection. In our previous study, the epitope vaccine CTB-UA, which was composed of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and an epitope (UreA183â€“203) from the H. pylori urease A subunit (UreA) was constructed. This particular vaccine was shown to have good immunogenicity and immunoreactivity and could induce specific neutralizing antibodies, which exhibited effectively inhibitory effects on the enzymatic activity of H. pylori urease. In this study, the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the epitope vaccine CTB-UA was evaluated in a BALB/c mice model. The experimental results indicated that oral prophylactic or therapeutic immunization with CTB-UA significantly decreased H. pylori colonization compared with oral immunization with PBS. The results also revealed that the protection was correlated with antigen-specific IgG, IgA, and mucosal secretory IgA antibody responses. CTB-UA may be a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.
