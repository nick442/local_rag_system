Comparing the metabolism of quercetin in rats, mice and gerbils

Several species of rodents are used to investigate the metabolism of quercetin in vivo. However, it is unclear whether they are a proper animal model. Thus, we compared the metabolism of quercetin in Wistar rats (rats), Balb/c mice (mice) and Mongolian gerbils (gerbils). We determined the levels of quercetin metabolites, quercetin-3-glucuronide (Q3G), quercetin-3′-sulfate (Q3′S) and methyl-quercetin isorhamnetin (IH), in the plasma, lungs and livers of three species of animals by high-performance liquid chromatography after acute and/or chronic quercetin administration. The metabolic enzyme activities in the intestinal mucosal membrane and liver were also investigated. First, we found that after acute quercetin administration, the Q3′S level was the highest in gerbils. However, after long-term supplementation (20 weeks), Q3G was the dominant metabolite in the plasma, lungs and livers followed by IH and Q3′S in all animals, although the gerbils still had a higher Q3′S conversion ratio. The average concentrations of total quercetin concentration in the plasma of gerbils were the highest in both short- and long-term studies. The activities of uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase, phenolsulfotransferase and catechol-O-methyltransferase were induced by quercetin in a dose- and tissue-dependent manner in all animals. Taken together, in general, after long-term supplementation the metabolism of quercetin is similar in all animals and is comparable to that of humans. However, the accumulation of quercetin and Q3′S conversion ratio in gerbils are higher than those in the other animals.
