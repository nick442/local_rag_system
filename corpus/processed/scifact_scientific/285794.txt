Quantitative Detection of Hepatitis C Virus RNA by Light Cycler PCR and Comparison with Two Different PCR Assays

The new Light Cycler technology was adapted to the detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in clinical samples. Sera from 81 patients were tested by Light Cycler PCR, AMPLICOR HCV Monitor assay, and in-house PCR. Our data demonstrate that Light Cycler is a fast and reliable method for the detection and quantitation of HCV RNA.
