Differences in the Clinical Effects of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers: A Critical Review of the Evidence

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a major role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and closely related cardio- and cerebrovascular events. Although both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs) are equally important in the treatment of hypertension, according to the results of recent years, there might be substantial differences in their cardiovascular protective effects, and these differences might be explained by our increasing knowledge of their non-overlapping mechanisms of action. The number of studies investigating how ACE inhibitors and ARB agents differ will certainly be increasing in the future. ACE inhibitors are the safe therapeutic opportunity for hypertensive patients at high risk, with a cardiological comorbidity.
