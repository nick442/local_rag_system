Expression of basal cell keratin 15 and keratin 19 in oral squamous neoplasms represents diverse pathophysiologies.

Human epithelium contains keratin, which is expressed during differentiation. Depending on the target cell type, different types of keratin are expressed, and their alterations seem to represent changes in cell properties. The basal cells of oral epithelium express keratin 5 (K5), K14, K15 and K19, but their alterations in tumors are unclear. To address this issue and to seek possible diagnostic application, we examined the expression of these keratins in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and squamous intraepithelial neoplasm (SIN). cDNA microarray analysis of 43 OSCC revealed slight upregulation of KRT14, downregulation of KRT15 and KRT19, and unaltered KRT5 expression. There were great variations in KRT15 and KRT19 expression across each cancer. Well-differentiated OSCC tended to express more KRT15 and less KRT19 compared to moderately- or poorly-differentiated OSCC. KRT15 was positively correlated with differentiation-related keratin, KRT13. These observations were further investigated by immunohistochemical examination. K5 and K14 were ubiquitously expressed in all 50 OSCC and 50 SIN examined. K15 and K19 were generally downregulated, but were considerably retained in about half of the cases and showed diverse expression patterns. K15-positive cancers tended to show a well-differentiated phenotype, and K19-positive cancers tended to show more invasive tumor fronts. Most K19-positive cancers appeared to develop with little associating SIN. K19 was consistently downregulated in SIN, while K15 was downregulated mainly in high grade SIN. In summary, K15 and K19, unlike K5 or K14, are expressed variably in both SIN and OSCC, which reflects the differences in their pathogenesis and biological behaviors, suggesting their prospective applications as markers for subclassifying OSCC and SIN.
