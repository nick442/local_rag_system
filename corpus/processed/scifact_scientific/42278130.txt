Unmet need for personal assistance with activities of daily living among older adults.

PURPOSE This study examined the prevalence, correlates, and negative consequences of unmet need for personal assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) among older adults. DESIGN AND METHODS The authors analyzed cross-sectional data from the 1994 National Health Interview Survey's Supplement on Aging. Data were weighted to be representative of the noninstitutionalized population aged 70 years and older. RESULTS Overall, 20.7% of those needing help to perform 1 or more ADLs (an estimated 629,000 persons) reported receiving inadequate assistance; for individual ADLs, the prevalence of unmet need ranged from 10.2% (eating) to 20.1% (transferring). The likelihood of having 1 or more unmet needs was associated with lower household income, multiple ADL difficulties, and living alone. Nearly half of those with unmet needs reported experiencing a negative consequence (e.g., unable to eat when hungry) as a result of their unmet need. IMPLICATIONS Greater, targeted efforts are needed to reduce the prevalence and consequences of unmet need for ADL assistance in elderly persons.
