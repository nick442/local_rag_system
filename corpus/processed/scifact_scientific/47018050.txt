CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing induces a p53-mediated DNA damage response

Here, we report that genome editing by CRISPR–Cas9 induces a p53-mediated DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest in immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells, leading to a selection against cells with a functional p53 pathway. Inhibition of p53 prevents the damage response and increases the rate of homologous recombination from a donor template. These results suggest that p53 inhibition may improve the efficiency of genome editing of untransformed cells and that p53 function should be monitored when developing cell-based therapies utilizing CRISPR–Cas9. CRISPR–Cas9-induced DNA damage triggers p53 to limit the efficiency of gene editing in immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells.
