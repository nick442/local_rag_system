The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex in transcription, replication and repair.

The Ino80 ATPase is a member of the SNF2 family of ATPases and functions as an integral component of a multisubunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex. Although INO80 complexes from yeast and higher eukaryotes share a common core of conserved subunits, the complexes have diverged substantially during evolution and have acquired new subunits with apparently species-specific functions. Recent studies have shown that the INO80 complex contributes to a wide variety of chromatin-dependent nuclear transactions, including transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.
