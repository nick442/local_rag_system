Neuron-specific expression of CuZnSOD prevents the loss of muscle mass and function that occurs in homozygous CuZnSOD-knockout mice.

Deletion of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in Sod1(-/-) mice leads to accelerated loss of muscle mass and force during aging, but the losses do not occur with muscle-specific deletion of CuZnSOD. To determine the role of motor neurons in the muscle decline, we generated transgenic Sod1(-/-) mice in which CuZnSOD was expressed under control of the synapsin 1 promoter (SynTgSod1(-/-) mice). SynTgSod1(-/-) mice expressed CuZnSOD in brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve, but not in other tissues. Sciatic nerve CuZnSOD content in SynTgSod1(-/-) mice was ~20% that of control mice, but no reduction in muscle mass or isometric force was observed in SynTgSod1(-/-) mice compared with control animals, whereas muscles of age-matched Sod1(-/-) mice displayed 30-40% reductions in mass and force. In addition, increased oxidative damage and adaptations in stress responses observed in muscles of Sod1(-/-) mice were absent in SynTgSod1(-/-) mice, and degeneration of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) structure and function occurred in Sod1(-/-) mice but not in SynTgSod1(-/-) mice. Our data demonstrate that specific CuZnSOD expression in neurons is sufficient to preserve NMJ and skeletal muscle structure and function in Sod1(-/-) mice and suggest that redox homeostasis in motor neurons plays a key role in initiating sarcopenia during aging.
