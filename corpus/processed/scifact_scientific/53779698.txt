Exercise as a therapeutic approach to improve blood pressure in patients with peripheral arterial disease: current literature and future directions.

INTRODUCTION Patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) exhibit reduced functional capacity and increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Although exercise has been a cornerstone for clinical treatment to improve walking capacity in patients with symptomatic PAD, its effects on cardiovascular parameters have been poorly explored. Areas covered: This review examines the role of exercise in improving blood pressure in patients with symptomatic PAD and summarizes the current evidence on the acute (single bout of exercise) and chronic effects of walking and resistance exercise on blood pressure and its determinants. Expert commentary: In patients with symptomatic PAD, exercise promotes acute and chronic reductions in blood pressure. These effects were observed particularly after walking and resistance exercise. Future studies are necessary to investigate the effects of other exercise modalities, especially non-painful exercises, on cardiovascular function in patients with symptomatic PAD.
