Dominance relationships between S-alleles in self-incompatible Brassica campestris L.

Dominance relationships were studied for 249 out of 276 possible pair-wise combinations between 24 S-alleles of Brassica campestris that had been isolated from two natural populations from Turkey and Japan. Each F1 hybrid was test-crossed reciprocally against its respective parental S-homozygotes to determine the dominance relationships between the pair of S-alleles it contained. The 24 S-alleles were classified into two groups on the stigma side and three groups on the pollen side. In the stigma, codominance occurred frequently, and dominance or recessiveness seemed to appear according to the combination of S-alleles. In the pollen, codominance was less frequent, and there seemed to be a certain hierarchy of the dominance relationships as a whole, although dominance appeared with certain specific combinations of S-alleles. Interactions among 24 S-alleles were different in the stigma and in the pollen. Independent weakening of S-alleles was found between 20 pairs in the pollen, but only two in the stigma. This interaction seems to be correlated with recessiveness of S-alleles.
