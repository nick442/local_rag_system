Gastropathies in the Lundehund

The mucin profiles of the gastric mucosa in Lundehunds suffering from intestinal lymphangiectasia were examined and compared to the mucin profiles in control dogs from other breeds. A previous study performed on this material had shown that all examined Lundehunds had gastritis and about 30% had gastric carcinoma. Neutral and acid mucins were identified using the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (pH 2.5) periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) methods. The acid mucins were divided into sialomucins and sulfomucins based on their reaction with high-iron diamine Alcian blue, pH 2.5 (HID-AB). In Lundehunds with chronic atrophic gastritis in the fundic and body regions the surface and foveolar epithelium showed a predominantly normal mucin profile although some Lundehunds had a reduced mucin content. The mucous neck cells extended from below the gastric foveolae towards the muscularis mucosae. Morphometric examination showed that the abnormal presence of mucous neck cells occupied 41% of the height of the gastric mucosa in Lundehunds compared to only 19% in the control dogs (p<0.05). Of the four Lundehunds with gastric carcinoma, two possessed neoplastic cells that contained minimal or no mucins. The amount and type of mucin in the neoplastic cells of the remaining two Lundehunds varied both between individuals and within a neoplasm. This study shows that the abnormal presence of mucous neck cells and the associated pseudopyloric metaplasia comprised the predominant changes in the gastric mucin profiles of Lundehunds.
