c-Src and cooperating partners in human cancer.

The proto-oncogene c-src is rarely mutated in human cancers, and when overexpressed in normal cells is non- or weakly oncogenic. These observations have raised doubts about the involvement of c-src in the etiology of human tumors. However, recent studies have shown that c-Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, exhibits elevated protein levels and activity in numerous types of human cancers. Furthermore, it has been found to be a critical component of multiple signaling pathways that regulate proliferation, survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Because of its important role in these oncogenic processes, it represents a therapeutic target ripe for exploitation.
