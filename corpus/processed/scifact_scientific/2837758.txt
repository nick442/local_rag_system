Therapeutic efficacy of a multi-epitope vaccine against Helicobacter pylori infection in BALB/c mice model.

Epitope vaccine is a promising option for therapeutic vaccination against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. In this study, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine with five epitopes and mucosal adjuvant E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) named HUepi-LTB and evaluated its therapeutic effect against H. pylori infection in BALB/c mice model. HUepi-LTB containing three Th epitopes from UreB and two B cell epitopes from UreB and HpaA was constructed and expressed in E. coli. Oral therapeutic immunization with HUepi-LTB significantly decreased H. pylori colonization compared with oral immunization with PBS, and the protection was correlated with antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and IgG and mucosal IgA antibody responses. This multi-epitope vaccine may be a promising vaccine candidate that may help to control H. pylori infection.
