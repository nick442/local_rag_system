Measuring adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy: implications for research and practice.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has radically changed the course of HIV disease, producing substantial reductions in both HIV-related morbidity and mortality. However, the complexity of the typical daily HAART regimen is substantial, and high levels of adherence are essential for complete and long-term viral suppression and the avoidance of drug resistance. The complexity of HAART has made the assessment of medication adherence of paramount importance. Even though various methods are in use, each measures only a subset of adherence behaviors, and each measure has limited predictive validity. Given the individual and public health concerns associated with adherence to HAART, there is a need for the continued development and validation of measures of medication adherence.
