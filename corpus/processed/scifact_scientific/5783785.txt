DNA Methylation mediated down-regulating of MicroRNA-33b and its role in gastric cancer

The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) provides a new and powerful tool for studying the mechanism, diagnosis and treatment of human cancers. Currently, down-regulation of tumor suppressive miRNAs by CpG island hypermethylation is emerging as a common hallmark of cancer. Here, we reported that the down-regulation of miR-33b was associated with pM stage of gastric cancer (GC) patients. Ectopic expression of miR-33b in HGC-27 and MGC-803 cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, which might be due to miR-33b targeting oncogene c-Myc. Moreover, enhanced methylation level of the CpG island upstream of miR-33b in GC patients with down-regulated miR-33b was confirmed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) amplification. Furthermore, re-introduction of miR-33b significantly suppressed tumorigenesis of GC cells in the nude mice. In conclusion, miR-33b acts as a tumor suppressor and hypermethylation of the CpG island upstream of miR-33b is responsible for its down-regulation in gastric cancer.
