DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A MEASURE OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

This series of studies describes the development of a measure of emotional intelligence based on the model of emotional intelligence developed by Salovey and Mayer [Salovey, P. & Mayer, J. D. (1990). Emotional intelligence. Imagination, Cognition and Personality, 9, 185â€“211.]. A pool of 62 items represented the different dimensions of the model. A factor analysis of the responses of 346 participants suggested the creation of a 33-item scale. Additional studies showed the 33-item measure to have good internal consistency and testretest reliability. Validation studies showed that scores on the 33-item measure 1. (a) correlated with eight of nine theoretically related constructs, including alexithymia, attention to feelings, clarity of feelings, mood repair, optimism and impulse control; 2. (b) predicted first-year college grades; 3. (c) were significantly higher for therapists than for therapy clients or for prisoners; 4. (d) were significantly higher for females than males, consistent with prior findings in studies of emotional skills; 5. (e) were not related to cognitive ability and 6. (f) were associated with the openness to experience trait of the big five personality dimensions.
