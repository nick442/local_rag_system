A more efficient method to generate integration-free human iPS cells

We report a simple method, using p53 suppression and nontransforming L-Myc, to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with episomal plasmid vectors. We generated human iPSCs from multiple donors, including two putative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-homozygous donors who match âˆ¼20% of the Japanese population at major HLA loci; most iPSCs are integrated transgene-free. This method may provide iPSCs suitable for autologous and allologous stem-cell therapy in the future.
