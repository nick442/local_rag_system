Treatment and management of graft-versus-host disease: improving response and survival.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following allogenic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and thus the focus of much ongoing research. Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and predisposing factors for both acute and chronic forms of the disease, a standardised therapeutic strategy is still lacking. There is good evidence for initial treatment of both acute and chronic forms of the disease with corticosteroid therapy. However, the most effective approach to steroid-refractory disease remains controversial, with current practice based mainly on smaller studies and varying considerably between local institutions. Timely diagnosis, multidisciplinary working and good supportive care, including infection prophylaxis, are clearly important in optimizing response and survival in such patients. It is hoped that in the future systematic research strategies and the identification of novel therapeutic targets may improve outcome further. The following review aims to outline some of the existing options for the treatment and management of acute and chronic GVHD.
