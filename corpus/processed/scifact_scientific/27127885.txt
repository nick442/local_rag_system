An activator of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway promotes osteogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells capable of differentiating along the osteoblast, adipocyte, and chondrocyte lineages. Regulation of MSCs differentiation may be a useful tool for regenerative medicine and cell-based therapy. The discovery of small molecule that activates the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs could aid in the development of a new anabolic drug for osteoporosis treatment. We identified CW008, a derivative of pyrazole-pyridine, that stimulates osteoblast differentiation of human MSCs and increases bone formation in ovariectomized mice. CW008 promotes osteogenesis by activating cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway and inhibiting leptin secretion. These results suggest that CW008 is an agonist of cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway in osteogenic differentiation and that application of CW008 may be useful for the treatment of bone-related diseases and for the study of bone biology.
