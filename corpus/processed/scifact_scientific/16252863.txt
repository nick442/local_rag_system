Preventing coronary heart disease: B vitamins and homocysteine.

The list of preventable and reversible risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease continues to grow. Cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, elevated cholesterol, underlying lipoprotein abnormalities, lipoprotein(a), diabetes, overweight, male gender, and age are well-established risk factors. During the 1990s, there have been many reports associating elevated plasma homocysteine levels with arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease and consistent evidence that dietary and supplemental folic acid can reduce homocysteine levels.1 2 The article by Robinson and colleagues3 in this issue of Circulation presents further evidence of the importance of homocysteine and suggestive evidence that plasma folate and plasma pyrixodal-l-phosphate (vitamin B6) are protective factors. Their study is part of the European Concerted Action Project,4 which examined 750 patients younger than age 60 with diagnoses within the previous 12 months of coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease and 800 healthy control subjects. The patient groups were young (47 years for cases and 44 years for control subjects) and heterogeneous, with nonfatal clinical events or symptoms of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease supported by ECG, angiographic, or Doppler evidence; the study involved 19 centers in nine European countries. Men in the highest quintile for fasting total homocysteine (tHcy), compared with the remainder of the population, had an estimated relative risk of 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 2.9), with a striking dose-response relationship and a more-than-multiplicative interaction with cigarette smoking and high blood pressure on vascular disease risk4 ; the corresponding estimated relative risk for coronary heart disease was similar (2.0; 95% CI 1.6 to 2.8). (tHcy is the sum of homocysteine and homocysteinyl moieties of oxidized disulfides, homocystine, and cysteine- homocysteine. ) Robinson and colleagues3 examined three B vitamins in detail to determine their effects on fasting and post–methionine-loading tHcy levels and any independent effects on cardiovascular disease …
