GeneTrack--a genomic data processing and visualization framework.

MOTIVATION High-throughput 'ChIP-chip' and 'ChIP-seq' methodologies generate sufficiently large data sets that analysis poses significant informatics challenges, particularly for research groups with modest computational support. To address this challenge, we devised a software platform for storing, analyzing and visualizing high resolution genome-wide binding data. GeneTrack automates several steps of a typical data processing pipeline, including smoothing and peak detection, and facilitates dissemination of the results via the web.
