Dietary status of trained female cyclists.

Dietary status was evaluated in eight highly trained female cyclists. Each cyclist kept a 3-day weighed food record. Diets were analyzed for nutrient content using a computerized software package. Blood was also obtained and evaluated for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and albumin. For an athletic group, the cyclists' diets were found to be low in energy (85% RDA) and carbohydrate (4.4 gm/kg body weight per day). Mean daily dietary intakes were well below the RDAs for folacin (76% RDA), magnesium (81%), iron (59%), and zinc (48%). In addition, more than one-third of the cyclists failed to consume 67% of the RDA for the following micronutrients: pyridoxine, folacin, cobalamin, vitamin E, magnesium, iron, and zinc. Hemoglobin (135 gm/L), hematocrit (0.39), and albumin (45 gm/L) values were all normal, although most hemoglobin values were in the lower 50% of normal range. Foods such as meats, poultry, fish, beans, peas, and nuts were low or absent from the diets of most athletes. Dietary quality in this group of female cyclists could have been greatly improved with the addition of more of those foods. These athletes could benefit from nutrition education and diet counseling.
