Pain catastrophizing and general health status in a large Dutch community sample.

The aim of the present study was to examine the association between pain catastrophizing and general health status in a Dutch adult community sample, including various subgroups of people with musculoskeletal pain in the analyses. For exploratory reasons this study partly replicated previous studies of the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Results demonstrated that across different pain subgroups, catastrophizing uniquely contributed variance to the prediction of the various aspects of general health status beyond the variance explained by pain intensity, age, gender, and chronicity. Across subgroups strongest associations were found between catastrophizing and mental health, general health perception, social functioning, and vitality. Furthermore, the association between catastrophizing and the various aspects of general health status was not moderated by the chronicity of the pain. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis statistically confirmed a three-factor model of the PCS, which was invariant across different subgroups of people with musculoskeletal pain. Inter-factor correlations were high, and the incremental explanatory power of the three-factor model over that of a one-factor model was only marginal. This implies that a one-factor model might be justifiable as well, at least in the general community. Across various pain subgroups the reliability of the PCS total and subscales was adequate. Additional evidence for the concurrent validity of the PCS was found as well.
