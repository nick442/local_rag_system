Zinc supplementation during lactation: effects on maternal status and milk zinc concentrations.

The effects of a zinc supplement on maternal zinc status and milk zinc concentrations through > or = 7 mo of lactation were examined. Seventy-one lactating women received either a daily 15-mg zinc supplement (ZS, n = 40) or placebo (NZS, n = 31) started by 2 wk postpartum in a double-blind, randomized design. Overall mean zinc intakes were 13.0 +/- 3.4 mg/d for the NZS group and 25.7 +/- 3.9 mg/d (including supplement) for the ZS group. Plasma zinc concentrations of the ZS group were significantly higher than those of the NZS group (P = 0.05). Milk zinc concentrations declined significantly over the course of the study for all subjects but were not affected by zinc supplementation. The mean dietary zinc intake observed in the nonsupplemented group was adequate to maintain normal maternal zinc status and milk zinc concentrations through > or = 7 mo lactation. Similar controlled intervention trials in less well-nourished populations will be required to assess the impact of lower zinc intakes on milk zinc concentrations.
