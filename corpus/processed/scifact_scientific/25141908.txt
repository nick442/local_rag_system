Expression of a human cytomegalovirus latency-associated homolog of interleukin-10 during the productive phase of infection.

The human cytomegalovirus UL111A region is active during both productive and latent phases of infection. During productive infection, the virus expresses ORF79, a protein with oncogenic properties, and cmvIL-10, a functional homolog of human IL-10. During latent infection of myeloid progenitor cells, an alternately spliced variant of cmvIL-10, termed latency-associated (LA) cmvIL-10 has previously been identified. To determine whether LAcmvIL-10 transcription occurs during productive infection, we performed 5' and 3' RACE to map UL111A-region transcripts in productively infected human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). This analysis revealed the presence of a singly spliced UL111A-region transcript predicted to encode LAcmvIL-10. This transcript was expressed in HFFs with early (beta) kinetics, a temporal class that differs from that of ORF79 (alpha kinetics) and cmvIL-10 (gamma kinetics). These data identify and map a transcript encoding a latency-associated homolog of IL-10 which is expressed by the virus during the productive phase of infection.
