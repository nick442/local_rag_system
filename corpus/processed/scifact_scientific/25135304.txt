Relation of plasma leptin concentrations to sex, body fat, dietary intake, and peak oxygen uptake in young adult women and men.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relation of leptin to metabolic and dietary factors in college-age adults. Young adult women and men (n = 32) were recruited and underwent testing for measurement of body mass index, body composition, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), dietary intake, and plasma levels of leptin and insulin. Ln leptin was significantly greater for women than for men (2.1 versus 1.2 ng/mL, respectively). This difference remained significant even after adjusting ln leptin for fat mass and fat-free mass as covariates in separate analyses. VO2peak was higher for men than for women and this remained significant after adjustment for differences in fat-free mass and total body mass. Significant correlations were found between ln leptin and indicators of fat mass in women and men, with higher correlations for similar variables observed in men (r = 0.548, 0.674, and 0.732 for body mass index, percentage of body fat, and fat mass [kg] for women, respectively, and r = 0.740, 0.888, 0.858 for body mass index, percentage of body fat, and fat mass [kg] for men, respectively). Ln leptin showed a significant inverse relationship with VO2peak (r = -0.751) in men only. After adjusting ln leptin for body fat mass using partial correlations, ln leptin was not significantly associated with any of the measured variables. Alternatively, after normalization of ln leptin using fat mass as the divisor, a less adequate statistical analysis method, men showed statistical significant correlations between ln leptin and dietary intake and VO2peak. Although plasma leptin values were higher in women, stronger associations were evident for men than for women between leptin and metabolic and dietary factors.
