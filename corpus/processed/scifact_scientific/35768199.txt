Methanosphaera stadtmaniae gen. nov., sp. nov.: a species that forms methane by reducing methanol with hydrogen

Methanosphaera stadtmaniae is a non-motile, Gram-positive spherical-shaped organism that obtains energy for growth by using hydrogen to reduce methanol to methane. It does not produce methane from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, formate, acetate or methylamines and cannot grow with hydrogen and carbon monoxide, nitrate, fumarate, sulfate or choline. Its pH optimum is 6.5 to 6.9 and its temperature optimum is 36° to 40° C. It is not inhibited by bile salts, inhibitors of the synthesis of folic acid coenzymes, cephalothin or clindamycin but is inhibited by metronidazole, bacitracin, monensin, lasalocid, or bromoethanesulfonate. It requires acetate, carbon dioxide, isoleucine, ammonium, and thiamin for growth and biotin is stimulatory. It does not contain cytochromes and the mol % G+C of its DNA is 25.8. The composition of its cell wall and 16 S rRNA and its immunological fingerprint are consistent with characterization of the organism as a member of a new genus of the family Methanobacteriaceae. The habitat of the type strain is the human large intestine.
