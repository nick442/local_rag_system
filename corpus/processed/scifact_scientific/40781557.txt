Low-grade serous ovarian cancer: a unique disease.

Low-grade serous carcinomas represent approximately 10% of all serous ovarian carcinomas. A growing body of research has demonstrated several important differences between the clinical and molecular characteristics of these tumors and those of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. Patients with low-grade serous ovarian tumors are diagnosed at a younger age, have a longer overall survival, and have lower response rates to conventional chemotherapy. In addition, low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas have pathologic and molecular characteristics distinct from high-grade serous carcinomas, yet similar to serous tumors of low malignant potential. This suggests a common pathogenesis and a continuum of disease from serous tumors of low malignant potential to low-grade serous carcinomas. Further study, focusing specifically on low-grade serous carcinomas, is needed to determine the role of other chemotherapeutic agents, hormonal therapy, or targeted biologic agents in the treatment of this disease.
