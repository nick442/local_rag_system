Coming soon to a Wal-Mart near you

According to the Web site of the Association for Automatic Identification and Data Capture Technologies [http://www.aimglobal.org/technologies/rfid], "radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is an automatic way to collect product, place, and time or transaction data quickly and easily without human intervention or error. " With the ability to track everything from crates of disposable razors to individual peanut-butter jars on the store shelves, RFID technology offers the potential of "real-time supply chain visibility. " Promoters of RFID technology feel [C. Humer, 2003] that "RF tags are to this decade what the Internet was to the 1990's-a promise of radical change in the way business is done. " However, before the full potential of RFID technology can be realized, several hurdles need to be overcome: reliability, cost, lack of standards, and security. As these hurdles gradually diminish, Wal-Mart publicly embraces the technology.
