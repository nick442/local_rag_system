Acute myopericarditis after multiple vaccinations in an adolescent: case report and review of the literature.

We report a case of postvaccination acute myopericarditis in an adolescent. The patient presented with acute chest pain, diffuse ST-segment elevation, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels. Cardiac MRI was consistent with acute myocarditis. He recovered within a few days with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory treatment and remains clinically stable, with improvement of MRI findings at the 10-week follow-up. Postvaccination cases of myopericarditis reported in the pediatric literature are also reviewed.
