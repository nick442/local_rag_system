Herpesvirus-encoded GPCRs: neglected players in inflammatory and proliferative diseases?

Herpesviruses encode membrane-associated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in their viral genomes that are structurally similar to chemokine receptors. These GPCRs hijack GPCR-mediated cellular signalling networks of the host for survival, replication and pathogenesis. In particular the herpesvirus-encoded chemokine receptors ORF74, BILF1 and US28, which are present at inflammatory sites and tumour cells, provide important virus-specific targets for directed therapies. Given the high druggability of GPCRs in general, these viral GPCRs can be considered promising antiviral drug targets.
