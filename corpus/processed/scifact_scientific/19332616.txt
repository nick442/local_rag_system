Coronary plaque disruption.

Coronary atherosclerosis is by far the most frequent cause of ischemic heart disease, and plaque disruption with superimposed thrombosis is the main cause of the acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden death.1 2 3 4 5 Therefore, for event-free survival, the vital question is not why atherosclerosis develops but rather why, after years of indolent growth, it suddenly becomes complicated by life-threatening thrombosis. The composition and vulnerability of plaque rather than its volume or the consequent severity of stenosis produced have emerged as being the most important determinants for the development of the thrombus-mediated acute coronary syndromes; lipid-rich and soft plaques are more dangerous than collagen-rich and hard plaques because they are more unstable and rupture-prone and highly thrombogenic after disruption.6 This review will explore potential mechanisms responsible for the sudden conversion of a stable atherosclerotic plaque to an unstable and life-threatening atherothrombotic lesion—an event known as plaque fissuring, rupture, or disruption.7 8 Atherosclerosis is the result of a complex interaction between blood elements, disturbed flow, and vessel wall abnormality, involving several pathological processes: inflammation, with increased endothelial permeability, endothelial activation, and monocyte recruitment9 10 11 12 13 14 ; growth, with smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration, and matrix synthesis15 16 ; degeneration, with lipid accumulation17 18 ; necrosis, possibly related to the cytotoxic effect of oxidized lipid19 ; calcification/ossification, which may represent an active rather than a dystrophic process20 21 ; and thrombosis, with platelet recruitment and fibrin formation.1 22 23 Thrombotic factors may play a role early during atherogenesis, but a flow-limiting thrombus does not develop until mature plaques are present, which is why thrombosis often is classified as a complication rather than a genuine component of atherosclerosis. ### Mature Plaques: Atherosis and Sclerosis As the name atherosclerosis implies, mature …
