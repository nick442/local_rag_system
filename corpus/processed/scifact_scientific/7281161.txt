MicroRNA-21 is up-regulated in allergic airway inflammation and regulates IL-12p35 expression.

Allergic airway inflammation is characterized by marked in situ changes in gene and protein expression, yet the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), a new family of key mRNA regulatory molecules, in this process has not yet been reported. Using a highly sensitive microarray-based approach, we identified 21 miRNAs with differential expression between doxycycline-induced lung-specific IL-13 transgenic mice (with allergic airway inflammation) and control mice. In particular, we observed overexpression of miR-21 and underexpression of miR-1 in the induced IL-13 transgenic mice compared with control mice. These findings were validated in two independent models of allergen-induced allergic airway inflammation and in IL-4 lung transgenic mice. Although IL-13-induced miR-21 expression was IL-13Ralpha1 dependent, allergen-induced miR-21 expression was mediated mainly independent of IL-13Ralpha1 and STAT6. Notably, predictive algorithms identified potential direct miR-21 targets among IL-13-regulated lung transcripts, such as IL-12p35 mRNA, which was decreased in IL-13 transgenic mice. Introduction of pre-miR-21 dose dependently inhibited cellular expression of a reporter vector harboring the 3'-untranslated region of IL-12p35. Moreover, mutating miR-21 binding sites in IL-12p35 3'-untranslated region abrogated miR-21-mediated repression. In summary, we have identified a miRNA signature in allergic airway inflammation, which includes miR-21 that modulates IL-12, a molecule germane to Th cell polarization.
