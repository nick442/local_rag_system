Usefulness of high mobility group box 1 protein as a plasma biomarker in patient with peripheral artery disease.

Atherosclerosis is often associated with chronic vascular inflammation. High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) plays various roles, not only as a transcriptional regulatory factor in the nucleus, but also as an inflammatory mediator. A previous study suggested that fibrinogen is an important factor associated with atherosclerosis progression. The present study was performed to examine the levels of plasma HMGB1 protein in atherosclerosis patients. We studied 24 patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) with atherosclerosis, and 10 healthy controls. We found that the concentrations of HMGB1 were increased in the plasma of the patients with atherosclerosis, and there were significant correlations between the plasma HMGB1 and fibrinogen levels. Plasma HMGB1 may play a key role in the pathogenesis of clinical and experimental atherosclerosis.
