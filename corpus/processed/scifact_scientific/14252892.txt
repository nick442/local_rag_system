Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenetic determinants of osteonecrosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Osteonecrosis is a severe glucocorticoid-induced complication of acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. We prospectively screened children (n = 364) with magnetic resonance imaging of hips and knees, regardless of symptoms; the cumulative incidence of any (grade 1-4) versus symptomatic (grade 2-4) osteonecrosis was 71.8% versus 17.6%, respectively. We investigated whether age, race, sex, acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment arm, body mass, serum lipids, albumin and cortisol levels, dexamethasone pharmacokinetics, and genome-wide germline genetic polymorphisms were associated with symptomatic osteonecrosis. Age more than 10 years (odds ratio, = 4.85; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-9.2; P = .00001) and more intensive treatment (odds ratio = 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.9; P = .011) were risk factors and included as covariates in all analyses. Lower albumin (P = .05) and elevated cholesterol (P = .02) associated with symptomatic osteonecrosis, and severe (grade 3 or 4) osteonecrosis was linked to poor dexamethasone clearance (P = .0005). Adjusting for clinical features, polymorphisms of ACP1 (eg, rs12714403, P = 1.9 Ã— 10(-6), odds ratio = 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-11.3), which regulates lipid levels and osteoblast differentiation, were associated with risk of osteonecrosis as well as with lower albumin and higher cholesterol. Overall, older age, lower albumin, higher lipid levels, and dexamethasone exposure were associated with osteonecrosis and may be linked by inherited genomic variation.
