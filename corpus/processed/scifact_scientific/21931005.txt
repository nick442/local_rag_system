Signal transduction proteins that associate with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor mediate the PDGF-induced release of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from permeabilized cells.

Permeabilized rat kidney cells rapidly released glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) following stimulation with peptide growth factors (Stanton, R.C., Seifter, J.L., Boxer, D.C., Zimmerman, E., and Cantley, L. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12442-12448). To evaluate the signal transduction pathways mediating release of G6PD, two cell lines transfected with wild type or mutant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors (PDGFR) were studied using two permeabilization protocols. G6PD release was evaluated by enzyme activity and Western blot analysis. PDGF caused a significant increase in G6PD release in 1 min in cells transfected with wild type PDGFR. PDGF did not stimulate G6PD release in cells transfected with tyrosine kinase-deficient PDGFR. PDGF did not stimulate G6PD release in cells transfected with partially autophosphorylation-deficient PDGFR in which four known signaling proteins do not associate with the PDGFR. The PDGF-stimulated release of G6PD was partially restored in PDGFR mutants in which either phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase or phospholipase C gamma 1 could associate with the PDGFR. Lastly, there was no basal or PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of G6PD. We conclude that release of G6PD: 1) requires intrinsic PDGFR tyrosine kinase activity; 2) requires PDGFR autophosphorylation; 3) is mediated by signaling proteins that associate with the PDGFR; 4) is not mediated by direct phosphorylation of G6PD.
