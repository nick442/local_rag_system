Model-based Geostatistics

Geostatistics is concerned with estimation and prediction problems for spatially continuous phenomena, using data obtained at a limited number of spatial locations. Model-based geostatistics refers to the application of general statistical principles of modelling and inference to geostatisatical problems. This volume is the first book-length treatment of model-based geostatistics.
