Generating an iPSC bank for HLA-matched tissue transplantation based on known donor and recipient HLA types.

The likelihood for immunological rejection of Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA)-mismatched induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) limits their therapeutic potential. Here we show how a tissue bank from 150 selected homozygous HLA-typed volunteers could match 93% of the UK population with a minimal requirement for immunosuppression. Our model provides a practical approach for using existing HLA-typed samples to generate an iPSC stem cell bank that circumvents prospective typing of a large number of individuals.
