BH1 and BH2 domains of Bcl-2 are required for inhibition of apoptosis and heterodimerization with Bax

BCL-2 was isolated from the t(14;18) chromosomal breakpoint in follicular B-cell lymphoma1–3. Bcl-2 has the unique oncogenic role of extending cell survival by inhibiting a variety of apoptotic deaths4–13. An emerging family of Bcl-2 -related proteins share two highly conserved regions14–20 referred to here as Bcl-2 homology 1 and 2 (BH1 and BH2) domains (Fig. 1). This includes Bax which heterodimerizes with Bcl-2 and when overexpressed counteracts Bcl-214. We report here that site-specific mutagenesis of Bcl-2 establishes the two domains as novel dimerization motifs. Substitu-tion of Gly 145 in BHl domain or Trp 188 in BH2 domain completely abrogated Bcl-2's death-repressor activity in inter-leukin-3 deprivation, γ-irradiation and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Mutations that affected Bcl-2's function also disrupted its heterodimerization with Bax, yet still permitted Bcl-2 homo-dimerization. These results establish a functional role for the BH1 and BH2 domains and suggest Bcl-2 exerts its action through heterodimerization with Bax.
