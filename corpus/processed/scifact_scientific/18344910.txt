Thrombocytopenia as an Indicator of Malaria in Adult Population

Objectives. To evaluate the predictive value of thrombocytopenia in malaria. Patients and Methods. It was a prospective observational study on all febrile patients with thrombocytopenia presenting to the Medical Unit of Hayat Abad Medical Complex during November 2008 to November 2010. Results. Of the total of 228 patients with fever and thrombocytopenia, 121 patients (53%) proved to be suffering from malaria. Of them 82 patients (68%) had falciparum malaria while 39 patients (32%) had vivax infection. Of these 121 patients, platelet counts ranged between 25,000 and 150,000/dL with a mean value of 101,000/dL (SD ± 47, 500) and a median of 75,000/dL. Of the 107 patients who were not suffering from malaria, the counts ranged between 10,000 and 150,000/dL with a mean value of 58,000/dL (SD ± 54, 000) and median of 50,000/dL. Conclusions. The presence of thrombocytopenia may be a predictor of malaria in adult population.
