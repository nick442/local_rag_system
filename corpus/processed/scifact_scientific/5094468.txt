Mitochondria as sensors and regulators of calcium signalling

During the past two decades calcium (Ca2+) accumulation in energized mitochondria has emerged as a biological process of utmost physiological relevance. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was shown to control intracellular Ca2+ signalling, cell metabolism, cell survival and other cell-type specific functions by buffering cytosolic Ca2+ levels and regulating mitochondrial effectors. Recently, the identity of mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters has been revealed, opening new perspectives for investigation and molecular intervention.
