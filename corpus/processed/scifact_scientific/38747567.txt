Human cytomegalovirus encodes an MHC class I-like molecule (UL142) that functions to inhibit NK cell lysis.

Clinical and low passage strains of human CMV (HCMV) encode an additional MHC class I-related molecule UL142, in addition to the previously described UL18. The UL142 open reading frame is encoded within the ULb' region which is missing from a number of common high passage laboratory strains. Cells expressing UL142 following transfection, and fibroblasts infected with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing UL142, were used to screen both polyclonal NK cells and NK cell clones, in a completely autologous system. Analysis of 100 NK cell clones derived from five donors, revealed 23 clones that were inhibited by fibroblasts expressing UL142 alone. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of UL142 mRNA expression in HCMV-infected cells resulted in increased sensitivity to lysis. From these data we conclude that UL142 is a novel HCMV-encoded MHC class I-related molecule which inhibits NK cell killing in a clonally dependent manner.
