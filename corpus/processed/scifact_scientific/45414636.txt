Requirement of c-myb in T cell development and in mature T cell function.

Previous reports have suggested that the protooncogene c-myb participates in T cell development in the thymus and mature T cell proliferation. We have generated two T cell-specific c-myb knockout mouse models, myb/LckCre and myb/CD4Cre. We have demonstrated that c-myb is required for the development of thymocytes at the DN3 stage, for survival and proliferation of double-positive thymocytes, for differentiation of single-positive CD4 and CD8 T cells, and for the proliferative responses of mature T cells. In addition, our data show that c-myb is directly involved in the formation of double-positive CD4+CD8+CD25+, CD4+CD25+, and CD8+CD25+ T cells, developmental processes that may imply a role for c-myb in autoimmune dysfunction.
