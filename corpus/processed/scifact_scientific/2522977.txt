Olmesartan-based therapies: an effective way to improve blood pressure control and cardiovascular protection.

The main purpose in hypertension treatment is the reduction of cardiovascular disease burden. Among different first-line antihypertensive drug classes, angiotensin-receptor blockers are characterized by their both good effectiveness and tolerability. Furthermore, the interruption of the renin-angiotensin cascade is related with several benefits in target organ protection and cardiovascular prevention. Among different angiotensin-receptor blockers, olmesartan has been examined in several trial of organ protection, showing improvements in several disease markers, such as microinflammation, regression of both plaque volume and vascular hypertrophy, as well as microalbuminuria prevention. Olmesartan has been also widely examined in combination of either hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine, as well as with both drugs in a single-pill triple combination, showing improvements in antihypertensive efficacy without significant effects on tolerability. This treatment strategy based on a drug with such characteristics and the availability of different types of combinations with other first-line drug classes may represent an effective way for achieving blood pressure control in a majority of hypertensive patients and this could also be related with a better cardiovascular disease prevention.
