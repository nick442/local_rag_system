Regulation of Bcl-2 expression by HuR in HL60 leukemia cells and A431 carcinoma cells.

Overexpression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2 promotes abnormal cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Expression of bcl-2 is determined, in part, by regulatory mechanisms that control the stability of bcl-2 mRNA. Elements in the 3'-untranslated region of bcl-2 mRNA have been shown to play a role in regulating the stability of the message. Previously, it was found that the RNA binding proteins nucleolin and Ebp1 have a role in stabilizing bcl-2 mRNA in HL60 cells. Here, we have identified HuR as a component of bcl-2 messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. RNA coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that HuR binds to bcl-2 mRNA in vivo. We also observed an RNA-dependent coprecipitation of HuR and nucleolin, suggesting that the two proteins are present in common mRNP complexes. Moreover, nucleolin and HuR bind concurrently to bcl-2 AU-rich element (ARE) RNA in vitro, suggesting separate binding sites for these proteins on bcl-2 mRNA. Knockdown of HuR in A431 cells leads to down-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels. Observation of a decreased ratio of bcl-2 mRNA to heterogeneous nuclear RNA in HuR knockdown cells confirmed a positive role for HuR in regulating bcl-2 stability. Recombinant HuR retards exosome-mediated decay of bcl-2 ARE RNA in extracts of HL60 cells. This supports a role for HuR in the regulation of bcl-2 mRNA stability in HL60 cells, as well as in A431 cells. Addition of nucleolin and HuR to HL60 cell extracts produced a synergistic protective effect on decay of bcl-2 ARE RNA. HuR knockdown also leads to redistribution of bcl-2 mRNA from polysomes to monosomes. Thus, HuR seems to play a positive role in both regulation of bcl-2 mRNA translation and mRNA stability.
