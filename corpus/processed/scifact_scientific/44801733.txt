The role of the transcription factor KLF2 in vascular development and disease.

The zinc-finger transcription factor KLF2 transduces the physical forces exerted by blood flow into molecular signals responsible for a wide range of biological responses. Following its initial recognition as a flow-responsive endothelial transcription factor, KLF2 is now known to be expressed in a range of cell types and to participate in a number of processes during development and disease such as endothelial homeostasis, vasoregulation, vascular growth/remodeling, and inflammation. In this review, we summarize the current understanding about KLF2 with a focus on its effects on vascular biology.
