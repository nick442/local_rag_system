The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates

The preceding editions made "The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates" the second most cited book in science. This Fifth Edition is the result of years of research providing the user with the drawings of the completely new set of coronal sections, now from one rat, and with significantly improved resolution by adding a third additional section level as compared to earlier editions. Numerous new nuclei and structures also have been identified. The drawings are presented in two color, providing a much better contrast for use, and the accompanying CD-ROM contains all of the drawings from the atlas as well as the corresponding color micrographs (which are not included in the book). Affordable, comprehensive, compact, and convenient, the Fifth Edition continues the legacy of this major neuroscience publication and is a guide to all students and scientists who study the rat brain. It contains 161 coronal diagrams based on a single brain and includes a CD-ROM featuring all of the drawings from the book, plus the accompanying color micrographs that are not in the printed atlas. The delineations are drawn entirely new from a new set of sections. The diagrams are spaced at constant 120 m intervals resulting in the high resolution and convenience of use. The drawings use blue color lines and black labels to facilitate extraction of information. The stereotaxic grid was derived using the same techniques that produced the widely praised stereotaxic grid of the previous editions. Over 1000 structures are identified, a number for the first time in this edition.
