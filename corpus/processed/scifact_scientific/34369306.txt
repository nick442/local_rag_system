Long-term efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation in adolescents: a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND A double-blind RCT on the short-term efficacy of nicotine patches compared to placebo patches among Dutch adolescents was conducted. The findings demonstrated that nicotine patches are efficacious for smoking cessation at end-of-treatment; however, only in highly compliant participants. We tested whether the effects of NRT also held in 6- (T7) and 12-month (T8) follow-up assessments. METHODS Adolescents aged 12-18 years, who smoked at least seven cigarettes a day and who were motivated to quit smoking were recruited at school yards and randomly assigned to either a nicotine patch (n=182) or a placebo patch (n=180) condition according to a computer generated list. Participants (N=257, age: 16.7 Â± 1.13 years) attended an information meeting followed by a 6- or 9-week treatment. Smoking cessation, compliance, and potential covariates were measured by means of online questionnaires. Smoking cessation at T8 was biochemically validated by saliva cotinine. RESULTS At T7, 8.1% and 5.7% of participants were abstinent in the nicotine and placebo patch groups, respectively. At T8, abstinence was 4.4% and 6.6%, respectively. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant effects of NRT on abstinence rates at T7 (OR=1.54, 95% CI=0.57, 4.16) and validated abstinence rates at T8 (OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.21, 1.93) neither after considering compliance nor after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS NRT fails in helping adolescents quit smoking at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This finding suggests that a more intensive approach is needed to assist youngsters in their quit attempts.
