Older People at the End of Life: Delivery of Care and Needs for Improvement from the Perspective of Bereaved Relatives

BACKGROUND Due to demographic changes with an increasing number of older people with chronic illness and multimorbidity palliative care for geriatric patients has become increasingly important. The aim of this study was to explore the perspective of bereaved relatives with regard to their experiences and expectations concerning the delivery of care for older people in the last phase of life. METHODS Qualitative interviews with 12 relatives of deceased older patients (aged 60 years or older). The interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed using the approach of qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. RESULTS The bereaved relatives perceived that the care for geriatric patients in the last phase of life was inappropriate in various respects. They criticised overtreatment (e.g. skin cancer diagnostic) as well as unmet needs (e.g. treatment of pain, patient centred care, communication). Family doctors were seen as the primary contact persons in the professional health system. CONCLUSIONS From the perspective of bereaved relatives care for older people in the last phase of life has serious deficits. They criticise an inappropriate priority setting and the disregard of palliative care. There is a need for better communication and information exchange regarding the needs and expectations of patients and relatives, and regarding the targets of treatment. Therefore it may be helpful to use advance directives more intensively. Furthermore, it seems to be necessary to strengthen generalist palliative care particularly delivered by family doctors and community nurses.
