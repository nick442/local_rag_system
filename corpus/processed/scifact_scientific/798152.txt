Isolation from African Sykes' monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis) of a lentivirus related to human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.

Analysis of serum samples from 100 wild-caught or colony-born Sykes' monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis) in Kenya revealed that 59 animals had antibodies cross-reactive to human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and to simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). A lentivirus, designated SIVsyk, was isolated from five of six seropositive asymptomatic Sykes' monkeys, but in four cases isolation was possible only after depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes and cocultivation of the CD4(+)-enriched cell population with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seronegative Sykes' monkeys. SIVsyk resembled other SIVs and HIVs morphologically, had an Mg2(+)-dependent reverse transcriptase enzyme, and replicated in and was cytopathic for CEMx174 and Sup-T1 cells. SIVsyk differred substantially from other SIVs, however, in that it failed to replicate in normal human, mangabey, and macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum from seropositive Sykes' monkeys immunoprecipitated env antigens from HIV-1 as well as from HIV-2, SIVsmm, and SIVagm. These data demonstrate a high prevalence of natural infection in Sykes' monkeys in Kenya with a lentivirus that appears to be unique with respect to its host range and antigenic cross-reactivity.
