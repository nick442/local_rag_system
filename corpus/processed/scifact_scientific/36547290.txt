Brahma-related gene 1-dependent STAT3 recruitment at IL-6-inducible genes.

IL-6 is an immunoregulatory cytokine with multiple functions in hemopoiesis, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. IL-6 triggers phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of STAT3, which binds to target promoters and activates transcription. Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), the enzymatic engine of the yeast-mating type-switching and sucrose-nonfermenting chromatin-remodeling complex, is essential for recruitment of STAT1 or STAT1/STAT2-containing complexes to IFN targets. We hypothesized that BRG1 might also be required for STAT3 recruitment. In this study, we show that induction of a subset of human IL-6-responsive genes is BRG1 dependent. BRG1 is constitutively present at these targets and is required for STAT3 recruitment, downstream histone modifications, and IL-6-induced chromatin remodeling. IL-6-induced recruitment of STAT3 to the IFN regulatory factor 1 promoter and subsequent mRNA synthesis is BRG1 dependent, even though IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 recruitment to this locus is BRG1 independent. BRG1 also increased basal expression of IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 and IFN-gamma-induced protein 16, and the basal chromatin accessibility at the promoter of IFN regulatory factor 1. The effect on basal expression was STAT3 independent, as revealed by small interfering RNA knockdown. Together with prior observations, these data reveal that BRG1 has a broad role in mediating STAT accessibility at multiple cytokine-responsive promoters and exposes promoter specific differences in both the effect of BRG1 on basal chromatin accessibility and on access of different STAT proteins to the same target.
