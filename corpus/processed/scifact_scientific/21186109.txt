The missing cases of tuberculosis in Malawi: the contribution from cross-border registrations.

Low case detection rates of new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients globally are a cause for concern. The aim of this study was to determine for patients registered for TB in Malawi the number and percentage who lived in a neighbouring country and the registration, recording and reporting practices for these 'foreign' patients. All 44 non-private hospitals, which register and treat all TB patients in the public health sector in Malawi, were visited. Ten (23%) hospitals in 2001 and 14 (32%) in 2002 maintained a separate register for cross-border TB cases. Patients recorded in these registers were not formally reported to the Malawi National TB Programme (NTP), the neighbouring country's NTP, nor to WHO. They therefore constitute missing cases. In Malawi, the number of cross-border new smear-positive PTB cases was 77 in 2001 and 91 in 2002, constituting about 3% of missing smear-positive cases in those hospitals that maintain cross-border registers and about 1% of missing cases nationally.
