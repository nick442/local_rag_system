LncRNA NEAT1/let-7a-5p axis regulates the cisplatin resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by targeting Rsf-1 and modulating the Ras-MAPK pathway.

The long non-coding RNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) was reported to be upregulated and be involved in oncogenic growth and drug resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the exact roles of NEAT1 and its underlying mechanisms in the drug resistance of NPC remain largely unclear. In this study, the expressions of NEAT1, let-72-5p and Rsf-1 mRNA were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The effects of NEAT1 and let-72-5p on cell proliferation and cisplatin resistance of NPC cells were investigated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the protein levels of Rsf-1, Ras, p-Raf1, Raf1, p-MEK1, MEK1, p-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2. Xenograft tumor assay was done to elucidate the role of NEAT1 involved in NPC tumor growth in vivo. We found that NEAT1 was upregulated and let-7a-5p was downregulated in NPC tissues, as well as NPC cell lines. Inhibition of NEAT1 markedly repressed the cisplatin resistance of NPC cells. NEAT1 was demonstrated to interact with let-7a-5p. Besides, a negative correlation between NEAT1 and let-7a-5p expression was observed in NPC tissues. Rsf-1 was confirmed as a target of let-7a-5p. NEAT1 remarkably reversed the inhibitory effect of let-7q-5p on the cisplatin resistance of NPC cells in vitro. Additionally, NEAT1 knockdown inhibited the Ras-MAPK pathway in NPC cells. NEAT1 knockdown suppressed tumor growth in the presence of cisplatin in vivo. Overall, these findings suggest that NEAT1/let-7a-5p axis regulates the cisplatin resistance in NPC by targeting Rsf-1 and modulating the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway.
