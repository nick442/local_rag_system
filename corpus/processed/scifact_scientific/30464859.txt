The influence of denervation on grafted hindlimb regeneration of larval Xenopus laevis.

The aim of the present research is to ascertain whether in larval Xenopus laevis nerve-independence for the regeneration of early stage limbs and nerve-dependence of late stage limbs observed in a previous work (Filoni and Paglialunga, '90) is related to extrinsic (systemic) factors or to intrinsic changes taking place in the limb cells themselves during development. In this paper the regenerative capacity of early and late stage hindlimbs under the same extrinsic conditions, insofar as both are grafted onto the denervated hindlimbs of host larvae at the same developmental stage, is studied. All the grafted limbs are amputated after the host larvae have reached stage 57-58 (according to Nieuwkoop and Faber, '56). In experiment I, the grafted limb is amputated at stage 52, at the thigh level; in experiment II, the grafted limb is amputated at stage 54-55, at the tarsalia level; in experiment III the grafted limb is amputated at stage 57, at the tarsalia level. In all three experiments, together with the grafted limb, also the host limb is amputated at the tarsalia level. The results show that while grafted limbs amputated at stages 52 and 54-55 regenerate in the absence of nerves, grafted limbs amputated at stage 57 cannot. The failure of late stage grafted limbs to regenerate cannot be explained in terms of an immune-type inhibiting reaction since it has been observed also in denervated autografted limbs and in the host limbs. Since all the grafted limbs are in the same environmental conditions, the results show that in larval Xenopus laevis nerve-independence for regeneration of early stage limbs and nerve-dependence of late stage limbs are not related to factors extrinsic to the limb but to intrinsic changes taking place in the limb cells themselves during development.
