Induction of the heat-shock response by carbon dioxide in Chironomus thummi.

The effects of a set of stress treatments on gene expression of Chironomus thummi salivary gland cells have been analyzed. Among the treatments assayed, only during recovery from carbon dioxide have we observed a response similar to that previously described after heat-shock treatment: induction of the heat-shock puffs and synthesis of the heat-shock polypeptides. In these conditions, puffing and transcription of telomeric regions were observed, which led to the appearance of the temperature-inducible telomeric Balbiani ring T-BR-III. Other treatments failed to induce the heat-shock response, despite promoting real stress conditions to C. thummi larvae or salivary gland cells.
