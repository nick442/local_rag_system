Antipsychotic prescribing patterns in Germany: a retrospective analysis using a large outpatient prescription database.

Data of prescribing practices for antipsychotics are of great interest with respect to quality of care. Consequently, we analysed all prescriptions under the statutory health insurance redeemed at pharmacies in Southern Germany between July 1999 and December 2001. The database covers prescriptions for approximately 25 million people. Up to 6% of the population were prescribed an antipsychotic at least once during the study period. Most prescriptions were for conventional antipsychotics and written by non-specialists. Patients receiving second generation antipsychotics were more likely to receive continuous antipsychotic therapy. For a large proportion of patients, antipsychotic polypharmacy, as well as comedication for somatic illnesses, were observed. In particular, drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders were frequently co-prescribed. Physicians should consider patients' cardiovascular and metabolic risk profile when making treatment choices. The data suggest that the majority of antipsychotics are used for the treatment of disorders other than schizophrenia. It is important to raise awareness among non-specialists about the indications, efficacy and side-effects of the antipsychotics because these physicians account for the majority of antipsychotic prescriptions.
