Significance of stem cell marker Nanog gene in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer

The aim of the present study was to analyze the stem cell marker, Nanog gene, for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer cases, and to study its application in the diagnosis of lung cancer. In total, 100 patients diagnosed with lung cancer between April, 2013 and May, 2015 were included in the present study. The patients were randomly divided into group A (lung cancer) and group B (squamous cell lung carcinoma). RT-PCR was used to detect the cancer and adjacent tissues, and Nanog gene expression was detected in groups A and B in cells. The results showed that, analysis of Nanog gene expression in the two groups of patients varied to different degrees. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to age, gender, disease stage and lymph node metastasis. Nanog gene expression in patients with carcinoma were significantly higher than that in the adjacent tissues (p<0.05). By contrast, differentiated and well-differentiated carcinoma tissue showed a significantly higher Nanog gene expression than poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinoma (p<0.05). The expression of Nanog in normal cells was significantly higher than that in normal lung tissues and benign lesions in lung cancer stem cells. Nanog was highly expressed in CD44+ cells, and Nanog expression in lung cancer stem cells was significantly higher (p<0.05). In conclusion, for groups A (lung cancer) and B (squamous cell lung carcinoma) the Nanog gene expression was significantly higher. The data of the present study show that the patients with stage III and IV lung cancer had a higher Nanog gene expression. In addition, there was a higher expression of Nanog in lung cancer patients. By contrast, a lower degree of cell differentiation was associated with strong Nanog gene expression in lung cancer.
