Neuroinflammation in spinal cord injury: therapeutic targets for neuroprotection and regeneration.

Traumatic spinal cord injury triggers a complex local inflammatory reaction capable of enhancing repair and exacerbating pathology. The composition and effector potential of the post-injury cellular and molecular immune cascade changes as a function of time and distance from the lesion. Production along this time-space continuum of cytokines, proteases, and growth factors establishes dynamic environments that lead to the death, damage, repair or growth of affected neurons and glia. Microenvironmental cues, therefore, generated by the cells therein, may determine these distinct fates of repair versus pathology. To harness repair, it is necessary to manipulate the assembly and phenotype of cells that comprise the neuroinflammatory response to injury. Here, the potential of the neuroinflammatory response to cause outcomes such as pain, regeneration, and functional recovery is reviewed.
