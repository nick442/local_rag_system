Synapsin I Cre transgene expression in male mice produces germline recombination in progeny.

The cre/LoxP system can produce conditional loss of gene function in specific cell types such as neurons. A transgenic mouse line, utilized by multiple studies, used the Synapsin I promoter to drive expression of cre (SynCre) to achieve neuronal-specific cre expression. Herein we describe that cre expression can also be observed in SynCre mice within the testes after being bred into a floxed transgenic mouse line. Cre transcript was expressed in testes resulting in recombination of the floxed substrate in testes. In the majority of cases, progeny of male SynCre mice inherited a germline recombined floxed allele, while this was never observed in progeny from female mice carrying the SynCre allele. This observation should alert investigators to a potential confound using these mice and enables male germ cell "deletor" strategies.
