DMSO as a vehicle for central injections: tests with feeding elicited by norepinephrine injected into the paraventricular nucleus.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is becoming increasingly popular as a vehicle in studies employing central injections. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the vehicle required for solubilization of substances for central injection [75% DMSO and 25% artificial CSF (aCSF)] would alter the well-characterized stimulatory response to norepinephrine (NE) injected into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on short-term food intake. To evaluate its suitability, we compared the effects of repeated unilateral injections of NE dissolved in two different vehicles (100% aCSF or 75% DMSO, 25% aCSF), in separate groups of animals every 48 h over a 30-day period. NE (40 nmol) stimulated food intake by approximately sevenfold compared to either vehicle alone, and the stimulatory effect was similar whether aCSF or 75% DMSO was used as a vehicle. Furthermore, the NE-induced feeding did not vary in magnitude across a series of 13 tests. These results suggest that 75% DMSO is a suitable vehicle for administering NE (and likely other water-insoluble substances)in small volumes of 0.3 microl into specific brain regions.
