Age as a risk factor for thrombocytopenia and anaemia in children treated for acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES Anaemia is commonly observed in children with malaria, but reports on leucocyte and platelet count abnormalities associated with malaria are inconsistent. This study examined the effect of age, gender, parasite density and temperature on haematological parameters in children with acute uncomplicated malaria. METHODS Haematological parameters were determined in children with acute uncomplicated malaria, and these were correlated with age, sex, temperature and parasite density. Statistical analysis was done using SAS 9.1. RESULTS Six hundred and ninety five children with acute uncomplicated malaria participated in the study. The mean age was 51.7 months +/- 33.8. At presentation, anaemia occurred in 43.8% of the patients and children <5 yr had a significantly lower haematocrit (28.4% +/- 4.8) than that of older children (32.8% +/- 4.8) (p <0.001), but the haematocrit was not significantly different by days 14 and 28. There was no difference between both sexes. Leucocytosis was more frequently seen than leucopenia (9.5% vs 3%). Thrombocytopenia was found in 59.3% of enrolled patients. More than half of the patients with thrombocytopenia had recovered by Day 28. Baseline platelet count was related to Day 14 (r = 0.6, p < 0.0001) and Day 28 (r = 0.2, p = 0.0015) and the haematocrit on Day 28 (r = 0.12, p = 0.00197). Platelet count showed no correlation with temperature, parasite density and leucocyte count. Haematocrit correlated with age (r = 0.4, p < 0.0001); but not with parasite density or temperature. Leucocyte count showed no correlation with age or parasite density. CONCLUSION While thrombocytopenia was the most common haematological finding and may be of diagnostic importance, anaemia and leucocytosis were more common in the under fives.
