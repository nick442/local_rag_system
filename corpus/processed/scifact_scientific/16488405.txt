Physical activity induces a subclinical inflammatory response, mediated in part by leukocytes, and manifested by elevated concentrations of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). However, the source of the cytokines that appear during exercise remains unknown. In this study, we examined exercise-induced changes in plasma cytokine concentrations and their corresponding mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Ten healthy [peak oxygen uptake = 48.8 ± 6.5 (SD) ml · kg−1 · min−1] but untrained men [age = 25 ± 5 (SD) yr] undertook 3 h of exercise (cycling and inclined walking) at 60–65% peak oxygen uptake. Circulating leukocyte subset counts were elevated during and 2 h postexercise but returned to normal within 24 h. Plasma concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α peaked at the end of exercise and remained elevated at 2 h (IL-6) and up to 24 h (IL-1β and TNF-α) postexercise. Cytokine gene expression in circulating mononucl..
