Identification and characterization of a novel monocyte/macrophage differentiation-dependent gene that is responsive to lipopolysaccharide, ceramide, and lysophosphatidylcholine.

A novel differentiation-dependent cDNA (DIF-2) has been isolated from human mononuclear phagocytes by differential display. The full-length cDNA was cloned and sequenced. DIF-2 consists of 156 amino acids and has a predicted isoelectric point of 8.84. The mRNA is expressed in freshly isolated monocytes and is downregulated significantly when monocytes are subjected to differentiation. A similar differentiation-dependent downregulation is observed in normal hepatocytes compared to undifferentiated HepG2 cells. The mRNA expression in monocytes is sensitive to lipopolysaccharide and ceramide which both strongly increase DIF-2 transcription, while lysophosphatidylcholine results in a weaker upregulation of DIF-2 expression. A DIF-2 homologous gene has been previously isolated from mouse fibroblasts and was shown to be a serum growth factor-inducible immediate early gene. Our results indicate that DIF-2 represents a gene which is regulated in differentiation processes and strongly responsive to lipopolysaccharide, ceramide and lysophosphatidylcholine.
