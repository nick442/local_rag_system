Liver receptor homolog-1 regulates the transcription of steroidogenic enzymes and induces the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into steroidogenic cells.

Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, also known as Ad4BP) has been demonstrated to be a primary transcriptional regulator of steroidogenic-related genes. However, mRNA for liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), which together with SF-1, belongs to the NR5A nuclear receptor family, is expressed at much higher levels than SF-1 mRNA in the human gonad. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that SF-1 induced the differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into steroidogenic cells such as Leydig or adrenocortical cells. The introduction of LRH-1 into human MSCs (hMSCs) with the aid of cAMP also induced the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, including CYP17, and their differentiation into steroid hormone-producing cells. Promoter analysis, EMSA, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using LRH-1-transduced hMSCs indicated that three LRH-1 binding sites were responsible for CYP17 transactivation. Immunohistochemical studies showed that LRH-1 protein was expressed in human Leydig cells. The CYP17 promoter region was highly methylated in hMSCs, whereas it was demethylated by the introduction of LRH-1 and cAMP treatment. These results indicate that LRH-1 could represent another key regulator of the steroidogenic lineage in MSCs and play a vital role in steroid hormone production in human Leydig cells.
