I am not a lawyer. I do however own an LLC. It's setup as a partnership with 50/50 ownership. You can do it as a sole proprietorship. In basic terms, if you separate your money and assets from the money and assets of the company then you are personally immune from lawsuit and thus your personal assets are safe. You have to set it up right (fairly cheap) and keep the records right (ie never mix personal and company assets ) but it provides a nice legal buffer and in some cases tax benefits. Do not construe this as legal or accountanting advice. Speak with pros to understand and get it set up right. But it's worth it.
