You're missing the point entirely. Minimum wage was created to force employers to pay a wage that is not commensurate with services rendered (otherwise legislation is not needed). The people hurt by this are the people who are otherwise unqualified for the wage commensurate with skill and education (direct result of government run schools). Skilled workers aren't affected in terms of employment opportunity only, but they are punished by the inflation caused by the arbitrary rate of a minimum wage. That FDR quote is a great example of fascism. Great touch.
