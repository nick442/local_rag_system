I understand capitalism, thanks. You think I am brand loyal though. Whomever gives the services for the least amount wins. As long as monopoly laws still exist consumers will be ok. I could use amazon or Hulu or other streaming. And if there is a merger so be it. It won't be the first and it won't be the last. Also, my free library offers most movies and can get over a million on inter library loan. Lastly there is redbox.
