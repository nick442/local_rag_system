Of course the first reply would be an attempt to poison the well. Of course I'm not gonna engage. Me, I'm still waiting for that concrete proof that's been promised for a almost one year already. Please, do remember to send it my way once it surfaces! EDIT: I've received accusations and insults so far. I'm still waiting for the incriminating paper, tape, video, log, whatever it is that is ACTUAL, concrete proof of interference to be sent my way. I'm not talking about proof that Trump is a liar, that is known, or that Trump kept in touch with Russia, that is known. I'm waiting for the concrete proof that Russia interfered in the election. I'm not claiming there was none, i'm just waiting for the proof. Please times a million, someone share it with me.
