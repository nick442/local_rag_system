Hello LY! I lived in Phnom Penh for a couple years. Loved Siem Reap and Angkor Wat. I tell you what, any time I needed to catch a moto or tuk tuk, we would always pick the one who wasn't shouting over every one to get us to ride. Just be cool and be yourself. Be active on social media. Take Instagram photos with clients you think are super nice. Tag them in your photos. Ask them to rate you on trip advisor. Post on twitter letting people know when you are available for rides. I hope I am helpful! Good luck my man.
