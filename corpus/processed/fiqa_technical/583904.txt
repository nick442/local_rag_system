I don't think you need to be an economist to answer the bell though. Gates is filling his role in that he's not letting the powers at be back down from pledges. From there though, it tends to get overly political and messy. From Gates's perspective it is probably black and white. Financial traders aren't doing much to engineer a better future directly, so why not tax them and make them contribute more to the world that Gates would like to see. It's not as if these guys are spending their weekends finding ways to get millions of mosquito nets and vaccines to people across the globe so why listen to their political dribble as to why they can't lose a penny on the dollar to create a better world?
