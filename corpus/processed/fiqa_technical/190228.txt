"But there's no proof that it's a distinguishing factor or dispositive. Correlation doesn't equal causation, etc. These ""successful people benefited from luck"" navel gazings serve no useful purpose other than to diminish the accomplishments of those who have achieved something and/or to make people feel better about their own lack of accomplishment. Might as well say ""successful people are mostly Capricorns"" or ""they were all raised in cribs facing east"" I think it's just a pointless exercise in mental masturbation."
