"This article absolutely nailed it. There's a better saying: ""Money can't buy happiness, but it calms the nerves"". Some years ago I lost my job just as the economy tanked. I spent nearly 3 years on what could be best described as a 'subsistence' income. I had played the whole game of which utility got paid this month and ended up in a bit of debt. It was just hell and it still haunts me. I was so messed up after that, I didn't even like taking vacation time. Just hanging around my apartment brought back memories of being unemployed and having no where to go. To this day I won't turn down overtime or a chance to make some extra money."
