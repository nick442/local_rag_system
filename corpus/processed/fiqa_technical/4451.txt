"> If an individual wants insurance My argument is that this is the wrong way of looking at the issue. It isn't a question of wanting insurance. Instead, the question should be *""if an individual wishes to remain healthy..""* or ""*if an individual wants access to healthcare..""* Who doesn't? Ensuring good health is a national good, just as providing an education, police and fire services, and national defense are. Full stop."
