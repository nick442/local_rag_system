Maximum FSA contribution amounts are set by the IRS. For tax year 2015 you are allowed to place no more than $2,550 (and same maximum for 2016) in an FSA account, tax-free. Your employer's plan year is not relevant to the IRS for this purpose. It's important to note that one interesting benefit to FSA accounts is the full amount of your annual contribution is available to you on the first day of the plan year; it is not a money-in money-out plan.
