"I work in wealth management now - so it deviates from what you are looking to do long term, but what about getting your series 7 or 65? I'm 37 now, and before I started my own firm I got my 7/63 and worked for a big custodian to ""cut my teeth"" - which quite honestly was a glorified sales position, however it was invaluable for learning to ""speak the language"" for lack of a better term. I don't have a CFA (which I know is very challenging), but I am a CFP and ChFC (also not easy) and have a MS in statistics and MBA in finance. If you have any questions or wanted to do a mock interview I'd be glad to help."
