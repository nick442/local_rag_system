Honestly, I think you are falling for a myth. Family business can also decide to go for short term maximum profit at the expense of long term. And shareholders can decide to look long term, just go to shareholder meetings and you will see everything. Its not so black and white. For the rest I agree, except for anti-monopolly laws. In general, anti-monopolly laws only help create olligopollies/monopollies not removing them.
