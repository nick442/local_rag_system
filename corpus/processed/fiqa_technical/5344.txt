Well, it's a pain in the ass and industries vary.. At $15/hr in my industry in my state, take home can be as low as $12 and cost about $24.. This puts a huge strain on entry positions and wage growth.. Plus with payroll taxes, wages can almost never outpace Inflation.. If employers give a 10% raise to workers, it costs 15% and their take-home only increases 8% (random fictional numbers, but close).. So what we've done is increased cost of living by nearly twice every wage increased.. It's a dog chasing its tail..
