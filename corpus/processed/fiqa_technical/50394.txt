The answers provided already pretty much answer the differences and trade-offs, and I'd agree with recommending an online savings account like ING because the rate is just about the same as most CDs you'll find right now. It's really a matter of when the CD rate is higher, and you can accept not accessing the money, then the CD is a better value, otherwise go with the savings account. However, here is an interesting option with CDs that helps with not being able to access the money: a CD ladder. Basically, you get a CD every 3 months (or some other acceptable time frame), starting with 3, 6, 9, and 12-month CDs. When the time is up for each of them, take that money and put it back into a new yearly CD. Eventually you will get to the point when you have all of the CDs long-term, but you'll get some of the money every 3 months. If you need the money, you'll have the option to use it, but you can always just keep it going, too. The exact timing you use depends on your situation, but it's a great way to help get around not being able to access the money for a year or more.
