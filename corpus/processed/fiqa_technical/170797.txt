Ok, now you're either trolling or you have absolutely no idea how Excel is used in the professional world. Maybe some of the banking folks can chime in on how much their junior analysts are allowed to use a mouse in Excel, because I've heard that some of the banks actually take away your mouse for your first few months at the firm because there are keyboard shortcuts available for every function. How old are you and how long have you been in Finance?
