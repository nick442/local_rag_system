I think he's talking about having a psychological investment in your dream. A truly devoted and obsessive leader will only be thinking about moving forward, not trying to work on getting out. I don't think it's a fair thing to expect, however. I think a lot of prudent leaders will want to know how to exit gracefully. That doesn't mean they can't be risk takers, but they're smart.
