This whole article is about politics, not about business. Just because the douche who is trying to make a statement about partisan politics makes a front page of a business section; just because he happens to do business, doesn't make the topic business. It's the ensuing pedantic arguments and quibbles about this and that which really make it about politics. if it were about about business it would be a question of profitability, efficiency or markets, not about some jerk who says he is going to try to ruin the lives of many people because of something that might effect his companies bottom line after ancillary effects make their way down the road to him.
