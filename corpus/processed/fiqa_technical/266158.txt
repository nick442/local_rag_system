That's a bold statement. Lots of people work hard, but traveling constantly, training, having to be a public figure, all are a lot of work that factors into the high salary. Not even mentioning how competitive a loving it is to even make it and maintain a career doing it. You could work two jobs to get by and bust your ass, but I don't think that's necessarily comparable to being one of the top athletes in the world.
