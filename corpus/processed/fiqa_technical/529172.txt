So the budget is just a guess and the IT manager can ultimately spend whatever he wants? Are you really arguing that he should treat the spending constraints given to him by the heads of the company as mere suggestions? Do you actually work in an accounting department? I have to ask because you seem to have a fundemental misunderstanding about their role in all this. They are just score keepers, they don't get to decide how much money is allocated to each department. So the way they track the money has no bearing on this issue.
