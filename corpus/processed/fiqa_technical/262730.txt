Buy a foam chair for your child then bring it home and find out she can't sit in it? Buy a dish set then discover your wife already bought one and didn't tell you? Buy a bunch of hooks then discover after opening the first they won't work for your application? Three examples off the top of my head. There are LOTS of other situations.
