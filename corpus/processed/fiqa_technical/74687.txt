Clearly the semantics of the discussion are of greater importance to you. Hospitals are not directly subsidized by the government. Medicare originated with two parts: Part A: Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) which covers hospital / hospice costs and Part B: Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) which covers outpatient costs. Part C was added later by Clinton, which set up a system of selection of health insurance through private companies, and those private companies are then subsidized by the federal government.
