I'm honestly a little surprised about where that funding came from too. Twitter's been a monumental help in all the uprisings worldwide. Incoming funds from a country known for human rights violations seems very suspect indeed. Then again, if twitter goes the way of suppressed communication / biased information (Fox News (also partly owned by said Saudi prince)) then what's to stop people from building a twitter clone? Twitter is great an all, but at it's heart it only has brand loyalty.
