I agree value is subjective to individuals. Therefore, most human beings would not pay anything for a highly polished turd. However, I disagree that things do not have intrinsic value. A rock may not have value to 99% of the world, but it can be useful for many things: building a house, breaking a window, etc. Likewise, a turd can be dried out and burned or used in making biogas. Everything has intrinsic value, however, many items are difficult to sell because so few people need their resources. A bit of pocket lint could be used to stuff a pillow, but who would ever do that, really?
