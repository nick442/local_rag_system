Trader Joe belongs to Aldi Nord, which covers the northern half of Germany. Aldi SÃ¼d (South) is the master race though, in Germany at least. They tend to have a greatly different level of quality abroad, e.g. I heard in the UK Aldis are considered shit-tier, so your experience may vary. edit: typo & grammar
