Regardless of the technicalities of how information was stolen through Kapersky, I am wondering why anyone would use antivirus software, which by definition must operate at a privileged level, that's produced by a company in a country like Russia or China. We already know for a fact that Tencent's WeChat programmatically monitors, censors, and likely reports thought crimes, and I would be surprised if Kapserky is NOT an agent of the Russian government to a similar capacity.
