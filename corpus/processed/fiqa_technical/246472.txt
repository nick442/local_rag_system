Well, if someone is paid hourly and works less hoursâ€”then clearly there is lost income. Additionally, there may be promotions that a parent gets passed over for because he/she often leaves work early to be with the kids. Usually, I think, one of the two spouses slows his/her career a bit while raising the kids, this obviously effects the earning potential of the family. Ultimately, the point I was focused on is that the amount, $900,000, isn't just paying for food, diapers, clothes, books, the larger house you need to house a larger family, the larger car/van you need to tote the kids around in, the extra gas you use in that car/van taking the kids to places you wouldn't otherwise be going, the baby-sitter for date-night, the potential extra seats on planes etc., it includes other lost opportunities (hey, that great job offer on the other side of the country, can't take it unless you want to pull your kids out of 8th grade in the middle of February.. etc). All of this adds up, it doesn't seem entirely unreasonable that it would be close to a million dollars. Also, the $900,000 estimate is probably an estimate of the average. Obviously, I can't speak for your friends, they may be outliers. Edited: grammar
