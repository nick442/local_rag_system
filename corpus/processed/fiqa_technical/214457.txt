Fair enough, either way if your skills are at the minimum wage level you should NOT be supporting a kid and a women/man. How can you expect to provide a decent life if you are making that much? No the government shouldn't force businesses to pay more, you should be earning more if you want to raise a kid and a significant other. I'm not comparing it to basic needs, I'm saying you have a CHOICE, you can choose to bring a kid into your life or not, and if you are on minimum wage it does no good for anyone, not the person earning, not the kid, not the business, no one. Is that so hard to understand? It's economics 101, increasing the minimum wage leads to only negative consequences, and in this digital age they will be coming sooner rather than later.
