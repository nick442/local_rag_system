Well.. First off, good luck getting many rational, cogent responses to a hypothetical economics question this sensitive. Lol. So in the interest of a *purely academic* exercise and expressly not any form of recommendation (!) or road map for application (!), let's dig in: You would need to clarify a few things in order to assess the economic impact of adding slaves to your society. 1) Is the supply of slaves limited? 2) is the ownership of slaves limited to a small sector of society or available at large to a wide portion of society. 3) Do your slaves represent a net increase to population? Or are you enslaving some percentage of your population? 4) Does the nature of work that slaves are capable of, compete directly with, or effect the employment levels of your population? 5) is the level of (and relative cost of) automation, robotics and artificial intelligence in your society advanced to the point where slaves would even be beneficial? 6) Does your society have the means of enforcement, security and subjugation (technological or otherwise) to control a population of slaves over the long term. 7) Are other countries (namely your trading partners) also introducing slaves? 8) What are the costs of acquiring, housing, feeding and maintaining slaves? (They are not zero-cost) Its not possible to answer the question without those answers, but note that the addition of slaves is most likely deflationary in economic terms, as you are increasing productive capacity at (an assumed) lower cost. At the same time you are most likely displacing some percentage of conventional paid workers, thereby increasing unemployment. (Which, if the Phillips curve still applies, edges us towards lower inflation or deflation).
