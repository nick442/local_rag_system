"Low cost tuition or loan forgiveness is stealing in the same way the government steals from you to build roads, schools, police departments and other social services. That is why I used to term brainwashed because there is a massive propaganda effort that says paying taxes to allow our society to function is theft and immoral so the wealthy can skirt their tax obligations with the support of the lower class. Why don't you get your head of the the sand and look at how other countries do things. Things like single payer health care or low cost/free college are the norm in the developed world and they suffer far fewer societal problems and less inequality as a result. So keep spouting your ignorant ""taxes are theft"" rhetoric straight from Fox News. It doesn't seem like going to school has done much to enlighten your way of thinking"
