I agree but the reality is that despite laws on the books, no matter how egregious corporate behavior in the US is, rarely do the courts impose any real punishment. It's always a small fine by the courts or the government which only encourages the bad behavior. Its always pennies on the dollar of what they got and no jail time for anyone. Business know this. Heard of Blue Bell ice cream? They knew there was a problem with their ice cream, instructed employees to cover it up and continues to sell ice cream which killed people. The state of Texas gave them a fine sure to have everyone repeat this and the company will delay for decades any settlement with the families. It's the American way. You have no power over corporations.
