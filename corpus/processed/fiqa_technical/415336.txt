I would not pay for anything on LinkedIn. I have read that once you give them your credit card, it is VERY hard to unsubscribe. Read the reviews about that online. They are not good. I believe in LinkedIn and feel you can benefit a lot from it. If you don't have a profile you are limiting yourself because all employers are searching prospective employees online and the more positive info about you out there, the better. You control what is on LI.
