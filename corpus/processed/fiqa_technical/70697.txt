Are you planning on paying your son back? If so, this is a loan from him. If not, it is a gift. Both have possible and different tax implications. For example, gifts above $14,000 ($28,000 if your son is married) per calendar year may be subject to a gift tax. If it is a loan, the IRS has rules about the interest rate you must pay him and taxes get more complicated if it is too low (or zero). Edit: Notice that if you are also married, I believe your son and his wife can give $14k each to each of you and your spouse. If the house is in her name as well you may be able to pay as much as $56K without the gift tax. Notice that this is a yearly amount, so if this was December you could get $56k in December and $56K in January.
