I'm having a hard time getting worked up over this case. The underlying issue is a serious one, but this case is the wrong canary. > The affidavit was false: simply, nakedly false. The employee had made no such claim. > The prosecutors alerted a major newspaper about the search, so there are photographs of agents carrying boxes from your office. That's not government error. That's malfeasance. This pisses me off. > The agent’s statement was false. The federal agent lied and destroyed a company in the process. The lawsuit was against the prosecutors who acted on good faith. Why didn't he try to sue the agent who lied? The prosecutors have qualified immunity, which they need, in order to do their jobs. Otherwise, they'd be spending all day in court defending themselves rather than prosecuting cases. > The appeals court said evidence that Ganek knowingly traded on inside information would give authorities probable cause to conduct a search, but it wasn’t needed in order to get a warrant. > The affidavit alleges that some of Ganek’s employees had traded on inside information and that “there was at least a fair probability to think that his office was among the LG premises where evidence of an insider trading scheme would be found,” the appeals court said, referring to Level Global. That's why the appeals court threw out the case. They said the lying officer only accelerated the warrant which would have been issued anyway.
