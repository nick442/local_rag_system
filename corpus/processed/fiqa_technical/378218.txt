">I've seen that happen many times. I have too. Including several times where I was personally involved -- either on the hiring or the hired end; not to mention countless dozens of times with colleagues and coworkers. Most people don't realize it, but the vast majority of positions never even make it to the ""help wanted"" stage -- someone is already lined up and hired before it gets to that point -- and a not insignificant number of the ones that *do* get posted as job listings, are also already filled (the company is just going through the motions, either as a negotiating tactic, or because they want to see what/who else is out there). >It happened with the position I'm in currently. I started out as a temp. Originally the job ad was some aimless posting about needing a new accountant, the accountant didn't even need a college degree if they had equivalent work experience. Then all of a sudden one week the posting changed to a copy-paste job of my work and educational experience (much more demanding than the previous ad). Ha! Means there is one SMART manager there (both for the fact that they DIDN'T demand the ""degree"" in the first place, and secondly because they knew how to work the system to get YOU hired full time). Dollars to donuts.. I'd be willing to bet you have a pretty good boss there."
