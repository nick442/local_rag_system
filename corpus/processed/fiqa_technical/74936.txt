"The ""right place"" is typically somewhat exclusive and you've had to work pretty hard to get there to begin with. Right time is more luck, but you can make judgement calls here too. For example I've been at the right place and (possibly - can't really tell without executing myself) right time for a huge number of opportunities. I had to pick one. Am I super lucky, or very good at networking? Or why do I keep being so often in what appears to be the right place at the right time?"
