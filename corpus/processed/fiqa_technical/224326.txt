"Sure, but there's really no limit to how far you can take this logic. Every social institution - whether it be money, property rights, the government you pay taxes to, the language you speak - ultimately only enjoys a stable existence because people collectively accept its existence as real. But from my perspective as a single individual, the money I use and the laws I'm subjected to are just as real as the ground I walk on. It's perfectly rational to treat social objects as real even though their existence does not derive from the ""brute"" facts of the world."
