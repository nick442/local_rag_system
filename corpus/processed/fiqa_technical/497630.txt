Do you want a house? Sounds like you do. Did you think about what it will take to own a run a house? I am betting you have. Buying a home shouldn't be about an investment in anything other than you happiness and you sure seem conscientious and ready. Your worries are good ones, but don't forget about unemployment insurance, that as responsible people you can get another job. Do you have a life insurance policy? If you really really can't afford your payments, you can try to sell the house because you should have plenty of equity per your plans. Furthermore, chances are you will earn more in your paychecks over your lifetime. Think about what features you want, shop the market hard, take time and buy a house on reason rather than love. Don't you dare love the house until you buy it.
