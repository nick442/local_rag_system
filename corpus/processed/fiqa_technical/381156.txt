I think you grossly overestimate the amount required to successfully lobby the American government. Take a look at BoA’s current [lobbying amount. ](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=d000000090) (spoiler: it’s under 10 million a year). Shit, even Comcast, the company people always point to as an example of unethical lobbying, spent 12 million a year.
