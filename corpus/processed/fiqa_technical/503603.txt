"equifax is not too big to fail. equifax needs to be made an example of. congress should be trying to start to legislate some privacy for us citizens like germany/eu. this just shows that the government is very unconcerned about our privacy. they could at least fake it. EDIT: i realized i am a hypocrite. i trashed hillary for her ""public/private positions"" and here i am asking for it. i feel defeated."
