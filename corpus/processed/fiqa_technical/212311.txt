I can, I obviously can't speak for every field but in mine I don't know a single person making 6 figures or more who doesn't work weekends from time to time. Now I'm not saying that there at the office on a Sunday at 7am just like every other day. But maybe Saturday morning they're at there computer finishing off something from Friday, and then Sunday afternoon they need to prepare some things for Mondays meetings. I've received emails from my boss at 4am on a Saturday, I seriously doubt that her boss is at home watching movies or out surfing or something like that. And yes like you said in your post no one is around to cover them and business is a 24/7 venture. So even though they won't be at work 24/7 they're definitely on call if things go wrong.
