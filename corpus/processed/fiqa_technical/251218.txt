1) I can and have argued that no act can be seen as purely altruistic. You can always find an edge where the person gains something. 2) Brownie Points? Really? I now think you are an ardent Republican who listens to Fox News. Why? Because my parents are ardent Republicans and they, too, like to talk about how “everyone else” wants brownie points and participation trophies. I am not a Republican or a Democrat or a Libertarian. None of those groups are trying to solve problems. They just make loud statements. I am just me, trying to ACTUALLY find a better way to do things.
