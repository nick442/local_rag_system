one of the major backbones of domestic transit in the US is the highway system. No businessman wanted to touch that until the government decided to pitch in and do most of the work. Would businesses make infrastructure if they had to? Yes. Would it benefit all users equally and would they allow anyone (including competitors) to use the infrastructure they built? Not likely. These are some reasons why some items like infrastructure do not work as well as fully private companies.
