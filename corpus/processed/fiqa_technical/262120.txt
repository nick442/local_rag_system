I quote this episode regularly. So many businesses will gladly take reservations. Restaurants, car dealer service centers, doctor's offices, etc and then you still end up waiting around. I spent about eight hours over three visits to get tires put on one of my cars _with_ appointments! Even after they put the wrong tires on after the first attempt they kept me waiting for hours the second go around. Guess where I'm never going again. When I started dating my now wife I took her to a place with a 7PM reservation. We finally sat around 9PM after another couple told the owner we had been waiting longer than anyone else in the pile of people at the front of the restaurant. I realize that appointments can run over and places don't want to have unused resources, but I can't fucking stand when places don't _hold_ the reservation.
