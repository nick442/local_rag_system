It's bringing together something really old with something new and unrelated in a way that is incongruous: Natural, farm fresh produce which makes us think about touching the earth, and being in the sunshine with dirt, plants and animals around + something that (interferes with and) mediates connection between people who exist only as consumers. I love(d) WF in part because I love(d) the shopping experience -- which had comfortable lighting, not freezing aisles, emphasized less processed foods, and tells you where your food came from. I hope that doesn't change. The other thing I loved about WF is that it was not overly ad-saturated like a Safeway would be, for example. I don't want to see giant signs from kelloggs pushing garbage cereal, or super-bowl promotions encouraging over-the-top enthusiasm for sub-par items. To me, I find that kind of consumerism depressing. Whole Foods didn't do that. But I guess that's over.
