I like THEAO's answer above but I would make some changes. Treat this as a gift; not a loan. Having to ask your friend for repayments is likely to become a huge strain on the friendship. Giving them money, whether you decide to do it as a gift or a loan, does not entitle you to then dictate their life. Sitting down with friends and going over their budget until it satisfies you is likely to be stressful for you both and demeaning to them. You can make getting help from a financial advisor/counselor a part of your gift. I would go as far as to suggest paying for that service for your friends as a part of the money you give them. If a few months from now they need more money, you'll have to reassess the situation.
