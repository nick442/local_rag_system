> Because if you are against Trump, you must(!) be for Hillary or the DNC or both. Nope and I think this attitude is the core problem with American politics. > Even if it's true, it's what Trump wanted, what he would have done, what he has done, and the GOP did it, for him. By that logic, **I** killed the TPP because it is what I wanted and would have done but the GOP did it for me. > Tell me of something that Trump did that you do agree to or do not like. How about one issue that shows both? Medicare Part-D was created to help cover the costs of prescription drugs to seniors. This is the biggest drug market but by law Medicare can not use it's leverage to negotiate better deals for prescription drugs. This effectively gives pharmaceutical companies a guaranteed customer regardless of price for any drug that has no equivalent competition, which means artificially high drug prices. During the campaign President Trump said he would battle prescription drug prices and after he was elected. [He specifically said he wanted Medicare to use its purchasing powers to negotiate drug prices](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-11/drug-stocks-plunge-as-trump-threatens-to-force-price-bidding). I was delighted to hear this because, in my opinion, it is low-hanging fruit for someone who wants to use the free market to benefit consumers. Fast forward to the end of January and President Trump meets with big pharmaceutical company execs to discuss drug prices. [When he came out of the meeting, not only was he now opposed to using free-market principles in Medicare to save tax-payer money but he promised these companies tax breaks, a gift of even more money](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/31/14453740/trump-medicare-prescription-drugs). I like that President Trump claims to be a champion of the common man but in this case his actions are that of a champion of the rich at the expense of the common man.
