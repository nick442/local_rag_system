Thanks for your reply, Sarah! I am sure there is no significance in the Washington Post disclosing that it is owned by Jeff Bezos, but my point is that if the patent was created for a cunning plan, I highly doubt Jeff would have let the cat out of the bag in this way, especially by a newspaper organization that he owns. As the other individual mentioned, I just think this is Bezos's flexing his muscles to other competitors--heck, he may even attempt to sell the innovation for a whopping amount of money. Believe me, I LOVE innovation as well. I think it plays an instrumental role in society. However, there are some innovations that are detrimental to us as a people, even if it may seem infinitesimal at the moment. If you haven't noticed, but the more technology that is created, the less privacy we have, the dumber we become and the more jobs we lose to automation. If Amazon succeeds and generates umpteen profit from operations at Whole Foods via electronic (automation) means, I see Wal-Mart coming back harder with automation services, which will prove detrimental to jobs.
