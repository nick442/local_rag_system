The loan agent surely knows that having a combination of loans greater than the value of the property (less some margin) is illegal, but also impossible. Your first mortgage, mechanic's liens, tax liens, and so forth are a matter of public record. In most states the records can be viewed online, by anyone, for free. The title search prerequisite for getting the second mortgage looks beyond the low hanging fruit for things like aborigines claims for parcels of land that include your property. The loan agent is trying to sell you a home equity line of credit. Almost everyone gets one after building up some equity. There's often no closing cost and it's not necessary to ever use it. Keep it for emergencies.
