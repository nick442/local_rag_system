Why for years has every broadband provider and their lobbyists been against anything net neutrality. Verizon sued because of imposed net neutrality rules and won, leaving Title II the only way to enforce net neutrality. Why believe they won't just bribe congress to allow paid-prioritization, throttling, zero-rating and blocking? These broadband companies need to start putting their money where their mouth is and stop with the bullshit lobbying against anything and everything remotely pro-consumer.
