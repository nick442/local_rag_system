"My knee-jerk reaction was ""no, they are not worth it"", but I took a little time to look up what some of the trusted names in consumer electronics reviews had to say about extended warranties/service contracts. A cnet writer said that your decision should consider the price of the service contract relative to the price of the item you're buying, as well as the amount of hassle you're willing to endure, should something go wrong. Consumer Reports believes that the warranties that come with your products are almost always enough, and they say that electronics and appliances are so well-built nowadays, the likelihood of you needing extra service before you upgrade are slim-to-none. And the folks over at epinions.com offer the same maybe-yes-maybe-no advice as the cnet guys: depends on your appetite for risk and the options available to you. So I would suggest that the answer be ""no"" most of the time, but consider it anyway."
