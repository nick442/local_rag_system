As a daily slickdeals user, I saw this thread and decided it was one of those 'deals' to stay away from. The idea of people just being able to repeatedly buy giftcards using the previously purchased giftcard to get free money, just had bad news all over it. Its a shame the admins didnt get rid of that thread, as it puts a big black spot on the community as a whole, IMO.
