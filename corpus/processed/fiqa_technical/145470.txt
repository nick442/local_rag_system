"Yes..yes you fucking are. ""I want you do do something for me so I can earn a living. But I in no way am willing to help you afford even a basic living. Infact, I only want to take on people who are currently accruing massive amounts of student debt. You know, as a supplement to their other non-existent income."" You realize how fucked up that is right? I, coming from a privileged upbringing, had no trouble affording university. As a result I was able to focus solely on my studies when necessary. But, I am not the norm. I had plenty of classmates who were frequently cutting out study and sleep to work part time jobs for shithead employers who couldn't give a damn about their living conditions. As a result, they are the ones who's grades suffered. They are the ones who lost sleep. They are the ones who when they graduate at the bottom of the class and can't get a job are told by the shithead employers ""hey, maybe you should've worked harder in school"" and are then stuck in the same shit a cycle they were faced with before they started university. Only this time they are carrying some really unforgiving debt while consistently and constantly being told to pick themselves up by the boot straps and ""just earn more money!"""
