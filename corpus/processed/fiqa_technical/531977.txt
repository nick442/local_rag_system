Sure, but in the context of Uber firing 20 people, disclosing the results of an internal investigation by Eric Holder, the firing of their self-driving car VP of engineering, and the resignation of Travis Kalanick's right-hand man, Emil Michael, it was clear that Travis Kalanick was extremely close to the ledge. Not to mention the fantastic reporting done by the Wall Street Journal that detail exactly what led to his leave of absence. Nothing about the reporting on his leave of absence was misleading.
