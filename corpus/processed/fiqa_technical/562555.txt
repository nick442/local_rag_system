What bogus, what it does in years to come doesn't disqualify changes in the years gone by. Have been problematic for generations? Real income hasn't grown since 1968 in the US, with inflation in prices of goods and assets far outpacing it. Things are absolutely different between generations. My job supports me just fine housing included, maybe that allows an objective look at things for people other than myself, whereas ironically you choose to be a morally superior cunt about it. What benefit to society does that have? Have a link to your data? Although I can tell by your post you care more about being a dick about this.
