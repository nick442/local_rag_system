I disagree. I think the motivation to automate is to run a safer, more consistent operation and provide better (e.g. Faster) service to its customers. I agree, fewer employees will be needed but I could argue that the new jobs being created--likely as equipment operators--is a higher skill job (than sorting shelves) and will likely pay more.
