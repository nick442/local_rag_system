I don't know what to tell you there. But I will say for our position (in commercial banking) having 1.5 years experience programming isn't super compelling (beyond the work experience itself and initiative it shows). But that being said, commercial banking isn't complex math and there's not much opportunity to use your programming skills. I don't know what internships you applied for but I suggest joining a finance related club or something like that to demonstrate interest in the subject?
