"That's great that you have saved up money. You are ahead of your peers. I would advise against investing in an index fund. The attraction of the idea is that you will get the same return as the base item. For example, an index fund of gold would supposedly give you the same return as if you bought gold. In reality this is not true. The return of an index fund is always significantly below the return of the underlying commodity. Your best strategy is to invest in something you know and understand. There are two books that can help you learn how to do this: ""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch and ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham. Buying, reading and following the guidance in these two books is your best investment of time and money."
