This is complete horseshit.. it depends on what type of degree you get. If you get your bachelors in engineering, nursing, respiratory therapy, radiology technology, medicine, pharmacy etc.. (shit where you become skilled/certified) it is the best investment you can make. But if you get a degree in sociology, English lit, history, and other bullshit that is not practical in today's economy, then yes.. Its a god awful investment.
