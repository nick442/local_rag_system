"So the end is food, and the means is abuse? Or is the ""means"" raising an animal? Abuse is superfluous, so it can't be part of the means. And by using dogs and bears I am *illustrating* my argument (have you somehow never encountered this before?), not changing it. My argument is the same: **raising an animal for food or otherwise by no means gives you the right to abuse it**, whether it's a turkey, a cow, a dog or a cat. Do turkeys hold some kind of special abuse-friendly status for you? I mean, you've already conceded that you feel the same way towards dogs and bears, so I don't see why it matters if you think it's changing the argument or not."
