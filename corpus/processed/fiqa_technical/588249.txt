I definitely see the value from a business standpoint just not as a consumer. I don't really feel like the prices are better than anywhere else. They do have really great employees and I'm sure there's a group of people who go there for that, and I'm are that ties in to them paying a reasonable wage. It will be really interesting to see where they are in 10 years
