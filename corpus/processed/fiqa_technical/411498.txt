"The way forward in business is dumb piping...being the biggest dumbest pipe you possibly can be, this will give your consumer the ability to use your pipe any way it sees fit. E.G. Lego focuses on making a great product, it does not ""add value"" by trying to anticipate or guide consumers in it's product usage. It also does not go after resellers who find ways to meet market demand that results in the selling of more lego product. FYI this is the exact opposite of the media industries."
