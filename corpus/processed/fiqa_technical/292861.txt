"You are entirely correct that it is an assumption, so I will not argue the point any further other than to say that I don't think it's a very large stretch of the imagination to say that a more robust bitcoin ""economy"", and a larger user base would smooth it out the volatility. It seems pretty reasonable to me that the instability in prices can't be accounted for from the technology that runs bitcoin, and yet it is obvious that the current bitcoin economy is borderline abysmal. It's the things bitcoin allows you to do outside of financial institutions that give it a robustness over typical government backed fiat currencies. When we utilize this advantage, **real** people will use the technology, and a genuine bitcion economy could flourish. As a caveat to this, I'm not 100% convinced that *""bitcoins""* are the answer. To me, bitcoins are one particular brand of free (as in speech), decentralized, crypto-currencies. When I speak of bitcoins, I'm promoting the idea it represents more than this particular implementation, although I do believe bitcions (the exact software you can download and run at this moment) have the potential for tremendously more use than they're currently being used for."
