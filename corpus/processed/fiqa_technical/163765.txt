Vista Sand When Marty Robertson and Gary Humphreys, Managing Partners, bought Vista Sand in 2011 they knew there were a couple of things they needed to take care of in order to grow their business, replace the worn out mixed fleet they inherited in the purchase and have someone manage it for them. The solution was hiring Ron Lee, Director of Mining and Fleet Assets, in 2013 and creating a partnership with an equipment dealer who could maintain the equipment at minimal downtime.
