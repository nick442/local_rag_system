"USPS doesn't receive any taxpayer money. Not entirely true: http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/consumerawareness/a/uspsabout.htm ""The USPS does get some taxpayer support. Around $96 million is budgeted annually by Congress for the ""Postal Service Fund."""" Even so, they obviously don't know how to manage money efficiently. A few years ago, the usps web apis went down for 3+ weeks. If this happened to a non-government organization, they probably would have gone out of business. Here is an interesting article about medicare: http://www.smartmoney.com/retirement/planning/how-to-treat-medicares-problems--and-yours-1306871486889/ an excerpt: ""Medicare will start running out of money in 2024"" My point still stands. I don't trust any government to run a service that my life will ultimately depend on when they can't even manage simple services without running out of money. Have you ever been a part of a government-run organization? They get an allotted amount of money to use per year. If it's not used, guess what happens? They get less money the next year. So the logical conclusion for most of these organizations is to spend all of the money they get, even if it's wasteful. Everyone on the left seems to want to increase taxes, but there's absolutely no thought put into accountability. This is why to me, it feels like stealing."
