“From time to time, Netflix plans and pricing are adjusted as we add more exclusive TV shows and movies, introduce new product features and improve the overall Netflix experience to help members find something great to watch even faster,” the spokesperson told Gizmodo. One of the big reason Netflix is doing their own content is because the ever increasing price of securing television shows and the unreliability of it. Often contracts will be up and the provider decides not to renew. To include the cost of doing business in producing shows as an excuse to raise prices is little more than an excuse. Netflix is going to start spending less money retaining not Netflix shows. Just admit that costs are going up and Netflix wants more money. One side note. Netflix produces a lot of good shows. They also produce a lot of crappy shows that bomb. A better quality control would help them save money.
