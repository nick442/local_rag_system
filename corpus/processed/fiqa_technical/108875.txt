The rate itself is too small and the difference is small as well .. The cost of switching, even one visit to the Bank B, would cost you around $50 just to open an account you would have to visit once .. Think of changing if there are other benefits [like utility payments online, or integrated brokrage accounts etc] if they are same, just stick with it.
