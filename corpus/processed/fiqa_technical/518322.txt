Have you ever used a proper e-reader (not an iPad)?. The screens are generally e-ink, which pretty much just looks like paper behind a matte screen. There's no backlight, no eyestrain, and you quickly forget you're not reading a real book. It honestly just looks and feels like reading a real book. The Kindle lets you 'lend' ebooks to a friends account. I'm not sure about other ereaders, but in either case it's absolutely trivial to strip the DRM and loan a friend a book anyway. Reselling is obviously still an issue that many feel strongly about, and I'm not sure this will change. Because of the passive screen, I can get through several novels (over a couple of weeks) before needing to plug my kindle into the charger for a whopping 30 minutes to fill it back up. Unlike a smartphone there's no battery anxiety, because it lasts so long. That said, I completely understand wanting the tactile book reading experience and having a bookshelf of books. It's not for everybody, but if you're an avid reader and you haven't used an ereader before I'd recommend at least trying one out in a store.
