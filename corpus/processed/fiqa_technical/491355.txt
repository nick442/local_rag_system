"> The BPP's inflation measure is markedly different from the government's. The economists average all the prices culled online, meaning the basket of goods is whatever you can buy on the Web. (Some items, like books, are most often bought online. Others, like cats, are not.) **Plus, the researchers do not weight certain items' prices,** ***even if they tend to make up a larger proportion of household spending.*** See, that last line is where the problem with this ""alternate/independent"" system lies. It may not ""adjust"" the prices in the same manner as the CPI, but it operates on an equally flawed assumption (which at it's fundamental root is still the same as the ""hedonic adjustment""). The fact that DVD's may have dropped from $20 to $5 each, or that last years (nearly obsolete) model of a laptop computer, tablet, or cell phone has likewise dropped from $500 to $250 -- and in that sense, just like the CPI excluding/omitting things like gas & grocieries from the ""core inflation rate"" -- the BPP **similarly** creates a FALSE picture of ""inflation"" as being just a crude aggregated average of ""price changes"". The problem ISN'T that the CPI (or other indices) include ""weighting"" and ""adjustments"" -- **it is that the weighting and adjustments are biased** -- and they have been altered many times over the past decades, and the methodology being used is one that is *biased* to create a ""lower"" inflation rate (one that dismisses a ""reduction in lifestyle/quality of goods"" as being an acceptable change, rather than a sign & signal of the actual problem). >Still, thus far, the BPP has tracked the CPI closely. Yes it has.. extremely closely. So closely in fact that it beggars belief."
