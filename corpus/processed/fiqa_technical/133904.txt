Actually that's not true, though I understand what you were trying to say. Uber handles insurance and regulation paperwork, and provides loans to drivers so they can buy cars. But a can company most usually owns the cars and hires the drivers and mandates their schedule, whereas Uber connects individuals with cars to people who want rides, without owning the vehicle or managing when or where the drivers must work. The primary difference being that drivers get more of the money than with a traditional cab company and control their schedule.
