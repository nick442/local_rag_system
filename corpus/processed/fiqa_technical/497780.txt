Try to avoid actually pulling money out of your retirement savings. Not only are you paying that stiff penalty today, but you're actually stealing form your future. Many 457 plans allow you to borrow against the balance, usually up to 50% of the plan balance. I'd roll the 401k into the 457 and borrow against it if you really need the money. Borrow a little extra to help you make the first few payments if you need to.
