You should begin job searching NOW. I'm going to echo the rest of everyone here and say that the CFA is nice and all but not key to getting a job. Get networking and get experience. Without experience, you have a lot of knowledge that you've never used before in a practical setting and practical knowledge trumps textbook knowledge most days of the week.
