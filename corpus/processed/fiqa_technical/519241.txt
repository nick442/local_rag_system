"There is no official price. There is only the price a seller is willing to offer and a buyer is willing to accept at that moment. It tends to be close to the price negotiated for the last such sale, but that's just market statistics, not anything actively managed or guaranteed. ""Past performance is no guarantee of future results;"" this buyer and seller may not agree with the previous pair. Especially when the market has been closed overnight but real-world events have continued to occur."
