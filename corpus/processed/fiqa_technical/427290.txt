Science is a methodology to understand the truth. When faced with evidence that that go against your belief you change your belief to fit those facts. You doesn't try and ignore them. You don't look harder at studies you disagree with then those you agree with you look harder at all of them. Cherry picking evedence and putting science in air quotes is not how you base your argument in science. And if you don't care about the science then don't try to use science as evidence to prove your predispositions and beliefs. There is very little evidence that a certain balanced diet is better or worse for you than any other balanced diet. The only real evidence is that missing key nutrients is bad for you along with an over abundance of sugars and fats is bad for you. If your opinions are any stronger than that your practicing belief not science. If you want to be anti meat then take this approach to your argument and say meat is bad for the environment. There is plenty of evidence is there for that. But there is very little to say eating meat is bad for you. If anything meat is one of the best things for humans to eat. Way over grains and sugars.
