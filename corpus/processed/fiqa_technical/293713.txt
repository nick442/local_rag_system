Maybe the disconnect is in how different people view work and money. In the standard view, work is something negative you do, in order to get something positive - money, or at least the act of spending money gets you something positive. If the work is particularly unpleasant, one would expect employees to demand more money to cancel out the negative things they have to put up with. On the other hand, if the work itself is a net positive even before pay, then when combined with pay, the combined positive may be worth more than the raise they're offered at another company - especially if the new conditions would be poor, and would cancel out the raise, leaving them unhappier, despite having more pay. Of course, we're not a bunch of robots weighing out positive and negative units, much of which are near impossible to measure anyway. I assume a lot of it is just going with gut reactions, using approximations and fuzzy predictions in decisions that sometimes appear rational, but when looking at the underlying data points, may be built on rather irrational hand waving..
