No studies are cited about the education of corporate management. I bet you'd find a lot of those MBA's have undergrad degrees in engineering and science. The company presidents where I worked were all former scientists or engineers with MBA's, including two astronauts. Other aerospace companies were the same. The more technical the business, the more I bet this is true.
