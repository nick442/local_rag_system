"Mostly true, it is possible to make money on Uber. I made $350 on the 4th of July. I uber part time, only during peak hours. And if its not ""hitting"" early I tend to give up. I've tracked my expenses, my margin is about 55% (this is after the uber tax) and I can typically make $200~ on a Friday night. Is it great money? Nope, but I like doing it too. Now yes most Uber drivers would think its a cash cow are fucking morons."
