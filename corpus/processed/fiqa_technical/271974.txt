Thank you so much for this! Like you said, I think I have a unique story and went to CC for both financial reasons and I had some personal issues that got in the way that I had to take care of. I guess my biggest fear is the whole resume issue, I put down my CC and my major (I have a 4.0 in all my econ/accounting/business classes that transferred) and cumulative GPA, but people have told me to not list my CC GPA, although then I have nowhere to list a GPA and it omits a lot of important information and part of my story. I listed my intended coursework at UCLA and my major/minor. I have made a list of some alumni that are MDs and VPs in the LA area, and I've been looking on LinkedIn for some recently graduated students, but I don't know how much of a help the recent grads will be.
