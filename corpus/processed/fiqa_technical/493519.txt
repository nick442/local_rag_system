"Um.. I wonder why Monsanto has a provision in their licensing contracts to restrict purchasers from replanting seeds from year to year? Must be because no one ever replants seeds.. Go have a look at the Monsanto vs Schmeiser case. Not all, but a few farmers actually develop their own varieties of seeds from.. Gasp.. Their own plants! This poor sod had the misfortune if having his field contaminated by Monsanto seeds. Which he did not plant. Yes, his intent was questionable when he harvested the seeds from plants he know came from Monsanto seeds to use them for development, yet it remains that farmers do replant seeds, and fields do get invaded by the GMO seeds. Edit: should os said ""I has been said that the TPP and the TAP"" contain those provisions, as the documents aren't public, and all if this is hearsay.. From the news outlets.."
