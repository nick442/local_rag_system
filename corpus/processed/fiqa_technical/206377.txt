"Options are generally viewed as having two types of value: ""Intrinsic value"" and ""time value."" The intrinsic value is based on the difference between the strike price on the option and the spot price of the underlying. The time value is based on the volatility of the underlying and the amount of time left until expiration. As the days pass toward expiration, the time value generally decreases, and the intrinsic value may move up or down depending on the spot price of the underlying. (In theory, time value could increase at some points if the volatility is also rising.) In your case, it looks like the time value is decreasing faster than the intrinsic value is increasing. This may happen because the volatility is also going down (as suggested in the answer by CQM) or may just happen because the time to expiration is getting shorter at equal volatility. As noted by DumbCoder in a comment to the original question, the Black-Scholes formula will give you more analytical insight into this if you're interested."
