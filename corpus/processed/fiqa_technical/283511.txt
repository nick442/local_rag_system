I'm fairly intelligent, and I'm willing to work my ass off. But I only have a high school degree and no real marketable skills. I don't drink or get high, I'm not even looking to become wealthy as I'm not very materialistic, I just want to earn enough to pay for the basics, save up, and room to grow in case I ever want a family
