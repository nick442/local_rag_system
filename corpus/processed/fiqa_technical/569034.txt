So your against food stamps? Or just people working while taking food stamps? Because unless you are against either of those, Wal-Mart isn't doing anything wrong. They're simply employing an otherwise unemployable segment of the population. The fact that it is more profitable for them to employee these particular people is the only reason they have jobs in the first place. The first thing Wal-Mart will do, if they have to raise their wages, is let go many of these workers and look for better ones. They're only an attractive option at a lower price. If I'm wrong, why don't they leave Wal-Mart for better jobs? Wal-Mart didn't tell them they were worth that much. The rest of society told them that they weren't worth anything more. That's why Wal-Mart can pay them that much. Maybe, just maybe, they should stop whining about their lot and consider the course they took in life that they can only boast stocking and sliding products across a scanner on a job interview.
