That's not the whole quote: > the city is increasingly held up not as a model of China’s future but as a cautionary tale — for Beijing and its allies, of the perils of democracy, and for the opposition, of the perils of authoritarianism. * Beijing (authoritarians) see the perils of democracy * The opposition (democracy advocates) see the the perils of authoritarianism. Basically, it's a city with one foot in two worlds, and each side is pointing at the other as the obvious cause of the decline.
