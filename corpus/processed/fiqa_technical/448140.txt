both issues addressed in my original idea.. >a bunch of small any individual one won't need to scale if there are enough of them and they're deployed on a rolling basis.. think burning through a shitload of free cdn plans then canceling them as soon as they start to rack up any significant bandwidth. and it's trivial to block ***one*** of them once it's big enough to even be on your radar. but this would be hundreds, potentially thousands, moving a relatively small amount of data each. how long has netflix instant been a thing? comcast is not known for staying up to speed technologically, and i'm sure you could get plenty of heavy hitters in the tech industry to silently donate ip addresses, bandwidth, storage, etc., with all the ire comcast has raised by effectively dismantling net neutrality. hell, get enough big names involved and it wouldn't even need to be silent. what are they going to do, sue google? i'm sure that would go well for them.
