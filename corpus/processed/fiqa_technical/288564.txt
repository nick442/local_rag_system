Seems a little early. Here's my advice: if you don't feel ready, you're probably not completely ready. In that case, it would probably be best if you worked as the assistant to the president of your business for a while to learn the ins and outs. Even if you are confident, keep the current president around to help. Maybe they can occupy the vice president position while you take over ownership. You'll want somebody there who knows what's up when shit hits the fan.
