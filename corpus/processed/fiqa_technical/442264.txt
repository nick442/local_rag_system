I don't think you understand human rights. Human rights aren't something enforced on someone, they are inherent in a person's humanity. If you don't want to participate in society (pay taxes) and would prefer giving up your citizenship or spending time in jail you can choose to stop paying taxes. It is also important to realize corporations pay a smaller proportion of US tax revenue than they have since before world war 2. Corporations are not pulling their weight considering the benefits they are granted by the US Government. Your silly argument against paying taxes because you think people worse off economically then you don't deserve the joy of having a family is depressing. The United States is the wealthiest nation in the history of world and people are having on average far fewer children than in the past. Having a lot of young people is beneficial to the country. The fact their parents are forced to work so much they can't raise their children adequately is a failure of the economy and society, not a personal failure of an individual. Unless you think a poor family in Idaho is responsible for the demise of global capitalism, the financialization of the economy, and the cultural counter revolution against the working class.
