That hurt them I admit, but I think it just accelerated an already growing trend of Chipotle's quality going to shit. I've eaten there twice recently and it just tasted so bland. I did notice the whole staff was white high school kids so that may play a role, I wouldn't expect them to make an amazing burrito. No offence to them or anything but I wouldn't expect an Asian person to make an amazing lasagna either.
