>Facebook is going down hill as a site. It's constantly cluttered with ads on the news feed, Not just ads, friends' likes, which you can't shut off. It's becoming unusable to me. I counted the other day - there were 22 statuses or pictures from people I DON'T EVEN KNOW because a friend that I know clicked like on that status/pic. Interspersed with ads, it takes forever to see anything I care about, and I'm ready to be done with it.
