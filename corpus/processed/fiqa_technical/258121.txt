"First off, I originally brought up Wells Fargo to show that big banks may not want to open the floodgates for lower level employees and management to have free reign to profit off customers in less than responsible ways. I didn't mean or want to get into a debate about past govt. oversight of Wells Fargo's practices. [But to your point:](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/39782-cordray-answers-charges-that-cfpb-didnt-take-lead-on-wells-fargo-scandal) >He explained that the bureau first received a whistleblower tip in July 2013. The exposé by the LA Times wasn’t published until December. > >Cordray did add that the LA Times coverage was a “splendid piece of investigative reporting” and that investigative reporting often aides government investigations. > >After that first whistleblower tip, Cordray explained that the Wells Fargo case over time grew into something bigger. > >As the CFPB watched Wells Fargo through 2014 and 2015 in supervisory activity, it became clear the situation was serious enough to migrate into an enforcement action, he said. I'm not sure what you're talking about here: >And what are you talking about freedom to ""compete"" against the big guys? What are you even talking about and how is that freedom threatened? I'm saying they *will* have freedom to compete in ways that may have negative impact on clients who have chosen to move their investments from bigger banks to smaller ones. As for the list of ""positives"" you gave surrounding this bill, [there are also negatives:](http://fortune.com/2017/06/07/financial-choice-act/) >Congress this week is considering the Choice Act, which would roll back regulations enacted after the 2007 financial crisis, particularly those designed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Yet, the legislation goes even further and limits consumer access to information that could help them make better choices. > >One of the hallmarks of conservative regulatory philosophy is that educated and empowered consumers are preferable to government bureaucrats, regulations, and prohibitions. Yet, the conservatives in the House of Representatives appears ready to pass the CHOICE Act this week and in the process legally prohibit publishing data the government collects on consumer complaints on financial services. This is a mistake and would cost consumers and businesses. It would also go against the universal values of fair markets and informed consumers. But [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/business/dealbook/house-financial-regulations-dodd-frank.html) is what I find most concerning: >The bill would also eliminate the Labor Department’s fiduciary rule, which requires brokers to act in the best interest of their clients when providing investment advice about retirement. The first parts of the rule are scheduled to go into effect on Friday. The rule was completed last spring under Mr. Obama after years of development. My point, before you started arguing something different, was that larger banks often *need* the oversight conducted by their customers and the government in order to help them nip bad practices in the bud before it becomes a much larger issue. This may not be as much of an issue for smaller banks, but in the end, they all deal in the same industry and present the same danger to their customers if things go bad and employees don't take their intrinsic fiduciary responsibility seriously."
