Yes, very. Opening a Roth - there is a limit of $5000 ($6000 if age 50 or older) for the year as well as a phaseout based on income, starting at $105K if single, $167K if married filing joint. Of course, this is for a new deposit, the choice is this or the conversion I discuss next.. Conversion - there is no income limit. Taxes are due on the amount converted, either as income in 2010 or half the amount as income in each of '11 and '12. If any IRA money was not deducted, you add all IRA money and pro-rate the amount converted so it's not taxed twice.
