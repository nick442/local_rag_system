I'll speak for the person you replied to. You have the right answer (I've experienced enormous success doing exactly as you suggest), but you don't have all the inputs fully understood. Depression kills people and steals futures. It's not the same thing as when your cell phone breaks or your parents die, as much as those suck too. It's far more serious and equally as difficult to understand without seeing it or experiencing it. I hope this person can find a path forward. I'm one of the lucky ones, but it took a lot of hard work- the same type you are prescribing here. Mental health is a jungle you have to fight your way out of. Some people assume the jungle never ends, others die of exposure. And those who do emerge aren't the same as when they went in. But that's ok. Life goes on, you find a way to adjust, the same way you might replace a broken cell phone. I'm gonna shut up now but there's a lot that needs to be understood on what is one of the largest health issues in the world.
