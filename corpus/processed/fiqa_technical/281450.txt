This is very interesting, and I am fully in support of the US moving to a single-payer system such as we have here in the UK, but I am a little confused. US costs are markedly higher than the second most expensive country, that's clear. However, by my reading of the data presented, it seems as though no distinction is made between the government paying for health care, and the individual paying for health care. Much of that 1.4t is coming out of the individual's pocket, rather than the insurance company's, and that for me is the crux of the whole issue.
