Theres no regulations for market manipulation of bitcoin markets. You can get pretty creative with ramping, stop loss hunting, spoofing, etc. I believe all the traders use TA with a fundamental view but no amount of experience can prevent you from getting margin called due to someone dumping $50 MM of bitcoin to trigger stop losses. Half the uber drivers here in San Francisco talk about bitcoin or are invested in it, that should give you an idea about the sophistication of many of the market participants.
