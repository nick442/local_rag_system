Jeepers . .its been a tough week huh? People got really serious, with missiles flying and what not . . Hydrogen bombs in the Pacific Well thank god its Friday and our orange baby can head off for a week end holiday so he can make sense of all the big boy words, can sink his head into a soft fluffy pillow to drown out the sobs as reality sinks in and the truth is exposed . . .nothing so cool as a Russian spy op . . just a simple shmeckle puppet Melania . . .see if you can bring yourself to maybe give him a hug with out retching . . Kim was so mean to him I think he hurt his feelings and the Chinese just ran circles around him and Putin . . damn . .so cold . .he just ignored him all together If all else fails Donald, grab a bottle of shampoo and put those little hands to work, maybe if there is some left and you can squeeze out a drop or two . . .the world wont look so hostile on Monday I bet you wish you took the blue pill
