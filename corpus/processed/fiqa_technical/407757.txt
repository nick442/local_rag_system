There's no need for joint accounts to transfer money between you. You can always transfer money to him in Israel to his Israeli account. Having joint account will pose a couple of issues. If the account is in Israel - you will be liable for FBAR/FATCA reports. If the account is in the US - your son will be liable for similar reports in Israel. Joint account also means there's an ambiguity about what belongs to whom and is transferred in what direction. You'll have issues with gift tax reporting/liabilities. Your son can open a USD account in Israel and you can wire money there or send him checks (that would take longer). Or, you can wire money directly to his ILS account.
