"Michael Moore is full of shit. Companies these days are competing in a global marketplace. If you can't stay competative, you get left behind - there are no ""home countries"" and no loyalty to either any one nation or employees anymore. If your job got outsourced then I'm sorry - you were doing menial labor. Skilled work rarely gets outsourced because the Asian labor market doesn't have the skilled workforce to handle it right now. Maybe in 10 years they will, but right now the only kind of work they do is grunt work."
