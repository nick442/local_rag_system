"Wow, since I commented the down voters came for you. Sorry about that. For the record, I've been through the founding and funding of companies a number of times. Only once as a cofounder, other times as a hired gun. My perspective is that you need to go into VC funding with an understanding of what the VC's motivations are and where they are in their funding cycle. In practical terms, that means that when presented with a 50% chance to get on base or a 2% chance of hitting a home run, they'll take the 2% chance every time. The base hit is only marginally less expensive for them than complete failure. Couple that with a few other factors and the set of companies that should take VC money is exceedingly small. The problems come when companies that are marginal take money. That's when things go to pot. Valuations are bad because the company needs the money. The ""Go Big or Go Home"" syndrome sets in. VCs do flyby micromanagement, etc. In the end, money is spent, when necessitates more being raise, which dilutes everybody. Then is becomes a slog with no return for the average employee. One tip: If you every work for a company that takes a round in convertible debt, get out as fast as you can. There's nothing there. What the VCs are doing it trying to keep the company afloat until there's a (low value) sale. Being convertible debt puts them in a better position for liquidation preference and there's still a small chance they may find a sucker who will pay top dollar. It's a reasonable and helpful thing for them to do but it means the rank and file (probably including cofounders) are getting squat."
