Will your family still be involved in any way? This can be disastrous - I've seen families torn apart by a business. If they are, be sure to establish boundaries and get every one to agree to bring in an outside mediator for any major disputes. And everybody, including you, must agree to abide by the mediator's decision. You don't want to gain a business and lose a family member/family.
