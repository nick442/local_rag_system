I'm an engineer winding down to an early retirement thanks to saving and managing money well. >why you feel differently? Because unions negotiate to keep raises coming even when the economy craps out. Public employee unions are the worst. Full benefits after retirement, etc., and double dipping. Unions have worn out their usefulness except to exploit capital (or taxpayers). The Boeing case is a pathetic example of the NLRB killing American business. The EEOC is generally a group of whack jobs. Look up EEOC and Jehovah's Witnesses. Their are so many cases where they side with the Jehovah's because they can't work on Saturdays. One case that comes to mind is 5 roommates working at a golf course and after they joined, they said they couldn't work Saturday's (when everyone is playing golf and they need to be there). The EEOC gets abusive more than it helps.
