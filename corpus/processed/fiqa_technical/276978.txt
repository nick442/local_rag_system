Yes, you generally leave your computer to 'mine' through data and eventually it has gone through enough data to turn up a bitcoin.. I think there's a hard limit on how many bit-coins will ever be on the market though and if you buy one you will likely lose money if you don't sell fast since that market is incredibly volatile.
