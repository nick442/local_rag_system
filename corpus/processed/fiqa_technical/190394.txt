>Moreover, after WW2, the USA population was half of what it is today. Same size pie, smaller slices. Pies (aka total amount of resources) don't magically change sizes when populations grow. It was for this very reason that people in the 1500s were desperate to find new land like the Americas; Europe was getting overcrowded. GDP per capita is [higher than it's ever been.](http://www.multpl.com/us-real-gdp-per-capita/table/by-year). Try again. Since you didn't address any of my real points (which were labeled in bold), and are claiming bogus facts and arguing against points I didn't make (that's called a straw man argument btw), I'm now of the opinion that you're either a shill or wilfully ignorant and shan't argue more.
