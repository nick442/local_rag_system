Over my lifetime (over sixty now) I found that having both options (white- and blue-collar) available always meant I could get work. By the age of twenty-one I had two paths available; by the age of forty-five I had four. The key is to not lock yourself into one path and always be learning something new, which means having an awareness of your society and its technology *and be interested in it.* The sad truth is that most people just aren't intelligent enough to be able to so this and that is not a bad thing; we're not all the same and so can't be held to the same measuring stick.
