Yea, but that coin would be worth shit ( They'll inflate their way out of debt) and there won't be anyone wanting to buy their bonds for a long time so they'll probably print more money. Also, everybody's savings will be gone. Going out of the Euro will put them in a worse financial climate than staying in and do austerity.
