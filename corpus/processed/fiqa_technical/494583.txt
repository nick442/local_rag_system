"The big difference is that you get your money earlier at the start. Suppose you start on a random day with payday on the last day of the month (monthly), or on every 2nd wednesday (biweekly), and it takes 3 days for payroll to ""ramp up"" (ie, if payday is within 3 days on your start date, your next paycheck is not on the next payday, but on the one after). If we assume every month has 30 days (to keep things simple), it is an average of 4+5+..+33 days until you get your first paycheck with monthly pay, an average of 18.5 days. For weekly it is a bit trickier Assuming you get hired at a random date here, with * being a paydate: time until you get paid: an average of 10.5 days. So you get your first pay an average of 8 days earlier. Later on, that 3 day thing no longer occurs, and now the company holds an average of 6.5 days of your pay ""due to you"" with biweekly paychecks, and about 14.5 days with weekly paychecks if you have monthly pay. So with monthly pay, on average your bank account has 8 fewer days of your pay in it at all times. This happens when you are first hired, and persists over the length of your employment. Now suppose you save that extra money (on average): Suppose you have an investment at 4% (after inflation). Over 40 years those 8 days of pay invested at 4% grow to 38 days of pay, a free month. What more, if the company has problems making payroll, you'll get a warning (to, say, look for another job) an average of 8 days sooner, and/or have the money in your account. Having someone owe you money is usually worse than having the money in your bank account."
