I've heard people complain about how stupid the articles at Forbes are. Now I've had a taste myself. So basically Microsoft is fucked because: 1. Arnold Toynbee 2. They copy other companies 3. GM went bankrupt in 2009 because they separated management from decisions, and NOT because they took on insanely huge pension obligations over the decades since the 1950s Got it, great arguments.
