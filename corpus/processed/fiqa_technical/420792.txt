"I am reminded of a dozen year old dialog. I asked my 6 year old, ""If we call a tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have?"" She replied, ""Four, you can call it anything you want, but the dog still has four legs."" Early on in my marriage, my wife was heading out to the mall, and remarked that she was ""going to invest in a new pair of shoes."" I explained to her that while I was happy she would have new shoes to wear, words have meaning, and unless she was going to buy the ruby red slippers Dorothy wore in the Wizard of Oz, or Elvis' Blue Suede Shoes, her's were not expected to rise in value and weren't an investment. Some discussion followed, and we agreed even the treadmill, which is now 20 years old, was not an 'investment' despite the fact that it saved us more than its cost in a combined 40 years of gym memberships we did not buy. In the end, no one who is financially savvy calls a lottery ticket an investment, and few who buy them acknowledge that it's simply throwing money away."
