For some reason I really see people being more comfortable going the way of [harrison bergeron](http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html). While I'm for the abilty to enhance people, sadly I feel it'd become a much more desisive way to divide the population of haves and have-nots. You can try to sugar coat it as much as you want saying it won't happen. Company A patents Process A. Company B patents Process B and does something like Process A. Company A sues Company B and wins. Company B's product now raises in cost due to royalty payments. Both companies feel the need to keep massive war chests of money to fight over stupid shit while people suffer. Think Software Patents only in your body. Yeah, I'd love to have some enhancements. But I don't think businesses are the ones that should develop them. WELL WHO SHOULD THEN! I don't know..
