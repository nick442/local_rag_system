"I can't tell if you're just very stupid, young, or trolling. You insist that if we don't like taxes we can just, ""go to Somalia."" WHICH IS NOT TRUE. Even if I did simply want to stop being American and live in Somalia I still have to pay taxes. If it was totally free to leave you'd have a point - that I'm opting in to being here after the fact by not leaving. But that's just not the case. There is a real cost to leaving and renouncing citizenship and thus there is an aspect of being under duress to this ""agreement"" you claim we make. Edit: Do you seriously not understand that these are exit taxes that I am talking about and not your regular income/property/whatever taxes?"
