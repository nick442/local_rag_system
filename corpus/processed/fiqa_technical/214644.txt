Yeah because we really needed to sign a deal that mostly cripples our industry while allowing India/China to do nothing until 2030. And if everything was so voluntary, and none binding then what's the point of the agreement in the first place? Also like mentioned in the other thread. China is the world's biggest polluter. What exactly kind of leadership on climate do you expect from them?
