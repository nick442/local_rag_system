"Yes I thought his flow charts did a nice job with a complex system. Some thoughts: * he makes the ""if your house ran a blah blah blah"". That is a horrible analogy to make for an economy. * He quotes the revenue to debt ratio as if it is static. We are spending much more now then we traditionally do at the same times as revenues are lower than historic levels. Ratios change over time. * Either he chooses to ignore, or doesn't know, that a lot of the issues with the PIIGS comes from the aggressive use of derivative products to clean their books for the joining of the EU. Like his ARM example, now the rates have changed and those trades have moved against the sovereigns. * His lists the outcome of current monetary policy as binary. Either we inflate to infinity, and the world explodes, or we default and the world explodes. One outcome that comes to my mind is that we ease out of aggressive capital injection and move through this liquidity issue. We then pay back our debt and live on. I am sure there are many other outcomes * Almost all the problems seemed to be supply side ideas. ""banks just won't lend"". I would argue banks and even corporations have cash, but lack demand for NPV positive projects and thus are sitting on it. And or they are waiting for things to play out so they can invest with better certainty. * I thought his discussion on Current accounts was very good. We also need to remember in many of these countries you have weak and corrupt tax systems which make it hard to fund your way out of these issues. I only point these things out for others who may watch the video and want some counter points to what the speaker says."
