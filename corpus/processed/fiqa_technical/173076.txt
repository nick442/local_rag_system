Aside from cost, the real problem is lack of jobs after obtaining a degree. My degree got me low paid work. In the mid 1990's I considered getting another degree but none of the colleges I spoke to could tell me how many of their graduates got jobs related to their degree or what the jobs paid. I already had one worthless degree and couldn't see going into debt for another worthless degree.
