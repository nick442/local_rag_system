Single payer is simply meaning you pay one outlet for your care. So I go to ER and have surgery with overnight stay. I would have 10 or so different bills under the current system or with single payer one bill with the details. With out considering left or right leaning, just seems easier. What is the negative to that? I have been involved in the IT side of insurance for a long time and a considerable portion of the expenses are just for all the different parties to track billing.
