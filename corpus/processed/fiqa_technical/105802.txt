No problem, i am unemployed right now but have been applying to a lot of firms. Im trying to do wholesaling and man o man all people want is experience. i worked at my uncles deli all throughout college to help pay for college and finally my last year i got a job as a teller at a bank. That isn't good enough for people to look at me and i have a lot of good connections.
