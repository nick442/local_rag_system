"This whole thing is about subjectivity and judgement. Reed Hastings personally believes that Donald Trump is so absolutely unqualified for the job of President that he personally believes that anyone who would **proudly** vote for him has a screw loose. My point is that this isn't ""you voted for a Republican, so I want you fired"" - which is the kind of political discrimination you're talking about. This is ""you promoted the janitor to reactor safety officer, so I don't think I want you in charge of this place."""
