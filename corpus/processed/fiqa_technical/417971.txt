Maybe they want to surprise people? They have the finishing line upgrade, body line upgrade and new paint shop all either being installed at this moment or in parallel to current production work. It will take them all year to figure out how to get all the bottlenecks out of the system, but it 'seems' like they are doing a hell of a job with building out the capacity of the S/X lines. Living 10 miles from the factory I hope to see some alphaX's on the road in the next couple weeks.
