That's a dumb thesis for Klarman if it's what he's doing. What history shows is that new investors are very interested in the total debt payments you are on the hook for. The higher your debt payments, the less room there is for new payments. You clear off all debts, people are more excited to lend, because it's the previous lenders that got the pain. It's gambling. I really have no idea what Klarman is doing, we just know what happened with the Algerian situation. If Klarman is not demanding 100% face value of the bonds, but something not too much more than what he bought them for, then who cares. There's a reasonable function of debt where the debt holder who doesn't want to deal with a long term repayment plan sells the debt to be out of the stress, and the guy taking it on knows he will get an amount more that is a function of being willing to wait things out. It shouldn't be a stratospheric amount more though. Otherwise the original investor is an idiot for not waiting.
