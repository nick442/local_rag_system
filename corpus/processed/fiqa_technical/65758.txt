"Shipping Costs. Tariffs. (Mexico and US have NAFTA, so Corona comes in cheap to the country). and Local and National taxes. Corona is made in Mexico and is a short truck ride across the border to be distributed. To get to Australia, it goes much slower, and can cause more of the product to go bad before it gets there, hence the cost goes up. Same with Budweiser, except it has even less distance to travel within the states. By the way, the US also has heavy ""sin"" taxes on alcohol. I'd imagine both of these products are cheaper in Mexico. Also, I assume, you are not exchanging $1 AUS = $1 US. right?"
