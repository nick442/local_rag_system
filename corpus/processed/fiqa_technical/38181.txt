>ovarian lottery It's not a lottery. That's offensive! I am sure your mother was choosing her husband (your future father) very carefully. And so did your grandmothers, and the generations before them. You exist because there's is an entire unbroken chain of your ancestors, each carefully (hopefully) choosing their partners, and each working hard to let the next generation survive.
