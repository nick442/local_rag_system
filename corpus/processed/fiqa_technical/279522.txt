This is potentially a real risk to Google. The odds of such a huge success it decreases Google's profits are tiny (I think). But there is a real risk that the increase in Google's profits going forward are materially affected by a well done competitor to Adsense. If Amazon took away 10% of what Google's Adsense business 4 years from now would have been that is likely material to Google's earning. Not huge but real. Even losing the ads on Amazon's web site is likely noticeable (though not a huge deal I would guess to Google - though to most companies it would be a huge lose). There is even the potential Google has to reduce their profitability on AdSense to compete - giving web sites a better cut of revenue. That said I think Amazon has plenty of challenges to making it an effective competitor to Google. But they have a chance. And there is even a small chance (very small I think) that Amazon could create a competitor that actually results in noticeably (say over 15%) declining revenue to Google via Adsense. Likely even in this case Google continues to grow profit as a company overall. Google revenue from ads from their own websites are the most important earnings and likely to continue to be so. Also new business (non web-ad-income) is growing and I think will continue to do so (this is likely an area some might find more questionable).
