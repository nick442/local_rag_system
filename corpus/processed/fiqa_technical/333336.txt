Our Website : http://www.orpheumtheatreminneapolis.com Guests are asked to assist in creating a safe and enjoyable environment by reporting any inappropriate behavior to an Orpheum Theatre Usher or Security Officer. From well-known and lesser-known actors and actresses to the men and women behind the production, including playwrights, directors, wardrobe specialists, scene and lighting artists, and a score of other professionals, an investment in live theatre helps perpetuate a centuries-old craft and actually supports. It's also an investment in the arts Centre and general community that supports the theatre itself.
