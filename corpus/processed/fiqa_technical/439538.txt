It's astonishing how my simple point - _this is going to suck really badly for thousands of people_ - is somehow interpreted as some sort of approval for exploitative capitalism. As I keep saying, these old companies have to go - and in the last few years the quality of the jobs they offer has fallen and fallen. Frankly, I see a collapse coming where most of these companies vanish. _But it's going to suck for the people who lost their jobs and I feel for them._ > Think of all the unfortunate hedge fund managers who lost their jobs in 2008. Shed any tears for them? Heck, no, probably most of them should be in jail. And they won't go hungry. What's your point? The poor suckers who work for Sears are in a completely different category.
