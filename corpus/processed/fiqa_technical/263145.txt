They all have rules about what type of insurance you must have; and if you don't have the required insurance, they will offer to contract one for you. That's fair enough, I had to prove to my CU that the insurance I have was up to their standards, no biggy. Where it becomes a scam, is when i) the lender refuses to accept your existing insurance as valid no matter what; ii) buys an insurance on your behalf without asking/giving you the option of getting your own; and iii) buys an overpriced insurance (e.g., insurance for the fair market value of your house rather than the cost of rebuilding it..), likely from themselves (and possibly iv) uses this as a pretext to foreclose your house).
