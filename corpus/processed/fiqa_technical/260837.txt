"I think your very long list of possible assumptions makes a tacit point of your own: to state ""15%"" as a general value is bogus. I think, in most cases, the ""15%"" is merely a popular meme. To give any fixed number or percentage of income saved is insufficient without expanding things in the way you show. Therefore, a formula, in which at least a handful of variables can be plugged into it, seems like the right approach. (And this is what is being discussed here with the Monte Carlo method)."
