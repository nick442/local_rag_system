Bullshit. Those 16 Trillion dollars in secret loans weren't known until that audit which was forced on the Federal Reserve by Congress, and Congress and the American people weren't told that the Federal Reserve was making massive zero interest loans to foreign banks. None of that would have come out unless Congress had pushed for that audit. >A prime example is his claim that 16 trillion was lent, which is pretty dishonest. At no point was there more than about 2T lent out (from the audit itself) and at no point was the US taxpayer on the hook for over around 2T. lol. that's some prime spin job right there. Tell me this.. if I loan you $500 a night every night for 5 days and those loans allow you to earn $100 totally risk free how much have I loaned you? Does it even matter, because the end of result is I essentially gave you $100.
