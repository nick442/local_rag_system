Part A solution: Assume no turnover in A.: Average Balance * Annual Interest - Average Balance * Annual Cost of funds + Annual Fee = Profit from A Profit From A = Average Balance * Interest Rate - Cost of Funds * Average Balance + Annual Fee So for B here is the sneaky thing, the Average Balance is 1/12 of the Volume.. That makes it really simple.. Volume * InterChange - Average Balance * Cost of Funds + Annual Fee = Profit From A Volume = 12 x Average Balance So: 12 x Average Balance * Interchange (0.015) - Average Balance * Cost of Funds (0.04) + Annual Fee (Say 50)= Profit From A (260) 0.18* Average Balance - 0.04 * Average Balance = 210 Average Balance = 210/.14 Annual turnover = 12* Average Balance Come @ me bro :p
