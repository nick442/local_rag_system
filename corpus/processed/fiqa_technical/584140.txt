>If banks did not have a big brother to bail them out of loans that went bust whenever they wanted, they would be a lot more careful in who they loaned money to. That's what they became, an avenue to offload risk. The reason those banks were making bad loans was the high demand for trading in mortgage backed securities, not because Freddie and Fannie were there. They wanted to make those loans anyway, so there'd be more paper to trade. If you could transfer half of the risk of a loan you already knew was shitty to another entity, but still keep all the profits and fuck around with the derivatives, then of course you'll take full advantage. The intention behind them was to help that margin of people that fell just below the banks' historically very high standards for home lending. Banks seek high profits. Fannie and freddie were to operate at break even or slim profit, but serve a population toward upward economic mobility(which benefits everyone). When the banks' lending standards dropped precipitously due to repeal of glass steagall, creation of new exotic financial instruments and appalling lack of regulatory enforcement, everything kind of went to shit. In my view, they're much more a casualty that's become a scapegoat than a causal force.
