Fought to even acknowledge the paternity of his daughter. Screwed the ""third"" guy from Apple out of what he owed. (I forget his name.) The list goes on. I'm sorry you never got the memo, but you need to put the ipod down and actually try doing your own research, instead of trying to debunk mine without any proof.

Anywhos, feel free to spiral away in your own ignorance."
