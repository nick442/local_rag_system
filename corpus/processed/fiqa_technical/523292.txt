"The Income Tax was put into effect during the Civil War, but was later revoked because it was deemed ""Unconstitutional"". It was re-instated in 1913, just one year before World War 1. This is largely the reason why people think it was created ""for the war"", when it actually pre-dated World War 1. Edit: I don't have any sources, per-se. This is just what little information I remember from Grade 10 History class. I remember this because I had a real ethical problem with how the government instituted the Income Tax, since it is effectively a tax on Productivity. I find this absurd, since it motivates people to do less, in an effort to be taxed less. This in turn promotes workers doing ""cash jobs"" and other such things to get around it. I personally have refused a raise because it would put me into a higher tax bracket, and I wouldn't actaully see the new money. In exchange, I asked for other non-monetary perks instead. I personally think this situation should not exist. ..however, I don't have a better solution. So I suppose I can't really pass judgment. :)"
