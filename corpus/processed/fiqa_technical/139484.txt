"WF has trust in certain customers. I doubt that they will lose that trust by lowering prices, and they will probably gain other customers as well. The thing you should probably do before making your judgements is to realize that the CEO of Amazon is probably a pretty smart person and he has access to information that you don't. So maybe you should lean on the side of ""Wait and See"" before making any judgements to a certain move."
