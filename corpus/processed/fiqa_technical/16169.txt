What sounddude said, mortgage servicing companies do not get to unilaterally change the terms of a mortgage. Although I'm inclined to guess it was a simple coding error on BOA's part (wrong processing box got checked when mortgage was acquired) that was never caught, in which case BOA *should* be falling all over themselves to fix the situation (on their dime). If they don't fix it in a hurry, then I'd hope they get their head handed to them in court in a hurry.
