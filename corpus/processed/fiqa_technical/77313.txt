Sticking strictly to the money aspects. I am also assuming United States. The lender will need to know before applying for the loan that the property will be a rental, they may even need to know the scope of the number of renters. Insurance. There are two types you will need to include Income taxes. If you do run a profit you will have taxes. The surprising thing for many first time landlords is that they don't realize that the principal of the loan payment is not considered a deductible expense. Of course there is a benefit to depreciation.
