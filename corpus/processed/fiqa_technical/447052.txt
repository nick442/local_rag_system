The app market in 2017: 1. Is saturated 2. Is fragmented by millions of suppliers due to low barriers of entry 3. Is rewarding free apps over paid apps. So unless you have a solid amount of advertising budget Your choices are : 1. Paid app -> Small downloads (if at all) 2. Free app + Ads + inApp Purchases -> Shitty user experience 3. Free app -> No to low income
