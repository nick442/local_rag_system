I second this. Wooldridge is very well regarded (and a very nice guy). His grad level book is quite good as well. The other grad level staple is by Greene. Not sure if he has an introductory book. I also recommend [Ben Lambert's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpartacanUsuals). He has some playlists for a full undergraduate and graduate level econometrics course. I've watched a few videos and he does a wonderful job.
