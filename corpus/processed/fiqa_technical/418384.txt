It IS a discussion. Historically yes, A minimum wage job was able to support a family. Do you feel that only the wealthy should be able to afford to have children? With the ever widening income gap and dwindling middle class please explain how this is not a possible reality. Since you do not adhere to the classical definition of what minimum wage should provide. What DO you think minimum wage should be able to provide? And individual to live independently free of assistance at 40hrs a week? Do you feel they should have to work over time simply to afford to exist? Should a minimum wage worker have to depend on government assistance to get by (with or without overtime). Do you feel so low of your fellow human being that you'd rather see them starve than increase to a living wage?
