How hard would it be to work in either wealth management or investment banking with a master's in accounting and a CPA? My program allows for a double major in finance but at the moment the finance major is full so I won't be able to do it. I already have internship experience in both Wealth Management at Morgan Stanley and FP&A at a major corporation if that's relevant at all.
