It makes sense to me. Amazon will now have a much better supply chain for grocery products. It's been trying to get into the business for a few years now, and this is a huge step in making that entry sustainable and more profitable. I think a big reason for this buy was whole foods strong reputation and weak finances. 13B is a huge number, but a solid investment for Amazon that I can think will pay off in the long run.
