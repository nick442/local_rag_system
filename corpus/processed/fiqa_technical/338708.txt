Quant here The best undergrad for getting into MFE is mathematics, second best physics, etc.. I think you get the trend here. There are computational finance PhDs which blend math, finance and programming which IMO are a much better value for money (because they are free). Also masters level courses concentrate on breadth rather than depth. They are good for consulting, starting out at a desk etc. PhD programs are for academics and for more in depth model building. Take math, lots of it. Use your summers to get internships and built networks and experience.
