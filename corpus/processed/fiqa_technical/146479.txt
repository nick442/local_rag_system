From what I read, if the monthly average of the stock falls below 1 dollar, it can be delisted from the NYSE, which of course means you lose everything. I've been playing this same stock on a day by day basis. Twice I've finished up 15% on the day, with AMR, but I don't plan on being able to do this for much longer though. I dumped it all today just in case they decide to remove it this weekend.
