>World war 2 was what carried america out of the great depression. Not really. The end *results* of world war II did (basically the destruction of ALL economic competition), along with the (fortunate) improvements in productivity (the advent of gasoline tractors in agriculture, etc) -- but the war years were ones of a combined voluntary/forced austerity & centralized planned production (the vast majority of what was produced being destroyed or squandered). >Anything's possible, people do desperate things when they're hungry, most people will resort to cannibalism within 2 weeks without food. No. Most people will resort to a lot of other things first. And then, those failing they die of starvation. Cannibalism is (and always has been) a relatively rare thing. >It's too unpredictable, but my bet is that the coming collapse will be multiple times worse than the great depression. Yes and no. Probably longer in duration (20 to 30 years rather than ~10) -- and no doubt some significant parts of the infrastructure will deteriorate to the point of collapse. What (in political & economic terms) comes out the other side of that is what is REALLY unpredictable. There will almost undoubtedly be some type of dictatorship police-state in there (most likely DURING the depression, making it longer & worse, before it implodes & gets better), but whether it would survive & remain (or be replaced by yet another) in the aftermath is the big question.
