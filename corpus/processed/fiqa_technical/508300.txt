"> people these days believe income is a human right or something. I believe a full day's work for a living wage is a right, yes. Do you think a full day's work for a non-living wage is moral? > if you are not happy with the amount of income you currently make, stop using the internet to bitch about it and use it to better and add value to yourself. Your argument ignores the possibility that the game is rigged. People can do things to get a better life in the Hunger Games but that doesn't mean they are fair/moral or part of a society I want to live in. > The idea of ""a fair share of income"" teeters on communism, if you ask me. In our society we need farm workers, ditch diggers, security guards, and dishwashers. It seems fair to me that if society needs these positions filled then they should pay a wage that allows these workers to be part of the society they enable. I think doing anything else is barbaric."
