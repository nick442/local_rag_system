My wife and I chose to share all bank accounts and credit cards. We did so because we realized that, over the course of a marriage, the pendulum of who is the primary breadwinner may shift repeatedly. Having one account gets us in the habit of thinking about our needs and wants together and eases any transitions that may come as one or the other of us quits a job/returns to school/reduces hours. I should also say that this system would likely not work well if either partner has semi-compulsive spending/consumption habits. I'd recommend separate bank accounts with a joint account for your mortgage in that situation.
