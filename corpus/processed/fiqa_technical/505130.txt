These places are being ruined by places like Smash Burger, Chipotle, and Blaze Pizza. Let's not even talk about the food, the service usually sucks and why should we sit down and have to tip someone for that service? Now let's talk about food, I don't see much of a difference in quality between fast-casual and comparable items at restaurants like Applebee's, Friday's, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Chilli's. You can also argue that perhaps Wendy's or McDonald's has improved it's quality enough to be considered close in quality. Obviously you're not going to get a steak at a fast-casual place or McDonald's but why would select Applebee's if you are longing for a steak?
