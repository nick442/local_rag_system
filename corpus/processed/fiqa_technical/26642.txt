The funny thing is, if someone came into the front door of a bank branch and committed a robbery in which they stole a fraction of that much, he'd be spending a lot more time in jail. People who abuse their positions of trust to steal far more are getting off with a slap on the wrist. Something is fundamentally wrong there. [Edit: I left a word]
