Hah. So, public employees get less rights as employees than private ones? What about private employees of companies with public contracts? I'm guessing that you don't think private employees should have the right to bargain either. How is having collective bargaining rights holding the public hostage? Hyperbole much? We're bound by the same arbitrators. Cops and Firefighters can't strike.
