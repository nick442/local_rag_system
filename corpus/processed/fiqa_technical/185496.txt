The introduction of saltwater and invasive species through the canal would essentially kill off most of the native flora and fauna while also removing a major source of freshwater for much of the country, the impact of both of which should also be obvious. Besides the impact directly on Lake Nicaragua, the canal would also [potentially cut through as of now protected nature reserves.](http://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/7.15580.1392661800!/image/Canal-2.jpg_gen/derivatives/fullsize/Canal-2.jpg) According to Nature, ""[t]he excavation of hundreds of kilometers from coast to coast.. will destroy around 400,000 hectares of rainforests and wetlands,"" as well as threatening the survival of numerous native species, threatening other industries including tourism and sport-fishing. I could continue but this post is already longer than I planned on writing, so suffice it to say that anyone who say this is an unqualified positive for Nicaragua is either uninformed or being deceptive. Whether these consequences are worth it for the upside is an entirely different discussion, but these consequences are not to be disregarded lightly.
