The number of government departments involved in anything the US (or any government) does is bewildering, but the invasion of Iraq was, by definition, a military venture intended to overthrow their leader and change the regime. The exit strategy was to attempt nation building to achieve stability. The US military acts for the US government, as do other departments and to muddle the question by listing departments is to miss the point – which is privatization of government functions, be they military or just involved in military ventures. If the contractors weren’t really required but were hired anyway….I don’t know how that’s defended. The fact remains: *security functions were outsourced*. That doing so is efficient or not is a good debate, but another debate.
