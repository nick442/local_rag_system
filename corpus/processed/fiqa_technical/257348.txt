"I was going to argue about the ""intent to execute"" but when I read Denninger's argument carefully, I was forced to agree. To the extent that the SEC rules are requiring human intention (should they?) then yes a time limit like 2 seconds (or even longer) can make sense. It's a kludgy solution though."
