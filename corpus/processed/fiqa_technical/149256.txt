Na√Øve? I imagine I'm a few decades older than you are. And I'm pretty sure you've never lost your job with a family to feed or you wouldn't be so cocksure that the loss of thousands of jobs was an unalloyed good thing. I also addressed his point perfectly well in my last sentence. To clarify it for you, yes, I believe that bad businesses will have to go, and since most of them today are bad, there will be a collapse and millions of people will suffer tremendously. It's inevitable but it's really hard not to feel for the people who are suffering now and the millions more who will suffer in the future. My only hope is that some sort of better system will come out of the ruins..
