Yahoo's share price more than tripled under her watch. ($15.45 in July 2012 when she joined, $54.02 when she left). Contrast that to the previous 5 years where it was cut in half ($31 to $15 between 2007 and 2012). You have to go back 17 years to 2000 to find Yahoo being at the $50+ mark again. Microsoft has only doubled in the last 5 years, Google is up 3.5x which is slightly behind Yahoo as well. Say what you want, but to stockholders, she has been good.
