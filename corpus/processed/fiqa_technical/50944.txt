He's trying to create a compensation system that is as fair as possible. >I can see certain benefits too, but look - as an employee, I want to work in an environment where I can advocate for myself and, occasionally, negotiate for better compensation. **Some people aren't good at these things, and frankly, that sucks for them. I'll eat their lunch if they let me.** What you're saying is you want to work at a place that rewards the skills **you** have. This is a very selfish perspective, but at least you're honest about it. Of course you want to work somewhere that pays you more than other people. However I don't see how it benefits the company to reward employees that are good at negotiating salary. I'd rather have employees that are good at making product.
