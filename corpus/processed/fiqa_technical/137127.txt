Two weeks of maybe 2-4 hours a day. Tried to read the book and got through like 2 chapters. Primarily took 100 question practice exams, read the questions I got wrong, then took another exam. Passed with an 86 and it only took like 2 hrs to get through. Probably matters quite a bit if you have a finance background though. No idea what it would be like without one. Edit: used the Knopman Marks books (which use Q bank for exam questions). Edit 2: Sorry, that was the series 79. And I only got an 82.
