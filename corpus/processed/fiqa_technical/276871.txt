">Many economists will dismiss this paper on methodological grounds: ""You can't learn anything by asking people about their behavior in hypothetical scenarios."" I say these economists are being insufferably dogmatic. Yes, people exhibit social desirability bias; they overstate their virtue when they don't have to put their money where their mouth is. But that's a lame reason to ignore their words entirely. Trying to deal with counterarguments by simply preemptively expressing awareness of them instead of addressing them is a rather lazy debate trick."
