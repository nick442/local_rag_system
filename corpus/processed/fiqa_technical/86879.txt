"Amazon lets you ""buy a season pass"" with some discount. It has good HDTV selection. Of course it course it costs more than buying the DVDs or paying for netflix. You are paying to see them when they will have value. It's not a market failure it's how the market makes money. A lot tech markets do this, including Steam. You want Skyrim, 60 bucks please. You don't bitch that they are offering Oblivion for 20 do you? You aren't going to get it for Netflix or even DVD prices because online views canalize tv viewership. Netflix and DVDs are seen as ""extra"" revenue. Money they make in addition to ratings advertising money. They are basically the clearance rack of the media world. It's like demanding the latest fall fashions at their spring clearance price. It's not going to happen. These shows are going for 2 bucks a pop. Assuming cable costs 60 bucks a month, you can get rid of it and instead buy 2 shows a day. If you put up a free antenna, you can go even longer by DVRing network stuff. The pricepoint is pretty good. You can't price TV shows at 10 bucks a month unlimited because we already paying way more than that for cable. There wouldn't be enough revenue to make all the shows that are currently being made. The mess is just different competing services which is good. It'll drive prices down and give alternative payment models. Hulu lets you trade your commercial viewing for free stuff. Netflix gives you cheap old stuff. Amazon lets you have whatever you want if you pay for it."
