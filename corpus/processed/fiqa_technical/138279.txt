> Ignorance is unbecoming. Then why did you choose to display it? Okay so there are a variety of different drug tests and they test for different chemicals and they have different prices. The majority of drug tests issued by the majority of employers are for Marijuana because A> That is the cheapest, and B> Marijuana can be detected a few weeks after the last use. Other drugs tested for such as Cocaine, Heroine, LSD, Alcohol and so on cannot be detected more than 48 hours after usage.

After the effects of the drug wear off they are no more dangerous than anyone else. Please, stop with your bullshit.
