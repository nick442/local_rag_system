"The Bank of Canada does not ""set"" the interest rates. They auction government debt, and then report what the average yield/interest rate was (rounded to 25 basis points). [The average yield of yesterday's auction of 3-month Treasury bills was 0.76%](http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/t-bill-yields/). I don't know why the news tries to interpret what the BOC ""is trying to say"". BOC isn't saying anything - just reporting what happened, with some filler words."
