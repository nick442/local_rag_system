At sixty, you are in a different generation, where at least early on loyalty was rewarded. I sit between the x and y generations, and never have I ever felt a sense of loyalty FROM an employer. We all know the score, they'll fire me in a heartbeat if it helps the quarterly numbers, and I'll bail if I can get a better deal elsewhere. I only stick it out if the deal is good, or I don't want to have to explain a short tenure on.my resume. I'm not gonna tough it out with a struggling company if they can't give me my market value, because I know they'll kick me to the curb if I'm in need. There really is no loyalty anywhere in the system anymore, unless your a sucker. Loyalty MUST go both ways, and employers are the ones who gave up on it.
