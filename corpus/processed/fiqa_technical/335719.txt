Just speaking from personal experience, I see this happening. My wife and I have cut spending basically as much as possible. We don't go out to eat, we don't go to the movies, we only buy what we absolutely have to and often that is from thrift stores, we make everything we reasonably can home made, etc. We just don't have the money. I blame student loans, the fact that in two years of employment here I haven't gotten any raises even though we normally get one every year (from what I'm told), and her super low paying teaching job.
