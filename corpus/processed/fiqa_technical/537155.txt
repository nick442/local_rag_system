>*A deal for $1.5 billion or more has finally been reached to sell the Market Basket chain to ousted CEO Arthur T. Demoulas, ending a knockdown, drag-out family feud, a source told the Herald last night.* >*The deal came after a late night board meeting following a long day of emotional ups and downs.* >*“It is official. We’re going back to work,” said Joe Garon, a company buyer who was fired July 20 when he protested the ouster of Demoulas. “We’re going to come back stronger than ever. It will take us a few days, but I got the word we’re going back to work.”* >*Demoulas was ousted as CEO by a board faction controlled by his rival cousin Arthur S. Demoulas on June 18. A month later, a mass protest and work stoppage by employees effectively shut the chain down. Customers largely stopped shopping at the 71 stores. Negotiations for a sale dragged on for weeks.* >*Arthur T. submitted a bid that would pay $1.5 billion for the 50.5 percent shares controlled by Arthur S.* Cross-post from /r/MAConservative
