Sorry you’re getting downvotes. At least the movie cites studies and sources which is a lot more than any of the people I see calling it a ‘scam’ or pseudo science are doing. Down voting you makes them feel better - because you know upvotes of majority is what defines what is true and what is ‘science’ in these parts. Merchants of Doubt is a good documentary as well to watch.
