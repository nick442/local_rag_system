Where are you getting this statistic about it being a high paying job ON AVERAGE? There are many many many dipshits with finance degrees working in fund accounting making 30K a year, with absolutely no prospects. Also - when OP realizes what a dogshit career finance is for MOST people (pay is nowhere near what people think it is, and the lifestyle is hell), and that its dominated by morons with deep pockets, he will need something to fall back on.
