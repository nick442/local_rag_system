Always the same bank. Started in a technology/IT related role on the trading floor. It was a long time ago. That part was luck. I didn't actually look to work on a trading floor specifically. I was interviewed, they hired me. After that, it was a lot of hard work and I basically changed industries while staying on the same floor.
