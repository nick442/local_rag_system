>Most of their inventory is actually downmarket or discounted white-label merchandise that TJ repackages, rebrands as their own, If one of my professors was right, he said this was a common business model, although the re-packaged products would be the generic brands, like Target's Up & Up or Walmart's Kroger brand products, and be sold cheaper, instead of what TJ is doing, selling them at a higher price. Target, for example, does not have their own factories to produce their own, Target-brand toilet paper, cereal, or hand towels. Instead, they just buy merchandise another company makes and repackages the products using their generic, Target-brand packaging.
