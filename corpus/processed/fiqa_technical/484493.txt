Thank you for this. Very grounding advice. I'm about 30 years from retirement and I am indeed trying to time the market. Your advice was just what I needed. Thanks for telling me what I should have already known (stay calm and bugger on). Also, a good night sleep and a run helped clear my head. But seriously, thx.
