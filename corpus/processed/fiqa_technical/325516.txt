So you're fine with curtailing free speech just because you're unhappy with the way they're treating Trump? What kind of over-sensitive snowflake bullshit is this? Unfair? He's the leader of the nation, he should act like it and show some resilience and strength and instead of crying about 'waaah they don't like me!' and banning dissenting voices. You think Reagan or Bush would do any of that?
