Maybe not exactly out of the ordinary, but 'What is the biggest mistake you've ever made' is a good one. You wouldn't believe it, but some people actually say 'I don't make mistakes'. Obviously the answer should not just be the mistake, but how you fixed up afterwards and what you learnt as a result.
