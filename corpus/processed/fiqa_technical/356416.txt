">Annnnnnd if you think about it a lot of the red and blue section went into shoring up bank balance sheets. Why? I can't prove it yet but i suspect twas to support the derivatives market and keep it from collapsing. This is [my thought as well], in addition to the interest on excess reserves being used as a surreptitious means of ""recapitalizing"" the TBTF (which won't work, of course, as Dimon has demonstrated)."
