I think it should be as well but I wonder how much more doping contributes to a win in Cycling versus other sports such as soccer. I could be wrong but I would think that with regards to winning, sports such as cycling have a greater weighting on physical performance and though it is also important in sports such as soccer, there is also a great weighting on skill and teamwork.
