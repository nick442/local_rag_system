Wrong. $$$ is a tool, not an end in and of itself. The moment you think otherwise, you become the cliche of an evil, short-sighted, self-absorbed businessman for real. And your employees ARE your business, the same way a carpenter's tools ARE his trade. Its a poor carpenter who doesn't take care of his tools, and its a poor businessman who doesn't take care of his employees. EVERY business is ultimately about people. Good long-term relationships with people matter more to your bottom line than short-term profits at the expense of those people. Not just your customers, but your employees, freelancers, suppliers, etc. Small business owners, at least the successful ones, understand that. Corporate tools like yourself (talking about paid vacations and workers like they're separate from you is a sure sign of that) think its all about $$$ and nothing else.
