Theta is a variable in options pricing. Theta aka time decay decreases over time. The reason of this is that you have to think of the option as insurance. It is a hedge against actual holdings in an asset. Would you pay more or less for insurance that covers you for a year's time, would you pay more or less for insurance that covers you for a week? The answer is that the market will pay less for insurance that covers them for a lower period of time. This is one of several ways of thinking about it. There is also the probability that the option will be profitable at all, the further out in the future, the more likely it will be profitable and people will pay a premium for it. There are other variables in the black-scholes formula and it is the most widely used options pricing formula. But keep in mind, the geniuses that made up the formula blew up their hedge fund thinking they could sell the options at an inflated premium from their own formula to everyone. Ironic really.
