A big part of why the insurers are pulling is is the uncertainty. The ACA model worked in MA and is based on market forces. There is no reason it shouldn't succeed other that being actively sabotaged by the GOP. No legislation this big works out of the box yet this one has not been allowed to improve for 8 years and the GOP was rewarded for that sabotage. If the insurance companies had clear understanding of the marketplace for the next few years you would not have this problem. There are changes that are needed. IMO first thing is to get rid of the employee mandate. If it was up to me Id change it so no company would offer health insurance. I don't get my car insurance through work why do i get my health insurance from them. But that is long term and we need to ease into it. There are other issues as well but they are all fixable. The overall costs are an issue and that is not addressed in ACA at all. That I don't have an answer for but the ACA didn't make it worse.
