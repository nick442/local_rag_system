I think this is going to be a Rorschach test on what people think happened during the crisis. If you believe that the crisis was caused in large part by government seeking to put more people in housing and stop what was viewed as discriminatory practices in lending, you are most likely to be against this. If you think the housing crisis was caused in large part by systemic fraud, you are more likely to be for this.
