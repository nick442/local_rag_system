Probably to some degree, but if it isn't connected to the internet it's much more difficult. They can't legally listen to you without a wire tap warrant, but they could ask Microsoft to listen, record, and share your information since you gave Microsoft permission to constantly listen in. And it isn't just the government. Who knows what Microsoft is listening for. Target has used purchase records to [figure out who is pregnant](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/). Microsoft would have a perfectly legal way to spy *much* more intrusively than Target. [Polls show](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/polls-continue-show-majority-americans-against-nsa-spying) that government spying (the NSA issues being the most well known) are a big concern. I'd be very surprised if I was the only one came to the same conclusion. And yes. Microsoft changed their policies on the constant internet connection and mandatory always on Kinect, but I think the damage was already done.
