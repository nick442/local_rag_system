Will having a lower credit limit, which I will still never reach, negatively impact my ability to get a mortgage in future? This would increase your utilization, the percentage of your total available credit that you use at any one time. Because it decreases the divisor, your total available credit, while not changing the dividend, the amount of your credit that you use. In the United States, you generally want utilization to be between 8% and 30%. So if this increases your utilization, it could hurt your credit score (or if your utilization is low enough, possibly help it). I do not know if the rule is the same in the United Kingdom or not, but this site claims that it is at least similar. 22% is an OK utilization, assuming you have no other debt. But a utilization of 17% is closer to 8% and may be better. It may be worth calling them to keep your credit limit where it is if they don't ask too much from you.
