> Tax rates do make a difference between whether to invest here or in Ireland. Not actual investment, but if you have the discretion to chanel profits to a lower taxed jurisdiction (necessarily a loophole that can be closed), then you may structure transactions accordingly. > he money that American businesses profit overseas stays overseas instead of being repatriated because the taxes are too high to justify paying them before reinvesting the money in the economy. That is an issue that is also independent of tax rates. Providing incentives to bring money back is unlikely to finance any new investment though. There are loopholes that allow using foreign assets (cash especially) to fund foreign loans that can finance any desired investment. Still, even if repatriation is used for stock buybacks and dividends that would be more money flowing into the US, though not really money flowing to people who spend a high portion of flows (rich investors). But just because there are reasonable arguments for tax reform encouraging repatriation and HQ locations as at least not being harful, does not support also including the genuinely directly harmful effects of cuts to tax rates.
