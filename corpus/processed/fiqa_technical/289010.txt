Plain and simple, go into business. I was in the exact same boat as you 5 years ago. Was going to school to become a Pharmacist while working in a Dominick's pharmacy as a tech. Absolutely hated it and did not see myself standing behind that counter for the rest of my life. Not to mention that a pharmacists job will be one of the firsts in the medical field to be automated. Left pharmacy school to start my business degree. Got a couple of sales jobs for the experience while completing my bachelors. Now I'm working in Chicago as a commercial real estate broker. The plan is to work in this for the foreseeable future, and then parlay this career into my own business ventures and real estate investing and build from there!
