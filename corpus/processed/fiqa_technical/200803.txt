Ah, I am coming from the fund side of things. The PMs do make some serious coin, but below that, once you factor in commissions, it is just silly. I actually worked on the compensation model for a certain fund company and I couldn't believe the disparity. I suppose it depends on how the titles are distributed, perhaps it is a Canadian thing. The traders title at the other two companies where I worked were entry levelish. Although they did make about the same as the research analysts if they performed as to plan.
