Well, sure, but that rate won't continue for the next 18 years. A lot of the increase in public school cost is due to government funding cuts and the increase stops once funding reaches 0%. When you look at private schools, say [Stanford](http://facts.stanford.edu/chron.html#tuition), the average over the last 18 years is 4.6% a year - higher than inflation (2.3%) for sure, but no where as bad as the overall numbers would suggest.
