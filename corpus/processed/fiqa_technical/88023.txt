Oh Jesus..the FBI (yes, the FBI) thinks there's a huge chance that Russia tried to rig the election so they appointed a special council to finding out. So fake news? Not at all. And wow. Obviously, a trumpette will bring up Hillary. Guess what, they did cover that. They just don't circlejerk over Hillary like Fox News does. Just because it challenges your flawed views doesn't make it fake.
