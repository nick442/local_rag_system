"It doesn't make a lot of sense to buy a house/condo and rent it out now. On the other hand, I think finishing your basement and then renting it out is an excellent idea. The ROR is excellent as long as you can deal with the ""strangers"" in the basement, have the extra driveway space and negative association with renting out your basement. HTH"
