Here is my personal opinion. Please take what I say with a grain of salt. I've been in your position before so I had to rewire myself. With that said, all your poor decisions were made in the past. Certainly, today, there are consequences that you are facing for the decisions you made, but still, they were in the past. So, you CAN eat and you CAN live. Perhaps, not to your liking but this is a rare opportunity. You see, (I am assuming your American), we Americans often feel that more in life means more happiness. But being in debt like you can show you that there is another path. Just having enough. Things like, enjoying every bite of the meal you just ate, or enjoying every moment while you're not thinking about the poor decisions you've made in the past will help you greatly in the future. I found that because of my debt problems living in the present moment was the only way I could stop myself from loosing all sanity. In fact, because of that I started to not focus on how to get out of debt, but how to live with debt. It became much easier once I was able to naturally accept that there is debt, and it will be paid someday, but this is how life is and it doesn't bother me. I found that by letting it go, eventually not only the mental problem, but the debt began to solve itself. I know it sounds like mumbo-jumbo, but doing everything as a small step, for example, when you get in the shower today, feel the hot water. I mean like, REALLY FEEL IT. You have HOT RUNNING WATER. Think about the hot water and how good it is. This is the moment. Maybe tomorrow you won't have hot running water, but that's ok because IT'S NOT TOMORROW, it's today. Doing it like that, with everything, saved me from most likely something horrible. Hth you a bit.
