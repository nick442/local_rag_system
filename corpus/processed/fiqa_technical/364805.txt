"1) there are 4 separate unions that represent USPS employees (American Postal Workers Union, National Letter Carriers Association, National Postal Mail Handlers Union, and the National Rural Letter Carriers Association) so careful saying ""the union"" here because it makes your argument incorrect. Which union are you talking about? 2) Democratic support is not a good gauge of union support these days. Conservative Democrats that like to cater to business interests vote against unions all the time."
