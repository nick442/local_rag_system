I'm not arguing against your position. I'm just curious how government will be able to fix a situation like this, in your opinion? It seems like, at best, the status quo is the only thing politicians can agree on. This obviously isn't working out well for everyone else who isn't a politician, investor or captain of industry. EDIT: The reality of the situation seems to be that the ruling class doesn't care about the domestic working classes. They've shed any social contract that traditionally existed between them. The Russia probe against Trump isn't about Russia or Trump. It's about delegitimizing the American Voter who dared vote for someone that the ruling class didn't approve of. The fact that Hillary Clinton's emails were leaked is irrelevant to the fact that the content of the emails is what may or may not have swayed voter opinion.
