I'll repost a [comment I posted the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/6pmtzr/askuk_weekly_what_makes_0_sense_to_you/dkv8qg6/?context=2) regarding Snapchat, as it fits just as well here.. > > Ah, snapchat before it got monetised. > I don't even think it's that. > Tech companies that become popular tend to go on hiring sprees and all those new developers feel compelled to justify their existence within the company. As such they start churning out additional 'features' that nobody asked for and which only serve to complicate their service and turn their product into the very thing people were trying to get away from when they started using the service in the first place. > ..then the 'next big thing' comes along and the cycle repeats.
