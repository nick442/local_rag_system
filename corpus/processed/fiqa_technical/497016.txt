You're missing the point. You can't save any money if you're required to spend all of it. Most costs like housing, transportation, utilities, etc. are highly fixed. Beyond illegally violating fire codes (what the Mexicans generally do) or building codes theres very little you can do. Unless you loosen the laws for flop houses but I'm quite certain many white home owners would be against that.
