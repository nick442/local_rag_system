Exactly, it's not like there's a shortage of rental properties or housing opportunities. There are a few hundred (if not thousand) within a 5 mile radius of my house alone, and they certainly don't all have the same terms. Maybe you're not going to get into a gated white collar community, but I'm pretty sure you can secure a nice place in a nice neighborhood even if your credit score is somewhere between ass and the toilet.
