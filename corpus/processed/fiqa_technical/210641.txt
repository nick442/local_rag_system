Apple earns over half of all the profits in the mobile space, and there won't be much profit in cheap devices no matter who makes them, although volume will help a little. At some point they will have to go downmarket but only once the more profitable users are completely served. Note that they currently use older models to do this. A random data point: half of all phones in the US are smartphones. That leaves the other half to conquer.
