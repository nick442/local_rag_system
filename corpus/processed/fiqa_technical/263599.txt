Find trends, get to the front - as they are becoming trends, get the T shirts exposure in those market areas. T shirts need to be basically good quality but what really sells them is what goes on them. That's primarily design - words and pictures. Also have a look at the Vistaprint business model - high volume, low cost, quick turnaround, fully customisable. Have a walk around markets. I don't know what part of the world that you are in, however I have seen a few good T shirts words wise but with poor presentation in the Paris shops and markets. Paris \ France does not have many French language T shirts, however the French aren't so much into T shirts (except perhaps when they are at the beach). Be ingenuous and creative.
