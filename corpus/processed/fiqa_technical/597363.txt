In addition to these fair points the argument that you can simply not buy from the unethical business breaks down in our current intermingled society. If I don't like Monsanto I can't simply stop buying their seeds (since I'm not a farmer and in lots of cases I'm pretty far removed from that stage of the process) yet their practices effect me in lots of ways and there's nothing I can do about it at the purchase level.
