Yes, the supply side is probably permanently restricted, and if NIMBY/regulations eased, there might be a temporary dip in prices (possibly even something that could be regarded as a bubble pop, but in reality that is very unlikely.) The self-regulating system I see is on the demand & employment side; companies can't keep raising wages but still require the workers, so they will have to sort workers by location: executives, creatives, and professionals in large cities; back-office white-collar in suburbs and/or smaller cities and production/manufacturing in rural areas.
