It's the result of many companies now outsourcing production to the same contractors. It's easy to see in electronics (Foxconn, Blackberry Playbook/KindleFire, etc) and happens in other industries as well. As our communication technology increased over the last century, it became easier and easier to contract out production. Now it is easy to choose any supplier/contractor in the globe for the production of your product. As suppliers/contractors begin to optimize and specialize, they become the dominant solution for their sector. This then leads to that product uniformity, which is close to working very nicely as a term.
