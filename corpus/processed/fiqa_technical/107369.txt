Also mediocre selection of most products. I for one, want high end items. I go to Best Buy and always have to settle with high marked up middle of the road times (in most of my personal experiences). There is great value in having local stock, but if I can wait 2 days for shipping, not have to travel 15+ miles to a Best Buy, I am happy to order online.
