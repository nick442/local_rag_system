> it is very common to see top reddit comments that are verifiably false, on financial subjects or otherwise This is the biggest problem with Reddit in subreddits that aren't heavily moderated. You can't do that everywhere though because then people start screaming about censorship, I don't know what the solution is. I just hope most people realize something isn't a fact just because a bunch of people upvote it.
