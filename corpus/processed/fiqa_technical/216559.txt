This sort of question pops up with every new or sexy technology, and it's born (IMO) from the misguided opinion that a growth industry is a source of huge, guaranteed profit. The reality is that, even in rapidly growing tech sectors, there is a high infant mortality rate. A lot of balloons go up, many pop, some drift far off course, some get tangled in the branches.. and a few rise to the heavens, making the early investors look like supergeniuses. Some very few of them were! They did their research, they made calculated risk assessments, and they chose AAPL over competitive companies. Some bought AAPL near the IPO through luck. If your investment strategy idealizes these guys, go to Las Vegas and bet on red. Red never fails. Plus: you'll get free drinks, a buffet, and a nice stage show while you go bankrupt. But in general, companies within a new, rising sector like marijuana dispensaries/farms/whatever aren't guaranteed growth. Do your research, and diversify your investments!
