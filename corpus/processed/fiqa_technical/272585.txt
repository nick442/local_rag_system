>Why not give extra tax breaks for the sale of stock purchased during a public offering (since that goes to helping the company) but not for secondhand (less necessary) trading Because secondary trading determines how easy it is for companies to raise additional money and it also allows the company to manipulate private vs publicly held stakes in their company. >Should we give big tax breaks to people who lend businesses money? There's a difference between lending money and investing in a corporation. Furthermore the income tax code when it comes to lending money via bonds is a complete mess. Corporate bond coupons are taxed like regular income (although the principal return is, of course, tax free). Federal and munis are taxed differently. There is also the advantage that you do get a tax break in the event of default, so any additional risk you take on has some marginal tax benefits.
