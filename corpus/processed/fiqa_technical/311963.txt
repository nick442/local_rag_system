So why is it my problem to worry about people who's situation is worst than mine. Sorry I don't share your humanitarian view but I worry about myself and those close to me. Trust me I got what you were saying with your scenario, but I don't agree with it. I don't think the government has the right to dictate how someone spends their money or where their money goes. And obviously the rich don't spend as big of a percentage of their wealth as others, but the overall amount they collectively spend has to be a sizable portion of total consumer spending. Since you're fan of hypotheticals, here's one for you: Let's say consumer spending for the US is $1B. I would say that 75% of that comes from the top 10% of wealthiest individuals. Do you see my point now? Get a little more butt hurt that some random person doesn't share the same opinion as you
