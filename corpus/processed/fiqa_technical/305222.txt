"Buying a piece of equipment is not a capital loss. You now have an asset that you can sell for some percentage of the original price. For most assets, that value decreases over time, and you can ""write off"" the depreciation of the value each year. So you can deduct the depreciation of the asset from your business's income, which would then get passed on to your personal taxes (reducing the profit from your business). If you don't plan to use the equipment for some time, you might be able to depreciate the equipment based on the amount of usage, but I'd check with a CPA in your area to be sure."
