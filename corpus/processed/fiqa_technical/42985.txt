Most of the commercials that I see online are for really expensive shit that I can't afford anyway (like luxury cars).. so it's kind of a moot point. I wouldn't alter my behavior in any way (either positive or negative) due to a commercial. Sure, they're a minor annoyance, but if I saw my favorite cereal in a commercial, I wouldn't boycott it.
