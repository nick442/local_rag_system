Here I am in China as a head teacher turning 30 next week. I gotta ask myself if he is really happy. I have an easy life, I'm paid and treated with respect and I'm doing okay. I can't imagine the burden of responsibility he must be feeling right now. If he made it there at 29 he must be an exceptional individual. I wish him the best of luck.
