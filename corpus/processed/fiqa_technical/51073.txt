"Nominal size versus actual size. Idealistic soft handed lawyers making stupid assumptions about carpentry. Next thing you know they are going to go after women's dress sizes. Or plumbing fittings. Plumbing pipe has little to do with either inside diameter or outside diameter. Its a confusing mishmash of outside diameter in some materials like copper and inside diameters in materials like iron pipe and rigid pvc that have grown up over the years. In copper the outside diameter is about an eighth of an inch larger than the nominal size in inches. While in iron pipe sizes, the outside is an inconsistent and somewhat arbitray size about a quarter inch larger than the nominal pipe size in inches. Before you know it they are going to complain that nails are sized according to ""pennies"", but a pound of 16 penny nails isn't being sold for 16 pennies a pound."
