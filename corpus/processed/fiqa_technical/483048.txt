Dude.Maybe some people are sleeping in the next room and I'm lounging and watching the show and the remote isn't at arms length. They all have to get woken up just because the show switched to an ad? I set the fucking tv at the fucking level I want to fucking hear it. That should be enough. Advertisers go out of their way to fuck with the signal to make the ads louder, that shit ain't right. Douche.
