I download and use very few apps. But I did buy Swiftkey a while ago. For my phone and my wife's. I was happy to pay the 3-4 bucks. When I see an app that's free, I'm thinking : 1- It's going to be a buggy piece of crap 2- It's going to ad spam my eyese relentlessly. Paying 3 bucks and having a quality add-free software is an excellent trade off.
