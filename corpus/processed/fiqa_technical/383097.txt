Their margins are going to be very, very low this quarter. Look at what they're doing: they're selling the fire at a loss as part of a razor and blades strategy for prime digital subscriptions, and now they're price-matching brick and mortar stores, and offering $5 coupons for every item customers buy from Amazon rather than in-store. Both moves are great longterm plays, but hurt margins for the quarter, so they're just doubling down and taking all their licks at once, hence the low share price, but will come roaring back with great numbers soon.
