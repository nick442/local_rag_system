That's only the market rate if there is nobody else willing to do the job for less. Look at how things go in 3rd world countries - the elite simply hire bodyguards and armored vehicles/helicopters to transport themselves around. You would have to prove somehow that your bodyguard services are worth 1/2 their net worth, and that nobody could do as good of a job for less than that. The rich communities become walled compounds with private mercenaries keeping the riff raff out. In these countries, there's any number of willing young men to earn in a month what most of the country makes in a year to take up arms against their fellow citizens in defense of the elite. Security just becomes another minor expense to keeping up a household.
