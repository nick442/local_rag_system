"Let me make sure I understand the point of what Adam Smith is going on about. In discussion of relative poverty, he relates the idea that an individual can be considered in poverty if they do not meet the customary amount of goods considered by their society to be the minimum to be polite in public. You have thus transferred his meaning of what poor means to be what is considered ""basic living"". You have then taken this concept and tied the cost of ""basic living"", which you still haven't actually narrowed down, towards the tax rate on income for a citizen of a community. This is all in the context that you're concerned with the community level of price for ""basic living"" and whether its too high. However, you also haven't said what too high is nor why you're concerned with the literal price which is why I've said you can only control the price of a good through central authority. I never made the assertion you wanted to invoke a centrally planned economy, I simply stated that the only way to control prices across a community is through central authority. You've stated that we collect taxes on local, state, and federal levels. This is true, however it does not mean that they control the price. They simply modify the price set by the market, and only serve to increase the price from the base set by market participants. When I want to buy beer, I don't just pay for the cost of the beer. I pay the cost of the beer + the city tax + county tax + state tax + state sales tax on the beer, which raises the price. Also, these taxes are not income taxes which is what was being discussed. I still don't know what your point is because you cannot seem to define phrases you've used that I have stated I do not know. If you cannot define what you're talking about, how it relates to the actual discussion, and why its relevant then please stop as its simply a derailment."
