I understand your point, but at the end of the day the CEO does know why businesses like his aren't doing well and yet they are still unable to be competitive. That is one of the cornerstones of capitalism, so as entitled as it sounds (I personally don't think it's entitlement) they actually do need to change their entire business model or die and start over. That's a sad fact, but you can't be upset that people generally have less money to spend these days.
