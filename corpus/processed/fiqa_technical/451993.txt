Why the hell is health care still tied to employment? Does anyone really think that is a reasonable function of business? All this does is make hiring human workers less attractive. Guess what. Thanks to automation and outsourcing business owners increasingly have the choice to do without the hassle of hiring people, especially poor, unskilled people these sorts of 19th century programs are designed to help. My heart goes out to those these sorts of short-sighted programs hurt the most (the poor), but blaming businesses for the mess is misdirected in the extreme. Maybe you think that business is evil, but in this case it is clearly and unquestionably the system created by the regulatory environment that has created the undesired outcome. The thing to always remember and keep in mind is the fact that businesses first and formost provide goods and services at the highest quality and lowest cost possible. Making labor more expensive means that businesses will do everything possible to use as little of it as possible when creating their good/service. If you want socialized health-care then fine, advocate for the government providing this service directly. Attempting to get 'health-care for free' by mandating businesses pay for it is simply a wrong-headed way to go about it that guarantees less employment **and** less health-care for the poor.
