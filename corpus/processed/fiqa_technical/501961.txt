> they have no bargaining power. Individually, and in the long term that's true. In the short term, most franchise businesses are running on the minimum needed labor, and even lower level management positions are still labor. So, if several workers went on strike at once they could severely hamper operations. If several low level managers went on strike, even more so. There's a training period for any staff that are hired, and even a minor acclimation period for transfers. If enough people leave all at once the store is hurt. Corporate might keep them from going under, but they will loose money and goodwill. All of that is before you get to picket lines and alternatives. A smart competitor can and should milk labor disputes for all they're worth. They should try to get as many customers as possible to go to their store instead of the one being picketed. Collective bargaining exists because most individuals don't have much power, but as a group they do. The idea of zero training doesn't exist. The idea of being able to simply replace large numbers of people quickly doesn't work. That's why places like Walmart are afraid of unions. They are already running on the edge with their staff. All it would take is several cashiers who were ready to leave anyways going on strike to shut the store down. Mind you, the trick with these large companies is to do it relatively suddenly. If they have time to prepare they can be ready to throw overtime at the people who didn't leave, or could bus in people from other stores. Compare that to the entire kitchen crew or cashiers just not showing up one shift.
