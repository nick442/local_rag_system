You're gonna start a business but you can't choose your own name? C'mon man, that's the fun part. Have you researched the demand? In a dying industry like hard copy games, what sets you aside from big players like GameStop? What's gonna set you apart from all the rest? Sorry to say but right now you don't even have a name, my friend. My advice is to write out a detailed business plan & come up with ways to keep yourself afloat. Either way, like I said, you're entering a dying industry that may have something like 10 years at the max considering digital copies are becoming the majority. Personally, i'd rethink your business concept because you may be calling it Game Over before you even push start. Good Luck
