Last time something like this happened we (eventually) created the New Deal, which greatly mitigated the problem.for a while at least, until the elite reclaimed power. I agree with you, but I don't think we're doomed. Things will have to get a lot worse until people see the problems though, but still then I wouldn't expect a socialist uprising, but just another new deal to buy off the non-elite.
