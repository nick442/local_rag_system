"One big thing to consider is that ""financing"" (whether equity or debt) is not always available when you want it. Examples: * Dot-coms - Tech related companies were famous for their IPOs and raised tons of equity from the public market. Post-bust the tech IPO market absolutely crashed for years [(example source)] (http://www.renaissancecapital.com/ipohome/press/ipofilings.aspx) * Aircraft financing - EU banks used to do a ton of lending on aircraft (Boeing/Airbus) but after their financial crisis the market dried up [(example source)] (http://www.boeingcapital.com/cafmo/2013/brochure.pdf) A lot of financing is about timing or paraphrasing my MBA professor - get financing when you can, not when you need it."
