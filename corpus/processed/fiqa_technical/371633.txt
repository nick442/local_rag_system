>The only explanation I can imagine is that production costs are too high. I think this is precisely it. It costs too much to produce in the us, so production is outsourced. Given that many people are payed based on working in production jobs, outsourcing leads to less money. So eventually, the US will lose money until the point where production in the US is cheap enough to bring it back. But anyway, my point was that interpretation of Keynesian economics by a few people does not mean that Keynesian economics are wrong. These people may simply have an interest in not mentioning the exporting of production jobs. In which point they would be willfully manipulating the paradigm.
