Do I have the option of stripping options off of the Model 3 to make it more affordable? Can I get it at $20,000 if I strip enough options off? I didn't think so. I'm comparing base model costs. Model 3 is a luxury class vehicle, not a family car. I have no hate for Tesla and eventually would like to see a Tesla in my driveway. But it's not a economically accessible vehicle for a lot of people right now.
