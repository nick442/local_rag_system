I don't see how this is a problem. It's their homes, not yours. And why are your needs as a long term renter more important than the needs of the other people renting short term? If it truly were a problem, the returns on investment to short term would be lower than long term. I.e., you are ripping off your landlord, he should raise his rent or kick you out and make an airbnb.
