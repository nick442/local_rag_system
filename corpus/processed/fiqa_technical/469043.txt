"> There may not be anything shameful about doing that, but that scenario is, indeed, a business **failure**. People do not shutter a profitable (successful) business and then go to work for someone else. Not necessarily. It may very well be a ""planned exit"" -- not all businesses will (nor should they be expected to or *planned* to) endure into perpetuity.. just because the corporate charter sets no specific limit to the duration of the corporate entity does not mean that it is (and certainly not that it needs to be) ""immortal"". And a business that may be quite profitable to run, even if it's final pre-closing year is less so.. is not necessarily a ""failure"": in fact closing an operation down *while it is (still) slightly profitable*, and BEFORE it begins losing money (and/or selling it's assets off while they still have substantial investment value), may in fact be the **wisest** move (especially financially speaking); which counts as anything BUT a ""failure"". Plus there are several industries where a ""temporary"" existence of a firm is heartily recognized as a positive thing: take films as an example, a new ""company"" (with a pre-planned, limited lifespan) will often be formed to craft and produce the film, and cease to exist once that task has been completed. And I think the hand-wringing about ""restaurants"" is especially gratuitous.. if ever there was/is a business niche that was subject to fad & fashion, and the ephemeral even transitory nature of people's ""tastes"", it would be the ""boutique"" segment of the restaurant industry; even the ones (or chains) that do manage to survive, often do so by dramatically changing their menus, brand & character.. so that a decade later they barely resemble their former selves. Sure there are also other segments of the industry that are generally ""stable"" -- but many of them tend to be slow-or-no growth as well. >I believe a key contributor to the confusion is talking about the self-employed and business owners in the same breath. Someone who's self-employed basically owns a job. His income will always be directly proportional to the amount of time spent working and the company does not exist apart from himself. It covers an entire spectrum.. and the lines are rather fuzzy. Yes, a lot of self-employed people (whether configured as sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLC's or full ""corporations"") are by INTENT -- and probably always will be -- simply ""job replacement"" businesses. (And again, there is NOTHING wrong with that -- whether they endure for a year, 5 years, 10 years or an entire lifetime). How or why people have come to view this as somehow of less ""merit"" than someone being gainfully employed *for someone else* -- has always puzzled me. But some of those -- just as some of the ""part time"" or ""on the side"" businesses -- can take on an (unexpected, unplanned) ""life of their own"" and grow into substantial enterprises that employ hundreds and even thousands of people over multiple decades. AFTER THE FACT, the owners will often (at least publicly) claim that it was ""all part of the plan"", but in several cases where I know the founder/owner personally.. I know from private conversation that THAT simply wasn't the case. >A business owner, on the other hand, has processes/equipment/staff/IP in place that generates income whether or not she gets out of bed in the morning. You are speaking of someone who has achieved a CERTAIN level of success, and a certain SIZE of operations. >These are different people with different goals and cannot be lumped into the same demographic block. Any and all ""blocks"" are going to be subjective (and in a very real sense the dividing lines placed at rather arbitrary segments) -- a particular named ""block"" will be very true from ONE point of view (with lots of things that correlate and appear to be uniformly applicable).. and yet fallacious from another (where there is again a whole spectrum of distinctions)."
