You're trying to change the subject. I guarantee to you, the amount of interference in your life, and death, would be FAR less intrusive with single payer, which is at least in responsible nations - accountable to the public. What we have now is forced privatization. Which means a total lack of accountability, why? Because the insurance industry and drug industry claim they need it in order to be profitabe WHICH IS BULLSHIT. Nobody is calling them out on this, so, what we're getting is Obama's Chicago school **[neoliberal right wing ideology](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=376)** being forced on this country - AND [other countries](http://ttip2014.eu) - [because of trade policy](http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2013/11/38-million-retirees-say-no-to-a-trade-deal-that-would-make-medicine-more-expensive.html), even when they know it can't work! Its a race to the bottom that is only going to get worse. IT [wastes quite conservatively AT least a third](http://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program), much more probably more than half of every health care dollar. Thats the facts. It worthless arguing with you, though, because you're not listening.
