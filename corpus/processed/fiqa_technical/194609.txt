If by tariff you mean a tax on foreign cars being sold within the US, then that's kind of a crappy idea too. That's still going to stifle competition and prop up the US auto industry, except now people won't be able to afford the better cars. Forcing US consumers to buy domestic cars won't make domestically made cars any better, it'll make them worse. Subsidizing an industry that's huge and has a high barrier to entry isn't a bad idea as long as you foster competition within that industry. At some point though, you have to cull the companies that fail to innovate and bring in new ones. Also, where do you put the tariff? What if you have a car that's assembled domestically, out of parts that are shipped over seas? What if a car is 100% made in the US by a company that's owned over seas?
