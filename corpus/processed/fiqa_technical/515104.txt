No one is saying people aren't allowed to go. I am just saying that malls are usually built outside city centers. Also, your sunk cost argument assumes I am for them building malls in the first place. It was bad in the first place to build the malls and now it is even worse (environment wise). Do you have any actual arguments as to why malls are good for the environment? Concentrating stores in one place is a benefit, I will give you that. But when the concentration is outside the traditional city center, it negates that benefit somewhat.
