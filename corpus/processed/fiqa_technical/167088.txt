You can always use those virtual/paper trading games/websites/apps instead of actually investing. They're completely free to use and you can use them to compete. You'll each create a portfolio of stocks and the game will simulate market conditions to see how your stocks would perform real-time. It's a great way to learn how to invest, and discussing what happened/why _____ sector performed higher/etc. It's a great way to start. If you're looking for a discussion-type thing, start off by reading the Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, and discuss amongst the club. Frankly, I don't see why you can't do both, investing and discussing/learning. Virtual Trading Websites: MarketWatch Virtual Stock Exchange Apps: StockWars: Virtual Trading
