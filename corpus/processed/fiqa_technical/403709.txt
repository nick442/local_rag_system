Yup, 7 figure seller myself. That's why everything possible goes fba anyway. Ain't nobody got time to deal with customers anyway, who can compete on that, especially with Amazon. It's not that the customer is always right, it's just easier most of the time to treat them like they are and move on. If customer issues are a significant part of your business, or can cause that much damage, you shouldn't be in this business.
