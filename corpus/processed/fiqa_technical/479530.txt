Big solar fan here. I like your argument for nuclear. With the way that electricity power generation works, we need ideally 3 sources of power. Nuclear is one of them. Base load, if you will. Solar and nat gas can sort of fluctuate against each other as the sunlight changes. And once battery tech updates we can do away with nat gas. I don't know enough about price/economics on nuclear and if you have a few concise things to share I'd appreciate it. Not asking for you to type a tome. I can always research later but appreciate your input!
