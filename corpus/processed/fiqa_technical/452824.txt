"We initially attempted to do this when we bought our house and found the listing agents ""resistant"" to say the least. For a variety of reasons (not just the commission), we ultimately decided to hire a buyer's agent, but we focused on buyer's agents that would pass some of their commission back to us. We used Redfin, but I think there may be others now. One ""gotcha"" even on this, is that, if you're getting a mortgage, the mortgage company may also have something to say about this situation. We had to apply the agent's rebate to our closing costs, we could not take it away in cash."
