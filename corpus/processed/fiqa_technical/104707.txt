> they will just leave instead of paying. Great. The rich are rich because they own things that leech money from our economies. We can tax them wherever they are by taxing the mechanisms by which they earn money from us. Having them all leave would be the best thing, because it would dispel the illusion that helping the rich helps America. > The rich already pay the vast majority of taxes. Only if you ignore most of the taxes the rest of us pay.
