> Could you discuss why the lack of restrictions on these subjects would make hedge funds more attractive to wealthy investors as opposed to mutual funds? Well just think about it this way. You have two soccer players. They both know the game extremely well, they both have similar styles of plan, and similar strategies. They're *very* good players. Now, you change the rules for one of the players. He has to wear a 20 pound weight vest on him at all times, and can only kick the ball with his right foot when shooting, but his left when passing. Who do you think would win in a one v. one? ________________________________________________ Mutual funds are offered to the *general public* (most of them, anyways), which works under certain assumptions about possible investors. While investments with these funds are still considered risky, the restrictions placed on mutual funds are designed to promote safety of principle. For instance, mutual funds are restricted in short selling and trading on margin. Mutual funds must also clearly state what securities they're going to get into, what strategy they'll follow, etc., and deviations from this can get them into trouble. Hedge funds have no such restrictions. Therefore, they can pursue any type of investment they want. Hedge funds have invested or tried to invest in everything from stocks to private equity to bitcoin to art to rare violins to property to contracts to get boats to and from the statue of liberty to water rights to lawsuit settlements to.. This relative freedom gives them MUCH more flexibility, and thus they can earn above-average returns. These lack of restrictions also makes them MUCH riskier, and additionally the way they're legally set up means only a specific type of investor, called an *accredited investor* in the U.S., can invest. What does it take to be an accredited investor? Basically, either be rich in income $200k a year if single, $300k if married), or be rich in wealth (net worth of $1MM, not counting primary house).
