Heh I'm more baffled by the sheer size of the collection I shared with my siblings. It must have seriously reached about 75k to 100k pieces. My parents were not well off at the time, but they never bought us cheap crap. Instead they just kept feeding more LEGO into the collection. I never fully appreciated them for it at the time. Looking back now I'm almost ashamed of how spoiled I was.
