I've been to one in Seattle. It's pretty much my favorite bookstore. Because they don't need to worry about inventory or profitability, they display all the books forwards, so you can see each book's front as you browse, rather than just the spine. And they have little review snippets under most of them. It's a great browsing experience. Of course, in the middle of the store there's a bunch of confused employees who think they're an Apple Store, but no bookstore is perfect. And getting all the books for Amazon's price is a big plus.
