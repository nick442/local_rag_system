Think about it. IF you save $15K by buying a Honda or a Mazda, you can invest those money at modest 5% average, you'll have over 60K before you retire, which allows you to retire at least a year earlier.. So it is worth working an extra year in your life to have a fancier car? And that's a conservative investment.
