"There's a lot wrong with your explanation and analogy. I believe you are trying to refute otherwiseyep but you haven't really. You have described the ""work"" or the ""step in the money-building process,"" that was happening *before* otherwiseyep's scenario. otherwiseyep's scenario begins at ""the apple farmer wants to get some meat but the orchard hasn't matured yet,"" implying that apples have in fact been traded for meat in real time. Secondly, I would much prefer a person build their own explanation and analogy than build onto someone else's while thinking it insightful in any way. Lastly, you went all Paul Krugman on us and used the word ""costs of production"" which I *think* you mean to be ""work"" but you did not build that analogy. When you went ""Paul Krugman,"" you jumped a HUGE boat. Krugman talks about very advanced economics and some of his stuff is political in nature. At no point did you build any specific analogies to Paul Krugman's many theories. You so completely lost me with that, I almost went into negative integers. Edit: otherwiseyep had been misspelled as otherwiseyes. Slightly laughable."
