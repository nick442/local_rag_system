I think you would be better asking about what things COULD increase in value. Even the given example (houses) are not certain to increase in value. In fact, one of the key causal factors of this recession IMHO is that no one realized that partly because there have been few recent housing busts, and also the illusory effect of inflation that made it seem like houses always increase in value. I once heard it described that rich people tend to get richer because they spend more of their money on things that are more likely to hold their value or appreciate (houses, art, etc.) as opposed to poor people who spend the majority of their money on consumables like rent, utilities, food, cars, etc.
