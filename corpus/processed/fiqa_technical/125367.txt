WTF yourself! Results matter. Billions of dollars are changing hands, women are trying to be a part of that, and the result is that women are getting a share that is according to most statistical analysis insignificant. You are getting all defensive as if this could only have happened if some nefarious persons at the top decided it must be so, but the reality is that persons at the top do not dictate results as you fantasize. Results are more what we end up with as the result of processes more complex than any of us fully understand, and reality most women get excluded early on because of various issues like the intense harassment that they experience at almost every level. You say nothing stops women, but analysis of available data appears to show that something is stopping women and that oddly enough we also find grotesquely inappropriate behavior is endemic to all involved institutions. A lot of people get harassed? You better believe it. I am a gay man and you would not believe some of the shit that I get in supposedly open minded tech industries. The big difference there is that most straight women have a lot of options open to them while as a gay man I can pretty much thrive and make a lot of money or starve to death in a world that is still festering with irrational spite that isn't even typically acknowledged. We can all do better. I am sure of that.
