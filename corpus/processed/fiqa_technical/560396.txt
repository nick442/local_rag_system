"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.aei.org/publication/do-minimum-wage-hikes-aid-workers-the-jury-is-still-out/) reduced by 85%. (I'm a bot) ***** > The NBER working paper includes in their analysis all low-wage workers across different industries that earn below a certain hourly wage, such as $13 or $19. The authors worry that if the analysis only focused on workers who are either at or below the minimum wage, it would overstate the dis-employment effects if employers moved some workers to wages above the threshold minimum wage. > In contrast, the IRLE Berkeley study focuses only on the food services and restaurant industry, since that industry is likely to have the largest fraction of low wage workers affected by the minimum wage hike. > In other words, a control group is a group of geographic units that matches Seattle so closely before the minimum wage increase that any difference in outcomes between Seattle and &quot;Synthetic Seattle&quot; can plausibly arise only from the minimum wage increase. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6l4vzl/two_studies_two_different_results_aei_has_some/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~158651 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **wage**^#1 **Work**^#2 **minimum**^#3 **paper**^#4 **Seattle**^#5"
