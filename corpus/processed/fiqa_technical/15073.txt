I like your reasoning, the car is the most emotional product a person buys on average, that is true. But I still feel charisma has to have some impact on consumers. Presidential candidates do have an impact, celebrities do as well. Both academically proven. Did not Steve Jobs have an impact? Who knows.. Nobody ever looked into it..
