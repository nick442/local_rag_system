It might actually be kinda a good thing. If these cars charge overnight, mostly off peak hours, the transmission infrastructure will be put to good use at night, which can really help pay for the infrastructure, and therefore help subsidize our current bills. Imagine it like public transit. A public transit system that had a high volume, constant stream of riders all day could earn a lot more revenues without needing to add more trains/rails/stops.
