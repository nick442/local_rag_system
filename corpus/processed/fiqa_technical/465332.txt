"As a great man once said, ""No risk it, no biscuit."" Nothing can immunize you from catastrophe. But cash won't do well in a war, either, so you need to turn it into something else. And timing is a crapshoot. When you enter, when you exit, total waste of your energy. Find something you want to own and watch, and get wet. If you want to be diversified, get into index funds. You'll technically own a little of everything, and they do well if you just leave them be. For example, they're higher than they were at the start of every war in the past. If you don't need the money in the war, just leave it there and you'll come out later with more than you started with which is what you wanted. Stay away from bonds, because the Fed is going to start unwinding QE soon and that's going to clobber bond values, taking bond funds with them. If you feel totally convinced war is coming, then get something that exposes you to gold. Like gold, for instance."
