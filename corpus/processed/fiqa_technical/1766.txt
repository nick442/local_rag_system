Bank A only care about the credit limit at Bank B when determining the maximum amount of credit they will grant you. In theory you might be able to convince them that by cancelling the other card they should increase the limit on their card. Of course since you owe too much money to do a balance transfer before the cancelling of a card you will need them increase the limit first. They will have to decide if your income, credit usage history, credit core, and age of your account with them justifies the increase. I don't think you have a good plan for using the increased debt, it is way to risky. But if you have enough income to save 3K a month you might be a good candidate for a higher credit limit.
