A statistical measurement is still more honest than no measurements at all. For economics we don't have a reference frame for the absolute truth. There is no way to judge the absolute accuracy of a theory. Given that, at least a theory that matches real observational data is more *real* than something that does not match observations. And quantitative easing has been in many ways one of the largest economic experiments. There were competing theories on what it would do, and one thing was certain - monetary velocity is inversely related to wealth. Even Kansas was an experiment. Something was predicted by Gov. Brown back, and that something turned out to be wrong. In the light of observations, I find it astonishing to hold on to a theory whose predictions have just not panned out. Monetary velocity may still be wrong, but on a relative scale of wrongness, it is still much less inaccurate than the Laffer curve.
