> Hey! Do you mind giving your credit card to the waiter.. I'm not especially fond of that, but it's easy to report fraud to the bank and most of the time the bank will reverse the charges. The PIN situation is different because a mugging is life-threatening. > We already determined that nobody even care about signatures or check them. You can't use a stolen card at an ATM with a signature. It seems clear you haven't spent as much time thinking about this as I have. No offense intended, this is a waste of my time.
