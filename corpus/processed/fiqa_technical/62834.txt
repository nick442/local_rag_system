Ok, so by doubling down you mean when I said that ms as well as 3/4 of the country don't consider sexual orientation a protected class..ok, then apparently I am not the only one who has their mind made up. You entire argument is based on it being a protected class..it is, but only in a few states. Ms is not one of them. I agree that they should not think like that and their business should hurt because they are bigots..but that does not mean another business can do the same thing because you agree with them. It is ok to have a difference of opinion but you seem to think that a company providing a service based on their bias is ok for some and not for others. How can you not see the similar aspects of the two. I agree with you that ms is wrong in this case, and I also agree that the nazi wannabes are wrong..We are on the same side..but I don't think that PayPal should get a free pass when it aligns with my thinking. They are not offering service based on an ideal, the businesses in ms were as well. So, I think they are both wrong and should be blasted in public..either you can show biased when dealing with customers or you can't. It is that simple. You are agreeing with a company choosing to do business with whom they want to, but then you are doubling down on having another business doing the same thing because you think that sexual orientation is a protected class everywhere. If it was we would not be having this discussion, but here we are. You are trying to have it both ways. I don't know how else to explain it.
