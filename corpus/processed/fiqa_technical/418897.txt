I agree with everyone that this approach is absurd. An equivalent assessment would look like this: How much does a sandwich cost? Out of pocket expense: $5 Work time value assuming $20/hr: $10 Opportunity cost for $15 dollars that could have been invested at 33% return: $5 So a $5 sandwich now costs $20 dollars on paper.
