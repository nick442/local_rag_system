Yeah those tablets came out with a lofty goal. They wanted to price them at the same price as an Apple product. The only problem was no one wanted one at that price. I still to this day dont understand Microsoft and the pricing of the tablets when they first came out. Look at google and what there doing. Low priced tablets and computers. The opposite of what Microsoft is doing. I dont begrudge Microsoft wanting in on the tablet and app market. I still think the Pro is overpriced for what it does, its close to 1 thousand dollars.
