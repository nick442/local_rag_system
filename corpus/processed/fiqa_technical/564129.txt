"In short Yes, your father needs to pay tax. Please consult a CA so that he can advice you better. In your father's case at the time of purchase it was agricultural land. However at the time of sale, it seems it was Urban, N.A. Land. A C.A. would advice you the exact exemptions and gains. If it was agricultural land at the time of selling, the Section 54B: ""Exemption from Capital Gains on transfer of Agricultural Lands in certain cases"" would be applicable if your Dad was doing agricultural activity on this land, and after selling has purchased a similar land."
