This is only one study via a UC Davis agricultural labor economist, but they conclude in their study that a raise to $15/hr for produce pickers would boil down to an additional cost to American shoppers of $20/year. http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/31/can-we-afford-to-pay-u-s-farmworkers-more/ Whole Foods (obv that Whole Foods operates at margins and a market segment that is not the norm compared to bigger grocery chains like Safeway and Krogers) but they report that the increase in labor costs of affects them nominally and the prices do not go up in the stores. It will be interesting to see what happens because if the trend continues given the policies/rhetoric of Trump we won't need projections and models to see what happens we can see with our own eyes as farmers raise the price they're willing to pay for labor and see where that number ends up being before they can't go any higher and see how much food goes ungathered.
