"Yeah I understand how much power a downgrade can have on a nations access to the capital markets and can thus cripple and slow down economic growth but the call to micromanage the rating agencies more is a bit much. The last thing the financial system needs is another 3 letter acronym agency sending in some official to watch every move of the analysts at these firms. The point of there being more than one rating agency is that you have multiple opinions and they average out to give you a realistic opinion, Standard and Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch don't have a conference call every time a deal comes through the door ""Hey guys what are we rating this at today"" they all do their own thing. I would be interested to see situations in which all the CRAs gave a lower credit rating then a debt issuer actually deserved."
