> Right now caps are at something like 100-250GB, which seems like a lot. But imagine you replace your entire cable consumption with online consumption. Plus add in any other internet activity like games and downloads, 250GB may be a bit closer than you think. I have. Last month I downloaded 122 gigabytes, and uploaded 12 gigabytes. The _most_ I've ever managed to do in a month was 260 gigs down. I twas during one of Steams ludicrous sales, combined with me downloading a bunch of other, unrelated, things. I average about 180 gigs down a month. That includes running a remote desktop connection to my machine at home 40 hours a week, online gaming 10 or so hours a week, and near constant media streaming from Netflix, Amazon, and Pandora. Sure, its not exactly blue ray quality, but I don't _have_ a blue ray player anyway. As long as it doesn't look like it was shot on a 1980's camcorder, I don't really care that I can't make out the pores on the actors face. Too, comcast recently increased the cap. Granted, its just from 250 to 300, and mostly just a publicity stunt, but still it went up, not down.
