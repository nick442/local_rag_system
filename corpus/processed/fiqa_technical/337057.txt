Well put and, honestly, seemingly unavoidable. It will be crazy if it truly does come to fruition if they (Fed/Treasury/Gummit) realize that they cannot inflate their way out of this by printing more money and all of the nay-sayers of massive deflation get proven wrong. So, the better question is this: we believe/know it's coming, so how do we prepare and strategically place ourselves to survive/profit/prosper from the coming collapse? As I see it, RE is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and oversize are not absorbed. People have to live, so rentals will be key; but, they have already bloomed quite a bit. Stocks will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced/willing withdrawals start happening from the Boomers. So, keeping it in stocks doesn't sound overly positive, unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced. Bonds are paying crap and, after taxes, barely pacing inflation. For me personally and selfishly, I have 20 years minimum for retirement, so I'm fine qith the market trending sideways or down. It means that I'm getting more bang for my DCA buck and, 20+ years from now, I will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up. But, for now, where do we put our investments to protect and, hopefully, grow them as the mid term passes?
