Retirement is a Fiction anyways. It is the carrot by which the class structured social construct prods people to take money out of Circulation and attempt to hold it for a later date, or leverage monies now for later. Retirement was a reward at times offered by some companies, but was not always the case. If you made the Company you worked for enough monies, they would offer a Retirement Package, or a productivity incentive for lower classed employees. Any Retirement packages that have been saved by the American Citizens are soon to be plundered by the US Government (once they figure out how to get away with it.) All for the sake of making the many equal with the few. Yet another way to penalize the productive working class, and kowtow to the unproductive yet voting non working class.
