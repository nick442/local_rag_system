Some folks are speculating that they did this to propagate the Amazon Go technology, which I don't think WFM customers would like very much (shopping at Whole Foods is a social experience). Others have even speculated it's a deal to acquire more real estate. Seems to me like they just took over the grocery-delivery space. And they'll probably crush it. There's a Whole Foods about five blocks from my house, but when I'm drunk and having a party I'd rather not get in the car to pick up more charcuterie or wine. Would be dope if I could get a quick delivery whose extra costs were covered by my prime membership.
