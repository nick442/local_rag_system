It may not be just in the meat production either. There are huge corn subsidies in the US. That keeps the price of feed down, so its cheaper to raise the meat. Also, the fertilizer and insecticides used on the corn have environmental impacts when they run-off into local rivers and streams which are paid for by the public not the farmer (which is usually a huge agri-business).
