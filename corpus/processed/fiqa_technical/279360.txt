If you can find data to support that conclusion then great, but the trend for 99% of countries has been the opposite. http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/u-s-image-suffers-as-publics-around-world-question-trumps-leadership/ The Chinese government likes Trump because he’s a useful idiot. He is tarnishing America’s reputation and allowing China to eclipse the U.S. at a faster rate on the global stage. If they like him it’s, because he benefits them, not because he’s a good president. That being said, they don’t like what he has done with North Korea recently. They don’t like what he has said about Taiwan. They don’t like his criticisms on trade.
