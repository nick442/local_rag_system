I've never understood why the auditing procedure is privatized in the first-place. The conflicts of interest seem much too inevitable. Shouldn't the SEC or some other governing body perform the audits? If an accounting firm's bottom-line is profit and not objective analysis, how can we expect it to not to ignore things here and there if it is good for business?
