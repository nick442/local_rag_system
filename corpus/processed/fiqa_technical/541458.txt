"That would be a very *evil* move on Google's part. As a Firefox user close to 100% of my searches are done through the built-in search bar, which is set to Google by default. That's got to be worth something surely. Besides which, I don't really see what Google has to gain by having their browser ""kill"" Firefox. Their goal should be a healthy ecosystem of standards-compliant browsers, all the better to keep the web open so they earn more money."
