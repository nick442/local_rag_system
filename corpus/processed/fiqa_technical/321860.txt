Lol i work at a major prop shop and it is far from retail trading. Existing relations are important and if used well will result in an increased pnl. Also, this is why i was referring to risk adjusted pnl to take into account different firms strategies. Honestly your company might have a different way of doing things but at every prop shop and bank ive worked for my pnl was their primary focus. Edit: i also wouldnt take such a condescending tone if i were you. You are far from the only person on reddit working in the industry.
