That's why you select defective or not as described when returning unless you don't mind paying return shipping or don't want to lie. I just pay the shipping - I can afford $3 or $4 and I figure the return shipping cost is passed back to the vendor. I figured this out one day by accidentally selecting 'Ordered by Accident'. The item was actually not as described so I cancelled the return and did it correctly and no shipping.
