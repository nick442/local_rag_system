Because some overhead expenses will be shared (accounting, most salaries, sales etc.) it's far easier to give him an ownership stake in the company because you won't be able to calculate net profit for each component correctly. What I would say to him is, in exchange for $80K and the contract with his building company (make sure it is significant enough to be worth it$ you will give him 35% of the company. How did you come up with he $1 million in net profit calculation? How much of that is reliant on his business?
