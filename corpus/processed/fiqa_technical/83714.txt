Cloud and online are already saturated there is no more significant growth at the top or bottom. Amazon, Google and DO have so much more of this market than MS it just speaks to how big it really is since even such a tiny fraction still looks good on the MS bottom line. I think they have a guaranteed slow decline into irrelevance just like IBM. Though I think MS will flame out long before IBM does.
