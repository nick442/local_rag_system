">Exactly. People don't seem to realize that a lot of the things they take for granted as being provided by the government were more than adequately provided by private charities until the government stepped in and 'fixed' things. Or that -- absent things like a 15.3% FICA tax (and all of the other taxes that have been added or increased substantially during the past couple of decades) -- which people could simply afford to save up and pay for themselves (or help friends, family, etc). Currently private charity is significantly restrained because there is so much taken away (from the lower & middle class wages) via taxes -- so quite literally, they already ""gave at the office"". >This is why the founding fathers hated democracy Yes, they were well aware of (and VERY wary of) the possibility of the ""tyranny of the majority"" and the inefficiency/corruption that would tend to happen via governments."
