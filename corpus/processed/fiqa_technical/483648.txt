Totally depends on the drivers of the downturn. Keep in mind that in ~2005, both real estate and short-term bonds would arguably have been reasonable answers to this question (without the benefit of hindsight, of course). e: After re-reading your post, it looks like you were asking about (I assume) equity investments by sector rather than asset classes more broadly. I'm not sure equity in any sector can be considered a safe haven in a downturn. Utilities are the typical answer, but they didn't do much better than equity markets in general in 2008-2009.
