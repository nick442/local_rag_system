And how is that even an argument? So..the fed needs to raise rates, is what you seem to be saying. I'm not sure that now is the time for that, considering the weak jobs numbers recently, but it's possibly a good idea for them to announce that a hike will come soon instead of actually raising the rate. Either way, to say that having a low interest rate for a decade is a bad thing sort of obscures a harsh reality. It's certainly not something that you *want*, but what's the alternative? Would the US have been better off without the Feds balance sheet expansion? Very few economists would say yes. In fact that exact line of thought likely turned a financial crash into the Great Depression of the 30's.
