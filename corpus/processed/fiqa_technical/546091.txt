Agreed, it'll be faster. Let's do a little math. Tesla is trying to hit 500k units in 2018. They want 1m in 2020. If Tesla can do 1m in 2020, how many EVs can *ALL* other western auto manufacturers build in 2020 (GM + Nissan + VW + Daimler + etc)? I'd take a swing at 2-3m. What about Chinese auto manufacturers? Probably 3m more, since EVs are a focus there? So if you count that up, it's 7-8m EVs in 2020, which is 10% of worldwide new car sales. This can all be accomplished in the $35k+ market. This also provides the volume to drive down battery and electronics costs to hit $30k and then $25k price points later in the 2020's. So if we're at 10% by 2020, I'd be shocked if we didn't have 50-75% EVs of new car sales by 2030. 20-50% growth over 10 years adds up quickly. The oil price crash of 2014 was caused by a 2% imbalance between supply and demand. So this predicts crashes in the price of oil and oil company stocks in the early 2020's. There's likely also political unrest in oil producing countries, as their economies start having revenue shortfalls. Given the friendliness of EVs to demand response, I'd think we'd just keep building intermittent renewables. When the wind blows and sun shines, EVs charge (and turn off otherwise) This will increase electricity demand, but put pressure on expensive and dirty coal and natural gas. All of this drives down the cost of electric driving, and CO2 emissions.
