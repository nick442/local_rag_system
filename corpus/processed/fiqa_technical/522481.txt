While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) started as a relative moderate price insurance, it quickly became expensive, unaffordable, tax for those who don't want/need it, and hard to get as in some states you have only one choice (or no choices very soon). It destroys and destroyed the medical profession. Doctors have no control on how and what they get paid for their work. You can't be an independent doctor and what you paid is very little, not worth your time in many cases. It's even costly for the insurance companies and many of them dropped from the program. Trump and I are NOT(!) against National healthcare system. Both Trump and me want to fix the system and make it reasonable, better and fair.
