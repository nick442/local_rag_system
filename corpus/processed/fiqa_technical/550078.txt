I mean even skimming through the article really quickly.. The fact that they're touting GS as Lloyd blankfeins personal hedge fund just makes anything they're saying laughable. Edit: they're also specifically talking about GSAM.. I'm not sure they understand how the industry actually works at this point because if Blankfein were to be using GSAM as his personal hedge fund (and this is the only part of the bank that can be used as a hedge fund in anyway) then their clients would be pulling out money by the boat loads..
