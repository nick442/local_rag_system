"I worked for a few large corporations in highschool and college. Mainly retail. My position being on the low end of the totem pole. At this level, there is a lot of pump-up-the-drone bs that's force fed down your throat. After college, I've worked for three companies. One privately owned and two publicly traded companies. The private business was one of the worst offenders I've ever seen with the BS ""be a team player"" mentality, regardless of your level. The public companies definitely push the ""team player"" mentality toward the lowest skilled, most easily replaceable, highest turnover workers. The more skilled workers (college degree, specialized in a field) on the other hand, aren't just fed the BS. If the company is worth it's weight in salt, these people are informed of the short term and long term goals of the company. There are discussions about direction, opinions on decisions that were made -- dissenting opinions being much more valuable than a ""yes-man"" response. That is, if upper management if competent. From what I've seen, competent upper management is contagious. It bleeds down the line. Successful corporations have people at the top (and in the middle) who actually care about the success of the company. They take pride in their work. They know that by them making the right decisions their company can grow and intern hire more employees, pay those employees better, provide better perks, etc. If you have garbage at the top, they'll hire garbage for the layer below them, and so on and so on.. Back to the point of the OP, I'm in a salaried position. My salary isn't for my 9-5 appearance in the office. I'm paid an agreed upon rate for my ability to complete a task and benefit the organization. Sometimes this means I have very little to do for a few days. Sometimes this means that I need to work 12+ hours in order to get the job done. I'm fine with that."
