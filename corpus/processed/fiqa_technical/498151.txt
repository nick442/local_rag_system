"Yeah, okay buddy. You want ""data"" now that you've been spewing nonsense. Where's your ""data"" that anyone but Muslims and Hispanics feel unwelcome. China is a country that jails people for religion and is notorious for having a government that preemptively cracks down on citizens. They're quite used to authoritarian rule. Chinese are probably more afraid of Muslims than Americans are and thrilled with a travel ban, as long as it doesn't affect them."
