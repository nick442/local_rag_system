"I agree -- personally, at the expense of some of the convenience you speak of, I use credit unions exclusively. However, my credit union more than makes up for that with 1) online check deposit (only thing you ever need to go to a bank for) 2) ATM fee reimbursement With those two amenities, I don't need a branch on every corner. I am pretty disappointed with BofA's practices (profiting off of those who are ""less responsible"" -- to me it's wrong to profit off of people's 'stupidity'), so I would never bank with them. It's just a personal preference because 1) I don't need them and 2) I wouldn't want to indirectly support their business. I can understand why people stick with them, and frankly don't really care, to be honest.. I just think they're a fundamentally bad company through and through and would rather keep my money away from them."
