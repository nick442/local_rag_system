"I agree. You've gotta figure that the next trilogy is worth about that much alone including worldwide box office and merchandising. And that doesn't even take into account any of the other properties or merch on existing films. I even had to double check the story to make sure that he didn't pull another ""I keep the merch"" deal like he did with Fox in the original trilogy. I don't get it either."
