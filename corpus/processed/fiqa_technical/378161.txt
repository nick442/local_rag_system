"That argument is an argument for investing generally, not peer-to-peer lending per se, and the argument as phrased (""thus you should invest your money at a Peer-to-peer loan platform"") is a false dichotomy. That said, as soon as one is investing as opposed to just getting a small but guaranteed return, then risk comes into play. In that sense, any savings account is fundamentally different from any investment, and, in that reading, the two shouldn't be compared as different approaches to ""investing"". Peer-to-peer lending as an investment could be aptly compared with stock market investing, for one."
