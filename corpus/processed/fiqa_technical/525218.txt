You clearly don't understand my post. NK has survived 60 years not because they're dumb, but because they know how to posture and keep the west at bay, and have the support of China. I'd love to wipe them off the map. But they had no real plans to launch. As I said- trump had nothing to do with them backing down, their Chinese masters told them to chill out. And since NK relies on China for their fucking food, they fucking listened. You know the problem with people like you? I made a reasonable statement of my opinion and instead of going after my point- you insist on attacking the person saying it. You have no idea how to have a debate without personal attacks just like your charlatan boy king. Go ahead and leave the geopolitics to the adults. Thanks.
