"I wouldn't worry about ""it probably wouldn't be best time for withdrawal"" aspect too much. With a bit of planning and organization, you could cash out investments held in one country and have them reinvested in another one in a matter of days (if not less), minimising your ""time out of the market"". If the markets are cheap when you sell, the chances are you'll be able to buy in again at much the same price. There's a small chance you miss out on the markets lurching upwards, but you might just as easily miss out on a fall and come out ahead. Old saying: ""time in the market is more important than market timing"". Tax it's hard to discuss without mentioning specific countries. e.g if you were resident in the UK you'd probably want to invest within an ""ISA"" tax-free wrapper; gains are tax free and there's no penalty for withdrawing when you leave. No idea what equivalents there are around Europe. Interestingly there seems to be some recognition by the EU that this sort of thing is an issue for an increasingly mobile workforce; was recently some news of plans for a pan-European pension savings vehicle."
