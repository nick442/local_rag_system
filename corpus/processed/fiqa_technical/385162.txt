McDonalds here in Norway is shitty and expensive. The food makes me feel sick; the burgers are like slime. The only thing I sometimes buy there is their cheap coffee when I'm on the run. Small, unknown kiosks, cafes etc. selling burgers, pizza and/or Chinese/Asian type food are much better and cheaper.
