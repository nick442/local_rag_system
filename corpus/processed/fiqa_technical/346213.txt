"replace ""new member acquisition"" with ""new loans"" and see how true your statement isn't. ..but more fundamentally, there are two factors that exclude banks from ponzi scheme membership: 1 - the thing they create is not in finite supply (they create money at a 10 to 1 rate by encumbering future labor proceeds). Technically, one could argue that future labor proceeds *are* the thing that does have a finite supply. I've never seen **anyone** post an estimate of the maximum supply of future labor proceeds (which is totally adjustable via inflation). 2 - they lend at a higher interest rate than they pay. Technically, all they have to do is keep the time value of money under control with respect of inflation over the duration of loans and they're good."
