To cut the cost of insurance in half, you will have to cut the number of ambulance chasing attorneys in half and stop half of the hail storms. I’m of the belief that lawsuits and defense cost will still be a part of the insurance cost as well as all the current comprehensive risks. The reason Tesla is doing this is because it’s vehicles are SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive to repair. The mainstream insurance companies are figuring out how to insure them, and it will end up be much more expensive to insure a Tesla than a Toyota.
