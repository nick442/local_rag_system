"Well, I'm not an expert and you sound pretty credible however I still don't see anything to back up what your saying in the sources that I've found: > Active business income can still be earned by [foreign] subsidiaries (if you can prove to Revenue Canada that it is a ""real"" corporation) and taxed at better offshore rates if 90% or more of its income comes from third party transactions. This seems to be consistent with my definition. >Active business profits earned by a foreign sub are taxed when profits are repatriated. Certain tax credits are available for foreign taxes paid and certain dividends out of surplus are tax free to the corporation (not individuals). http://www.can-offshore.com/tax-planning/reporting-rule1-ccra.htm So when foreign sub pays dividends to the parent corp they are still charged repatriation - just like in the US. Again, this sounds consistent with my previous comment. Canada has a corporate tax rate that is over 10% lower than the US so this is still a very good deal in its own right. Maybe you can explain in more detail or provide a source that has some additional detail? I also can't find any pieces on this or the Valeant deal that suggests beneficial repatriation rules."
