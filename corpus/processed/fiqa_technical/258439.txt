My experience (two purchases, Ontario, Canada) is that the property taxes are paid by whomever is the owner on the date the tax bill comes due. The bill might be due before the owners even decide to sell. However: A part of the closing process is a Statement of Adjustments, in which various costs that span the tenure of two owners are split on a per-diem basis. In your case, there would have been a charge against you of 2/365 of the tax bill on this statement at the time of closing (if you hadn't paid any 2014 taxes) The statement also includes things like flat-rate water bills, monthly cable bills, security system monitoring.. All paid by one owner or the other, but split fairly on a per diem basis at the time of closing..
