Unfortunately I don't know if the experiments can really get to the heart of the economic complexities to really prove how the model could work. There are only so many programs that could be cut to provide funding and that doesn't begin to pay for the programs. The only thing I can find that would begin to cover costs is to start taxing wealth instead of income. And even there you'd have to get SO MANY countries to agree in principle on taxation in order to get started that it would be extremely difficult to get started.
