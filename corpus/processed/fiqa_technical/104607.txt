"I suppose it is on the surface, when you look at the cost of that indivdual item to your individual doorstep. But one most consider the efficiency of the entire *system*. While one item may be a chore, the UPS driver is really an online shopping delivery man. Courier companies have developed very efficient networks of delivery. Vastly more efficient than the net sum of the chaotic weekend chore runs that we all do, heading from store to store accross the city. I know i've switched over to online shopping almost exclusively to avoid that. I'd rather wait a few days and have whatever i need delivered to home or work than waste one of my week days ""running around"". I know that doesn't sound like much of a point, but consider the effect if a significant percentage of the population began to utilize online shopping. Replacing the chaotic hordes of individuals running around all week, with an efficient delivery system. The infrastructure savings would be likely be significant, and quality of life would be improved for most with less errands to be running. It would be interesting if that could be quantified and compared to what the income from a state sales tax would bring."
