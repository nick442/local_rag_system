Even if 99% of the $80 billion Food Stamps Program is fraudulent, there are still hundreds of thousands of Americans who are using food stamps to survive. However, it was estimated that the national payment error rate was only 4.36% in 2009 ([U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2009](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-956T)) and it was also estimated that an increase in FSP expenditures by $5 billion in 2002 resulted in an increase in total economic activity of $9.2 billion ([USDA, 2002](http://webarchives.cdlib.org/sw1s17tt5t/http://ers.usda.gov/Publications/FANRR26/)). As it turns out, having less of your population starving to death increases economic output. In other news, recessions make people poorer.
