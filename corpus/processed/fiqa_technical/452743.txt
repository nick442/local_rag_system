Nah, not true mate either - have some clients that sell in excess of AUD1M per month almost all of which done via social media ads, and they've been around years before Facebook was a thing. You're totally right though when you talk about some companies being behemoths - but social media and PPC platforms allow the playing field to be amazingly level when competing against them. AI is the next tool to be transforming sales and marketing - and again, it will be done via social media platforms - were seeing it already where Facebook and Watson can be connected within a few minutes to provide basic conversational customer service bots that can take payment for suggested products or services it gives as a result of that conversation. Now you may not like that aspect, but it's here already and only getting more advanced. Social media will morph and change - largely driven by AI and AR and better universal wireless connectivity - but the tools will be connected into 2B+ people via whatever social media channels continue tk be adopted - be it facebook or Instagram or whatever else emerges. kinda cool.
