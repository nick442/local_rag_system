"> Bernie sources: I would agree, it looks like the tax would cover all those that buy stock, bonds, and derivatives. However, this article didn't really cover the specifics. What would the tax be? Would it a flat dollar amount per transaction? That would make sense as it would focus more on those that do high volume traders. That wouldn't really impact me, as I already pay $9 per transaction. And I don't do many transactions. A couple dollars more, and I would be fine. > To answer your Enron example, no corporation would have enough power to actually do something like that if they didn't have at least partial backing by the government. Ah, but corporations [edit - wouldn't] have the power to do much of anything without someone to enforce their policies. Name one market that doesn't have an enforcement agency of some type. That is a mighty big assumption that the ""free market"" would make it work.. especially since one doesn't really exist. And that would be the crux of my argument. All of the things you say about the perfection of the market to regulate itself is so far not proven. Take a market like Kansas - over the last 6 years, they just underwent one of the largest deregulation, de-taxation experiments of any state in the union. The results were less than stellar. Kansas is lagging the national average in growth. And they took a hundred million dollar surplus and turned into a couple billion dollar deficit almost overnight. And who suffers, of course the most poor. They shut down schools, fired teachers, and shelved many infrastructure jobs - jobs that would have been fielded by lower wage workers.. And those infrastructure projects were undoubtedly in lower income areas. I would say, if you truly believe in what you preach then live it. Start a commune somewhere. Demonstrate how it is effective. That would have more power than preaching some amorphous unproveable policy over the internet."
