For academic stuff, SAS and Stata are amazingly better at cleaning and processing huge amounts of data. I love excel and it can certainly do some very amazing things, but at some point you just need a full on statistical software totally driven by its own programming language. That software is pretty cheap for academics, but corporate licenses are usually insanely more expensive. Otherwise I program everything in Python.
