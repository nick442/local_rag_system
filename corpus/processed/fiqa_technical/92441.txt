I do at all from home right now. Im just some kid in college, I manage my parents money (successfully, so far) and the goal is to grow that into enough money that I don't need to work for the industry at all. So far I'm on track. I like to stay optimistic but I'm also realistic. I study deep learning and Ai on the side (since it is generally a Phd level topic, sadly). My majors are Mathematics(stats) and Computational Math Science. IDK, I just do what I love - hopefully it pays off.
