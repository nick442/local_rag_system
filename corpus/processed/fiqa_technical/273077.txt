I haven't been following this crisis at all, so I know nothing about this, but I understand why the value of the Euro would shoot up as a result of Greece/Italy/Portugal leaving. But why would the Germans not want this? Is it because Germany is a leading exporter and it would increase the costs of exports from the country? Or could you expand on that for me? thanks
