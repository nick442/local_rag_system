"What kind of financial aid? Today, most ""financial aid"" consists of loans. Methinks it better for you to be ineligible for ""financial aid"" and be able to pay enough that they can cover the difference with their own sweat (their own income) rather than deliberately spending the money and forcing them to take out ""low interest"" student loans to pay part of the bill. Have you played with FAFSA to see what happens?"
