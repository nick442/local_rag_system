The banks use any loss as a tax right off which helps when you make billions. So yeah a couple of grand is like me dropping a penny. Even if 1 million people did this and the average is 10k that's still less than 1% of the banking industries total revenue in a year. Hell bank of America alone is 100 billion a year and it could take a 10% all at once hit and still be fine. And a car is easily resold and has less protection than a house.
