"It is probably a strategy. Apple could clearly afford to pay them more. They could double the salary of all their sales staff and you'd barely even notice on Apple's bottom line. But I think their strategy is to offer a salary that is a bit higher than the competition but not so high that you wind up with sales staff that never leave. I don't think they want ""lifers"". They probably like the churn of fresh new Apple enthusiasts coming in each year."
