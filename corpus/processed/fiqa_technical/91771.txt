You're welcome. Pm me if you have questions. Ideally you would get to a point where you are debt free save a mortgage if that's where you are heading. Your interest rates a low enough save the credit card debt that you may want to look into an investment portfolio. Especially if you have more than $3k in cash. You don't need to keep that much cash at your age. Most investments are liquid enough you could get it out in a couple of days in case of an emergency. Though you will want to think about how taxes and market timing could affect you.
