The problem was that it was such a niche offering that was only used by hardcore bitcoin fans. It's such a hassle just to buy bitcoin, as Coinbase makes you wait a week. If you don't already have bitcoin, there was (and still, I assume) no reason to not use paypal or a credit card, which offer much better protection to the buyer. Gyft, an online e gift card company which carries every major retailer, was offering a percentage off to people who paid in bitcoin. I was getting Amazon cards through them but once they stopped offering bitcoin discounts, I have stopped using bitcoin all together as an online purchase tool.
