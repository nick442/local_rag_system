Actually, that's impossible; such laws would (and do) constitute prior restraint of trade - no city council would enact such a law, as it's asking for a lawsuit, and is patently illegal and legally indefensible. In the state of California, the state vehicle code says very specifically that municipalities may ONLY regulate food trucks (or any kind of otherwise legal mobile vendor) for purposes of public safety and health; they cannot legislate competition, or enact laws that favor one type of (established) business against another type of (new, usually) business. This is why the past 8 lawsuits against municipalities, asking that time limits etc. be abolished, have all been won - either at first or in appeal (and in the case of LA, both) on behalf of the truck operators .. there is no way to argue that a 15 minute or 30 minute limit benefits public health/safety but a 2 hour limit does not. Laws that say the trucks can't park too near an intersection as they may block drivers' view, that sort of thing is fine - it can easily be argued that such regulation benefits public safety. Same thing with the trucks around schools - as long as other types of large vehicles are also restricted.
