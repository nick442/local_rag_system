"> If you're a few decades older, your generation is mostly to blame for this reversal of fortunes in the US. Absolutely. I've personally worked pretty damn hard to do the right thing - I've never owned a car, I recycle, compost, blah blah, but when it comes down to it it was my contemporaries that did us in. > 1969 was the peak of American culture. > Not since 1969 have more cars been sold in the US Wait, how is ""selling more cars"" equivalent to the ""peak of culture""? I fail to agree that American culture reached a peak 40 years ago. Frankly, I think I'd be pretty bored if I were thrown back to 1969, even though it seemed pretty exciting at the time. I do think the last ten years of culture have been a bit lame, I've been very surprised that we haven't had an outpouring of intense art and music in response to 9/11 and the impending collapse, I find I keep playing the Clash for want of any contemporary political music that moves me - but there's tons of great things out there. (EDIT: A great example: I just saw [this movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440266/) a few days ago, and it simply blew my mind - it made me rethink choreography, and it also made me happy that Germany, a social Democracy, spends money on amazing things like this.)"
