What sort of control is the US exercising if it has to use Air strikes in a residential Area of the Capital? How does shit for brains imagine that he is going to run a Multi Trillion $ Mining operation in the Mountains where the Taliban actually live and there is no road or infrastructure? Maybe he was just being an ignorant asshole when he decided to send more troops, when he could simply have just walked away.
