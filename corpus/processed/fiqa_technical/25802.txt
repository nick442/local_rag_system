It costs them more to make the screens with more pixels. Let's say I usually pay you 10$ for something that cost you 5$ to make. Now I pay you 20$ for something that costs you 18$ to make. Sure you get 20$ instead of 10$, but your profit per item went from 5$ down to 2$. Same thing here, the screens with 4x the pixels costs much more than the original screens. Apple paid slightly more for them, but not enough to keep the profit margin.
