They hired Mandiant (an IT security consulting company) to come in and do damage control once they first got hacked in March. Are we really to believe that the CFO had no knowledge of this, or the larger hack in July) when he sold his shares two days after the second and larger hack was discovered? Seriously spending that kind of money (at least six figures per month) on an outside security consulting firm wouldn't require sign-off from the CFO?
