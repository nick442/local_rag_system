Perfect competition would not be the outcome you want from this model, nor does it imply what you posit. It implies that there will be infinitely many firms, with free entry/exit, making zero profits. Bonds would then become a reason for exit if you had heterogeneous firms (but in perfect competition this is unlikely). In fact in equilibrium no would (probably) issue bonds. What it seems like you want is some sort of structured oligopoly, or a regulated cartel separated into regions. This might generate the bond market you have in mind, but it still does not take into account the relative risk of the bonds.
