This is wrong. Clear but wrong. A different story that has the benefit of being true follows. Money is an agreed-upon fiction. When, say, the Romans invaded a territory they had to find a way to feed their army and pay their soldiers. The soldiers could just steal stuff, but that was unsustainable because after awhile all economic activity would just stop. So, the army paid the soldiers with coins that could then be used by the soldiers to purchase things from the natives. Now, the people had no reason to accept these stamped pieces of metal (gold and silver are not inherently valuable, it's just an agreed-upon fiction). To force acceptance, Rome imposed taxes that had to be paid in Roman coinage. Now, the people had to accept the coins to accumulate enough to pay their taxes, the soldiers were able to spend their pay, and a more-or-less modern looking economy was born. Coins stamped with a monetary value have always been worth more than the market price of the underlying metal, (except in extreme circumstances.) Currency has value because it can be used to pay taxes.
