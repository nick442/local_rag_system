So have we all agreed finally that climate change, while happening. Is a totally normal process and not something we can 'fix' with money or new taxes? No? Hmm. Read a short history of nearly everything. The earth goes through glacial periods and non glacial periods. The SUN has seasons that last about 11 years. We just went through a hot season. We're going into a cold season (as far as the sun is concerned). Really. Climate change is happening, but it's normal. Really.
