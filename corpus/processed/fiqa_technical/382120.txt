American poor is everywhere else rich. For me, poor is going to a farm on Saturday night and digging out potatoes missed by the harvesting machine. Going deep into the forest and gathering mushrooms and wild berries for food. Washing plastic bags for re-use. Pulling teeth without anesthesia. That's how I grew up. Americans are such cry-baby snowflakes.
