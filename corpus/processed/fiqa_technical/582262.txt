But if increasing demand is brought about by increasing spending, and wide-ranging increased spending appears when many people have money to spend - why not just give everyone some money to spend? Why tie it to the hourly rate at a job, thereby making tons of positions too expensive for employers to justify? Seems like a simple allocation of money to everyone, no strings attached, would stimulate demand nicely.
