"Wall Street: Unloading onto the muppets, BRB.. On a serious note, WF has a TBTF put on them. The shorting opportunity likely already came and went. The central banks have issued a global put on equities and real estate for about the last decade, they're unlikely to now say, ""oops, our bad, we'll retract that put starting with WF"" over this. The associated market disruption isn't worth the positive electorate optics. They'll opt to try to surgically fix the scandal; find and fire highest executives feasible, pay a fine, move on."
