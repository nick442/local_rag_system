..which is funny because the Fed established a direct line to Beijing to allow them to buy and sell treasuries without any of that pesky governmental interference (remember, the Fed is a privately held corporation). This is all just window dressing for mass consumption. China has been drawing down their treasuries for quite some time now. HOWEVER.. given how poor the 99% of America is, I doubt that the US would survive getting its direct access to China's plastic teat cut off cold turkey.
