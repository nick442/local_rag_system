I live right beneath the epicenter of this eclipse. My town has less than 150k people and for the eclipse we are predicting a million visitors in the area. That will almost double the population of my state. There aren't enough automobiles in my area to support everyone having a car reservation. Looking at the surrounding areas (up to 200 miles away) and there still aren't enough cars, or ***infrastructure*** to support so many vehicles in my area of my state. While it's a dick move by car rental companies, I honestly don't know what they are are supposed to do. Edit: I mean, obviously rental companies need a better reservation system that doesn't allow reserving an automobile in an area if there aren't enough automobiles to fill the demand. That is completely on the rental companies. However, even if the demand for all of the automobiles could be met--let's say one car for every four visitors--that's still 250k rental cars in my area of less than a 150k *residents*. It's going to be chaos. Also: I have three rooms to rent over the week of the eclipse and if anyone is headed to SE Idaho, I'm willing to reach an arrangement.
