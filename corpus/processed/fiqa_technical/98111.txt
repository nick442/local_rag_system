You didn't say why this person or his aunt would want to give you money. What service are you performing for them? Why would he want to give you money? Simple, practical tip: If somebody offers to give you money for nothing, or a large amount of money for a trivial amount of work, there's about a 99.99% chance that this is a scam. In real life, it is disappointingly rare for millionaires to pick random strangers and give them money for nothing.
