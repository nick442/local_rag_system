Are you kidding? Electric cars can be faster than gasoline powered cars. But do you know what the real advantage is? Car design is limited by having a big, heavy engine and transmission. Plus you have to put the gas tank somewhere safe. Electric cars do away with all that. It will *dramatically* change handling, braking and building a safety cage. Electric cars will completely outperform gasoline cars. No question. Also, the electric cars should have many fewer parts and be more reliable. The future is electric. And youâ€™ll love it.
