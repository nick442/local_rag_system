How far can this be taken though? If you increase the minimum wage to $100/hr, tons of businesses will either close or eliminate most of their staff. Will the increased spending power of those that remain employed really manage to drive growth and subsequent expansion of hiring? Isn't that a rather roundabout way of creating job growth?
