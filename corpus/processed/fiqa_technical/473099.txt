"> You are giving poor and uneducated people a lot more agency than they really have. I mean that's sort of the social contract isn't it? At some point we all agree that humans reach the ""age of reason"" and are responsible for their decisions. What are the implications to say that uneducated don't have agency? Should we use government force to ensure they make good decisions? If they don't have agency should they be allowed to make their own reproductive decisions? I'm not really sure how to take the implications of your argument. >Also teen pregnancy are at historical lows I'm referring to early 20's as well. I'm not sure how you can view the pregnancy (and birth) rates of those in poverty over time but it would be interested to see. I've seen some statistics that indicate that women in poverty have 15% more children than the rest of us, which by itself would create a perpetually growing under class."
