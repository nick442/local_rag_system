Thanks for all the cliches about how I'm a hate filled person, because I think people should live in reality over demanding high pay for skills that are one microchip away from being replaced. When in doubt, pretend the person you're talking to is filled with hate and make a condescending comment about how you hope they'll find Jesus..er..I mean liberalism.
