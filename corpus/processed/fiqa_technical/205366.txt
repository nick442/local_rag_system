Why the fuck are executives retarded enough to take political stances with their companies? Companies like Google are taking a stance against SOPA because it directly affects their business. SOPA doesn't directly affect GoDaddy's business. Just shut the fuck up and make your money. Some executives just have to actively find ways to shoot themselves in the foot.
