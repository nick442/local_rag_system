According to something I read geography doesn't matter. Basically you could be the King of South Dakota with a $75k family income, that's property on a lake, a boat, horses, and all kinds of cool stuff. In a nice city $75k wouldn't get you as much stuff, but you'd have more people around you and more amenities. (Looking, but I can't find the source at the moment) However geography has a large impact on happiness, a Hawaiian with $75k income is on average happier than a New Yorker with a $75k income, more money wouldn't make either of them happier though. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091217141314.htm
