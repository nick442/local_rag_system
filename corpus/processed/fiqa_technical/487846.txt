"No it isn't. Time is fixed. On each of those days, the sale ends ""today."" But tomorrow *becomes* today, and today becomes yesterday. So, if the sale ended today, then tomorrow the ad would be completely false, because the sale, in fact, ended yesterday. Come on man, don't be one of those ""time is linear"" people. Another example. My IT shop has been saying for 3 years that a certain project will be completed in 6 months. The problem is that in 6 months, it will *still* be 6 months! The point in time on the horizon may be fixed, but the horizon itself is NOT. If you see a point on the horizon, then walk toward it, when you arrive at that point, did you reach the horizon? NO!! The horizon is still as far away as it was before."
