I stopped paying for television from my cable company a few years ago. I have Netflix, Hulu Plus, Roku, DVDs, Bluray, ect. The only thing I wish I had that I don't is HBOgo. I'm in the same boat about commercials as the author. When I'm at someone else's house and a commercial comes on, it is a novel thing.
