"You hit the nail on the head in the first paragraph ( the rest was good as well). Most data is garbage, but even a large amount of garbage data can tell you something. I wouldn't touch DRYS with a 9 million foot long poll, but if 9 million people said DRYS was a good buy (or said they were bullish on stock twits, or twitter). Id buy DRYS and sell it by the end of the day. People are stupid, there's no argument there, but if 9 million idiots are gonna be buying a shitty stock, I'm gonna join them, let the price get driven up based on nothing but hive mind idiocy, then drop it before they all realize they've been fooled by their own ignorance. AMD has been hilarious. I've been holding AMD since 2013, any tech geek would know AMD was a great buy back then. Now all I see are posts about ""Why did AMD go up today?"" or ""Will AMD hit 100 dollars a share by the end of the year"" or something equally ludicrous. People don't want to read. They just want to spew nonsense and be spoon fed the information (by those who are spewing nonsense)"
