Generally speaking, if you have significant revenue outside the US, then you're better off incorporating out of the US. The US has significantly higher corporate tax rates, and taxes on worldwide income not just revenue in the US. Setting up in an offshore country would have no corporate tax but would cost about $1000 a year in fees. For any non-US company, your US partner would need to file a 5471 form with his US personal tax which reports the company's finances. That costs about $1000 a year for an accountant to prepare. So you still need accounting on the company, even if you are not paying corporate tax. Setting up the company is reasonably easy, you just use a broker. The bank account may be more difficult but they can help with that too. You may find that your optimal personal tax strategy and your US partner's strategy are different. For example, if your partner is living overseas, then they are not taxed on salary in the US, but are taxed on dividends. So they would prefer to take any money out of the company as salary, resulting in no corporate profits. You, on the other hand, might prefer dividends.
