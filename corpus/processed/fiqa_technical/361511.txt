I have encoded videos that we watch via Apple TV XBMC on our overpriced Sony Bravia LCD in one room and a cheap Acer LCD in another. They look amazingly different on these two screens. Same movie, same playback unit, same HDMI connection, different TVs. The Sony presents a smooth display with few artifacts. Good motion, clean image on pause, etc. The Acer displays tons of MPEG encoding artifacts, palletized chunks in what should be smooth gradients, visible in motion as well as paused. I'm just saying that there is a different in what you get when you pay more.
