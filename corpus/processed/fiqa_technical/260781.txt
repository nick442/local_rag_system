I use both Factset and Bloomberg on a daily basis. Factset has an extremely powerful portfolio management tool, which is really useful to analyze your portfolios etc. Also, it has a great backtesting tool. But it is unbearably slow, and the UI is not particularly intuitive, and you can't navigate using the keyboard. Factset is not cheaper. Just a different cost structure. I use Bloomberg for prices and stock analysis. It is much quicker and I like the keyboard navigation system. That said, it has a lot of mistakes, especially in the Financial Analysis section. So you can't really trust it.
