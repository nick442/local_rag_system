"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.ceps.eu/publications/when-nobel-prize-goes-pop-richard-thaler-and-uncertain-future-nudge) reduced by 89%. (I'm a bot) ***** > The popularisation of behavioural economics in the form of relatively straightforward experiments paved the way for a successful age of direct implementation in policymaking, as testified to by Thaler&#039;s own involvement with the Behavioural Insights Team and the creation of similar teams in many other governments, including the US. Thaler was the economic genius behind &quot;Nudge&quot; as much as Cass Sunstein was the legal one. > The second is far more controversial: empirical literature reported by Sunstein himself revealed that &quot;Nudgees&quot;, those targeted by a given nudge, tend to be significantly affected only by the nudges they agree with, and in a related vein, &quot;If people are told that they are being nudged, they will react adversely and resist&quot;. > While in the short term modifying the order in which food is presented in a canteen might lead to increased consumption of healthy food over junk food, it is unclear whether individuals end up maintaining these new consumption choices over time, or simply learn where to find the food they wanted in the first place, thus neutralising the nudge. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/77o9be/ceps_when_the_nobel_prize_goes_pop_richard_thaler/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~231947 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **Nudge**^#1 **individual**^#2 **economic**^#3 **behavioural**^#4 **policy**^#5"
