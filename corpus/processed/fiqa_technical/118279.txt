"I'm not defending Faber, but from an statistical point your logic is terrible. It's a lot easier to go from 2 to 4 than it is from 200 to 400 - so any undeveloped third-world country should be growing a **lot** faster than places with existing stable economies. And to put ""fastest growing"" into context, it's 8.5%, which isn't even as big as I was expecting considering the US is growing at 3% and has a much larger base value."
