"I would say his delivery could use a little better tempo and charisma, but the content and references he included were just right for his audience. I just watched that video because I wasn't sure if ""applause break"" meant he had to stop for applause or there was a break in the applause. I see that you meant he had to stop because they were applauding what he said. The applause was more for the republican and american part than the gay part, but you're right. There was applause directly associated with his statement of being proud to be gay. I have to think that his alignment with Trump is based on small government (deregulation and lower taxes) and frustration with the status quo. They are very strange bedfellows. Aside from deregulation and lower taxes, I wouldn't think that Thiel has much in common with the RNC. An example from the video is where he asks ""Who cares?"" about the issue of transgender bathrooms. The crowd cheered at that. I don't know who gets worked up more about the issue, the left or the right, but I know they both certainly do. Hearing Thiel's thoughts today would be very interesting. I believe he has acknowledged that Trump could end in some sort of disaster. I respect Thiel's abilities, the amount of thought he has put into various topics, and his effectiveness very much. He's one of the few Trump supporters that I can't immediately write off as uninformed or biased in an egregious way. On the other hand, its hard to see how a man as intelligent as he is could respect a ridiculous carnival barker like Trump."
