"saying that someone is ""the CEO of their product"" (and the variants: for sales: ""the CEO of their territory"", for any one else: ""the CEO of their valuestream"") is idiotic and wrong. It's a simple-minded nonsense perpetuated by unimaginative line managers. It's downright insulting when directed at individual contributors."
