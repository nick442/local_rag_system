Say what you want about their prices but I still go there twice a month because: * The marbling on their beef is significantly better than what I can get at Safeway * Their cheese selection is far better in variety and quality, and their employees are much more knowledgeable than Safeway * They actually have a cured meats section. I love me calabrese salami with a nice malbec. 95% of my grocery shopping is done at Safeway (can't beat $2/lb chicken), but the 5% when I'm feeling fancy it's pretty hard to beat Whole Foods.
