"Instead of getting into complex economic theories, here are the few places I can tell you where the cash has disappeared to: 1. Apple - holding over 100b cash in their vault more than any banks have in their reserves in the world and more than enough to pay off all of the debts of the U.S. 2. Real Estates.....in developing countries, that is :p. You may keep hearing how real estates are de-valuing in the U.S., but in developing countries like the BRICs, they are going higher. Think Hong Kong, Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, etc. Yes, it's a proven bubble there. If you have access to their regional news, just listen to how many people in Asia have to borrow from loan sharks to keep their finances afloat. 3. Gold - go see for yourself on goldprice.org, that's where the wealthy individuals put their cash in the so-called ""safe haven"" next to shotguns. Yes, it's ridiculous and is totally out of anyone's league beyond basic things like air, water, and food. 4. Commodities (gas, food, basic materials) - enough said, check out your local gas pumps and grocery stores."
