In this era of music, what can Rolling Stone offer that is unique? Musicians go directly to their fans now, they don't need journalists to be the intermediary. And investigative journalism has better outlets. I don't think cultural touchstones like Rolling Stone that offer many things to readers, but don't do any of them extremely well, have a place anymore.
