"How soon can we get the AI systems to focus on finding ways to make faster chips with more efficient manufacturing processes? That's when things get really interesting. I think it might shatter Moore's Law. When the AI designs the optimal manufacturing processes, that will be a good day. Of course, that will probably mean the AI will design it's own robots to do the manufacturing, and it would code the robots, so technically, it would be building it's own ""body."" And that's how we get Terminators. Note to self.. invest in EMP manufacturing companies."
