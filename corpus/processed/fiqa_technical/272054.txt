"LOL. Its gotten harder for those who dont want to change with the times. Tools like sentdex and PsychSignal provide a solid argument against the headline of the article. Its not harder, the methods have just changed. Most people dont understand the methods and thus: ""its gotten harder."" Harder is entirely relative, for people like me, its gotten easier.. [This algorithm looks for a high volume of bullish tweets about penny stocks and returns 95% in a year.](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/psychsignal-machine-learning-and-penny-stocks-95-percent-in-a-year) [This algorithm trades my favorite tech stocks using tweets to determine when to buy. 140% 2016-mid 2017.](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/psychsignal-machine-learning-models-and-tech-stocks) I will say that in those algorithms, I throw out more than half the data. To be more correct, I assume half the data is bullshit (people mindlessly reposting, morons talking about shit they dont understand, etc.) People, in general, are idiots. The moment you accept this, social media analysis becomes rather easy. In my first 3 weeks of trading ever I was up 60% because of Bio Med stocks (i lost it all due to greed, I now always pull out early (lol) as opposed to too late). I didn't know ANYTHING about the bio med market - I let stock twits do all the work (in general, Twitter is actually more correct than stocktwits, which is rather ironic). Once I started trading with algorithms, I automated this process. Have real analysts been squashed by the short segments they get on TV? sure. but if you are really getting your info from TV, as opposed to just reading it in 1/10th of the time it takes to watch a TV program, thats your fault. These days I feel its best to do the research yourself, read about it online somewhere, or use the high volume of data available with algorithmic trading."
