"What you are referring to is called an ""externality"" in economics. Efforts are often made by governments to internalize costs to groups and individuals that don't experience consequences of their actions. But from another perspective, forces such as scientific advancement bring new methods of eliminating such consequences. Much like the Wall-E concept per the movie of the same name (technology reorganizing or converting what was previously waste). This is another aspect of the free market, but it has what some economists call ""stickiness"" or delay from problem to solution, as scientific advances are often done via fiscal motives, urged on by the marketplace and public demand."
