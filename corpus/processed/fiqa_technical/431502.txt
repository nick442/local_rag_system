"All ticket vendors do this, not just Ticket Master. I purchased $20 of University of NC (UNC) Mens soccer tickets on their website last week, and was charged: $1 per ticket ""service fee"", $3 per ticket ""booking fee"", and then $1.50 per ticket to send via PDF e-mail! The total came out to around $11 in fees for $20 in tickets, making the total $30+ dollars when I should have just bought them up front at the counter before the game since it wasn't sold out."
