Wouldn't that cause more problems in hiring. If small companies that can't afford a fine for not hiring the right race probably won't hire anyone at all. Now we only have big companies that can afford a discrimination lawsuit will be able to grow. If we want more jobs we need to make less law on hiring people not more. Every time to add anther barrier between employers and employees we are going to get less of both. Only the big companies that know how the systems works will win.
