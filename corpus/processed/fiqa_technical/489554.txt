"I get what you are saying, and I have actually asked for and gotten raises in some previous jobs, so I know it's not impossible. But in a case like this, do I go in and say *""hey I know Bob does the same job and makes X more money than me, so now I want a raise for X""*? Like the title of the post implies, this is the exact reason employers want to keep employee salaries confidential, and I doubt they'd appreciate you bringing it up while asking for a raise. So I guess the other option is to ask for a $15k raise out of nowhere. Might be possible, but **not likely** going to happen. Assuming Bob and I have the same job description, experience, and skill level, why should he make more because he happened to get hired during a talent shortage? Yes the company needs to offer a better salary to attract new talent, but when that's not reflected across the board even for current employees, and when companies rely on keeping it a secret instead, they breed mistrust and resentment."
