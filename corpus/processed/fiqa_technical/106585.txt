Because BB is really a decentralized marketing company that supports individual retail stores. It would be continuing to use typewriters instead of email; while still employing typists. Xerox had the same problem: they were a copy machine company and the sales workers got paid by each paper copy was made. They R&D the paperless office PARC (mouse, GUI, laser printer, etc..) and can't make it work because it conflicts with their core business. BB would have had to buy back all the franchises. The ONLY thing BB could do was to go out of business.
