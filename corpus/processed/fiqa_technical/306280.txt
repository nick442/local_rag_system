"There is a ten year statue of limitations on debt collection, bankruptcy, etc. The problem is, if you start paying, even say, $1, you ""acknowledge"" the debt and the clock starts again. Debt claims fall under the ""he said, she said,"" rubric. In debt restructuring situations, the debtor is taught to write all their creditors DENYING debts. Some percentage of those creditors won't have the paperwork to back up their claims. Others will, and can press their claims. Then a court decides. But in any event, a debt more than tens years old is a ""stale,"" debt. A court is likely to rule in your favor. Unless you ""acknowledge"" the debt."
