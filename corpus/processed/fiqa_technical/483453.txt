"Yea. Almost every form I fill out wants to know ""Employer Name"". They don't even bother checking ""Are you Self Employed"". Of course, I end up writing ""Self Employed"" in employer name field anyway. In the United States, it is even harder because EVERY state has their own labor and employment laws. You are a freelancer but what if you need to travel to a client site in a different state. Bam, you gotta file taxes for that state as well even if you made like a few hundred bucks. Too much red tape and it is really hard to change."
