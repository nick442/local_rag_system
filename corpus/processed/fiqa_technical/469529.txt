"You should read ""Financial Analysis for Management"" (Robert Higgins). It is short and explains things very simply from a high level perspective. This is especially valuable when you are explaining things to non-finance people. Also, an analyst will want to develop quick ways for making estimations. Don't get too caught up in the tiny details, although they are enticing for problem solvers (I've made some over-complicated models myself). In the process, know which direction your short cut is biased, check other people's short cuts, where's the bias? Understand it. Understand how it may affect the outcome. Is it material? This will develop your ability to understand models. BUILD MODELS. Pick up a 10-K. Build a simple model. Connect an Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flows. Update it, break it, fix it. Rinse & repeat."
