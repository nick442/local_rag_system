>When a store physically closes, does that effect business in that surrounding area? Absolutely. Many malls are only alive because they have anchor stores that attract customers, which then purchase from less attractive outlets nearby. To compensate, I believe outlets generally subsidize rents of anchors. >This is kind of a branding issue I guess. And/or do online sales noticeably decline in that area? I don't have any data for this, but I believe online sales would increase as brand awareness increases. There are also benefits where you can buy online and have it delivered, but return in person. >I got curious from this because I’ve always noticed that L Brands (operates Victoria’s Secret & Bath and body Works) seems to be in many malls, even failing ones. I’ve since learned that this is actually their business model. But why? Probably low rents. Commercial real estate is a difficult business. Hot locations are always rented. Bad locations will do anything to keep their tenants. >Would they have high rates of return if they were online? Increases in damages? (hard to resell shower gel and undies, even if you don’t know if they were used) I have never seen either of those items be accepted for return.. >Or for specialty retailers is it important to the brand that they have a physical location for brand recognition? Yes. Also there are customer acquisition benefits to being physically present such as being able to give out samples, and having a good fragrance such as Subway and that body wash place.
