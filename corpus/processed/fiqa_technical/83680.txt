I don't see that this follows. Capital commitments require that one assess the ability to unwind as information changes - market frictions. Thats why private equity demands a premium. HFT is not investing - it is far closer to market making. In that regard it is a social good. What is of a concern is that they are far less supervised than a market maker. They provide liquidity the way bankers provide loans - when it is not essential. The old adage of an umbrella when it is sunny but take them back at the sign of rain. If there are requirements to commit capital and maintain orderly markets with some oversight on their ability to maintain their capital ratios, a shadow market maker, then they should get to enjoy making a spread in exchange for keeping those spreads relatively tight.
