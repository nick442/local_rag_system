Haha, I used to work for a head of research whose favorite pastime seemed to be putting together these kinds of charts. Edit: And the funny thing is people who take this chart at face value shouldn't want to short anyway - the balance sheet is going to flatline for sometime before they start letting it run off - so at most it suggests that people utilize strategies that work in sideways markets.
