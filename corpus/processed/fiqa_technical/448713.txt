"if it opens below my limit order What exactly are you trying to achieve here? If your limit order is for 100 and the stock opens ""below"" your limit order, say 99, then it is obviously going to buy it automatically. also place a stop loss on the same order Most brokers allow limit + stop loss order at the same time on same order. What I conclude from your question is that you're with a broker that is using obscure technology. Get a better broker or maybe, retry phrasing your question correctly."
