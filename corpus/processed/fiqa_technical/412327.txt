If I were in your position, I'd start reading about the job on my spare time. There are lots of good books that are available free if you know where to look *cough pirated* A couple of titles to start you off. (note I haven't personally gone through all of them) Market Risk Analysis - Carol Alexander Modeling Risk: Applying Monte Carlo Simulation, Real Options Analysis, Forecasting, and Optimization Techniques- Johnathan Derivatives: Markets, Valuation, and Risk Management - Robert E. Whaley Best of luck.
