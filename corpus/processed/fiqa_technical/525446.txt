"If I recall correctly you get PDF's from there? Things like this happen when printing to PDF as both the PDF ""printer"" and the sending program fuss over page size and layout, which can subtly (and not-so-subtly) increase page size, leading to ""spill"" onto the next page. Follow that with a hard page break in the source document and your nice eight page doco is now eighteen-and-one-half pages, mostly white space."
