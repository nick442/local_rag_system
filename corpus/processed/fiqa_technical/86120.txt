This is a weird skew on statistics. We added 8 Million jobs which lowered the average wage since most of these jobs were entry level. So they took the drop in average salary and multiplied it by the added jobs and said that's how much drop in the economy we had. I feel like the opposite is true. More jobs only adds I the economy not take away no matter how much they make.
