"Why would you ask ""is the money yours"", when you know it isn't? When we were young children we were told ""two wrongs don't make a right"". As an adult we know that breaking the law ""to get back at"" someone we perceive as breaking the law is illegal. In sports and in real life, the retaliator often receives a worse punishment than the initial rule violator. In the case mentioned, the second part of the ""scam"" would proceed if you participated or not. The person would go to their bank and indicate a mistaken deposit and have such refunded to their account. By the correct amount yours would be debited. Woe to the person that spent this money prior to the debit."
