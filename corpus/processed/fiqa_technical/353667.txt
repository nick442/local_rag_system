Yep. Definitely troll. Deregulation made it possible for anyone to start an airline and then airlines without unions kicked the snot out of unionized airlines. Same plane, same airports, and the flight costs $350 to fly on an airline with unionized employees or $300 to fly on an airline without the unions. Guess which one the public picked?
