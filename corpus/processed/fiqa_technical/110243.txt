"This is just trade warfare. China is rejecting loads based on the presence of the ""Vipterra"" corn trait which is just another BT variant from Syngenta. China has only rejected loads from America based on the presence of Vipterra despite every single load coming from Brazil and Argentina having this trait present. Vipterra is grown a ton in South America due to the very high insect pressure."
