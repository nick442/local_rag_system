It doesn't matter if the buyer breaches the contract during the due diligence period, because most due diligence periods allow the buyer to breach the agreement without cause. Unless there is due diligence money added to the contract (different from earnest money), then breaching the contract costs nothing to the buyer. This happened to me. I learned the hard way: until the due diligence period is over, the buyer can renege without consequences. It's one of the risks of being a seller.
