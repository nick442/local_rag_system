I'd personally use a standard brokerage account and invest in a mix of mutual funds, ETFs and individual stocks. Follow the municipal bond markets and be prepared to move into muni funds or ETFs when opportunities present themselves. If you buy on weakness, you can pull some great returns with reasonably safe investment.
