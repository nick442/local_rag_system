#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; [**Minarchism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism): [](#sfw) --- >__Minarchism__ (also known as __minimal statism__) is a [political philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy). It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity\)) ought to exist (as opposed to [anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy)), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from [aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression), [theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft), [breach of contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract), and [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud), and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military), [police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police), and [courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts). In the broadest sense, it also includes [fire departments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department), [prisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison), the [executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government\)), and [legislatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislatures) as legitimate government functions. Such states are generally called [night-watchman states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-watchman_state). > --- ^Interesting: [^Anarcho-capitalism ^and ^minarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism_and_minarchism) ^| [^Night-watchman ^state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-watchman_state) ^| [^Laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) ^| [^Libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck1tpnu) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+ck1tpnu)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
