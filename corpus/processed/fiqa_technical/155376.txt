">They lie right to your face. ""Borrow tens of thousands of dollars to give to us, it will totally work out..for us."" I don't believe they verbalize those last two words. They pretty much end it with a period after the ""work out"" part. And then of course, they produce that BS statistic that college grads make a ""million dollars more over their career"". I mean really? Which grads are those? You mean the ones who graduated circa 45-50 (or more) years ago (when very few people had college degrees)? And in exactly what inflation-adjusted time-frame was that ""million dollars""? Was it 1960 dollars? 1980 dollars? 2000 dollars? Because a million bucks, while still not pocket change even in 2012, was worth a LOT more the further you go back."
