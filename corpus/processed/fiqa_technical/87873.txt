> Theres so much alarmist populism on reddit Should there be less 'alarmist' posts? And did you find my previous post alarming? I'm not calling for our current economic structure to be changed today or tommorow. I just wrote out, as simple as possible, how I see capitalism and why I see it that way. Should people not express desent? Do you not think, that if a lot of people are saying the same thing, there might be a reason for it? I agree that there is a lot of ignorant ideas posted here. Sometimes I post something, only to realize a day later, I said something very ignorant. The flip side of it is, if I had kept silent, I may still hold some of my wrong beliefs. **edit**: Sorry about the ramble. :D
