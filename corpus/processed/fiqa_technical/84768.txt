The only part that bothers me about google is android. Everything else is pretty diverse and each of those individual products could easily or already do have competitors. Video, email, search, social networking, advertisement and analytics all have alternatives. Android however gives them immense power over the offerings of many other companies products, but it is pretty damn messy with no simple solutions besides wait and see what happens so far. Amazon has gotten huge, and while they do amazing logistics, that is almost entirely what they do. Unless im buying straight from manufacturer, I only shop at 3 or 4 sites and 90% of that is amazon. Amazon, Newegg(computer shit), RockAuto(car shit), and monoprice for cables. For now they are king but I doubt it is going to stay like that. Ive noticed some products have higher markups and suppliers are likely raising prices for amazon, but it will be a few more years at least before anyone else might be able to gain traction.
