"Depending on the details of your solar panel setup, the monthly savings may change depending on changes in the law or utility company policy. This could change how long it will take for the solar panels to ""pay for themselves"". So your bullet point about the ""payback period""/""break even point"" is not fixed at the moment you buy the solar panels; it depends on costs you will incur over many years, and those costs could turn out to be different from what you originally thought. At least in the US, home solar installations typically work by selling excess power back to the power company. The power company can change the amount that it pays you for that power. There is also typically a minimum charge for being connected to the grid, and the power company can raise that charge. (This article mentions one such possible change.) The power companies want to keep making money, and as more people start adding solar panels, the power companies may change their rate structure to make that less financially feasible. You can avoid many of these issues if your solar panels are not connected to the public electricity grid, and you, for instance, store power with your own battery. However (at least in the US) this is very uncommon because it is more complex and expensive."
