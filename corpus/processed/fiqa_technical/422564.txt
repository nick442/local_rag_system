Quite the Paradox this nation if you look from afar, but if you look closely you come to realize what you see is what you get. A darling of Israel because it echos its hatred for Muslims and is willing to eagerly spread anti-Muslim propaganda. It also is the closest to Pakistan which is the thorn in Israels anti-muslim ribs, a muslim country with a nuclear bomb, so it arms India with as much as it can and has deep ties. Rumor has it that the Hindus are actually the 13th lost tribe who worshiped the calf. America would woo India as a counter Balance to China and Russia in the region, as an added bonus, perhaps a smaller wheel to power America's funny money economy though that will burn out the Indian economy a lot faster, and its effects are visible already. In an effort to please India has made an attempt to restructure it central bank, but it has gone as well as a pile of shit in the open, with badly time rate decisions and demonetization debacles, not to mention deep corruption and a culture of graft. China looks at India as a reluctant partner in BRICS, while Russia looks at India as a long time but extremely unreliable partner. They both recognize that BRICS cannot continue in this vain with India playing the American agenda in a unity that is supposed to directly confront IMF and world bank control of the region. Its economy has been talked up by the US but has deep structural and systemic weakness and is folded over like bubble wrap. It has made arms deals it wont be able to pay for and its just a matter of time before the consequences of being openly promiscuous hit home hard. They have a space program, but no toilets, pretty girls though . .very very pretty girls.
