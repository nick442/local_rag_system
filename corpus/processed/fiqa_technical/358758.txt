The issue is, universal healthcare is not perfect. No system is, since healthcare costs are economically infinite, so every system draws the line somewhere. In universal healthcare, coverage lines are determined by central authorities on what is most economically beneficial to ALL of society. In the US, coverage lines are drawn up by for profit insurers. It's a complete clusterf*ck. Why any American would prefer a barely regulated for profit insurer to make decisions on whether their critical healthcare is covered, knowing that they personally profit should they decline coverage is incredible. I personally lean libertarian, but not for areas like schools and healthcare. They are far better served universally supported by government taxes.
