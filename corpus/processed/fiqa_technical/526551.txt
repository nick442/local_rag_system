Your first example was a system built by the GOVERNMENT. Your second example is a tiny bus company built on the backbone of the existing PUBLIC bus system already in place. And the third example is talking about having google use PUBLICLY BUILT AND DESIGNED roads and bus stops. I agree it would be fine I suppose to have private companies RUN public transport, but they sure as hell won't build it, and they SHOULDn't make a profit on riders.
