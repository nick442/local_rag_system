WhyHellYeah, What do you do for a living? I am an accountant in the energy industry. I will never be a union member and at $50,000 a year I already make more money than 75% of people and 50% of all households in the USA.. I am in the position where Unions are a threat to my lifestyle and income.. But I do know that collective bargaining is the only thing that prevents capitol from exploiting labor. I'm really curious why you feel differently? >but EEOC is expanding Whats wrong with an agency that is tasked to enforce laws against workplace discrimination expanding? Do you think that workplaces should discriminate against employees?
