Not sold on BK at all. It seems what is being implemented is not going to be sustainable. Net income never = increasing shareholder wealth. BK still has pisspoor food, with sizes of burgers that are laughable, and the whole sector is being eaten by casual dining. Increased comp sales are great, but nothing when traffic is going down more and more. And don't get me started on the 20/20 BK restaurants that cost a fortune to remodel and Schwartz has pushed so hard. TAST even had to dip (quite significantly) into more common to pay for all these remodels. Idk, maybe I'm being bias, but I'm not sold on BK in the slightest or what's driving their, and their franchisee's, stock price.
