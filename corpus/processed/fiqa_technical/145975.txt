"I live in Boston so I look at boston.com quite a bit. In general, boston.com is pretty terrible. Even for local news it is often pretty shitty. Given that, boston.com doesn't try to game the system to garner additional page hits from reddit. Browsing through the articles on The Atlantic it looks like they have lots of sensationalist bullshit written like something right off blogspot or Fox News. ""Is Obama Really That Great of a Foreign Policy President?"" ""Is This Obama's 'Put Up or Shut Up' Moment on Syria Intervention?"" ""Is the International Criminal Court Facing Its 'Black Hawk Down' Moment?"" I can't say I miss seeing sensational crap from them. If this is your idea of a quality content you might not have a leg to stand on when guessing my experiences."
