Why is it important? Are you saying Lewis gets credit for correctly identifying the person to befriend, based on their likelihood of helping him? You're talking about assisting factors *likely* to help while avoiding the ones likely to harm you. Lewis made dumb choices twice and was still successful. Even then, the 'big shot' might have turned out to be Murdoch or Conrad Black, and earned him a trip to jail. Either way, the factors involved are ultimately out of your control however much you encourage them.
