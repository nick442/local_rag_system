One commenter brought up Steve Jobs (I think it's mandatory) and it seems like people forget that Apple's first project wasn't new or revolutionary. There were other personal computers out there, but it was what people wanted. People wanted a keyboard, wanted an easy to interface display, wanted to be able to add on to the system - they learned what the customer wanted by showing their early systems to others at the homebrew computer meetings, and people told them what they wanted. Jobs and Woz delivered it. Nothing new, but it was just flat out good.
