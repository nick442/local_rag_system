"The only thing Google Photos has in common with Picassa is that it stores your photos, but Photos is much more powerful than that. For example, you can search for ""horse"" and it will show you all your pictures of horses. Same with dogs, beaches, whatever. And Google Assistant is much more capable than Siri. Have you used either of those products?"
