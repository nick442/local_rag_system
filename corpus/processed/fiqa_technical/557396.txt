"To be fair, while he was harsh and over-critical, he was realistic. Based on your vague wording (understandable, you think you have a unique proprietary idea) but the other stuff you mentioned, I don't think you can confidently say it'll make ""way over $200,000"". It doesn't seem like you've done much research at all, have a business plan together, or any credible experience to evaluate your idea without personal bias. Hope you continue to pursue it, but do your homework. Learn how to put together a business plan, etc. Because obviously if you came to an investor with your idea explained in the style of your original post, you'd more than likely be laughed off as a delusional kid."
