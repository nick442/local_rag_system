You need to hire a veteran product marketing manager who can help you position and message your product, and will also be connected to whatever ecosystem you operate in. Then you need to find and hire a talented Marcom person. Products never sell themselves, no matter how good. And people would rather buy average products from an established company that they know will be there in a year, then a great product from a company with no credibility. A good marketing team will help you build credibility and brand for you. Don't be that CEO who thinks he/she knows how to message and pitch their product. Because that is always ultimately a failing strategy, proven over and over.
