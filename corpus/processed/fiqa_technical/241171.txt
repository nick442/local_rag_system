"> would rather get a Five Guys burger ""than eat something gross"" TBell gets a bad wrap for being garbage or terrible, but it's good and even better for someone on a budget. Granted it also depends on your location/store you go to, cause the people working there can make decent food terrible just from presentation and what not. I love TBell, it'll continue to be a regular place to visit when I'm starving at 1am, especially over MickyD's."
