"You are not smart. The average person works more than 25 years. And because it's an average earnings increase, OF COURSE EVERYONE DOESN'T REACH IT. By the way, the greatest predictor of a person not reaching it is that person getting a liberal arts degree. And since you seem to want to do baseless math, I'll let you go ahead and decide how much the other 10% has to make in order for it to be true. The point is that if you go to college, particularly to get a more valuable degree, you are making an astoundingly good investment. Are there exceptions? Absolutely. There are always exceptions. That doesn't disprove the facts. Go look at the actual statistics by major or career. Don't bring this, ""I'll bet"" nonsense into the argument as if it proves anything."
