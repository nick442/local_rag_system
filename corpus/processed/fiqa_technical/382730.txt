I'm delighted that the people who work for me fly in the appropriate class. I want them to arrive fresh, rested and prepared to do a great day's work. If I'm paying for an employee to fly somewhere it's because they're smart, capable and are going to create value at their destination. As a shareholder, why would you want them turing up tired, fractious, annoyed and unhappy?
