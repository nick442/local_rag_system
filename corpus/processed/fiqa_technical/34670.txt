"Since the last time savings account interest rates were meaningful banks have made relationships much ""stick-ier."" By that I mean that the online services and all the auto-pay systems in place put up a significant barrier for people to leave their bank. This results in people no longer shopping their banking business around to the bank with the best account interest rates. So no cartel or other devious behavior from banks, but rather just customer apathy (as you pointed out was an option)."
