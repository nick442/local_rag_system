His argument seems to be all hinging on the seamless transaction/transfer of money (which I do agree is something that can be made much better) but what about other functions that banks do.. like lending (mortgages) ect. I don't see how that works on blockchain/bitcoin. and also I don't see why it has to be Bitcoin and not some competing crypto.
