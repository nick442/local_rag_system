"Re: ""In retirement I don't see how we can be in a higher tax bracket than we are now (maybe than we will be if one of us stops working, we buy a house, we have a couple of kids, etc)."" That's assuming tax rates remain the same. What if tax rates go up? Consider the U.S. deficit and the debt, and unfunded entitlement programs. Even though you may be in a lower bracket in retirement (bracket, as in ordered income ranges), there's still a possibility that at that later point in time, tax rates in general could be higher than today. So, even though you may find yourself in a lower bracket in retirement, who is to say the tax rate for that bracket won't exceed what you pay today in the higher bracket? Don't think switch. Rather, I'd consider diversifying retirement savings across both pre-tax and Roth – i.e. make contributions to each type of account – so you're not gambling 100% on which bracket you'll be in, what tax rates will be like in the future, etc. Then, you'll at least have some money in a Roth account that, in retirement, you can do with as you please without having a tax consequence .. assuming the U.S. government doesn't get so desperate as to change the tax-free nature of Roth account withdrawals! :-)"
