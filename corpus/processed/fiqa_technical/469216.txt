This isn't a religious organization in that sense, so the exception is not applicable. But he won't win. He needs to prove that the reason he wasn't hired was specifically because of his religious views, however, it would be easy for the company to say that they didn't believe he was a good match for the corporate philosophy, wouldn't fit in, etc. Various subjective things that really can't be argued. Unless he can show a clear pattern in them turning away those who aren't Christian enough, he doesn't stand a chance.
