The US did the same during/after WW2. Look up the T-Force. Its likely manufacturing will return to the US due to highly advanced automation. Its difficult to find sympathy for Western corporations when they are doing everything to pay as little tax as possible and to bribe/'lobby' politicians. Even Google is now censoring free speech, so how are they different to a Chinese company?
