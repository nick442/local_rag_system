This 'social contract' you speak of is rooted in theft. If you disagree with how taxes are spent, and do not participate in the tax system, then you will be stripped of your savings and property and will be sent to prison. It just seems like such a barbaric and archaic way to operate society to me. And actually, many Americans *have* increasingly been renouncing their US citizenship and moving to other parts of the world. It's mostly because of increased business regulations and the endless War on Terror.
