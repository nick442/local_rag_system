Yes I kow my questions are broad and debatable, I was looking to spark the interest of multiple perspectives/opinions. Regarding the strength of western economic fundamentals, I think a lot of it has to do with simply better performance by companies, especially in Western Europe. I think both this performance (companies' broad EPS growth) as well as less anxiety over the future of the Eurozone/PIIG debt crisis has engendered a broad feeling of positive animal spirits. Imo this has become a recursive self fulfilling prophesy in the markets as people's optimistic expectations of the future leads to higher investment, lending and risk taking, which results in growth, which then rewards and spurs further spending/investment. The other argument (especially in EU) is that the ECB's sustained accommodative monetary policy policy is finally trickling down into European asset prices just like they did for US equities from 2011-2015. Regarding your series of questions about China/NK, I was genuinely hoping for answers/opinions on those questions you proposed. I think China is playing Trump and the State Dept like a fiddle - stringing us along with this Kim debacle while they quietly consolidate sea territory (man-made military islands) & drilling rights in the South China Sea.
