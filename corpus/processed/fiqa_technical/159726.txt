First, I don't claim to have all the answers, but can appreciate the dialogue and question you're posing. As you stated, you love the overall advertising experience and, I'm assuming, sales generation from those experiences. Since, that is how you'll generate revenue. Integrated marketing, to me, has always seemed like an especially narrow subject matter. I don't mean that it is simply or easy by any means, but rather you become a story teller in the advertising world and your story is to impact your target audience in a particular way. I'll use myself as an example: I am a former college athlete and currently work in sales/marketing/supply chain. I watch a lot of sports with my two sons and saw the recent Gatorade ad about in order to win, you have to lose. That ad has stuck in my head because I know that commitment from athletics to school to work. It's a brilliant concept that has me hooked. To me, that is what IMC is all about. A concept that was tailored to tell a story of success through failure and having athletes that repeat that story. A truly hand crafted product that now has me opt for a Gatorade when leaving the gym. When I consider marketing, as a whole, I don't think of these types of tailored situations, but rather the whole puzzle. Marketing, and its counterpart analytics, create a solid shape for a business to thrive. Your personal sales lines and how your sales people are performing are a part of your marketing potential. Customer service to build relations and increase your net promoter scores. Technical applications to develop products that are in line with customer demand and, in turn, the supply chain foresight to deliver on said products. All of it is marketing. Hope this helps.
