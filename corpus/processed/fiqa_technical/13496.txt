An Indian citizen who is not a resident of India (an NRI) or a Person of Indian Origin (a PIO) is not permitted to sell or gift immovable property in India (real property for US readers) to another NRI or PIO; the property must be sold or gifted to a resident of India. So, assuming that the property in question is in India, you cannot sell it to your NRI friend.
