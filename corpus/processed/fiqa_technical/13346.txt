You won't know what the exchange rate will be when you convert AUD back to USD when you eventually want to spend your money unless you hedge. the movement in fx rates could easily outweigh any benefit received from higher interest. As far as i am aware the way the hedge is constructed you will lose any benefit from foreign interest. That being said, the 'Carry Trade' is big business. There are plenty of people that borrow yen to invest in AUD.
