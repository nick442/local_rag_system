So America puts its cost of emissions right into the tax on a gallon of gas instead waiting to tax until you buy a certain amount of gas. My point is, This is almost exactly like the Cap & Trade policy Obama wanted to pass about a year ago. America is up in arms when they have to pay another Cap & Trade tax in another country when they are on their soil but when we want to Cap & Trade here its OK because its all for the environment. Also I don't like Environmentalist at all so I don't support any emissions taxes.
