All the manufacturers exporting things from China. When they mention a supposed lack of consumer demand in the USA they fail to account for the heavy balance of payments deficit, [$124 billion in the last quarter of 2011](http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/glance.htm). If there's no demand, as the Keynesians claim, how come the US is buying so much stuff from other countries? There seems to be plenty of demand, the US is just unable to manufacture the products its citizens want. The real problem is lack of production capability. The industrial base of the US has too many obsolete plants. And the companies cannot modernize with the current tax regulations, they are unable to depreciate those obsolete plants fast enough to build new ones that could compete with the foreign corporations.
