Yeah. It's already crazy here. All summer we've had massive road projects, both on highways and locally. Since the end of last week the traffic has also increased noticeably--and we're two weeks away from the event. The news and town meetings have been about traffic safety, food preparation (buy early and for two weeks), plus we've had a rash of fires in the area we are trying to get under control (51k acres burning less than 50 miles south of here--in Pocatello). It's going to be crazy; it's going to be awesome.
