"When I was getting my Business Admin degree, WFM was the hot thing because of the current ""green revolution"" and I had tons of access to management at all levels because of my job. So I pretty much built all the work on my degree around them. Nothing quite like having interviews with regional buyers and store managers as a primary source on a paper or project. Quite frankly, I think Mackey was pretty much just lucky. Most of the people I interacted with while I worked there had zero sense when it came to any sort of long term strategic positioning within the industry (which is why the activist investors have been pushing to get Mackey to sell). Now that they've actually begun to have competent competition, the cracks have really started to show. Honestly, instead of trying to expand at a breakneck pace like they started to five-seven years, they should have looked internally and instead begun to examine all the cost-saving measures they could on their supply-chain, management structure, and IT systems while they were the darling of both consumers and the markets, and had the profits. Instead, they attempted to triple the size of the business in just a decade (funded by increasing the prices of their products even more), and really destroyed all the cultural goodwill they had going for them. Then they started expanding into areas that weren't as affluent, trying to do these longshot deals with no cohesive strategy other than ""people like us, they'll show up."" Seven or eight years ago, people were excited when they heard I worked for Whole Foods, and wanted to ask me a million questions. Now they find out I worked at Whole Foods and they're just like ""Fucking A that place is insanely expensive, and all the employees seem miserable."""
