"Bravo! Too bad if a few big, slow, ancient fund managers, who can barely anticipate what day it is, much less when to make a move, can't keep up, wahhh. They have had enough cake. The world will be a VERY different place financially in 20 years and that's life. Look, it's all pretty simple and it works like this: When stocks are UP, buy real estate (NOW). When real estate is UP, buy stock (this is what you do next). Anyone who says different is probably still using credit. ""Everyday I'm hustlin"" -R. Ross"
