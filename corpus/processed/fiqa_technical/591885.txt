a 60k pay raise is totally possible (depending on too many factors to list (ok, fine I'm generalizing)) coming from TX to San Jose. the difference in raw pay numbers makes it emotionally hard to make rational comparisons. I once baked at a job on the east coast early I'm my career before I understood how to compare reasonably. anecdotal evidence shows it's possible because a machinist friend is moving here from Austin because he can make much more money. of course that's just an example.
