Your right. The argument is, it's already dickered, so now we need to come up with something better. National ID is what's on the table. SSN has been used that way because there was a need for a national ID but everyone opposed it so vehemently and it bit us in the ass. Now here we are with a mass ID theft because we didn't address the problem when we should have.
