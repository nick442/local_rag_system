"The real question you're asking is how you can work for your business. You cannot. Whether your ""friend"" pays you or not is entirely irrelevant. Claiming your work-related earnings as interest/dividend will make it also a tax fraud, in addition to the immigration violation (i.e.: not only deportation but also potentially jail time)."
