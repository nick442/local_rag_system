The tourists who go to that golf course will not be staying in Benton Harbor, they will be staying in the rich white neighboring town of St. Joseph and avoiding Benton Harbor at all costs (much like everyone else who lives in SW MI). There are a ton of politics behind this golf course, but I do believe Benton Harbor does get quite a bit of economic benefit from this course being on their property. They didn't want it in the first place, but it ultimately was built and now what's done is done. One round of golf is out the ass expensive at $150/round for a non-resident during peak season.
