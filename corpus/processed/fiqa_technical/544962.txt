So obviously, realtors are not economists and have a strong bias here. A lot of actual [economists](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-tax-deductions-economists-hate/) think the mortgage deduction is nonsense and doesn't actually promote home ownership. Countries without the deduction have about the same ownership rates as the U.S. Worth noting that this proposal doesn't actually scrap the mortgage deduction, it just makes the standard deduction bigger. Some people will end up better off with the new standard deduction, and those with more expensive homes can keep using the mortgage deduction. This is one of the few proposals coming out of the Republican congress that actually helps poor people more than rich people.
