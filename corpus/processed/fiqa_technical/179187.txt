**>in a survey of 1000 American Executive**s McQuaid found a “whopping” 35 percent of Americans are happy at their job. And, 65 percent say a better boss would make them happy. Only 35 percent say a pay raise will do the same thing. Even if it wasnt tripe, asking a bunch of people probably already in the top 5% of income, if they would rather have a new boss or an unknown amount pay raise, you might get a totally different answer than asking the rank and file. Median income america. so from what i read, the best the title could say is 65% of well off americans would rather a better boss than a raise. WHich is perfectly understandable.
