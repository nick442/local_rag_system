"They are overpriced to begin with. One reason is the fact that they are luxury cars. A second, related reason, is that they tend to push the technology envelope. All cars depreciate drastically the minute they are driven off the lot. This a good argument for buying a car that is 1-2 years old. The higher you are, the more you can fall. Repairs and maintenance are typically still expensive on these cars, due to relative rarity and the lack of necessary expertise. Here is where that advanced technology bites you. This is a reason that a 5 year old Civic may be worth more than than a 10 year old Benz. It may simply not be worth the hassle of maintaining/repairing a luxury car. This is especially true for an aging luxury car. There are some people that only buy domestic, precisely because of the maintenance costs. Also, a 10 year old car is still a 10 year old car, regardless of the make. (There are a few notable exceptions, like the NSX.) Hondas and Toyotas have a great reputation for reliability and (long-term) total cost of ownership. ""Better"" is a subjective issue, that depends on a variety of variables. A Civic is certainly not better in terms of technology, comfort, etc. But, it is likely better in terms of maintenance, reliability, etc. Which ""better"" you focus on, is up to you."
