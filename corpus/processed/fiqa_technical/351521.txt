I am not sure where your numbers are coming from but I don't want you to be wrong. I am only giving like as I said previous my (non pro) advice. People are coming at me like i am Warren Buffet. I know what I have done and what I believe. Obviously all my eggs are not in one basket no one ( at least I hope) is that dumb. I strongly believe that Snap Chat and Walmart are a very strong buy for long term. I also think GoPro is a very good company to earn short-middle term income on. The fact you have made 30% returns is fucking awesome and congrats you obviously doing something right. I do although feel Snap is heavily underestimated for what they are doing and what they want to do. I am will admit i am a bit out of the box on all of it but I am willing to take that risk with the amount of money I am willing to dump into to do so. I hope you keep rocking the returns you are! Make your money my friend!
