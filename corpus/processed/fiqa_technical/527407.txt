I understand what they are doing, and certainly don't disagree with your assessment. HOWEVER, what I'm saying is that people are going to buy Birkenstock's on Amazon with or without the CEO's permission and thus with or without legit Birkenstocks (Read counterfeit). My point is that they can either capture that distribution channels themselves or someone else will. When American's buy shoes now, its turning more and more to online distribution. Ignoring an online distribution channel is the same as ignoring cell phones if you're a pay phone provider. All I'm saying is he can get on board or get out of the way.
