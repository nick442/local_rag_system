I agree. That's why I referenced the way things are done in the Valley in quotes. >..big companies.. I work in IT at a fortune 10 company. It's not a Tech firm but our CIO oversees a 10,000+ head count. If you don't mind not having one of the 4 horseman on your resume, you can find great work with great pay and plenty of time to spend what you make in other industries that need technology to function (which is basically all of them).
