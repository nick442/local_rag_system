People romanticize it. I just finished a prestigious MBA and the number of people who were obsessed with PE found it to be this super sexy niche of finance. If you are a partner it can be great, but it takes a long time to get there and necessitates you being on the ground floor of the firm. Otherwise its ibanking with better hours/pay.
