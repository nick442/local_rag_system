"When I first started working in finance I was given a rule of thumb to decide which price you will get in the market: ""You will always get the worst price for your deal, so when buying you get the higher ask price and when selling you get the lower bid price."" I like to think of it in terms of the market as a participant who always buys at the lowest price they can (i.e. buys from you) and sells at the highest price they can. If that weren't true there would be an arbitrage opportunity and free money never exists for long."
