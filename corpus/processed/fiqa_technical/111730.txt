>You seem to have very little respect for your coworkers in general. So why the fuck are you still there?!? A true high performers rarely can stomach working with people they despise as long as you've been with this company. It's a job and I need the money. I'm used to being the top percentile of the class, working at the top firms. The economy has made that difficult. So I'm settling for less and looking for better opportunities in the meantime. Thanks for the advice, I understand what you mean now.
