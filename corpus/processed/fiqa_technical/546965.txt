Subprime loans typically pay a higher rate of interest. If you earn 10% on a subprime loan and 4% don't pay you earn 6%. If you earn 5% on a prime loan and 1% don't pay you earn 4%. During the years up to the financial crisis a lot of subprime loans were sold to investors, earning the originating banks money from fees. If you can make a $1K loan and sell it to an investor for $1050, that's a damn good business. Subprime lending isn't so much about being good at picking borrowers, it's more about being good at collecting. Different skill set.
