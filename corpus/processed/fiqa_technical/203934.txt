"3 things people think about when getting a plumber: * Can they be trusted? * Are their rates affordable? * Could I just do it myself, or is it dirty & too hard? I think if you smack some item on your biz cards, marketing material, website homepage that address those 2 issues (trust & affordable) then you'll happily attract more customers. Also, a really, free fun way to market would be to have your father do some ""How-To"" videos, and put them on YouTube, and do keywords related to region. Get ultra-realistic and gritty in the video. Show how dirty it gets, and how much wrenching & special gear is needed. Talk about how much the gear costs, and the danger of a certain chemical etc. No need to worry about losing business. Anybody that has attempted plumbing knows it's damn hard. And if they don't, they will call you when they fuck it up (as I have). But in the meantime, you gain trust, and you dishearten people that thought ""I can fix that"", and then see your father sticking his arm down a toilet's asshole in the ground."
