"They already do, it is just sneaky how it is done. They have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country. They do this by setting up particular legislation and shutting down public options (and anything else that might cut out administration and executive profits). They don't need to directly tax us in order to keep an unreasonable amount of money flowing to corporate executives and wealthy share holders. That is without even getting into pharmaceutics and prohibition legislation. One way they could easily keep money flowing to Hollywood, would be an additional tax refund that applies to ""legitimate"" entertainment costs. Or perhaps doing as Canada does and adding taxes to storage media. They can also continue to cut web freedom, options and bandwidth. Every bit of legislation I see come down the pipe (with only a couple of notable exceptions, such as dadt) has been about protecting profits for the top of the economic pile, at the expense of everyone else. EDIT: I would also like to mention that our taxes already fund healthcare, and in fact, we pay so much that we could have a universal system already just with the money we spend via taxes. It is so hyper-inflated because of the vast amount of profit built into the system at all levels. http://www.kff.org/insurance/snapshot/OECD042111.cfm http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1258 We have to cut out admin and profits to the hyper-wealthy if we wish to have a reasonable healthcare system. This chart in particular shows the problem. http://www.kff.org/insurance/snapshot/images/OECDChart3_1.gif This was just in 2008, costs have increased since then at the accelerated rate. So yes, the oligarchy has ways of making us pay without introducing specific new taxation."
