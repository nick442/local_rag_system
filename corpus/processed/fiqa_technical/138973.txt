I am in the same boat as this guy. Laugh all you want, but I am not racist either. I love what African-Americans have done for our country. Their culture has made a HUGE impact on our country. But to suggest there aren't MAJOR issues facing their community and to suggest America would be same if Anglo-Saxons had not been running the show for the last 200 years, is naive. While we try to figure out how to solve the problems that plague our African-American community, we need to be careful. Let's encourage the efforts of people who made our country great over the actions of people who make our country not so great
