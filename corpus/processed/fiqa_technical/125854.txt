There it is. The core difference between our perspectives. You believe there are innate human needs that can be known objectively, and I do not. I believe that human needs are inherently subjective, and their degree of satisfaction or lack of satisfaction is unknowable to anyone but that individual. Both language and observable behavior offer an incomplete picture of a person's internal state. I think philosophy calls this privileged access.
