As of April 2017, they had an estimated 80 million subscribers. At $99 a year that puts it at just under $8 billion. Now, there are different deals that will bring the cost down from $99 for college students.etc. you can also pay $10 a month, which would make it $120 a year. So it gets a little more complicated than the simple equation above, but on average I'm sure it's right around $8 billion, plus or minus a couple hundred millions of dollars.
