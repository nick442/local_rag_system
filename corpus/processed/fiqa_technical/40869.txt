"I haven't had cable in forever.. but I still like to watch comedies on NBC.com (Community!) which of course has commercials. They're a nuisance, but I guess it's the ""price"" I pay to have hilarious new content streamed to me for free on the internet every week. Honestly, I wish they would give me the option of ""watching"" one big 5 minute long commercial up-front and then stream the rest of the show commercial-free.. but unfortunately they don't."
