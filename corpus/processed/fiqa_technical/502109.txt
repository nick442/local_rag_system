Time & money. People have one or the other. Even with a Pell Grant to attend school, it can be very hard to get a job that will accommodate a class schedule and also pay enough for basic living expenses. And many people around here were not encouraged to pursue education, because of the expense. And because, until 10-15 years ago, there were always factories hired and it was expected to start at 18 and stay until retirement. I'm in my 30s and in school now, and it's taking me forever because I've had to change jobs, shuffle classes, and take time off in order to be able to pay bills and pursue my education. If you do too well at work, they don't want to give you the time off to move forward (problem I had at a law office where I was working way more hours than hired for, then told I couldn't cut back to our original agreement when the next semester required more seated classes). If you don't excel, it's not worth their trouble to accommodate you because there are plenty of others begging for a job that can work whenever they're told. And, in towns like this, I suspect part of it is a crabs in the bucket mentality. 40+ year old supervisors with GEDs sometimes don't like it when workers on the bottom rung are getting bachelor's degrees. The same in nursing - some of those LPNs & ADN/RNs get a little touchy when the newer younger ones immediately go to work on their RN. (And EMTs that try to jump straight to Paramedic, or those going for 4 year Paramedicine degrees, are met with outright scorn. Although there are some reasons for that, mainly lack of real world experience).
