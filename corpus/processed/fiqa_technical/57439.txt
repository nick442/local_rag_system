Uhhm you do realize that like 99% of all new consumer products are still developed and released to market by US companies. I mean two us companies drive like 99% of the mobile cellular market, google and apple. Google will be releasing driverless cars, tesla is redefining the car market, space X is redefining space travel the list goes on. The idea that the dollar is america's only edge is ridiculous at best.
