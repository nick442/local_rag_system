This is a good example of the hellish cycle of dictatorship and corruption. It happens time and time again: a dictator strangles the country and its institutions for years. He finally dies/gives up power and those in line behind him quickly start attacking the remnants of his family and regime. But are they doing it for the good of the country or for their own benefit, so that they can expunge the previous regime only to get their own iron grip on power? On the one hand, prosecuting a corrupt regime is necessary. On the other hand, it only brings up lasting positive results if it's because the free, independent institutions are actually acting in the public interest rather than to allow a new regime to establish total power. At the end of the day this shows one thing: people don't matter, what matters are processes, laws, and institutional independence. As long as the country's institutions are vulnerable, the people at the top will change but the way the country is run will not. Time will tell which one it is in Uzbekistan.
