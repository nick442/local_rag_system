I agree that if you have 4999 employees you're going to think long and hard about hiring employee number 5000, and probably hold off as long as you can but eventually if you need more employees you're going to do it. I also don't think a company with, say, 10,000 employees is going to suddenly fire half of them to get to under 5000. AKA: they still have an incentive to grow, you can still make more money by growing a slight increase in taxes doesn't change that
