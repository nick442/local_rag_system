I would not prepay a loan with a 3.79 rate, with just a tiny bit of inflation that's nearly free money. I would always seek to first max out a tax deferred savings program before making investments that are not receiving preferential tax treatment. (outside of emergency money, which you say is already dealt with) Especially since you effectively get an immediate return on the investment = to your marginal tax rate. (or to look at it another way, it takes a much smaller amount of money 'out of pocket' in order to make the investment) Every thousand you could put into a tax deferred account now, is generally equivalent to putting in several times that amount 20 years from now. OTOH Once you've maxed out the tax deferred savings, or if you need to set aside money for large purchase with a big time horizon that is short of retirement age, then making regular monthly investments in a no-load index fund with a quality company is a great way to go as you will be taking advantage of Dollar Cost Averaging, and a good deal of diversity, which is a great way to put money into the market. Just make sure you are investing in a fairly broad index, such as the S&P500 and not a little dinky 30 stock index like the Dow.
