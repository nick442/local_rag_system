"Well, he better get cashin', then. Because the bills are piling up. https://www.law360.com/articles/942251/floyd-mayweather-lacks-cash-for-taxes-until-after-fight > Boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. doesn’t have enough cash on hand to meet his 2015 tax liability, according to a Tax Court petition asking for a reprieve until after an upcoming fight because his current assets, while “substantial,” are “restricted and primarily illiquid.” So maybe the McGregor check went straight to Uncle Samuel? So the IRS cashed it, not Floyd? I humbly suggest the new nickname: Floyd ~~""Money""~~ ""Bank Drafts"" Mayweather."
