"We're not in Bubble #2, There is another land rush in the web due to how easy it is to get in and how everywhere else is terrible to work at this moment. Groupon is the big outlier b/c it's a sales company and not a tech company. Facebook (which I personally hate but am forced to use it) is worth what someone is willing to pay for it, all companies with stock are the same way. Will it have a market cap of $100B, you bet! There are a few once in a decade companies that will do something uniqure very very well. Think Google, Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Cisco. Facebook IMO is a walled garden, where your information is free to enter but forbidden to leave. Your data is their data, your web habits are known to them and are tracked by them. They know more about your like's dislikes, web habits than you yourself do. Damn! That's some powerful shit that people who want to peddle anything and everything to you will want. You are actively being tracked by each ""like"" button you come across on the web. Now for this whole Facebook IPO, Google has shown the power of the tech IPO post Bubble #1 in 2004. Well guess what Wall Street/Private Equity/Hedge Funds/Global Captial wants in! That's easy money to them, it doesn't want to be left out in another bubble, another hit, whatever you want to call it. That drives up the initial offering price, more media, more exposure, more demand, etc. So now Facebook has this hugely valuable database of individuals that it owns and doesn't share to anyone else and a huge demand for it."
