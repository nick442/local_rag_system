Ah, you're one of those people that want to pay to do literally everything in life. All regulations gone and safety be damned! Every road is a pay road, the fire department only comes when paid ahead of time, and police protection means hiring thugs as bodyguards. Basically you want Ancient Rome, pre Octavius.
