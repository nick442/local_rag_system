I don't see how it goes any other way. This is a company for which their entire value proposition is rooted in data security and integrity. That shown to be a farce, what's left? Also, there are direct competitors who weren't affected, which means they aren't uniquely positioned to rebound. It's not unlike Arthur Andersen. Once your name is tarnished in that kind of an industry, there's not really a road back.
