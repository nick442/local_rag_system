">histrionic Holy shit that is a great word. Nice one! >I never said ACA was perfect. The ACA is designed to fail within 10-15 years. It is, and was, completely insolvent from the beginning. For Progressive Democrats, the end game has always been a 'single payer' system that entirely neuters free choice for patients and practitioners. The fact that the ACA warranted a ""mandate"" of coverage by law and threat of penalty is a dead give away that they knew this all along and did it anyhow. >They've lied about it since .. when Reagan .. was telling everyone how communist Medicare was. Medicare is socialist/communist. Reagan was not wrong. Now that is not to say that ensuring citizens over 65 and ensuring a social safety net is not a good and righteous endeavor. The problem is that the system has been revised and co-opted to provide service to so many individuals that were never intended or designed for. At this point, the system is overburdened and ~~its~~ *the* expansion of Medicaid by Democrats in the ACA legislation was irresponsible and a detriment to the overall effectiveness of Medicare services for our vulnerable and elderly. >the GOP is absolutely far worse. That, my friend, is a matter of opinion that we will just have to disagree on. >I spend a lot of time in these nations we're told whose ""socialized"" medicine is failing the people. I have spent a lot of time in ""actual"" Socialist nations and I can assure you that the free market system that puts an emphasis on choice and freedom is a vastly superior option regardless of who or what you come from. >Loud or long posts don't make you right. Just makes you more wrong. Trying to cast disparity against an opposing viewpoint does not make you correct, it just makes you a condescending ass hole."
