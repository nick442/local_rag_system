But their strategy is not debt spending to increase demand. Every time we start getting anywhere near a balanced budget they cut taxes again so that they can continue blaming the deficit on pork barrel spending. Forcing ever more draconian budget cuts that will never ultimately balance the budget. It's called a [starve the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast) strategy. Deficit spending does drive demand short term. But as this debt rises so does the rent seeking cost of that debt. After some point this debt cost exceeds the benefits derived from the debt incurred in any given year. Just because you cab say the debt incurred this year exceeds the cost of the debt incurred this year does not mean that these benefits will remain positive overall as the debt remains on the books indefinitely, not just for the year they were incurred. This is not to claim that all debt is bad, but you can't make broad statements about the benefits of debt in general. Most such debt spending is a complete waste. Because your taxes are not defined by how much they take from your paycheck alone. When debt is used for consumption spending, rather than investment spending that increases productive capacity, this consumption leaves fewer goods and services remaining on the market for the rest of the consumers competing for it. Raising your cost of living. Your tax rate is not determined by how much money the government takes from you. It's determined by how much they spend. That is how much they are taking from the consumer market. Granted, given the [low wages relative to capital returns](http://www-tc.pbs.org/prod-media/newshour/photos/2012/12/06/Andrew_Smithers_chart_blog_main_horizontal.JPG), demand (consumption) is overly suppressed. Resulting in an [overproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overproduction) problems. Which makes debt spending look even more financially appealing, because it's not actually suppressing the already excessive demand constraints. But this is because you wages have been suppressed. So instead of paying taxes you are working for a lower income. In fact the loss of wages, relative to capital returns, i.e., your cost of living, actually well exceeds your tax cut. Your just paying those taxes through lower wages, or an increased cost of living, instead of taxes out of your paycheck. So your being conned out of that money while the people doing it are pretending to cut taxes. The same [applies to the rich (PDF)](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/jmp_simcha-barkai.pdf) in a different way. There is a limit to how rich you can get from a population of poor people. When you cut wages too far below productive capacity to save cost it dries up demand. People can't afford as much of your product as you can produce. So they cut jobs, i., production, to match market demand, which drives demand even lower. Pushing inflation and the velocity of money to historic lows in spite of an increased money supply. This also makes it unprofitable to invest in new productive capacity when market demand is already saturated. Wages, relative to capital returns, must increase to fix it. But if you take it too far it drives inflation to unacceptable levels. But, at the present ratio, we are a long ways from that.
