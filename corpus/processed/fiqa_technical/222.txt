"I read the post. I read what **they said** about it. Yet, that part makes **no sense**. They keep talking about ""only avilable to members of the Florida Bar"" but stop and think about how that doesn't make sense. Are they in a *florida* court or in a *federal* court? Or an IP/administrative setting? Some things they wrote suggests they're in a *federal* court. But others things suggest they're in an administrative court related to IP. For example, they talk about needing an attorney who can represent them in the Trademark/IP courts. That sounds like patent prosecution - but that's typically just about getting the patent/IP stuff in the first place - and not so much after-the-fact stuff. But then again, I'm not at all familiar with the area so I could be way off base. The problem is: I shouldn't have to be speculating so much because their story sucked. But patent litigation (for infringement for example) as far as I was aware, occurs in traditional district courts and so far as I am aware you don't need a special trademark/ip exam to sue on it. By contrast, patent *prosecution*, which is getting a patent through the offices, requires that the attorney take the USPTO exam - to become a 'patent' attorney. [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USPTO_registration_examination). Federal courts, if that's where they are, typically use PACER ECF/CM (case management web portal). Which, I'll have to assume is the system they are referring to. https://www.pacer.gov/psco/cgi-bin/regform.pl That's where anyone can fucking sign up for it. Then they can look at dockets and all that jazz. Maybe there's another system I'm not familiar with OR another system that I can't discern from the way they wrote the story. But so far. More BS or just confusing or wrong information. This is why they should have hired a lawyer."
