"I'd advise you to use a broker. Even a discount broker like Charles Schwab would do. First, they would do the ""trades"" purchase/sale, on your behalf, using parameters you specify (and also tell you where the ""market"" is at any given time). Second, they may sell you bills of a desirable term (e.g. six weeks) of out their own inventory. Third, they will lend you money (50% or more) against your holdings, so you'll have some money when you need it, and the balance when the bills mature."
