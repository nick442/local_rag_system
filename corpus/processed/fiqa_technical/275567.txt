Let's talk about the Constitution. The Constitution has two purposes: To list *a portion of* person's (*not just Americans, but all persons*) inalienable rights, and to list *the only things* that the government is *allowed* to do. So I have no fucking *clue* where you got the idea that states have *rights*. Only *persons* have rights. States are *allowed*, by persons, to do certain things, but *cannot* have *rights*. **Rights** are exclusive to **persons**.
