"Maybe, in that the government gets interest on the money it takes in, and has to pay interest on the money it spends or has agreed to spend (pensions, etc.). So depending on which interest rate is higher, the disadvantage shifts a little. It's also not a question of ""deeming"" things, but a tax credit would be more like taking a cut in pay rather than spending more money. Thinking of it as ""spending tax money"" should only be a way of helping to show that it makes this disadvantage."
