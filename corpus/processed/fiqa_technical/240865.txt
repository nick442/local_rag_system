">A lot of countries with harsher rules and higher taxes have lots of big companies that makes massive profits. Often with price protection mandates. Did you know in Germany the same Jeans they sell in Wal-mart for $18/pair sell for $80-100/pair? Do you know why? The government set's MSRP price controls and no one can sell below that amount. The same is true for all sorts of products. Do we really want to go down that path? >I have no sympathy for this man. Compete or die. That's a bit unfair when you don't know the intimate details of the accounting/liabilities any changes would cost. But surely we could use a few hundred more ""for lease"" warehouse space and a few thousand more empty storefronts, right? >Obama wont change much that he already hasn't. How much do you think it costs employers to keep 26 year old adult children on their parents healthcare + them living at home? That's ONE example. Obama is also looking at mandating higher employer medical insurance costs in general (employers having to pay a higher percentage of the costs). If somebody can avoid that by cutting payrolls or becoming ""more efficent"" with the number of employees they will do it. This is true for ANY company. >This is just a guy that in the past has bragged about his ability to affect the florida vote trying to affect it again. And? People brag all the time, about all sorts of things. Personally I think this is less ""slimey"" than Obama gloating about killing Osama Bin laden as if death is cheap because an individual is an outsider or another religion. >Slimy bastard. Again, you don't know all the details or the guy personally. But it's nice to know you're reserved and mature about somebody you don't even know. From your name should I assume you like Croc shoes? Which are lame and thus making you a loser? Superficial assumptions and judgements help nobody and in many cases are not even true."
