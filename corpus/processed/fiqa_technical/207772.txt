Here's something that's not in the article, there is approximately just as much wealth now as there was 10 years ago. The only thing there is less of is money, which is controlled by gov't/banking collusion. So when you see an article that blames unions for our troubles, but ignores the greater problem of said collusion, know that the author is either ignorant or trying to mislead you.
