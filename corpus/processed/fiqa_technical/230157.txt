I loved this podcast. You can tell, at least during the interview, she hadn't come to terms with it coming back to bite her. I was listening on a drive somewhere and I can just remember thinking, damn, she really got exactly what she needed. It was just so oddly satisfing. I also couldn't get past the fact she didn't see it coming. Anyway. I hope the linked podcast is the one I'm thinking about.
