Aristotle did recognize the problem of democracy if a society like ours is facing massive inequality. He thought that the majority (the poor) would vote in their own interest and take away from the minority (the rich). So he thought the solution is to decrease inequality and increase democracy. Notice Madison recognized the same problem in formulating the American system but he came to the opposite conclusion. He thought democracy should be reduced and power be left in the hands of the more capable set of men, the wealthy elite. Now the society you are describing would probably be self destructive. If people went around having a mob mentality as you describe, lynching, looting and committing violence, this would be more like a death cult. At some point you have to recognize that common people are usually the target of oppression not the cause of it. Ironically all the examples you mentioned were imposed by the powerful few on the commoners not the other way around.
