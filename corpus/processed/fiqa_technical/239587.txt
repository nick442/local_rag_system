The apartment I rented in San Jose had a severe mold problem. It triggered an asthma allergic reaction I'd never had before. They jacked my rent 15% so I shacked up with sweetie, whose rent was also jacked up contemporaneously. Anyway, I moved out and haven't had an asthma attack since. I was paying $1500 for a one bedroom (what a steal now!) that gave me asthma. I think people can now rent that disease-hole for around $2300.
