"I often find the one-star reviews on yelp help me determine whether or not I want to try the place more than the other reviews. If the complaint is something completely unreasonable (e.g. long wait for brunch on Mother's Day), or an idiot who doesn't understand how that food is cooked or wine is served, then I completely discount the negatives. The positive reviews are tough to judge by unless they are there en-masse. I find hole-in-the-wall places to be nearly impossible to judge on Yelp, because there seems to be a hipster vibe of ""I like this place because nobody knows about it."" That said, if you take your time and read all reviews, you can get a pretty good sense of the place (at least in my experience)."
