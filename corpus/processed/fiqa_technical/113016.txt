"Clearly this is going nowhere. Your calloused view of the world is not going to change. I hope that you never have to face adversity in your life. I truly do. But if you ever do, I hope that you meet nothing but people with the same attitude as yours towards those lower on the scale, so you can see how wrong your view of the world is. I hope they tell you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, I hope they tell you to just simply get a better job, I hope they tell you to take responsibility for your own life, I hope they ask if you think that rich people should just give you their money, I hope they tell you that your problems all come from you blaming others. Maybe then you'll understand ""what I'm even arguing""."
