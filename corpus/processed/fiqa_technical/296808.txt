"> Oh, I've gotten the ""massive upside"" in writing - you get 10,000 shares of this thing! Don't ask for 10,000 shares. Ask for $10,000. Or $100,000. Or whatever you think is a fair payment for the time you invest. You could even pull a cash figure from the income projection in the business plan you asked to see. You did ask for that, right? As well as the resumes from the founders and the name of the VC company so that you can check them out? > The fact that it's a pretty sophisticated game is not always obvious, It isn't sophisticated at all. It's very, very simple. IF you're asked to work below your market rate, you're an **investor**. You're investing time, and you need to see it paid back in the form of money. You need to be sure to get a contract that covers your investment, so that even if the company tanks you can still get paid. Or at the very least, you can sue the VC company for your back pay. If you're new to it, you need to ask for advice from someone who isn't. This isn't rocket science, guys."
