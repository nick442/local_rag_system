Not only recycling, but in a lot of places burning trash is the main way of disposing of it. Or just throwing it on the ground and letting it pile up because disposal services are insufficient or nonexistent. Then when it comes to oil there are those regions, but let's not forget the entire global shipping industry (and really all commercial marine industry) is dependent on diesel and oil and to a lesser extent very recently Liquid Natural Gas. And even a small ship uses the same amount of fuel as many, many cars.
