This statement is somewhat hyperbolic but that's what kind of scares me about facebook. This all seems pretty true. Zuckerberg has always held a cavalier attitude toward user privacy from before facebook expanded out of Harvard. Their plan when it comes to privacy matters is to shoot first and ask questions later. Implement something new that pushes the privacy envelope and see if it is challenged. It is a risk business strategy and I hope that one day they reevaluate it.
