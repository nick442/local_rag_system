I'm being realistic. They're dumping tens of millions of dollars into an operation that shows no real signs of earning any kind of profit in anything that approaches the short or medium term. They're making expensive cars at Ferrari volumes for BMW prices in limited markets while the major automakers introduce more and more electric and hybrid cars. Once Mercedes and Ford and Honda have full electric cars on the road, serviced and backed by their huge network of dealerships, what does Tesla offer anyone? Toyota is happy, they pumped a relatively small amount of money into Tesla and have all but locked up rights to their IP should the company go bust. Tesla is trying to capitalize on being first to market, but they're in a kind of catch 22: there isn't huge demand for electric cars right now, which means they won't be able to sell the volumes they need to grow their business and return a profit. As soon as the market is large enough for them to make a profit, the big guys are going to catch up and run them over. Who'd buy a Model S when they could get an electric 5 series for the same money? Who'd buy a Tesla Roadster if they could get an electric Boxster or 911?
