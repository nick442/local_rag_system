">So why not talk to your employer, and ask them to pay you in gold dust? Then when tax time comes, just convert some gold dust into the amount of USD in taxes you owe. Because selling gold and buying dollars has an effect on the market: it reduces the value of gold, and increases the value of dollars. Understand? So being forced to use dollars *artificially increases the value of dollars*. The reason we are forced to use Dollars is because the central bank has the monopoly on printing dollars. Without legal tender laws, that monopoly would be worthless. >Of course, you'd have to find farmers and shoemakers and electronic stores willing to accept payment in gold dust as well.. As the value of gold increases over time, the government taxes the increased value as ""capital gains tax"". So gold cannot be money under these circumstances - the government considers it an investment now."
