This is becoming a reality as Saudi Arabia moves closer to Russia. It will be interesting to see what happens once the Saudis start to divest in the US Dollar, from what I hear, they hold shit loads in the back ground. I don't think the world is falling for the Fed Unwind, usually the Fed buys up the US Treasuries to keep the yields low, who is going to buy the Feds shit to keep up demand?
