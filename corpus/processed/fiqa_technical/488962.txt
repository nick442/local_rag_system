I tried to get an iced coffee at BK. They were not capable of making one. Their pre-made iced coffee was sweet. I settled for hot coffee. - your customers are heavy fast food users who like sugar - your employees are not empowered to add ice to coffee to create iced coffee. - I gave you a chance BK! You blew it!
