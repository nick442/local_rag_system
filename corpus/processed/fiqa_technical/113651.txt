You should pay things off every month. You don't want to be paying 10%-25% interest if you don't have to. If you regularly use you card, the credit agencies can't tell the difference. The way it works is that every month, they send the credit agencies your current balance and if you paid the last bill on time. There is nothing that indicates if this is a standing balance, or if you charged all of it since the last payment. Any business that you legitimately owe a debt to can report that to the credit agencies. Not all of them do. This includes utilities, cell phone companies, landlords, etc. If any of them report overdue items it will show up on your credit report, and your credit card company can use that to raise you interest rate. Some cards will automatically raise you credit limit. They are basically looking to make money fro you. If you often charge near the limit, and pay the minimum balance each month, they may raise your limit to get you to charge more, and pay more interest. You can also call them and ask. They have some internal rules to decide if, based on your history with them and your credit history, if you are a good risk.
