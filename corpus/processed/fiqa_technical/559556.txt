"It's called disposable income for a reason. It's what's left after obligations, whatever bills you have, and saving. Saving half one's income is pretty much at one end of the spectrum, very few can afford this. The combination of high savings and low actual spending will enable you to retire very early if you wish. Saving 'only' 15% might actually be out of your comfort zone, maybe 25% will keep you happy. What remains is yours to spend on what you wish, whatever makes you happy. There was a time I joked ""I spent most of my money on women and beer. The rest, I wasted."" Now, I don't mind travel, but it's not my passion. If traveling the world is yours, do it. Enjoy every minute of it."
