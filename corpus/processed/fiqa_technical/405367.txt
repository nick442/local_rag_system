I'll go a step further: I think he did it not only out of investing acumen, but literally because he believed it was the right thing to do for his country. He understood how much misery could come from the collapse of such a creditor, and the risk he took was offset somewhat by the knowledge that his actions were, at worst, delaying the implosion of the US banking system, and at best preventing it. It bled furiously for a few months, and the healing took several years, but his efforts quite literally single-handedly reduced the pain and duration of the Great Recession. It could have ended like the Great Depression, with over a decade of rebuilding, endless soup lines, and taken a greater toll than it did (which was heavy enough).
