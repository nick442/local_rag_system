Yea, typically if you sign up for a payment plan you have to pay something extra, whether it be interest, a start up fee, or both. I signed up for a payment plan last year and had to pay 75 dollars as a start up fee. OP if you can pay it up front and it won't hurt you in the short run I'd definitely go for the full payment option
