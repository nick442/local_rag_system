"You're absolutely right. I'm not commenting on the fact that retail stores still do massively more business than Online, nor the that they have a significant advantage when the balance begins to shift. My only comment is that their data doesn't support their conclusion. They concluded that 90% of business is done in retail stores. No, 90% of business *involves a retail component*, including the somewhat dubious ""Returns""- which is not part of the sales process and would understandably want to happen in a retail setting."
