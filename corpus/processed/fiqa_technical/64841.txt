Nope you talk about oligarchy, not socialism. Socialism is the opposite of this. I'm not saying that socialism is a feasible idea that would make the world better, but it's wrong to give something the wrong name just to dissociate it from capitalism edit: Socialists dislike crony capitalism because in their opinion it's the result of any capitalist system, in order to sustain the system (and screw over the middle class). Capitalists dislike it because it goes against free market.
