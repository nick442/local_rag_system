I agree, the crux of the problem is not Wal-mart or companies like them, but the unethicalness of the laws they follow, and, those laws most likely were put in place by politicians who were put into office by large rich corporations, like Wal-mart, who funded these politicians campaigns to get them elected, so they could pass these laws. Ain't America great? Now we have Super-PACs. Wheeee!
