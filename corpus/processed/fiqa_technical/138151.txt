If I'm not mistaken, using dairy cattle to buy more dairy cattle is already common practice in Kansas. Why it is not widespread is more because the banks concerned don't have the necessary expertise to value / monitor / resell these assets when necessary. They are tricky to deal with because they grow / breed / die, unlike your house.
