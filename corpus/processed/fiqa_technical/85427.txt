"It costs money for a mutual fund to accept your money. It doesn't cost as much as it used to, but historically there has been, at a minimum, a modicum of record-keeping associated with it. As such, they will typically have a minimum amount of money they want you to add at a time. They don't want to process 100 transfers of a nickel each; that would be silly. So if you have a mutual fund with a ""minimum initial investment"" of $10,000 and a ""minimum subsequent investment"" of $100, then that means that you can put in $10k to open it, and then deposit dollars in lots of 100 or more whenever you feel like it."
