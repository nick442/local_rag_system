I'm sure what you are saying may be true in some cases but there is no proof that the developers of the game mentioned in this article did that. I have played video games in the past (Zelda, Resident Evil, Silent Hill) and they all took quite a bit of time to get through. I dont think there would have been anything insidious about having the option to pay a couple dollars extra to get through the game quicker. In fact, I know of people who in the past have PAID third parties for cheat codes in order to get through the game a little quicker (this was well before we all took to the internet en masse). It seems fair to have that option still and to pay the game developer for it.
