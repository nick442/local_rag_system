"I don't think even an outlet format would be sustainable in the long run. Literally all the major brands and products they carry are already offered by more reputable retailers (Best Buy, BB&Beyond, Home Depot, etc..) The only way I could see it working out is if they offered in-house, low-quality alternatives. A ""Harbor Freight"" of everything except hardware."
