I'm not pro-union not because of a conservative talking point, but because I think workers should have the choice as to whether they want to join or not. Most unions are compulsory, not voluntary. When I worked for Kroger as a summer job, I was forced to join the UFCW (United Food and Commercial Workers). A part of my meager hourly wage was required to be given to them, yet I did not want to be a member because I would never receive the benefits. You had to be working for 6 months to be accepted into the union, yet you were forced to pay dues the first minute you began working.
