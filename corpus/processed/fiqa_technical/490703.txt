> You're right about the accuracy of axioms being important though. If you can disprove an axiom you can disprove the theory, that's why the fewer axioms taken, and the simpler those axioms are, the stronger the resultant argument becomes. That is true philosophical argument and is however quite a bit removed from the original point of this discussion. Your point, which I rebutted several times over the course of this thread - is that lowering taxes will lead to increased growth, compensating for the revenue deficit. You are basing this on the Laffer curve - which states that there is a particular taxation point where the total collected taxes are maximized. The curve itself seems fairly common sense at a first glance, but are we to the right of the curve? Several papers have argued that we are on the left^[1](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261018),[2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105353579690013X),[3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304393295012249). Additionally, the curve itself is doubtful - as it has not been observed in a real world setting. Austerity measures almost wrecked European economies in the early part of this decade, while the Kansas experiment was a utter bust. > We can make certain simple assumptions about human nature, such as that all else being equal, people will chose to take actions that aligns with their wants/needs over ones that do not. And this is an incomplete statement. People will take actions in a boundary of possibility. That boundary is much higher for somebody whose wealth puts them at 99.9% of the scale rather than being at 20%. And taking the point further, the wants/needs are also very different for somebody at different social stratums. Given that, there is no evidence (and rather there is a wealth of contradictory evidence) that giving a tax cut to the highest income earners would boost the economy. Your assumptions and axioms are wrong, and a simple introductory economics course ([MITX](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-02-principles-of-macroeconomics-spring-2014/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-economics-macroeconomics-snux-snu044-088-2x)) will solve your misconceptions. Beyond mathematical mastery, the true mark of a rational, scientific person is a willingness to accept mistakes and be humble about it. I see neither in you. On the contrary when presented with evidence, you raise straw man arguments (eg: the validity of epistemological vs empirical observations), obfuscate facts and changing of goalposts. When presented with economic reason, I see pride in not knowing modern economic advancements. You see that as a mark of intelligence, but that is idiocy that belongs on /r/iamverysmart
