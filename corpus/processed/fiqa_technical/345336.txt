We've tried to establish Atlantic Salmon in Pacific waters as late as 1981 (wild stock, not farmed). There were 3 escapes in the late 90's (totalling over half a million fish) with no 'wild' adults found (some juveniles were found in the rivers, but none are known to have returned). Scientists have tried to hybridize Atlantic and Pacific Salmon. While successful, the offspring were sterile and the process was difficult and unlikely to occur in nature. So, while they might, their kids won't (or haven't in previous episodes).
