Bezos describes the Prime business model as a 'flywheel' in which the ecosystem of services sucks in more customers providing economies of scale to suck in more customers still and speed it up. Google it for his more detailed quotes. When the acquisition was announced, I wondered how it would work out for Amazon unless it went all out on integrating Whole Foods into part of the Amazon Prime experience, rather than leaving it alone. Looks like it is. No wonder the other stocks are terrified.
