In THEORY, you don't have to pay income tax in such a situation. In actual fact, the transaction looks suspicious because the money went into your account. Presumably, the money should have gone OUT of your account in equal amount. Having allowed all this to happen, what you need to do is to DOCUMENT this activity ASAP. The first thing to do is to retain the paperwork showing the sending of the funds to the third party. The second thing to do is to ask your friend for a letter dated TODAY (don't use an earlier date) as to why the money was delivered into your account, and corroborating the fact that it was sent to the third party. Then if the IRS comes calling, you will have documentation to prove your point and protect yourself.
