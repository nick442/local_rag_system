"> I'm a basically daily user of some of the things I mentioned and I have a job, why does it matter what I do on my time off? I've had issues with depression and do see a psychologist, and the aggressive way you position your argument isn't appreciated. Many of these people get high before work as well and go in high. I want a happy employee that is ready to work and isn't impaired. > Correct me if I'm wrong, but in your mind a weed smoker = jobless person with 0 motivation, which just isn't true. While there are people who fit that bill and perpetuate the stereotype, it isn't everyone. I know plenty have jobs, but many daily users aren't at their full potential and don't have as much motivation. Which definitely holds them back. As far as insurance, I know you didn't want to get into it, but I was talking about liability insurance if there is an injury at work, not medical insurance. While you can say it doesn't cause accidents, I've heard from a few people that ""I smoked too much"" or ""I ate too much of an edible and I couldn't move or passed out"" So it does cause serious impairments and can cause accidents in less amounts (lesser than the amount that knocks you out)"
