That's a serious threat, a lot of people keep saying this but the Chinese are really the ones who need us. Their economy is a house of cards, based on an ever worse and more corrupt version of the Japanese 70-80s model, and their trade is the only thing injecting enough money into the system to barely pay for the government to prop up all of its important industries. Unfortunately their trade demands the US Dollar/debt to manipulate their currency to stay cheap. To lose access to US finances is more or less an existential threat to China. On the other hand the US really could find replacements or live without whatever we lose from Chinese trade. For this specific nunber, I don't know how he came to it, but Peter Zeihan says the US' GDP from trade is only about 14%, and only about 4% when you discount NAFTA and energy imports.
