http://www.bills.com/private-student-loan-settlement/ Here is a page that seems to have specific advice on the matter. This site speculates that even though the private loan industry does not have to settle (and the private student loans, like federal loans cannot be discharged with a bankruptcy) they sometimes will anyway. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/private-student-loans-bankruptcy-law_n_1753462.html .. If she could file bankruptcy to erase the private student loan debt she owes to Sallie Mae, she would. But because of a 2005 reform law, private student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, except in extremely rare cases. .. The advice that works for you is the same advice with negotiating any debt. Get it in writing that the amount will constitute payment in full. Be sure that the written agreement makes some mention of how they will report it on your credit. (You are going to take a credit hit if you settle, but time will heal that.) The best plan is to pay, but if you can't, and you can honestly prove you can't, the debt collection company would be foolish to not take a settlement. They can wait around forever and sue you, add penalties and fees, but if you cannot pay, you cannot pay. I am going to guess because you are dealing with a debt collector, they are less vested in collecting the full amount. So get that settlement offer in writing. And don't be too much of a hard core negotiator. The power is all on their side. You will likely have to appeal to the greed of the collection company to succeed. Hope they would rather have $.50 today than $1.25 tomorrow.
