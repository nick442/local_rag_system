Any portfolio, even one composed of risk-free assets is subject to risk. That said, to short an equity without margin risk, puts can provide. To replicate a short without excess margin, an at the money put should be used. To take on less leverage, a deep in the money put can be used. Puts are not available on equities deemed illiquid by regulation. A long/short portfolio can help mitigate variance risk, but then the problem becomes the risk of a lack of volatility since options decline in value over time and without a beneficial change in the underlying.
