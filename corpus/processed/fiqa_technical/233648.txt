"That local batch of strawberries wasn't created in a lab. [The seafood standards](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/sustainable-seafood) WF maintains were not designed to ""fleece"" me, as much as you want to believe that. I'm willing to pay a bit more for food I can trace back to its origins, and I'm GLAD someone has figured out how to get me food that is as close to unprocessed and unpolluted as possible. I also shop the sales -- it's entirely possible to shop healthy, local and cheap at Whole Foods -- and the foods I buy are actually more affordable at WF than they would be at a different chain. [But let's talk ""lab created,"" shall we?](https://www.google.com/search?q=Food+manufacturing+and+mouthfeel&oq=Food+manufacturing+and+mouthfeel&aqs=chrome.69i57.11916j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) Do you know that the poultry you buy at traditional grocery stores has been injected with salt+sugar water to plump it up so that you pay more for it? Ever notice how a ""croissant"" from an Albertson's ""bakery"" counter disintegrates in your mouth before you can chew it up? Do the foods from the salad bar have that metallic sulfite flavor? You know that Snickers bars were literally designed so that you swallow the bite in your mouth before fully experiencing/chewing it, right? [The idea is that](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?mcubz=0) you swallow sooner, emptying your mouth faster -- the exact opposite of ""satisfying,"" so that you'll eat and finish it faster. The design causes you to start swallowing and it ""pulls"" the rest of the food down your throat. I'd much rather someone figure out in a (marketing) lab that I want to know the source of a green pepper or the origin of a 6oz freshly cut pork chop -- vs [figure out in a lab how to trick me](https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/2016/09/14/sugar-shocked-the-rest-of-food-industry-pays-for-lots-of-research-too/) into thinking I'm eating 6oz pork chop when I'm eating 4.5oz of bleached, injected meat from a factory farm. WF is entirely justified in charging me a little bit more because it actually is selling me better food. THAT is the benefit. No one is making you shop there. Spend your money on cheap food so you can buy more games or live in a bigger house. I'm not shitting on you for that, and I'm tired of people's mis-informed prejudice against WF. Edit: added links"
