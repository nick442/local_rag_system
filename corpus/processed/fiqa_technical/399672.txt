"This one struck a nerve I see. I also certainly understand your side- it's not ""right"" for the consumer to do it, in a strictly moral sense of the word. However, they're operating in a marketplace where Target will use any and all tricks in the book to increase revenue, including tax dodging/sheltering, lobbying against their citizens' interest, using non-union shops (see the Canadians' discussion below), etc. That is, Target is doing everything it can to gain the upper hand against consumers/employees/labor, etc, in the old ""labor vs capital"" battle. To ask individuals to adhere to a stricter set of marketplace rules is to put ""us"" (or any individual) at a disadvantage in said marketplace. Consumers need to be able to be just as ruthless in the marketplace as corporations. In this case, Target screwed up and thus pays for it. If Target found a perfectly legal loophole, it's guaranteed they would drive the whole ship through it. I mean, there's a reason corporate taxes rates are abysmally low. The argument I would accept is this: One could argue that the consumers, by using the gift card deal in a way that deliberately violates the terms of the contract of said card, are committing fraud. That's fine- I have no problem with saying it's wrong on that technicality. However, economics has been called the ""dismal science"" for a reason- there's no morality in a marketplace."
