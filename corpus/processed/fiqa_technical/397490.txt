> Pensions should be held in an arms length trust independent trust and the company should have no access to it. This is, at least theoretically, the situation in the United States. There are plenty of restrictions as how trust assets are protected from the company itself. > All workers should be paid before executives or creditors see dime one. All employees in the United States, that have benefits on an underfunded pension plan are protected by the PBGC. It is 'pension insurance', and will make up the difference in any participant's pension. It doesn't provide preferential payments to 'executives last', but it does cap payments at a certain amount - it's about $60k/year in 2017. > This is why unions need to get their shit together and break these laws for the rich, by the rich. Unions take money away from workers, too, in the form of dues. They also have the capability of running companies into the ground. GM and Hostess are two examples that got plenty of press. Unions are important, don't get me wrong. But there is no 'rich' here to rob. This company has been going downhill for 30 years, and they are downright terrible. > When one of these execs walks away with millions of worker's earnings in their pockets US perspective: If this happens, it's because they deferred their own salary. They took a pay cut, basically lending their money to the company. These plans aren't protected under bankruptcy, so if the company fails, they lose the vast majority of their pension. There is no protest needed. The laws are just fine in this particular case. > If you let them steal your lunch money without a black eye you'll starve. There really isn't any lunch money stolen here. Just a terrible company with short-sighted management, who missed the boat on technological improvements 25 years ago.
