That totally depends on if its domestic or international. The difference between domestic first and coach is not as drastic as the difference between first/business and coach on international. On a two hour flight, I don't see any added advantage to business/first over coach. On a 6+ hour flight, I do. On a cost basis, it would have to come down to how important that person's decisions are on a capital return basis.
