There was a comic (which I thought might have been on the oatmeal, I can't find it, found it originally on reddit though) where they show a guy who's great in his department and is promoted, great again, promoted, repeat until he's not great.. but then they can't demote him, because his old spot's filled, so he's stuck there where he sucks. edit: apparently [tuna-fish2](http://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/nfc8k/famous_last_words_by_bosses_ive_had/c38pfza) says it's the Peter Principle
