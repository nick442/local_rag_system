>> *counterpoints > Not worth my time. Because with all time in the world, you have no counter points. As for undergrad degree, and even a master's degree, who said they determine competency? They only indicate interests. Only in real work, after your training, in few months, it's easy to tell if you have any skills or talents. And if you don't, your degrees will not help you. Any questions?
