I'm currently in process. I work full time for one big local company and side Hustle in my free time. U must have some income, so I belive this is good path. In future, when I could live from my own company I will quit my current job. But that means that you should work at least 14-16 h/day. It is hard but it will be worth one day. Make some product, find clients etc. Start small, find some co-founder(s) and just start.
