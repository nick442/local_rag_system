If the biggest flaw in the review is that one of the characters is probably made up and the book should therefore be considered fiction instead of nonfiction, then this is an incomplete review. The author points out many good items about the book and the only negative he states is the nonexistence of a character, and then he states that the book has flaws (implying multiple, not single).
