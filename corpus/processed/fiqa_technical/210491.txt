Based on my experience with student tuition documents, it sounds like there is money due to you from the school. From your description, I would guess that your statement looks something like this: Credits: Debits: Registration === 3,400 Lab/Classroom Fees === 600 Balance: === -6,000 If that's the case, remember that this document is from the school's accounting system and so it is registering a negative from the perspective of the school's finances.
