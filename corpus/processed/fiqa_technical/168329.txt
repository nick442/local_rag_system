Westgate properties are also hotels, so you may have. I have been reading through pages of these complaints all day. It's amazing that people will sign these contracts without reading them first, instead believing what they are told by a high-pressure salesman. Seems like you would do a little research before spending tens of thousands of dollars. But that in no way excuses the tactics of Westgate. It's amazing that they have been operating like this for so long.
