"> “Americans are temporarily embarrassed millionaires in waiting.” This shit ! As Romney said: its not about the 1% versus the 99%, it is the 57% of makers (himself alongside struggling middle class) against the 43% takers (those who are the real threat to middle class). It's not anymore about ""stability"" or ""job security"", but ""making it big"". There is an over-glorification and even idealization of multi-millionaires which is unhealthy, leads to their further exploitation, and inequalities."
