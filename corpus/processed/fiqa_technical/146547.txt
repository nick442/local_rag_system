I think rather than take a percentage out, I focus on getting a total amount I consider appropriate for my emergency fund. Then as for retirement, I do at least what my employer matches, up to the contribution limit. For example my personal retirement plan in the US has an annual max contribution of $5000. Once I have my 6 to 12 month emergency fund (in a pretty liquid form) and a fully funded retirement, I want to concentrate on building wealth via investments or increasing the quality of my life by spending. Summary answer is: no percentage for emergency, just get to a total amount you feel comfortable. Then whatever percentage will allow you to make the most of employer matching and make your retirement fully funded.
