Building tanks and helicopters is the use of the countries economic resources for goods that provide no net benefit to the economy beyond their construction price. If, for example, the government wanted to stimulate the economy by spending $1 trillion on something, sure, the country's GDP would by definition increase by $1 trillion, and there'd probably be some multiplier effect by those workers now having additional money to spend on other goods. There's also going to be some negative effects on other sectors of the economy because the prices for labor and raw materials will go up because of the increased demand from the government. If the government is buying $100 billion in steel and aluminum, you can bet that the spot prices of steel and aluminum is going to jump up, squeezing any private industries that need to buy those resources. Now the question is what do you spend that $1 trillion on to get the biggest bang for your buck. Military hardware accomplishes the goal of having something disposable to buy with $1 trillion, but little additional benefit to the private economy. If you instead spent $1 trillion on building infrastructure (bridges/roads/dams/pipelines/flood control), scientific research, or education, you've now generated goods that have their own intrinsic value to society beyond their cost - whether it be less traffic, new scientific discoveries, or a more educated workforce.
