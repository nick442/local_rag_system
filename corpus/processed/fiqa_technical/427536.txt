I read this story last night and it made me laugh. I don't drink their beer. The best beer is locally produced by small private breweries who have no intention of going public. They aren't going anywhere. In fact, they are growing bigger. A lot of people love bland beer. If you like flavor, turn to a local brewpub! Given the choice of Budweiser and American made Spaten, I choose red wine! I would rather drink a bad red wine then a bad beer.
