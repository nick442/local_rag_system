"> I spent 2+ years building a business that now brings me ""passive income"" There is a distinction between putting a lot of hours into building a semi autonomous business and having your Accountant and Tax Lawyer find legal loopholes so you can avoid millions of dollars of debt again and again. I'm not sure where you disagree with me. Do you not believe it is preferable that people earn a living by providing a product or service of value, rather than manipulating financial tools and laws? What would become of an economy if 50% of a population decided they didn't like working and so took up speculating stock prices full time? Yes, it is ""smart"" to abuse every existing loophole, but it is not ethical and it is certainly not sustainable without being to the detriment of others. I prefer a system where people have integrity and where manipulating others is looked down upon, rather than admired."
