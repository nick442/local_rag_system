Good thoughts. Automation is killing some jobs traditionally done by humans. And humans will compete with machines unless they can't be more affordable than machines (e.g., some McDonalds's have screens vs people for ordering). That's a prob with increasing wages vs cheapening tech. The reality, as you said is that some of these jobs WILL be won out by automation, regardless. But someone has to service/develop/etc all that automation, so I think jobs will be created in that industry for sure.
