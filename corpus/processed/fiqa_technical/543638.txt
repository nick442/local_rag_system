I'm a two time Dungeons and Dragons World Champion - or whatever. There are as many ways to answer your question as there are ways to be competitive. But that's not the point. I think you're doing yourself a disservice by employing a pop-psychology approach that has very little value in evaluating potential candidates. You'll succeed in picking out who shares your interest in sports, but little else. Even the famous [Meyers-Briggs Test](Meyershttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator#Reliability) has been generally dismissed as unreliable. Seeking information in a roundabout way is like shooting an arrow into the air and hoping to hit the bullseye. Just aim directly for the target and you'll get better results. If you want to know if someone is competitive, ask them if they're competitive. - explain why a competitive nature is important. Complete transparency and honesty is always the best approach. Any trained psychologist will tell you (and I know several) that your method is not only ineffective, but recklessly assumptive.
