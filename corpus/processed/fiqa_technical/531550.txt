I don't have a problem linking my games to my Facebook account but I detest all the permissions they want. Now the game wants to make Facebook posts on my behalf? Send messages to my friends? Now it wants to send me e-mails too? Perhaps next you'd like to call me on the phone and nag me to play your game again!?! Let's not forget that you don't have an option to decline ANY of these permissions either. You must accept them or you are not allowed to play the game anymore. Goodbye mildly entertaining Draw Something.
