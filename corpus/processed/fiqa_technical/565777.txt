You buy a share of something for $100. It goes up by 10% over a year, and you now have $110 in value. It goes up by 10% next year and you now have $121. That original $10 increase was compounded even though you're not earning interest because the gains are measured as a percentage. If, instead, you'd only invested the second year you'd have less value. Assuming the markets average a positive gain (above inflation) you see greater gains the earlier you're invested.
