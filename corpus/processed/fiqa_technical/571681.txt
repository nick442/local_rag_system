You create products and services that aren't tied to your personal hours worked. They generate income, like a golden egg. They need various amounts of care, but in general, they have a positive return on time spent on it. The returns can be 1000x even, like the one man who created flappy bird. Luck helps too, in those cases :) The author of that article, on the other hand, is selling his time, not a product. That doesn't scale well, especially if you're one human.
