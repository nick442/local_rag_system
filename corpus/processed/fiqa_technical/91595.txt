"The price movements of Bitcoin are actually cogent in at least one sense: Why in the world would somebody use bitcoin right now to buy anything? That $100 item you bought today represents (to most) a huge opportunity cost as far as ""missed returns in the future"" go. It's basically a dollar-deflationary cycle, which we know to be corrosive to an economy: You don't buy today what you expect to be cheaper tomorrow. That's highly problematic for bitcoin as far as business adoption is concerned."
