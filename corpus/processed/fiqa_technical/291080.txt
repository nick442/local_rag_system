Your best bet is to pay for title insurance. If you do the same search as the title company, you'll probably find (and miss) the same things they would. By letting a title company do the search and paying for their title insurance, you're covered in case something else surfaces. In a case like this you should be getting a good enough discount, don't take the risk of doing the search yourself.
