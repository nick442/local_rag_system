Keep your account with Navy Federal, once you get an account at a good credit union keep it. Look for a credit union the students can join, it may be based in the town where the campus is, or one related to the school. Look for a free ATM on campus. Many times it is near the food court or student union or bookstore. If there is none ask the university to get one. If you don't find a local credit union you should be able to deposit the checks via scanner or phone to navy federal.
