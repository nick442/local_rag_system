Is this practice of support for women on maternity leave across the board for all Yahoo employes or just those who are CEOs? The rules maybe in the employee manual but is this cultural accepted at Yahoo in general? Because CEOâ€™s are treated quite differently than the rest of the employees and is Marissa Mayer being treated differently because of her celebrity status?
