Pennsylvania allowing gambling now also put a decent dent in the business. Not necessarily the overnight resort stay but the people who used to do day trips frequently are now going to Parx, Valley Forge or Sugar House. Revel in particular would not allow bus trips to drop off there, which for a long time was a staple in AC's economy. That has declined due to what I mentioned above, but to flat out not allow hundreds of old people coming on a bus from the city and suburbs helped to their decline.
