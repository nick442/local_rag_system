"Sorry buddy, you don't get to say you're wrong when your models are consistently proven inaccurate. It is demonstrative of a fundamental flaw in methodology. If you want to throw around statistical anylaysis it behooves you to verify and critique those models. >hey, look at all these facts, well researched figures, and data that gets someone to this conclusion I didn't say that. I said oh hey look someone trying to stand on Nate Silver's shoulders, as if his methodologies and analysys weren't the laughing stock of the previous election. The other ""statistics"" was one poorly done histogram from a loosely related study offered as evidence to support an opinion piece. That's what you don't get. You're bought into a world with a substantial cognitive dissonance and then you try to swing science around as if it supports your beliefs when it doesn't. >From your understanding of the processes, to random sampling, to what stastical models represent, to facts in and of themselves. Explain to me how the methodology for an exit poll is substantially different from the methodology for a prediction poll, other than the obvious ""everyone is a likely voter."" That being said I think the numbers are representative of the voting trends ( the silver one, the other one is to small) from the exit polls because they don't get to play with the voter model, my critique is against the logical leap that one must be unintelligent or uninformed to have voted for Trump. There is no evidence for that. Only your ad hominem attacks. The arguement is that those willing to manipulate their models to make a conclusion evident shouldn't be trusted to make reaching conclusions about the state of the electorate when they hold obvious bias."
