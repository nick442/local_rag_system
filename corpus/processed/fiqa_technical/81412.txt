"Jesus Christ dude, your entire comment. Let's start with the blatently and simply wrong. >Even Wal-Mart can't come close to matching it. Walmart operates on a ""just in time"" basis that they operate themselves, with as many walmarts that exist around the country, you can go witness this by yourself, every day of the week 364 days a year. >Whole Foods, on the other hand, is a mess. That's why they were struggling to compete against other big supermarket chains who started offering organic foods too. WF can't compete because their entire business model is unsustainable, it has nothing to do with logistics and everything to do with how the grocery business works. You can't lower prices when you're covering up for high losses on other parts of the store, that is why they're expensive. The only thing Amazon can bring to the equation is a system in which WF suddenly can operate at a loss and Amazon share holders simply don't care, like they haven't cared for the last 20 years amazon has made ""no money""."
