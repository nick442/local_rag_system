Looks like it stands for Accident and Emergency. Yes, that is a grey aeea, similar to mental illness, disability, old age of those who cannot afford help, terminal sicknesses and autism. My heart goes out to them, while my brain calculates the cost to the national bottom line. For example, per one study, about 80% of emergency care is spent on extending the life of a terminally ill patient by only three months on a sick bed. That money could serve millions avoid sickness. I don't know what to say on this topic since it sits at the intersection of the current great national debate. Edit - Add to this list addicts, orphans, homeless, victims of crime and others I may have missed.
