Found the communist! Yes, it is the company's fault for not making enough money. They're so greedy for providing jobs and healthcare so it is no surprise that when healthcare prices soar through the sky that they will choose to keep paying it until it bankrupts them! Jesus Christ, get half a brain before you comment. This is life, not every small company is going to be living like a king.
