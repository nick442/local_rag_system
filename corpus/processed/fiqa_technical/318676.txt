"Village? Are you in the states? I am not saying start a car dealership, I am saying look for cars that are sold below the value they usually go for. This takes a bit of time and effort of looking at each car and seeing what they generally sell for. Blue book is a decent indicator, but do not go solely on that alone. Go to a car auction, and write down each car you can, judge each car, the mileage, and condition, and see what it goes for at auction. Then go to other areas and find other similar cars and see what they are sold for there. Build up a database of sorts, and the cars with the best margins, and preferably higher turnover, and get those. This is not a ""business"" per say, it is a way to make money and learn the market for a while. Once you get a good bit of general knowledge, and build up a lot more money, then you could likely start a car dealership. Depending on your area you will likely need a good 50k to get started, maybe more depending on insurance and lease agreements."
