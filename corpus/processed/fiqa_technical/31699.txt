In reference to the original question: You put pretax (untaxed) money into an IRA. If this was a rollover from a company plan (like a 401k), your company may have also put pretax dollars in. As the account grows, you get gains on all of this money. The government gives you this amazing deal because they want you to save for retirement. But, they also want you to eventually spend the money in retirement and they want to collect those deferred taxes. So they require RMDs starting at age 70.5. To guarantee that people follow the rules, they make a stiff penalty for not doing so. The IRS has the option to forgive a forgotten RMD distribution penalty, if you can convince them that it was a true oversight and not a deliberate flouting of the rules.
