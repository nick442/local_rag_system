You should also know that its FAR cheaper for everybody, including you, (at least $250,000 over each person's lifetime, - each American, compared to a Canadian) to get rid of the whole insurance system and pay for health care with taxes (we wouldn't need any more than today) and simply give people health care, eliminating all of the administrative complexity from the users standpoint. That would allow doctors and hospitals to save a LOT of money on staffing. So, your tiered system that denies health care to those who can't afford to pay actually costs everyone more and they get LESS care and lower quality care. In short, we're cutting off our own nose to spite our face. All this time the rest of the world is growing farther and farther ahead of us.
