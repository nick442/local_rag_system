He's complaining about the post freezing a pension and requiring employees to waive their right to sue when terminated to receive severance. Freezing pensions is becoming standard because it's an outdated and expensive way to fund retirement. Requiring a waiver for severance is standard. This guy comes off like a whiner that doesn't know the way the world works. There is probably a reason the post was in trouble before Bezos.
