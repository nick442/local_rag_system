Thanks for the link to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, @ChrisW.Rea. It explained in clear terms that I can withdraw money from and transfer money to the line of credit any time I want. The only monthly payment needed is the minimum payment. And yes, it may have a term after which all remaining principal + interest must be paid back in full. Similar to a credit card, as you pay off your line of credit, you can draw on it again, up to the limit you are allowed. However, a key difference between a line of credit and a credit card is that with a line of credit there is no interest-free grace period. You will have to pay interest on the amount you borrow from the day you take the money out. You will receive a monthly statement that shows the amount that you owe on your line of credit. You must make at least a minimum payment on that balance every month. (n.b. Specific terms and conditions for lines of credit vary from institution to institution.)
