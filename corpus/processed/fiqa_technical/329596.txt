"tl;dr Roth earnings are not necessarily ""tax deferred"", but they might be. This is a great question because IMHO, the use of the wording ""tax deferred"" is slightly misleading when talking about a Roth IRA (and Roth 401k too). The phrase ""tax deferred"" actually means you save tax now and you pay tax later, i.e. you ""defer"" the tax. As you pointed out, this is the normal terminology used for describing a Traditional IRA/401k. Earnings on a Roth IRA are tax free (not deferred), but only if your distributions are qualified. For the most part distributions are considered qualified if you wait until you are 59.5 years old before taking the money out, but there are some exceptions. If you choose to distribute more than your contributions, meaning you are now taking out earnings, the earnings are tax free only if your distribution is qualified. For example, if you take out the earnings before you are 59.5 (and no other exceptions apply), then you would pay tax on the earnings and also a 10% penalty. So, perhaps a better way to say it is that earnings in a Roth IRA are ""conditionally tax deferred""."
