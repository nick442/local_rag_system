She’s near the Coronado neighborhood in Phoenix so it’s not the best place but it’s definitely rising. Property values are starting to go up and the hospital is right now the street. Her location isn’t the most perfect, but when she did a survey of the neighborhood there were a ton of people saying the only thing that’s missing is a health food market. The closest Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s and sprouts are all pretty far away especially with traffic and she doesn’t mark up her prices that high at all.
