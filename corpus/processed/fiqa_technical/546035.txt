What's funny to me is that the sales tax isn't what gives Amazon better prices. It's that stores have to include their costs on the price that's shown on the shelf. Amazon gets to tell you later that there's a shipping fee, Amazon isn't paying a store staff and rental on store front property. In short Amazon can show the customer a price that is making a decent profit, and still be lower than a retail outlet.
