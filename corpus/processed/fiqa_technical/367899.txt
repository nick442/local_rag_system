> Vimovo was created using two readily and cheaply available generic, or over-the-counter, medicines: naproxen, also known by the brand name Aleve, and esomeprazole magnesium, also known as Nexium. > The Aleve handles your pain, and *the Nexium helps with the upset stomach that’s sometimes caused by the pain reliever*. > You can walk into your local drugstore and buy a month’s supply of Aleve and Nexium for **about $40**. For Vimovo, the pharmacy billed my insurance company **$3,252**. The stomach pain that's *sometimes caused* by the other drug? For an over 8000 per cent markup? I'll take the Nexium, or the even-cheaper Prilosec, thanks. And since the stomach pain is only sometimes, maybe a lot of us don't even need the bundled pain killer. WTF. The doctor in the article claims he didn't know the medication he prescribed was so expensive. With the costs of medications these days, I think doctors should at least be aware of drugs they prescribe when they cost thousands of dollars - especially if there's a cheap counterpart. > [Drug maker] Horizon says the high price is justified. In fact, the drug maker wrote in an email, “The price of Vimovo is based on the value it brings to patients.” I hope Horizon gets as much hate as Martin Shkreli and Turing Pharmaceuticals did. EDIT: Fixed mixed-up drug names.
