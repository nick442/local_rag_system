"I can't imagine how a company that has all the proof it needs of its existence and business dealings is able to be challenged in this way. Fact is, they were doing business first. The insurance company has no claim to make. (I'm not a lawyer, my observation there is based on what's right and logical..perhaps the law disagrees and if so, that law is as crooked as the judge who thinks the request for the insurance company's business dealings off ""frivolous""). They may have messed up. That's because the evidence looks pretty ""open and shut"". Too bad for them they're getting pushed around on the basis of ""I'm bigger"" I guess, huh? I don't see why this means they're on their own. Edit: I didn't see the part about the dillusion suit. Definitely brought it on themselves, still being harassed; and insurance company has no right to shut them or their site down."
