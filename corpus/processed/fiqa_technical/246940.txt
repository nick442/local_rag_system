Folks, they aren't making the ESM just for shits and giggles. Of course it will be used. The real question is how far this goes. If growth doesn't come back then not only Italy will need a bailout but so will France. And not even the ESM is big enough for France. But Spain and Italy are already pretty much baked into their planning. All of this stuff is already laid out but you can still bet the breathless media will report every single step like no one ever before contemplated it.
