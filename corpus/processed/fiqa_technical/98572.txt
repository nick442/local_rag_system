That's not how logic works. Warren Buffet is for a FTT for one counter example. People who make money in the stock market in honest ways want long-term stability. If they see the financialization of the economy as counter to this goal, and a FTT as a method to mitigate that risk, then they would be for it. If John selling Jim ten thousand cows introduces systemic risk to the economy, then yes, the rest of the market players should be compensated.
