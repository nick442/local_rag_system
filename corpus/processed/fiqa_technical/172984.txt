Yes. It was a very trying time. The company management and board were basically incompetent, and they fired the CEO, who was a great guy. The company went from being worth essentially nothing, to a billion dollars in less than 5 years. And it got that successful despite the management and directors rather than because of them. The amazing staff held the company together, and made it successful, while the board concentrated on in-fighting, and management concentrated on lining its pockets with stock options.
