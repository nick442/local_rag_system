Working from home is a mixed blessing. It's nice to avoid the morning/afternoon rush hour. It can be nice and comfortable at home and you can work in the nude .. All that said though you need to make an effort to get out or you will go fucking crazy. You need to make more of an effort to maintain a normal routine as it is far too easy to just get up 5 minutes before you start working etc. Also it can be hard to focus on work sometimes, shutting out distractions at home can be very difficult especially if you are doing dull work.
