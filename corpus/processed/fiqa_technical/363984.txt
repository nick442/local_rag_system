For most business purposes, Gmail/ Outlook should suffice. Just make sure your username sounds professional enough. Try and stick to FirstName+LastName @ Gmail/Outlook dot com, if that's available. You could also get yourself NameOfYourBusiness @ Gmail/ Outlook dot com If you want to come across as a well established business, and only if you've some cash to spare every year, getting yourself a domain name would be a good idea. But, if your business/ services aren't too popular, yet; I'd suggest you defer that expense.
