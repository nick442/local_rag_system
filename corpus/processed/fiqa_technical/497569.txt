I'm a woman in her early 30s who has a bachelors degree and a job. I rent an apartment, own my car and spend within my means because that's what I was taught. When my sister and now ex-bro-in-law decided to buy a house in the middle of the bubble, despite having no saved money and a child on the way I shook my head at them. They responded with, 'Real estate only goes up, it's an investment'..I laughed and told them they were fucking stupid to pay $350,000 for an older 2 bedroom house in Phoenix, AZ that was severely overpriced but they said, 'well it's 0 down and the interest rate is like NOTHING!' Cut to now, the same house is worth MAYBE $110,000 but ya know that great interest rate they got at the beginning wasn't so great when they had to refi so they didn't want to pay their payments for a $110,000 house with a $350,000 loan so they stopped paying their mortgage. Nothing really happened except some letters were sent and was told that the only way to get a better interest rate was to HAVE to miss a certain number of payments (maybe 6 months) in order to qualify for the loan the Obama admin had created. At some point that year she decided to get a boob job, tummy tuck and liposuction and her and her husband felt the need to purchase all kinds of new things. She eventually did qualify for that government help and was totally forgiven for the 6-8 months of payments they missed.. so CLEARLY purposely missing payments would have been considered 'very smart' by those same analysts who called what American Airlines did as 'very smart. So I sit here, with my morals in tact and they sit there like a million other people in this country having their cake and eating it too so I have to wonder WHAT THE FUCK? Was I the stupid one for not following the rest of the asshole idiot sheep and screwing all the people with what I would have thought were basic morals? It appears so.
