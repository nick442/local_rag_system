I'm sorry but that is just absurd. 900,000 over 20 years is 40909 per yer. So by this logic, my co-worker, with 4 kids, is making 160k per yer just to cover his children, bullshit. I know his wife doesn't work, she has health problems, and 4 kids. I have other friends that make way less then 40k per year and yet they have a child, and are able to have a car, this is utter over inflated bullshit, what is middle income then? 150k a year?
