No the government got screwed. They only made a profit if you squint very hard and ignore lots of things. They should have done what Buffett did, or more, offering to buy as many share as needed at 1c a share. No-one need to bust but stupid greedy people needed to learn a lesson. Of course they did learn a lesson: America is the home of socialized losses and privatized profits.
