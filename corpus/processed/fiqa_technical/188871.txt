The other answer is awesome and complete, but I will say that, to charge my car, it takes a few seconds. I plug it in, go inside, and don't think about it until I go back to my car. That's something that people who don't have an EV don't understand - most of the time, it's more convenient. On long trips, you use superchargers, and the trip takes a little bit longer counting stops - because you were already stopping for food and bathrooms anyway so might as well charge while you do. But, overall, unless a huge amount of your driving is long trips, then you will end up saving time with an EV over a gas car (because you don't have to go to gas stations and mostly charge at home, which is more convenient).
