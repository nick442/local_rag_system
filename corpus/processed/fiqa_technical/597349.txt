It's called the Stark Law. Most of us would eat and run, sleep a little bit during the dry lecture. Had no effect on practice whatsoever, since you're following guidelines anyway. Mostly was for antibiotics and cholesterol meds, insulin, stuff like that. Can't ever remember getting one about opiates - although based on the amount of new brand name opiates on the market, I'm sure someone is getting these lunches.
