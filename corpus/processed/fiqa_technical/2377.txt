>If you're a non-target like me this is how it is. With hard work and intelligence we will get what we want though. I suggest looking into the CFA program. I think networking might be more effective on that front. I'm from a non-target (and not even in finance) yet it seems like talking to people has gotten me a lot further than anything else. I've been surprised at the number of bankers who are willing to give me the time of day.
