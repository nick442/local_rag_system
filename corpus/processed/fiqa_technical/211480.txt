That is the part I like most about SoundCloud, how artists use it as a platform to share their creations. As others have mentioned it's probably just a shit mobile app, which is a pity. Because the app is a means to an end, that is to say.. I use the app to stream soundcloud, which is then transmitted to my Hi-FI setup over Chromecast or bluetooth (preferably the former).
