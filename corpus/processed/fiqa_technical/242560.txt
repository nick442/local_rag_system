What do you actually know about their methodology? Do you have the raw data? Do you know how they selected the sample? Did they discover perfect random? I would guess not. So that probably would mean 100 isnt correct in this context. Not that I doubt this study follows stats best practices perfectly or that the people running a study on employees about a company of a very wealthy individual would be objective/completely without ulterior motive and from some source I dont even actually know the full background of the people who made it but.. I'm non-partisan. I would also just ask, how did that election turn out again with the numerous polls and other research of 1000+, repeatedly at different times over a campaign that seemed to have been like 2+ years long? Further I dont even know why we are talking about a study of 100 when theres glassdoor with more than 10,000 reviews though it isnt normalized or in an actual study format. The thing to note is that if you compare the types of employees to another tech company like lets say Google/Alphabet or Facebook you have a different distribution in the type of people recruited and that might effect their experience. Amazon does a lot of retail, support and call centers as compared to a lot of engineers with a more educated background. Both are people but theres definitely a difference in the type of person as well as their temperament you get if you go to lets say an urban wal-mart as compared to an Alphabet or Facebook engineer. Have to compare apples to apples and as far as this study goes I dont even know how they like them apples.
