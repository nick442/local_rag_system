"I was not arguing, I was agreeing with you. People should pull themselves up by their bootstraps. I am sick of lazy yankees failing to uphold the great juche ideals of self-reliance/self-support. In all seriousness though, I was hoping my wild sarcasm would open your eyes to the non-sequiter of your own argument, that Starbucks is ""one of the best companies to work for at that income bracket."" So it's better than McDonalds/Walmart/Target. Does that make it actually good? Are these work conditions (poor scheduling, extremely small notification window) acceptable? If you answer yes, would you continue working under those conditions if you experienced them?"
