And that vol., which you love so much, is the exact reason retail is leaving the market to begin with. If you're retirement savings is tied up in market that you don't trust anymore, and returns aren't what they used to be, why continue to participate? You'd be better off buying long-term bonds. HFT complains that they can't make money as easily as they used to, but forgets that they, collectively, scared off many of the participants that were necessary to make that money!
