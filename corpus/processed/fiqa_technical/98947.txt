"Market cap is synonymous with equity value, which is one way of thinking of a company's ""worth."" The alternative would be enterprise value, which is calculated as follows: Enterprise Value = Market Value of Equity + Market Value of Debt - Cash and Equivalents - Non-Operating Assets Enterprise value is essentially ""how much is the firm worth to ALL providers of capital.""
