> Just because you had 1, 2 or a dozen children, why should that be considered in what your unskilled labor is worth? 1 child per person or 2 per couple should be factored in to what unskilled labor is worth. The reason is that we need unskilled labor to wash dishes or dig ditches. Since the system needs them, the system needs to support them. Support would mean that they can get a modest living working a full time job for their entire lives. A modest life would include one where basic needs are met and normal human experiences are available. This would include food, water, shelter, clothes, health care, some entertainment, retirement, and a child to replace them after they die.
