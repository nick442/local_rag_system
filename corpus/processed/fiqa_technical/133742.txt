That I - Deacon John Hubertz, and my tiny church, are going to make a dedicated and if necessary lifelong effort to stop the thieves and scoundrels who charge $10,000 to bury a body. We do this for the widows, for the orphans, and because I and my entire church are on a mission from God. We do not own a building, we do not seek to convince or convert, and we never ask for donations. We have been given this righteous task and with all our strength we will do this. http://saintjosephrcc.blogspot.com/2017/09/god-speaks.html
