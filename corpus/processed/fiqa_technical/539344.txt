Based on what I know I'd say the following: * financial assets are mostly owned by the rich, and so normal items aren't being purchased by normal people at any higher significant rate. The higher asset prices are staying invested instead of being used to spend. * QE failed to raise consumers expectations for long term wage expectations, and so spending and credit hasn't grown as much. * technology is causing a variety of deflationary pressures: ride sharing, room sharing is cheaper. Music and video are almost free. Brick & mortar stores are contracting.
