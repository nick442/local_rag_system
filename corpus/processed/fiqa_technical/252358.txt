"So long as you have complete, virtually instant access to funds through checks, debit card, or ATM transaction, then yes it would be a better option than a ""vanilla"" savings account. If it's in a brokerage account that you would need to process a transfer and potentially wait a few days for everything to settle, then I would just keep it in savings. The amount earned in interest isn't worth the extra hassle. A compromise might be to keep a few thousand in a savings account and the rest in a money market. That way you earn some interest and still have instant access to enough funds to cover most emergencies."
