> However for non-tech industries, if current CEO's want to learn more about tech I think that's great but, most of them still won't get it, they'll just say the normal buzzwords and enough to get by. Yup, and as the article says, this will not bode well for the company that employs them. The fundamental problem is that non-tech companies are facing the same kind of disruption that is situation normal for the tech business. It probably won't last forever like that, but for now there is a big wave of rippling through a lot of industries. > Then a CTO/CIO will step up. You ever been at a company with a technically brilliant CIO and a CEO that didn't undertand a thing about technology? Does great if the business fundamentals remain the same. Otherwise.. not so much. Probably one of the better outcomes with that was Gerstner at IBM. He saved the company, but turned one of the biggest mountains of intellectual property in to a consulting services company that essentially was out of the tech game. > Also one risk here is, you get a CEO who wants to learn tech or gets a wild hair and then they think they know everything and then the backsliding begins, I actually worked at a company that went this direction because a CEO learned about a new product that would replace our backend processing software and wanted everyone to start converting to it, then the CIO had to come in and take reins. If you have a CEO who thinks they know everything when they don't, you are definitely doomed. They have to expect their senior staff to be more talented specialists. If they aren't, that already a very bad sign of their leadership skills.
