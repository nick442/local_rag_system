Last I checked, Argentina had a growing economy. [Argentina 1991-2011 GDP Per Capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Latin_America_GDP_per_capita_1991-2011.png) * Foreign direct investment in Argentina is divided nearly evenly between manufacturing (36%), natural resources (34%), and services (30%). The chemical and plastics sector (10%) and the automotive sector (6%) lead foreign investment in local manufacturing; oil and gas (22%) and mining (5%), in natural resources; telecommunications (6%), finance (5%), and retail trade (4%), in services. Spain was the leading source of foreign direct investment in Argentina, accounting for US$22 billion in 2009; the U.S. was the second leading source, with $13 billion (17%). Investments from the Netherlands, Brazil, Chile, and Canada have also been significant. In all, foreign nationals hold around US$86 billion in direct investment. * Argentina's economy grew by 9% in 2010, and officially, income poverty declined to 8% by 2011; an alternative measurement conducted by CONICET found that income poverty declined to 22.6%.[Argentina's unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 was reportedly down to 6.7% from 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009, according to INDEC data. The jobless rate has declined from 25% in 2002 largely because of both growing global demand for Argentine commodities and strong growth in domestic activity. Argentina proves my theory.
