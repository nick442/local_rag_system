"I worked for a plumbing/heating business in a management position for the past 3 years and I learned a few things: You need a web presence STAT. Yellow page ads while effective at reaching older clients are EXPENSIVE and effective web marketing can be created at a fraction of the cost. Social media is an AMAZING tool use it. Flat rate pricing. Quote your prices before you get the work and get a signature before you start. Make sure it is very very clear that you expect to be paid on completion. Be known for cleanliness. Wealthy clients WILL spread your name around if you take the time and care to respect their property. Carpet runners, boot covers and cleaning supplies will pay off. Pick a company name and get a PROFESSIONAL graphic designer to make your logo. Plaster it on all sides of your vehicle and you now have a mobile billboard. Find something to specialize in.. for example boiler repair is a dying art. If you can be ""The boiler guy"" you will have lots of yearly maintenance work. Speaking of which offer yearly maintenance contracts as a way to get back into the house and develop a business relationship. Get some sales training. You can be and effective salesman and still be honest it is just a matter of understanding the customer. Nexstar might be something worth looking into. But the membership fee is not cheap. Setup some sort of inventory tracking system NOW. Have it in place so when he wants to grow it will be easy. The company I worked for while not doing all of the things I mentioned here still managed to do 7 million a year in revenue. PM me if you want to know anything else."
