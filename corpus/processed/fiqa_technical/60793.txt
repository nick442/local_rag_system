Save a little if you want but pay most of your way through college if you can. Debt sucks bad and I try to avoid as little as possible. I'm willing to bet that any money you invested while in school would be trumped by a only a few hours of overtime once you're out of college and making money (assuming you've chosen a path that is valuable today and through most of your future). I worked full time and attended school full time when I was in college.those 3-4 hour nights of sleep were worth it not that I see people paying $1k/month for the next 10 years on loans.. assuming you can handle it.
