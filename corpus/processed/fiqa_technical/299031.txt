Using GDP as a proxy for economic well-being was ok, though not great, when GDP growth seemed to be linked with other measures like average salary, purchasing power, national debt and employment. I had really hoped that the split in these different measures during and since the recession would mean that people started to look for more nuanced reporting of the stats but sadly it seems that now GDP is on the up and employment is back below 7% everything is fine in the world of newspaper publishing.
