>Please. There's virtually no place you can't hide a private key... virtual or otherwise. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what I said didn't matter.. the reach of the law extends to your person and tangible property. Your home, possessions, misc assets and most of all *you* can be hauled off. At least though, through it all you can draw comfort from knowing your private key is safe. Or something.
