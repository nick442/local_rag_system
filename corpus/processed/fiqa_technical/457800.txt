That tends to be the case with a lot of things I am seeing. Any changes seem to create short term recession with projections of long-term growth. I would normally see that as a problem, because the reaction to the recession could effect the outcome post recession, but the LFPR trending downward is not a good sign for the economy as a whole. Eventually that portion would leave most markets, or welfare would have to increase, on the current trajectory. I think encouraging non-income producing assets for wealth generation is a flawed system, personally. Whether I am right or wrong, I do not know. I think the Government, and subsequently the fed, should encourage income-producing assets for the wealth affect, or in the very least, not something as crucial as housing to the health of the consumer base.
