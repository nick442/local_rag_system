> That said, the non-profit also was likely to enroll about 1,000 students at nominal tuition levels, whereas the for-profit is likely to enroll tens of thousands, with dozens of staff doing nothing but making sure their students get the largest possible student loans. I get what you are saying, the non-profit isn't causing as much long-term damages as these for-profit Johnny-come-latelys. Has anyone taken the numbers and really crunched them? I feel like the problem is the perverse incentives created by the student loan system. There isn't anything inherently wrong with for-profit colleges, but there are issues under the current system because of the way we extend credit to students. Anytime credit is available, the big, corrupt banks are not far behind. I say get rid of the loan programs and see how these for-profit schools adjust. I think they would probably be able to adjust more quickly and possibly even get better than the non-profit schools, due to their lack of legacy contracts and traditions.
