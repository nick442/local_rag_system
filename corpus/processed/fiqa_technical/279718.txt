Heck yeah. I actively dislike Taco Bell, but I still can't help stopping in to try whatever their new whatever-it-is or grab a bag full of food for $4. It's like those new limited Lays chip flavors. I know I'm not going to like cappuccino flavored potato chips. Who would enjoy coffee and milk chips? No one. Did I try them? Yep. Did I like them? Nope. Will I buy the next crazy flavor? Of course.
