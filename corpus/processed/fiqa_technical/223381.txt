In my district, it clearly hurts it. There are highly incompetent teachers teaching because the only requirement for tenure is that you work for three years in the district. Since hiring people is a hugely cumbersome process in my district, it is often easier to just keep a mediocre/incompetent teacher than it is to hire somebody new. This is even more true after they have received tenure. I understand the idea of due-process that KillYourTV is talking about, but it is so easy to receive tenure and so hard to fire tenured teachers that it does not actually cause that.
