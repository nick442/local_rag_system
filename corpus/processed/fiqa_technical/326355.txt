What area of finance? Institutional finance (equity research, investment banking) is a non-starter with no experience unless you're Jesus. And if CFA level 1 material is intimidating, reconsider, as those are the basics of a finance undergraduate degree. PM me your prospective employer if you like. I'm probably twice your age and have the CFA charter and several other finance qualifications, so I'm not going to be applying there. I will be able to give better insight as to preparation and your chances.
