"> no factory will let you operate machinery stoned. Because if someone gets hurt they may require **medical care**. Also, there is currently no hard definition of ""stoned"" and drug tests do not show if someone is ""stoned"" or not, just that they have used the drug at sometime in the past. Yes there are non medical compensation costs to be considered as well, but all of it is really rooted around the insurance industry which in turn lobbies against drug legalization. Its not just CEOs of course, but if there were more business leaders that would speak up about these things and not just play into the right wing anti-drug propaganda then maybe we could make some slow progress."
