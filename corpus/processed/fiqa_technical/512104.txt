It's an early adoption situation, Tesla's approach is pretty brilliant. Serve the high-end niche markets with a design and performance at the high-end and work your way down in affordability over the long term. Many products have followed this overarching strategy. BTW that includes the early combustion cars which were playthings for the wealthy, and pretty unreliable at the time compared to horse and buggy. As an aside, all those batteries are recyclable into new batteries. Solar panel costs are dropping rapidly and if we can get to the point that investment in industry R&D is self sustainable we will continue get price drops similar to Moore's law in computer speeds.
