"First, don't try to understand other people's finances. Family or a trust could provide the minimum down payment, or even large chunk of the price, leaving them with a small/manageable monthly mortgage. More importantly, HGTV home buying shows are fake. Buyers don't actually buy, other people touring are just locals/ friends, and the entire plot is literally a written script. Source: My best friend had 3 of his listings on one of the shows as the house options, and our friends were the ""other buyers"" on the tour."
