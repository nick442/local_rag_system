"Right now you are standing at a fork in the road. If I could tell my younger self who blasted past that fork without noticing it what to do, I would say: Research ""Financial Independence"" and ""Early Retirement"" and ""frugal living"". If you do it right you can be financially independent in 5-15 years depending on your comfort level with frugal living. Many people celebrate graduation by financing a new car. It's like a quadruple whammy. New car brings sticker shock. Financing is paying to use someone else's money. Buying a car period is buying into the commuter lifestyle. And the cash flow could have gone to reducing debt or building savings. One blog I read advises that this step adds ten years to the time you have to work before you become financially independent."
