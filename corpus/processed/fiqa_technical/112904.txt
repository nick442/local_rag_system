seriously..I'm the only one that is recommending VoIP.ms? It costs a buck a month to keep your number and you can get DIDs (numbers) from other countries that point to the same phone. You'll need a ATA though to hook up your normal phone to the internet..I use the Cisco PAP2T-NA and it works wonders with good QoS on the router. Bonus: This also allows you to do long distance phone calls on your smart phone if you have 3g/wifi internet access..pretty awesome stuff. Extra Bonus: if you switch family members onto voip.ms too then you can phone them for free. I have quite a few around the world and most of my long distance has been completely cut out of my bills. Monthly bills are ~3-5 bucks a month based on usage. I challenge anyone else to beat that! Edit: just realized Verizon is cell service only -- DOH! Can you tell I'm not from the states? :P Leaving this post here because it could help someone in a better choice for their wired phone service non-the-less. Long distance thing is also a plus for your smart phone ;)
