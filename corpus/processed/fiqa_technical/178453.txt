"> Didn't these guys get their covers blown? Your statement refutes itself. How? I'm saying Cash can be used *just the same*, and the point of 'bitcoin is anonymous' glosses over the logistics of purely anonymous trade. The second you come out of the darkweb into the real word which you flat out must unless you intend to trade in small amounts and never pay taxes/trade for anything in the 'light' then the chain will be follow able back to the invisible now not so anonymous wallet. IE the wallet is only anonymous if it only does business with other wallets that stay in the darknet which doesn't happen and doesn't happen with cash either - see Panama papers. > Also, offshore banking ""safe havens"" frequently give away records to authorities, which most recently led to arrest of piracy website admins e.g. kickasstorrents Right which is the same as Bitcoin? IE Bitcoin doesn't fund terrorism anymore than Cash does and is no harder or easier to discern one from the other = Therefore the comparison is stupid and theater for the stupid."
