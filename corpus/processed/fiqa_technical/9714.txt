Hahaha. Oh yes! Brown rats, the second most successful mammal on the planet and the most well adapted human vermin, are totally only in your burger kings as opposed to fucking everywhere. Fast food is plenty clean. Just about any large corporate food chain will get consistently good health inspection marks due to the cost savings of a strong central training policy. Also, rats don't get as big as rabbits. You may have been looking at an opossum.
