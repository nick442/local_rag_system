Microsoft **actively** stifled innovation. They would buy new tech just to prevent it from being deployed. They would force people to use their products through bundling at a time when there was no other reasonable option. We all have the option of Walmart or any number of supermarkets. This situation is nowhere near at Microsoft levels yet. I'm sure Bezos would love to be as much of a monopolist as Gates was, but the era is completely different.
