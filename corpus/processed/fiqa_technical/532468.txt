I see, I'm not familiar with how the US works but I had always assumed that ratings agencies existed to audit firms and actually had some legal authority. If the issue comes from legal grey areas though, isn't it still fair to assume that better regulation would fix the issue? Why wouldn't giving ratings agencies protection in the way of government funding, and actual authority over firms, fix the issue? I just feel like CDOs are an interesting security and I don't know why, as long as fixed income securities are being accurately represented, that they wouldn't be a viable investment choice. Edit: also please note, I am but a lowly final year university student so bear with me if I don't make sense. I'm just trying to understand this whole concept and lord knows fixed income isn't my strong suit.
