Definitely a scam. Don't call him or do anything. Stay calm, there is no damage done yet. I met someone online three weeks ago. .. Left his wallet, debit card, credit cards, drivers license, etc. in the room In the entire world its only you he can bank upon .. someone whom hes met online just few weeks ago; there are no relatives, friends ! why would the hotel manager Fed-Ex or UPS the items to my home address .. and not to his own address? Upon receipt, the engineer will give me his password to the Bank of America account so he can access his account Why doesn't he have internet? I am supposed to call him in the next hour or so and let him know if I will be doing this tomorrow. Don't call. Don't reply. The $150 is just a starter bait to see if one is gullible enough to take it and then there is more and more by different ways.
