So I liked the source. Biased and outdated on a lot of things, but still very informative. I will concede that FDA regulations are far from infallible, and deserve to be loosened and the process expedited. THAT BEING SAID: the discussion wasn't whether that was the case. It was whether the FDA is the cause of high drug prices. This site did not to my knowledge make that case (at least for the present time period it didn't). https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/big-pharmaceutical-companies-are-spending-far-more-on-marketing-than-research/ Here we see that the companies spend a lot more on marketing than they do on R&D (of which FDA compliance is just a small part). Furthermore, assuming that they'd still be doing SOME SORT of testing themselves, they wouldn't save the full costs from reducing FDA regulations. They'd also have to spend even MORE on marketing to deal with the increased competition (we're talking pharma girls for dayzzzz). The problem with the free market solution is that the drug companies end up getting politicians to shill out to protect them from legal harm. As governor of Indiana Mike Pence, signed a “right-to-try” law, which absolves drug makers of legal responsibility for hawking untested nostrums at terminally ill patients. Okay, so now the onus is on the doctors. Well that's barely any better, because doctors are individuals with very little free time, and with so many new drugs coming out and no way for the doctors to test them, they just have to take the drug company's word for them. In other words, **the drug company isn't liable, the doctor is. And the doctor has no way of knowing whether the drug company is being forthright until it's too late for both the doctor and the patient**. Laws like this Mike Pence law weren't around when that site was publishing.
