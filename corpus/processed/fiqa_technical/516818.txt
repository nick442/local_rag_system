FTA: “Yet this new study notes that subsidies aren’t simply cash being handed to oil companies. Subsidies often come in the form of tax breaks, which is just one of the many ways oil companies receive government handouts.” Tax breaks are not subsidies. The taxpayer pay absolutely nothing to the oil companies when a tax break is applied. The taxpayers are actually net recipients from the drilling activity. If the existence of a tax break is a requirement for oil drilling profitability, then elimination of the tax break would eliminate drilling. The taxpayers are choosing between zero additional tax revenue without tax breaks or some tax revenue with tax breaks so drilling can proceed. The article’s point about export ports being subsidized by the taxpayer is a distraction. The VAST majority of oil produced in the US is consumed in the US. All that oil is drilled, transported, refined, transported again, then sold to consumers in an end-to-end supply chain built on a vast sum of private capital.
