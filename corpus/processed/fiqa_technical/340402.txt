"> nor does poor political judgement make him also poor at running businesses. People don't *really* have ""different flavors of judgement."" If he supported Donald Trump, there's a reason. What is that reason? Liked his politics? Liked that there was an (R) after his name? Was swayed by the siren song of ""drain the swamp""? I'm a moderate progressive who wants single-payer healthcare, cuts in military procurement, elimination of ""Right to Work"" laws, stronger labor protections, etc. And I seriously question the judgement of anyone who says that Hillary Clinton ""did nothing wrong"" when talking about her email server. After a year of debating the issue, I feel that anyone who says that is not actively engaging their brain, but rather that they've decided they like Hillary Clinton and will make decisions that favor her despite overwhelming factual evidence to the contrary. While I wouldn't completely dismiss someone based on it, I do have a number of friends and colleagues I know who fall into this group, and I would take any recommendation they made regarding political issues with serious skepticism. Or a broader analogy - let's say a friend took you to dinner somewhere, and you got violently ill afterwards. You mention it to your friend, who says ""Yeah, me too - happens every time I eat there, but I just really love the food."" So - do you now question your friend's judgement only with respect to choosing restaurants? Or do you kind of start to question it across the board?"
