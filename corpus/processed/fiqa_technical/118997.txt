In other words, the cost of three people at $12 an hour is less than one person at $20 an hour. So we'll spin this into a feel good story and post it up on Reddit. This is further supported by the fact that when I go into a Costco it's nearly impossible to find anyone to help me, and when I do, they are just about useless. But overall, I don't care. All that really matters is how much money I'm saving under the business model of buying in bulk. So..I'm a major Costco fan.
