That sucks. If BofA is taking responsibility for the insurance payment, then they should.., well, take responsibilty - full responsibility. I hope these people get reimbursed fairly. Didn't their insurance company contact them about the policy? If not, I'd certainly be shopping for a new insurance company, and possibly I'd include them in a lawsuit. The insurance company should be contacting the bank **and** their customer. Mine sent me a couple of letters, saying a copy was sent to the bank (although I think they still had the original bank, not BofA). But BofA had recently paid the premium, so they ignored it - basically dropped the ball. When I got the 2nd letter from the insurance company, I called again, and the guy at BofA got right on the ball, checked it out, and fixed it very quickly, then helped me cancel my escrow so I could handle it directly in the future. Perhaps I was lucky to get someone who cared about their job enough to follow through. But I also jumped in to make sure it got taken care of, so if he hadn't, I would have been bothering them until they did.
