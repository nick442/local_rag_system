Can someone explain to me the whole electric car thing? I mean how can they be green, batteries and short life cycle surely thats not environmentally sound long term. Added to that green energy is hardly common so really its just moving the source of the pollution no? Obviously oil is unsustainable but does electric really make logistical sense?
