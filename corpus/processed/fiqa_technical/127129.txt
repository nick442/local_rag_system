As a lifetime car/driving/racing enthusiast: The modern driving experience is such shit. Traffic is terrible everywhere you go. There is constant road construction. Our crumbling infrastructure ruins suspensions once you actually manage to break out of traffic and build some speed. For pleasure cruising you get beat to death and tar/paint/road debris ruin your cars finish. Assuming you find a nice stretch of pavement that has been maintained since the Eisenhower administration with no traffic, there are overly aggressive speed cameras in place, or some dickhead with a badge out to make a quota. I got a speeding ticket last year for 3 over. 3 fucking MPH over, and it cost me almost $200. TL;DR: Cars are awesome. Driving anymore is no fun.
