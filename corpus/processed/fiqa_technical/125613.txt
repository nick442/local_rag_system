"How can I use a house I own free and clear to purchase another home? Answer: walk in to any bank, that's any bank, or any lending institution. State that you own a house free and clear. This will happen: In all jurisdictions, it's incredibly easy to borrow large amounts of money at the lowest possible rate, once you own a house outright. On top of that, you want to spend the money on another house (as opposed to s sports car or the like), so you have even more equity. Winner! Your main question will be this. Say your current house (owned outright!) is worth $500,000. Go to a bank or lender, and say to them, ""How much money will you give me to buy house B putting both the houses on the mortgage."" One bank will say ""fantastic! buy any house you want up to $400,000!"" Another will say ""$450,000!"" another will say ""$300,000!"" In a hot market another will say ""$650,000!"". So shop around and see who will give you the most."
