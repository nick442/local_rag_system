You don't, because no one will. (In fact, if you want to patent an *idea* -rather than a process or a design- it probably sucks.) So you just bring the product to market. Then you can either move forward patenting it yourself, or demonstrate that it's a preexisting idea and dispute all other subsequent patents. And the way you bring your product to market is by gambling your life.
