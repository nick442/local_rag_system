> my only argument is that the degree alone doesn't define competence. Of course! But degrees determine interests. And it seems that you are trying extremely hard to not understand what I said: if someone has degrees in music and has proven skill and knowledge in security, I will hire them. But not as Chief Information Security Officer. For this, you need someone who took many specialized training and got their end dirty working, designing, planning and setting security systems. So we BOTH agree, mainly based on the stupid things that Susan said, that Susan was not qualified for her job. > I also never agreed that she got the job due to connections: So give me a possible way how Susan got her job. > HR .. Contractors, on the other hand, perfectly fine. OMG! Contractor, or temps, or outsourcing is not fine, especially by the HR department, because it all means trying to save money on workers, not giving any benefits or security and shoddy work. Contractors, except IT, are paid less than permanent employees. All I can wish for you that you will work as a Contractor all your life and you will see how great it is yourself.
