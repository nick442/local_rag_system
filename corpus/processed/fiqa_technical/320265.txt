ISAs last for as long as you live - you can accumulate a further £20K each following year (or whatever the limit changes to) and the whole balance including gains is tax free. You can also leave the £21k in the first ISA, and open a new ISA the next year, if you prefer. You can also transfer a balance from one ISA to another (make sure you go through the explicit process for doing that, don't just withdraw it and re-deposit it, otherwise the protection is lost.)
