You don't need a book, you need to advertise. Start trying different things untill you find the money. Scale up what works and also keep trying other avenues. What's your position on Google when people search for your Jewellery, Jewelry, Jewellers, Jewellery stores, etc., + dates (anniversary, mothers day) + brand names? Do you have a website? I've been killing it on google maps & local seo for years. FB ads would do great with the right targeting.
