Start with the cards you already have. If you don't have enough room on the best card, then ask for a credit increase. You have to keep in mind that some of the programs have a maximum amount you can charge to get the bonus cash back amount. Others have a graduated plan where the first few thousand dollars are at a lower cash back rate. If you do decide to get a new card, make sure you get a large enough credit limit or the work to get a new card was for naught. I would start with bankrate.com to research cards.
