Both android and IOS have basically been _complete shit_ with app permission management as a rule. It's one of the reasons that I essentially refuse to treat my smartphone as an actual personal information device, and instead treat it like some shared platform that I just have on really extended loan that could be revoked at any time. Frankly, I think that permissions should be dynamically selectable and with multiple levels (including options to allow things only while an app is running in the foreground), and it ought to be fuckin' trivial to see what an app is accessing at any given time. I mean, FFS, they already try to sandbox users, so failure to do the rest is just halfassing it.
