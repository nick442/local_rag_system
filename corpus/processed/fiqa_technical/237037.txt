"If I pay off 70 percent of the loan amount, will I be charged less interest? Yes, because when there's less debt (aka ""the balance"") to charge interest on, just as when you pay it off ""normally"", there's less interest charged. Note that the loan contract might stipulate: That's quite rare in the US (except for some student loans), but I don't know about India."
