I can understand the argument that it's not a good allocation of resources to extend the life of someone by a few months, but what's your argument against treating accidents, mental illness, disabilities, autism etc? And how much would the additional bureaucracy of charging people cost? In the UK, the NHS costs about Â£3000 per working person. Seems well worth the cost.
