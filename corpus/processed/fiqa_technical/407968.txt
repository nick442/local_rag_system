">*""The vast majority is just too indoctrinated or apathetic to think""* Yes, I agree with this statement. In certain states, a party platform built upon ""Guns, Jesus and No More Abortions"" will get you elected even if the rest of the policies amount to having them bring ropes to their own hanging. In many blue states, shallow, rhetoric-laden environmental platitudes and an appeal for various kinds of ""social justice"" will have the same effect insofar as it also tends to get voters, voting against their own self interest. There is literally no other reason why a majority of people would ever vote to de-fund schools, stifle science, dismantle society, allow corporate overreach, prefer pain, suffering and bankruptcy/financial ruin for millions instead of having sensible healthcare policies for everyone. That the military gets almost unlimited funding for its capital purchasing but leaves millions of veterans denied of VA services and almost every other kind of support is shameful and should not be acceptable to anyone. Yet, all of this goes unchanged year-after-year because of the meaningless and ineffective manner in which people vote. Voting isn't the problem. What they vote for, is! The underlying problem is a deeply uniformed voter that is easily manipulated by the products of campaign finance. Even when voters do show up, their vote is easily purchased that their vote does not have an effect apart from confirming what the lobbyists paid for."
