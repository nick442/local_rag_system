People can engage in whatever mental gymnastics that they want if they're only reading the headline. There's no way to get enough information from it to be educated on the subject. Even your headline, I can dismiss the statistics because I don't know the source. I can still throw in my own anecdote to dispute it. A person's ignorance and personal beliefs can trump even the best crafted sentence. I don't think headline readers are any better or worse off reading the current headline or yours.
