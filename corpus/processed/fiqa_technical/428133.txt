Slightly better attempt this time around. However, the linked studies are essentially irrelevant to your bombastic claims; they still fail to backup your idea that literally everybody who consumes cannabis is a degenerate who lives with his/her parents and works a minimum wage job and is a danger to society. That remains an unproven (and unprovable) assertion And you misunderstood all of previous posts. At no point did I attempt to argue that marijuana is good, bad or indifferent. My point was simply that your generalizations of marijuana consumers are spurious, close-minded and not based on any *real* research. You've yet to provide any counterfactual to that.
