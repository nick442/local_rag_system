Some governments offer business information search for corporations in their jurisdiction. The search results may show the director information for the company. If this information is made publicly available, keep in mind there are websites that make money from indexing publicly available information to show in Google search results. I don't mean to scare you as this is a likely a slim possibility. It really depends on the privacy practices in place at the jurisdiction you're in. But do keep in mind if you're planning on doing business on the side for a few years policies may change. I would call Service Ontario (or whichever province you're incorporating in) or Corporations Canada if federally incorporating and ask them if they offer a business search service and exactly what information they make public. You might be able to reach a Privacy Officer and find out what exactly their policy is.
