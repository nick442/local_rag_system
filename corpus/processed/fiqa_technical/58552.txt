Yep, worked in same kind of company. I have seen great people getting fired, when I could see them performing great with better guidance, or working in a different department. Instead they would put them on performance plan with unreachable targets. A guy I knew hit his targets while on perf plan, still the manager found some bullshit excuse to get rid of him. I ended leaving in the end as I saw it coming.
