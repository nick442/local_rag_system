I think your right that these people don't have zero bargaining power, but even with everything you've listed, they still don't have much. The difficult thing we have to deal with as a society is that some portion of our population isn't capable of or willing to provide enough value in the labor market to support themselves sufficiently. Personally I think the solution to that is more MGI or UBI. Tampering with the market price for labor just creates an artificial floor that leaves the least skilled earning the real minimum wage, which is always zero.
