There are entire 5-person teams dedicated to forecasting *individual products* at major companies that roll up to product class teams, which then roll up to balance sheet forecasting. Since all of those companies have major capital markets operations, these things get huge. The real forecasters are spending 10-14 hours a day, year-round using massive models to come up with competent forecasts. I did this for a few years, it's leaps and bounds more than applying multiples. I hope you get a lot of participation, but you have to see the flaw in this dataset. I think this would be better done by honing your focus in on what forecasting you're talking about. It's a very, very broad field.
