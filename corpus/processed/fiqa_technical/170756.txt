"Damn right. The USA appears to have one of the highest productivity per capita rates around. Actually, when you measure its productivity per man-hour, it's merely average. America makes up for sub-par productivity by just working longer hours. It's a ""Boxer the Horse"" work-ethic. Infrastructure falling behind? ""I will work harder."" Wages falling? ""I will work harder."" Patent trolling? ""I will work harder."" Labor laws being violated? ""I will work harder."" Layoffs? ""I will work harder."""
