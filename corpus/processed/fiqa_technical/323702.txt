Maybe you can explain their position. It seems to me they should be in favor of: 1. Universal healthcare (public or private) for the reduced uncertainty and increased mobility to the working class 2. Ending government subsidies of things like energy and farming, so that the markets will properly transition and adjust based on the economic realities rather than manipulated markets 3. Copyright reform to enable easier access to aged content by creators and the public at large, including the creation of new businesses 4. Infrastructure investments that fuel growth in the forms of market development and market access 5. Industry-based cooperatives for things like waste management (a la Germany) to preclude the need for the government to dictate the standards and practices, while actually dealing with the problem. But as far as I have seen, they are opposed to all of these things. For example, in [1] above, what I've seen is that business likes to have the upper-hand in the employer-employee equation; they like when employees can't up-and-leave because the children would lose health care. But the same informational availabilities that enable capitalism to function to their benefit are stifled in that case, preventing the employment market from properly equalizing. To put it another way, erecting barriers to entry to prevent people from competing with you sounds great, but it usually bites you, your investors, and everyone else in the ass because your products/services are stagnant and you aren't competing. Why do the so-called fiscal conservatives seem to be okay with ass-biting externalities and artificial barriers to entry?
