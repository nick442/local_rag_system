Call them ask for a delay on your $25 per week fee and send them a check and a written letter saying to close the account once the balance to zero. If they deny your delay of $25 per week fee, send them a express package by Fedex, DHL or the post office. That should run about $25, so in comparison to the fee its like paying one week. Be sure to close your account and be clear on how to do so from overseas.
