Hasbro is also in this mindset with a lot of their properties. Look at how they handle the MyLittlePony thing going on. Every single episode of that cartoon is on YouTube in full 1080p, but Hasbro doesn't really care. They don't make money off the episodes, they make money off the merchandise so they let the episodes stay online. Same thing with custom pony models and plushies, these things [sell on eBay for over $2000 using Hasbro's IPs](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fluttershy-Galloping-Gala-Custom-Plush-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic-/120792470190?nma=true&si=lA3t7kbBPFukGe0nnpU9m4g7c7Y%3D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557). Yet even though all these things are a clear violation of their copyright, Hasbro just stands back and lets it run. That's one of the reasons the brony thing spread so fast as it did.
