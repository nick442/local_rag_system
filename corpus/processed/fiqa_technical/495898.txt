"That's definitely a good point; thanks for noting that. Leverage was definitely an issue. Re: the ratings agencies, I just wanted to clarify that I was talking about something a bit different than the problem of ""ratings shopping"" (I assume this is what you meant what you mentioned the ratings agencies ""capitulating""). ""Ratings shopping"" is essentially the tendency for a ""race to the bottom"" in ratings when banks pay for ratings. That has always been an issue for the ratings agencies since the 1970s (I think?) when they started having the rated entities pay for their ratings. What I was talking about is more unique to the structured products industry in the mid-2000s -- i.e. how the ratings agencies gave banks an opportunity for essentially risk-less profit by merely repackaging MBSs into CDOs. So banks would buy up MBSs, repackage them into CDOs, sell shares of the CDOs to investors, and then hedge all of the residual risk away by writing a CDS contract with a monoline insurer like AIG. This has more to do with the relationship *between* ratings for different products, and not the absolute ""level"" of the ratings for any given product. Sorry if that sounds nit-picky, but I think it's an extremely important detail that is generally lost upon -- as you pointed out -- economists who are pushing the ""ratings shopping"" theory. I would guess this is because moral hazard is a story they are already familiar with."
