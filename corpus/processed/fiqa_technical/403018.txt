Thank you so much, that means a lot to hear. My uncle I am close with is the CEO of an investment banking company and I have some ambition to try and get into that field. I just know it is so competitive. But I am also interested in other fields such as financial planning or asset management. But I don't even know yet, I haven't even started my degree and I'm not looking at going back to school until next fall. I'll get in where I fit in I guess.
