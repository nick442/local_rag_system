Whats hilarious is that Sears WAS amazon. Sears started as a catalog service, basically an analog version of Amazon. Then they pivoted to department stores. Had they truly stuck with their why (big Simen Sinek fan here), they would have seen the internet as an awesome new tool to get them back to their roots. With better leadership they could have been Amazon. They ahould have been Amazon. Lesson being, never let success prevent you from continuously reviewing the value you bring to your customers. And never forget your roots.
