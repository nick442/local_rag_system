"Austria - I'm 27 years old and live alone in a 753 square feet apartment. I live 100% on my own salary and have 0â‚¬ debt. I pay quite a lot of taxes but I think that it is well worth it, as until now, I received more from the state than I paid back (health care, education, scholarships during education, public transport, low rent,..) Our tax system is far from perfect, but there would be a lot of people who would have no chance to rent a decent apartment, get health care, get their kids to school, or even college without the ""socialist redistribution"" how you might call it. I do not think that I could change your mind for even a little bit - I just hope somebody who isn't as narrow minded as you might read that and think, hmm maybe this ""socialism"" isn't as bad as it is displayed. You for example have apparently no idea about the different facets of social economic systems but what am I expecting from a Trump voter (initially meant as a joke, but I actually was right wasn't I? :)"
