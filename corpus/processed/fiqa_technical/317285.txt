Does not surprise me in the least. Sony has zero innovation now. Their audio products are shit. Their TV production is hitting the end of the line. The PS3 barely survived launch and they were beaten badly by an affordable, innovative, and horrendously underpowered competitor. Their online store is a fucking joke and they spend too much time pandering to companies like Capcom and Konami (who have nothing but tapped out IP's now and they keep trying to leech as much out of them as they can which, after RE6 reviews have shown, is about to implode under their own weight). The Vita is not doing well at all and it's library of games is missing high demand games and most of them are ports of their lackluster PS3 counter parts. I hope their president can turn this shit around, but his task and the depth of the issues may make that impossible. He's just starting to play catch up right now and it's going to be some time before they can surpass anyone. They need to cut the fat, ditch what's not working for them and never will again (like their smart phones), and focus on innovation instead of beating old ideas into the ground and copycatting their competitors (i.e. PS Move).
