Owning a home with a spouse is a form of a trust. A pension plan is a trust. Protecting land from development often involves placing it in trust. Wealthy people use trusts for estate planning for a variety of reasons. There's no ""better"" or ""best"" trust on a general level.. it all depends on the situation that you are in and the desired outcome that you are looking for."
