Middle class for me is anyone who earns at a level where they can save money but depends on a salary for a living which is a very wide range. You are at the rich class if you can comfortably live on your earnings from assets and have large savings so emergencies have little impact. The whole healthcare was a big help to middle class since they didnt have to worry about existing conditions etc and preventive care was always covered. Also democrats are the ones that want to extend deductions like mortagage interest, property tax that help middle class most.
