> . I mean, they are making a really cheap Tesla S, where are they cutting costs? Guess you forgot your tax dollars go into that car. We pay a ton of money per car to lower the price. Funny thing is, wealthier people are the ones buying the Model S for example, but tons of poor people are subsidizing it. > The Chevy Bolt has a 50% 38km larger battery for practically the same price. I'm not a fan of all the issues with Teslas and there are MANY. But I rather have that than any Chevy.
