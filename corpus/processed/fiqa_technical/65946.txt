Typically a hedge fund makes money in two ways: An asset fee of around 2%, and a performance bonus of 20% of the profits. This causes a huge deterioration of the funds growth, especially when you compound the difference over 20 or 30 years. Funny enough, they don't have to put in 20% of losses, that's 100% on the pension to bear.
