You guys have real potential to market yourself very well. First off, your truck is a giant moving billboard so vinyl wrap your truck with the company name, phone number, and other factoids about the business. Every time you drive, you advertise. This might be out of your league, but viral videos always help. I don't know how good you are at video work, but if you can make something short/simple/stupid/weird enough to gain traction on youtube, you can get your name out there even more. However, I'd put my current focus in vinyl.
