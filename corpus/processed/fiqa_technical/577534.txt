Politics matter when these types of things are being initially negotiated. Otherwise an early proposal that is intended to be just a bargaining position will be reported as OBAMA IS TAKING OUR FREEDOMS, and they will be forced to remove the bargaining position by politics instead of good policy. This will be voted on by the Senate, and will have to be ratified by 67 Senators. Trust me, this treaty will have its day in front of the people.
