Unfortunately it's not that easy, not up to people, up to the boards of directors at said companies. If those boards see value in paying more for a CEO and less to what in their eyes are replaceable workers then CEO pay will stay where it is. There needs to be real solutions set in place to accomplish anything. Ex. Where do pay cuts stop? Is it just CEOs? Because there are plenty of other executives who make millions as well. Even high level managers could make say $200k/ year while the people directly under them make $75k. So where is the cutoff point? TL;DR: Saying to pay higher ups less is nice but isn't a solution without a plan of how to distribute money more evenly.
