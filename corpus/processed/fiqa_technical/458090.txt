If Paywalls were without ads, I would pay. They want me to pay for contents, and, on top of that, I have to fight ads? I can only understand PayWalls if they claim their ONLY income is from what you pay for the contents. In the past, people paid to get their favorite papers. Yes, papers had ads, but totally not obstructive.
