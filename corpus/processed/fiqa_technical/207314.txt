It's also going to cost them big time catching up to Google's current map technology. Google has a massive head start and having a subpar map app will certainly hurt iphone sales and future adoption. The SGSIII had 4 of its 5 best weekly sales after the iphone5 was released. The fact that Google would not release turn by turn navigation is only half the facts, Google was willing to release it but they had terms that Apple would not agree too. Also Apple didn't need turn by turn navigation for Google Maps to continue to function, Apple could have developed a separate app instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water.
