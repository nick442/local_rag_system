The weird thing is that Walmart and maybe Kohl's sales are becoming the economic conscience of America. If Kohl's does better because Walmart shoppers move up a notch -- cool. If Kohl's is doing bad, and Walmart's down, and especially if Walmart necessities of life items are doing poorly, we know things are going the wrong way.
