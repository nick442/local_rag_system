"With stocks, you can buy or sell. If you sell first, that's called 'shorting.' As in ""I think linkedin is too high, I'm going to short it."" With options, the terminology is different, the normal process is to buy to open/sell to close, but if you were shorting the option itself, you would first sell to open, i.e you are selling a position to start it, effectively selling it short. Eventually, you may close it out, by buying to close. Options trading is not for the amateur. If you plan to trade, study first and be very cautious."
