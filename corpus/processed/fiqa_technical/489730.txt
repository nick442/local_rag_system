Comcast is always hiring, and they pay pretty well. I know someone that I work with now, who worked at Comcast as a Commercial Installer. He traveled a couple times a year, but each time it was to some awesome island. Take note, however, that he was laid-off. So, layoffs are a possibility there. Also, if you are willing to take part-time work (which, if you have only debts and no wife or child, I absolutely suggest sacrificing your credit for a few years for this opportunity), I highly recommend getting on with UPS or USPS. You will start part-time and work your way up to full-time making over $55,000/yr. Also, don't forget about truck driving. Long-haul truck driving pays around $55,000 your first year. Most companies will train you, so long as you sign up for a one-year contract. Some companies are Central Refrigerated, Knight Trucking, Gordon Trucking, Swift, Stevens Transport, etc. This is always an option, and I intended on doing this before having formed a family, but alas.. Also, trucking can lead to better, more local jobs.
