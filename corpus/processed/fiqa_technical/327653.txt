It's simple. Look, children are basically an 18-year debt, and if a couple is poor, they can't adequately pay that debt AND their own lifestyle costs. If those who can't afford that debt simply.. delayed or abstained from reproducing.. that would very easily solve the poverty problem permanently, so long as the next generation followed the same. This next generation would also have more of a surplus since their parents had to have had a surplus before having kids. Ad infinitum. This is exactly what happened in my own family so I know it's possible. Ultimately, most poor people only have their parents to blame.
