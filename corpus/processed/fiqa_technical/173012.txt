As a resident of Wisconsin, I can definitively say that the whole reason why we are in this position is because of governor Scott walker and his anti-federalist ideology. Wisconsin has passed several bills, strongly advocated by the governor, effecting in inhibiting worker unionization and collective bargaining. And it is this lacking of both that catalyzed the middle-class decline from the start.
