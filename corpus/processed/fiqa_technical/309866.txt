Don't do it! The penalty and repayment requirements of the 401K will likely be more of a headache than the student loan payments. Just pay off the student loans the normal way, or in larger chunks, if you can. Student loans often have lower interest rates than other loans. Think of your 401k as your long term savings. Don't rob your long-term self to pay the student loans.
