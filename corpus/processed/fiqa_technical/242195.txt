I was clarifying a point someone else made. I don't take any ownership of the claim, however none of what I said is particularly far fetched, especially considering [Wal-Mart has a net income of close to $16,000,000,000 annually](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=WMT+Income+Statement&annual) Also, I didn't say that the job *deserves* higher pay. In addition, there's no reason I can see why a pay increase would result in Wal-Mart laying off 30-50% of its workforce. They either need the manpower to operate the stores or they don't, and that financial statement would indicate that they could absorb a slight increase in overhead. Sorry for the way you were treated there, particularly the 39hr55min a week part. I don't know the ins and outs of Wal-Mart's policies, but I'm guessing this was a way to circumvent a policy that grants certain benefits to 40/hr week workers?
