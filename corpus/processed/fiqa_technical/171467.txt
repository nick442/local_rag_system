That wasn't my argument. Everybody is upset that they are so much faster and lower latency than everywhere else and that nobody else can afford it. However this misses the point that these faster speeds only affect HFT fighting HFT. HFT practitioners were already running successful strategies on the same links as the regular institutional investors; the arms race began when more HFT players entered the market and the game became saturated. It's now very hard to make money in HFT as a result of the heavy competition.
