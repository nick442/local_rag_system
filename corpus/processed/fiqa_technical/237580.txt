I mean a checkings/savings combo is fiscally responsible if you're putting a 3-6 month emergency fund in there. Hell, I'd argue that you'd be insanely bad with money not to keep an emergency fund if you got the cash to spare. 401(k),IRAs, and stocks are great investment vehicles, but having a portion of your funds be liquid is important.
