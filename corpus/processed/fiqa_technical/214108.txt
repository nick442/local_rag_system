We will ignore the fact that insurance companies are making record profits since the ACA, are not allowed over 10% profit, which they don't hit, and are only pulling out of markets because they want MORE money in the coffers at the end of the year, not because it will bankrupt them to stay in. You're right, lowering investments from not dumping as much dividend gains back into it, and taxing them in them will make them not lower premiums, you know, seeing as they reach that 10% anyway.
