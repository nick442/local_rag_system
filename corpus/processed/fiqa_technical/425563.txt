Something something old people retiring something something ignore the 18-25 205+ unemployment rate something something THE ECONOMY IS RECOVERING BLAH BLAH BLAH *Decreasing participation rates can also be the result of perfectly natural phenomena such as people leaving the labor force so they can go to college/graduate school, raise small children at home or retire. Furman said these phenomena, particularly the boomers’ retirements, are responsible for participation rate’s dip more than anything else.* This article is trying to piss on me and tell me it's raining: first, it was snow/weather hindering the economy. Now, it's all going according to plan since old people are retiring. If this jackass Googled unemployment rates for 18-26 he'd realize how ignorant or stupid he was. Just waitin for that Student Loan bubble to pop to watch this so called recovery come crashing down.
