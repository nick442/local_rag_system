It's not really fair for him to say share buybacks are 4% of GDP, because share buybacks don't directly contribute to GDP. Presumably, if a company has excess cash than what can profitably be reinvested into the business, then it should return that cash to the shareholders (buybacks). Then, it is up to the shareholders to decide how to reallocate that capital. Theoretically, shareholders will allocate that capital into profitable ventures. The assumption being, distributing capital to profitable ventures is more efficient than distributing capital to non-profitable ventures. And the efficient distribution of capital should increase GDP in the long run. If you believe that sort of thing. Personally, Id rather that every employee was paid a respectable wage for their labor, not the bare minimum that they'll accept to avoid starvation. But that's another issue all together, so nevermind.
