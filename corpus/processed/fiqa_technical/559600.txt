Oh definitely, you just need to be willing to work in Bismarck ND, or various parts of the rustbelt. And it's not that you're getting paid especially high, it's that everything is so insanely cheap (for the most part). The last enclave of decent earning potential, really cheap living, and decent weather/enough stuff to do to keep you content is deep south college towns, but those are a secret so shush!
