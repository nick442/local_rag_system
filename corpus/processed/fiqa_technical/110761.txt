"Frankly, eliminating unlimited data on Sprint would not be a bad thing IF it meant faster speeds. As it is now, I get perhaps 125K a second speeds. Hardly worth it for ""unlimited"" or the $10 ""premium data"" charge that Sprint adds on. A few select cities that have seen Sprint's Network Vision implemented are getting faster speeds but the majority of us are limping along at speeds slightly better than 56K dialup."
