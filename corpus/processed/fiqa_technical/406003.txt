> Walmart, home depot, and Costco will always have their place. I still buy a number of items in stores because Amazon can't compete with a 5 gallon bucket for 3 dollars, food prices/quality they haven't even begun to fathom how they will compete with, and general items like furniture that they can't ship for cheap. You might be right, but Amazon's stated strategy *is* to compete with all those stores, and in all those markets. Most recently the purchase of wholefoods being part of their 'food prices/quality' strategy.
