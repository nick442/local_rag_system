It is a very good idea to spread your ISAs over more than one stock broker. However now that a lot of stock brokers charge an admin fee it can get expensive if you use too many. There is no need to tell your last yearâ€™s ISA provider that you are using a different one, however you MUST ONLY pay into one ISA provider in each tax year.
