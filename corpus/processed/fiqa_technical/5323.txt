Since returning of capital is the most important, I would go to bankrate.com and find either an online bank savings account or MMA account. By going to bankrate.com, you can find higher rates. Sometimes you can find rates that are higher than a CD and are still FDIC insured. I've found ally bank's raise your rate 2 year CD to always have the best rate. In addition, if rates go up, you are able to raise the rate to the current rate.
