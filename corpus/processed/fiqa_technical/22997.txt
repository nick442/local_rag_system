Standard Chinese business playbook. 1. Hire subject matter expert to establish new business operations. 2. Hire a local Chinese workforce to follow the subject matter expert around and make notes of everything he or she does for the next 2 to 3 years. 3. After three years, get rid of the foreign subject matter expert. Use all of the knowledge they have extracted from the individual including intellectual property and other trademarked information. 4. Rinse and repeat.
