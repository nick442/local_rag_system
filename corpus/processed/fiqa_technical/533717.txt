">The success rate is terrible. This may be quite true, but how many ""careers"" exist that all you need is $500 and a bank account? One can call their self a trader in less than a week; apply for online broker, transfer funds: you are now a trader. >I also wanted to see if it is still feasible with all of the algo trading and stuff that has been dominating the market versus an individual trader. Either I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid or I'm just completely missing something here, but I don't care about algo trading. One can go on about algos, HFT, and traders at big banks and insiders, but what does this have to do with me? People invest/trade different ways and none of the aforementioned methods create a market that doesn't allow small, amateur traders to make money. The market isn't on or off, it's moves in fluid motions; sometimes smooth, sometimes erratic. When people bring up big banks or algos, I feel as if they think the market acts like a [square wave](http://www.thedawstudio.com/wp-admin/Images/Sound_Waves/Square_Wave.jpg) and once the info is out it's too late. But markets take time to make movements. Just don't be left holding the bag."
