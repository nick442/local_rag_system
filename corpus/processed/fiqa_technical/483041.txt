Absolutely take advantage of getting your series 7. Sure, you're first position will likely sponsor you, but think of this as having Something on your resume that no other grad will have. If I interviewed a grad who I liked, and he/she still had an effective series 7 license, I'd be drawn to hire him/her. The money id save the comp on sponsoring them and the initiative it shows to receive the 7 while in college would give you more bonus points then anyone else.
