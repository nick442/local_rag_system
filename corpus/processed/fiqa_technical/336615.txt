"For a long time I did just as you did. I had a car, but I didn't drive it. Even if you NEVER drive a car, it still has a cost. You still have to insure it and you still have to register it. On top of that a sitting car will have costs. Cars are not built to sit. I found it to be much cheaper to take a ""taxi"" then to own a car. Eventually I got rid of my car, and we (my wife and I) just rented any time we needed to go somewhere long distance. Very recently we purchased a car and kids change things, and we want kids. SO better to do this costly move now (in our minds). But still if we travel outside of town, we still rent. A car is, usually, not good at constant ""long drives"" as the maintenance costs get high, and they are, usually, not good at ""no driving"" as they are not built to sit still. They are best used, usually, for shorter, in town, or ""next town over"" style driving. Keep in mind I am in the USA so ""long and short"" drives have a different meaning. A 200 mile trip is about the line we draw before we just rent. But that's our preference. Some of which is because we would prefer to take the train and rent there then drive the entire trip."
