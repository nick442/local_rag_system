Really, were only talking about Trumps plan? Cus I was talking about tax reform in general. As my OP mentioned, I think spending across the board needs to be reduced to make lower taxes easier to accomplish. ANYWAY, there's currently trillions in profits overseas that would be taxed at a one time low rate if repatriated. This low rate would probably be between 10-15%. Do the math, it roughly gives you the the 500b you mentioned
