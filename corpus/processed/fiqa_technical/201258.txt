"Double digit increase in tax liabilities might not ""break"" a business, but if you already keep less than half of gross profits because of liabilities for tax, insurances, etc, what incentive do you have to continue if in doing so your costs go up even higher? Do you realize how many retailers have gone out of business because of increased overhead? Obama said he didn't build it, but he'll sure as shit shut it down or sell the business if there's no incentive to continue. To use your words its amazing you make such assumptions in such a ""cut-and-dry fashion"" knowing nothing about the actual details of the business except that there is a lot of net revenue and gross profit. GROSS profit, not necessarily net profit."
