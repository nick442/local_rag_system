I wouldn't count on the hardware just disappearing. Someone is going to capitalize on the business device market; microsoft just announced their new stuff, but they could pick up the hardware division anyway. There are rumors of Facebook moving into the hardware market, and the hardware engineers and research has to be worth something to someone to just buy out. The market value of the company is dropping so much that it's be crazy to not chance it just to have a chance to get the engineers that have already been vetted by RIM. A lot of smart people were picked up by RIM in Waterloo; although I hear a lot went to Amazon and other biggest successful companies. Tl;dr Just because there's no RIM doesn't mean blackberry style devices are extinct.
