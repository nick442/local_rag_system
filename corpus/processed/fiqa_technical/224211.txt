Reminds me of when I had a warehouse job about 10 years ago. I started at the same time as a lot of temp employees. A lot of these temps were promised permanent jobs after 6 months. That didn't happen quite on schedule and one I worked with kept complaining about it loudly. So they hired him. I was in the room when he was told he had to get a drug test the next day. It wasn't a happy face. I never had a chance to compare and contrast though because he never showed up again.
