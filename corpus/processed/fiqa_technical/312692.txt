"> Sweden is on the verge of a housing bubble So now we are not taking about economy, but real estate? I am think you might be getting tax policy confused with real estate stability. After all, your [Bahamas](https://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Caribbean/Bahamas/Price-History) is not exactly real estate stable right now. Look, I get the fact you don't like taxes. If I were to guess, you are living at the edge of your budget and really feel those income taxes. You are angry, and think this ""liberal agenda"" is what is holding you back. The problem is that the opposite holds true. It is no coincidence that many liberal countries do well economically. When people's basic needs are taken care of, they have much more freedom to create and innovate. And they opposite is true too. Kansas just underwent a huge tax experiment, and had one of the biggest, business friendly, tax cuts in recent history. Instead of spring growth, it actually hurt the economy. They weren't from a hundred million surplus in their budget to an almost $2B defecit overnight. The economy didn't explode either, it lagged. Meanwhile, it's close but more liberal neighbor Missouri faired better even though they didn't change their tax policy. What is the difference? People tend to do better when they know their basic needs are going to be covered. I would recommend you take some time to actually go visit these countries that you look down on for their stringent tax policy. Go talk to their people - *in* their country. I think you are forming opinions based on our experiences, which don't exactly reflect all experiences."
