One thing I thought of when I heard this was first announced, is how theaters actually make money. Theaters don’t make much from the movies they show, since studios take a huge portion of ticket sales for themselves, especially at release - theaters make money with concessions and value add services, which would still be in full effect even on this “movie a day” subscription model. I’m no expert in the industry though, so I could be completely wrong here, but I’d imagine if theaters have a limitation on the pass in terms of how long a movie must be out before a pass can be used to see it (thereby avoiding the super high studio ticket cost) then they can still make good money from people dropping 30 bucks for popcorn, a drink and candy before they go in to see the movie.
