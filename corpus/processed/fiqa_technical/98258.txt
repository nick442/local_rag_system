It has clearly emerged in the teaching profession. Teachers in my district are paid to work from 8-3:45 on school days. Most teachers cannot finish their job in that amount of time, because of all the extra obligations teachers are forced to take on (for example, cutting janitorial staff means that teachers have to spend time cleaning their rooms every day). Most teachers put in vastly more than the 38.75 contract hours a week on site doing job related things, and are not paid any more. Heck, many of my colleagues are probably at the school right now, prepping for next year, even though summer days are not contract days and thus unpaid.
