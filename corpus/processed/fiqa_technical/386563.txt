I have always liked HTC phones and don't mind Sense, but they really blew it with the One X / Evo 4g LTE. Performance is horrible because of poor memory management. It performs worse than the Evo 3D it was replacing. It will be my third and last HTC phone. Samsung got it right putting in 2GB of RAM on the GS3.
