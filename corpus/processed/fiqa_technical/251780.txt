"When you have nothing and you need to build new, this is the best situation, but you need to partner with the Customer Support Manager, since it all come down to process management and reporting needs. First of all, what are you in the company, do you work in Customer Service, IT or just an office worker who randomly got picked do it? Secondly, do you have any budget? Do you have to code the whole thing, or can you licenses a platform or go open-source? Thirdly, what do ""they"" want from the system? Do they want to track sales leads, sales, budget, customer service issues, do they want to track trucks and payloads? Are there any business measurements, they want, like NPS, CSAT, TAT, AHT. Fourth: Are they willing to changed their working processes? If not, then all you really need is a system, where you can look up information and tie it to a account. Source: I do this for a living"
