Which is why it's *ludicrous* that they're doing so poorly. They were perfectly positioned to move to the online world and dominate. They've got experience running catalogue-based sales.. but their website is mediocre and they've failed to market it properly. Unlike pure-online stores, they have a store customers can go to for service/returns and so they can shop with confidence. Sears could've had it in the bag.
