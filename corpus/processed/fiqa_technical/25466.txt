Paying interest on a loan costs you money. The tax deduction just reduces that cost, but it's still there. So the only possible reason to borrow more than you have to, e.g. with the interest-only loan, is that you can invest the excess elsewhere and make more money. Can you invest money and make more than 4.5% expected return before tax with a risk level you're comfortable with? If you can invest tax free then the hurdle is (4.5%-the tax deduction instead), e.g. 3.6% if your marginal tax rate is 20%. One possible such investment would be paying down any mortgage on your own home - as you don't get a tax deduction for such a mortgage, overpayments are effectively tax free so 3.6% or whatever is the appropriate hurdle. If you can't do that, then even switching to a principal and interest mortgage at 4.5% would be worthwhile; the principal payments would effectively be an investment in reducing your future interest bill, and that investment is better than anything else you have available. Given that what you actually have on offer is a mortgage with a lower rate of interest, the hurdle for an alternative investment is quite a bit higher than 4.5%; with the interest-only mortgage, you can invest some of the money that would otherwise go to principal elsewhere, but in exchange you are paying a higher interest rate on the rest of your loan balance. You'd need to look at the exact numbers to work out the right hurdle, which would vary depending on your marginal tax rate, the term of the mortgage, and your guess as to where interest rates would go after the 2 year fixed term.
