I think we have to divide it up into the elements that are 'real' and those that are 'abstractions'. Certainly, it will take a long time for a turbine to 'recoup' the embodied energy of its manufacture, transport, installation, maintenance. After that, tho, it's paying its way. 'Free' energy. Property values are made up, and - while important - I don't think it's fair to include them. As far as $-per-watt hour goes, renewables can't/don't/won't compete with fossil fuels. Digging up millions of years of compressed sunshine has served us well. Looking at the bigger picture, however, renewables start to make sense, and are the only way forward. Any models that require maintenance of 20th century levels of consumption are unrealistic. The future will be slower, more expensive, and less convenient.
