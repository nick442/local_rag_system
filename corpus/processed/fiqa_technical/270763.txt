Applebees is another word for shit IMO. It's demise is long overdue. My last visit was a few years ago to a Florida location and my meal wasn't bad, but no one wants to pay Applebees prices for unhealthy, GMO, high fat and sodium food that is unoriginal. You can go to a fast casual place or a local restaurant and pay less for a much better meal.
