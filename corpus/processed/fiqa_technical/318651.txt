"The amount of ""if they don't like it, they shouldn't work there"" in this thread is fucking appalling. People have a right to decent wages. In this case, I think we all understand that simple boycotting and educating won't work. Someone in the upper chain of command in the US needs to come out and say something, as well as re-haul a disgusting system that lets people live so distraught while others live so comfortably."
