So far there have been two complaints named here, and they both have to do with the service/repair side, which is an area I've never used. Years ago I took a stereo to Circuit City to be repaired and it took them forever. I was pissed about that. I also took a computer to Fry's to be repaired once. They eventually repaired it, but it took a little longer than I had hoped. But it wasn't too bad, since they gave us a loaner to use in the meantime.
