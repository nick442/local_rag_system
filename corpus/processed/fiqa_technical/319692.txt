We fired some middle management who can take the blame for the ridiculous and unattainable goals we put in front of them. We told them to perform or lose their jobs and you'll be happy to know they lost their jobs anyways. We also shat in their boxes of personal items on the way out the door. Thank you for trusting that we can find new scapegoats.
