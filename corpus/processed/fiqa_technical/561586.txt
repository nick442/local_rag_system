I read somewhere that they are the first generation of individuals who have been monitored by marketing firms and businesses since they were born. All businesses really care about it being able to squeeze every dime out of a person regardless of a recent recession, poor job options and stagnant pay and growth. Forget trying to make the world a better place, let those who've suffered the most suffer a little more -they won't notice.
