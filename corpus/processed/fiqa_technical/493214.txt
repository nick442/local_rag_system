"The main pros are more than that. They are 1: stability of prices and interest rates (otherwise these would swing wildly with the economic cycle) 2: Guarantee of trustable legal tender. (otherwise, what's to say for sure that paper money would be any better than say.. paying in chicken feed) 3: the employment and output effects of monetary policy. 4: Currency price stability relative to foreign currencies. Also.. it might be a good idea to look who is in favor of Central Banks and who is against. In favor: All mainstream economists from any of the major schools (Keynesian, Austrian, Neo-classical, historical, monetarist, ect.) Against: Lyndon LaRouche, Ron Paul, and Right-wing conspiracy nuts. Also, last time I checked, currency value of the USD wasn't really the US's biggest problem, even even a problem at all really. Also consider what ""currency"" actually is, before worry about its value."
