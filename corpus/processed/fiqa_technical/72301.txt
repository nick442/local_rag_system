If your taxes aren't going to healthcare, they are going for something else. Taxes won't go away even if we eliminate Medicaid, Medicare, social security and the EPA. Politicians are very good at spending money, so they will find a place for your taxes. The argument isn't taxes or charity. It's where should taxes be spent for the most good. What will keep the US leading the rest of the world? It isn't charity. It is democracy, standards of living and defense spending.
