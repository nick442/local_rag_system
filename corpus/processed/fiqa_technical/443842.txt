Probably a backlash from people who are upset that the only pressing issue people are paying attention to is Net Neutrality; and ***ONLY*** because Youtube and Netflix beat over people's heads that the government is allowing companies to do shady stuff which directly affects their ability to consume entertainment. Basically Bread and Circuses. No one is really outraged over the NSA leaks or the USA paying Israel to bomb people, or these unfair trade agreements like TPP being rammed down American's throats, etc.
