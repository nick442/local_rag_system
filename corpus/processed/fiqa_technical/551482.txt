Well I certainly wasn't saying NOT to vote with actual votes.. but as it is now, we would have a quicker and larger impact by voting with our money. The voting system itself is rigged, gerrymandered to hell, and a large portion of politicians in office are paid off and only represent the interests of their largest donors.
