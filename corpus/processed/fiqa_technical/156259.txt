"> The laws just mean you can't make your decision on the basis of religion. Make your decision because they don't interview well, they can't do the job, they have poor qualifications, etc. Which means people are being forced to lie and make up excuses to hide the real reason they don't want to hire someone. > Substitute, say, ""black people"" for the reference to religious expression and you see where this is a problem. Paraphrased, you've got: ""Why should I be forced to hire black people who I fundamentally oppose (and do not wish to support, however indirectly via a paycheck), why is their right to be black more valid than my right to not like black people?"" There is a MORAL problem with this insfar as I object to bigotry. There should not, however, be a LEGAL problem with it. If the local bigot business owner does not wish to serve blacks, they shouldn't be forced to do it - it is THEIR business. They took the risk, they pay the bills, and they should be free to hire, fire, and serve whomever they wish as long as they to not use fraud, force, or threat to do so. if you think otherwise, then you're asking goverment to be in the morality business and this does not end well. it is EXACTLY because of this that we see the right trying to enforce morality codes when they are in power, the left trying to enforce some version of fairness codes when they are in power. I want one code: a code liberty that applies to everyone equally. Yes, that means there will be bigots that do not serve blacks or gays. But it also means that I can start a business, hire whom I wish, serve whom I wish, and thereby create community-specific value."
