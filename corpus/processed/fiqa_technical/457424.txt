"> Using my time the way I want is my liberty so long as I am not obstructing another person's same natural born rights. I think the left and right agree on this goal. I just think the left sees more things as indirectly obstructing another person's rights than the right. > Well, tell me why (""My body, my choice"") doesn't hold true when it comes to health care? I don't understand. I think the general left embraces that attitude except in a few cases where another person's rights are infringed (vaccines, for instance). When do you think they are being hypocritical to that slogan? > I think I am done here. Done with your answer or done with our conversation?"
