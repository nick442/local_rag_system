I think the rise of low quality merchandise in things other than consumer electronics (where obsolescence is natural due to Moore's Law and the very fast rate of improvement), is due to socialist redistribution that has put $Trillions into the hands of people merely for being poor rather than producing for others. These people typically still shop based on price rather than quality, which creates increased demand (and therefore encourages higher production) of lower quality items, such as plastic versions of things that are actually cheaper if made as metal (lower long-term cost of use).
