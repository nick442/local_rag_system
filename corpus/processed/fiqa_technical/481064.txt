Good analysis/point, except you're missing the fact that most pensions allocate only a tiny fraction of their overall portfolios to hedge funds. So say you have a $2 billion pension fund, maybe $50 million of that is hedge funds. So basically, yes the pools of money will get smaller, but there's a lot of the overall pie that the hedge funds aren't eating (yet).
