>It's not unlike Arthur Andersen. Once your name is tarnished in that kind of an industry, there's not really a road back. I don't know. Arthur Anderson had multiple accounting scandals before Enron. The waste management scandal. I think companies like Enron wanted Anderson because they were willing to bend the rules and operate in the gray area. The thing that killed Arthur Anderson was not their sketchy auditing. It was their dipshit lawyer that went on a shredding Bonanza when it became clear that Enron would go down. A case of the coverup being worse than the crime.
