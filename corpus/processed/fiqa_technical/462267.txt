>First of all QE is an increase of money supply but using non conventional measures(there might be exceptions) some examples of this measures are changing interest rates or TLTRO. Ok, but how is this different from printing money? I mean the money supply goes up in both cases, right? ShouldnÂ´t this cause massive inflation? >As to why this hasnt transitioned into more inflation, which in the end has but years after, has been a question that people have asked a lot. One of the reasons for this is the transmission mechanism not working properly, which implies that despite the fact banks have received money, they havent been able to move it to the real economy hence not increasing prices. I have read that all QE has done is basically make the prices of assets such as housing, stocks, art and whatnot skyrocket. As if all the extra money has gone to a very few, specific areas while not touching the rest of the economy. Is this something you agree with? Thanks for your reply, btw!
