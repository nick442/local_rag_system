Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying it's a bad tool. I'd personally use it, not exclusively or taken as gospel, but I'd use it. > I am not comfortable moving to the big city just yet This is what I'm saying. There are other factors if you're using glass door to validate feelings of being underpaid. By the way, if this is what you want then make the leap now. It'll never get easier.

I'm not sure I'd agree with that. If a business isn't competative then there is likely a reason. Either they can't be or they don't feel like they need to be. Prospective employees that weren't hand-picked wouldn't change that. Former employees can be drowned out with astroturfing. It's much cheaper and easier.
