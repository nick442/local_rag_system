"Not sure what your point is, but not all journalists are trying to predict the future. Some just report existing trends and let the readers make their own conclusions. The trend the article talked about was work, and therefore capital, flowing to cities. You said this trend would reverse over the next few years, because Trump. I'm not sure what you think that means. I would surmise that if America were to double down on ""Trump,"" we will lose the subsequent trade war, we will fail to invest in or heed science, we will fail to invest in national infrastructure (yes I know Trump promised this, but the Republicans only understand how to cut things,) and our healthcare system will be whittled away to something worse than it already is. In that case, talented workers would not only stop going to cities, they would leave the country entirely."
