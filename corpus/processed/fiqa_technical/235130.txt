">then why would the largest IT companies with the biggest budgets do it? Do you understand what ""appeal to authority"" is? Just because a large company does it doesn't mean it's right. Microsoft has private offices for their developers, and there's research that shows people are more productive with private offices. Yet some companies have private offices, though most still have cube farms. Who's right? There's solid research that having multiple monitors makes developers more efficient. But how many of those ""largest IT companies"" only have their developers with one monitor? Or on a freaking *laptop*? Large companies most certainly do things for the wrong reasons, or out of inertia, or with good intentions but poor implementation."
