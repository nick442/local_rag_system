Well, you could probably say that the modern tax & regulatory system is the main cause. ..for instance, in 2001-02, the Bush tax cuts reduced the dividend tax rate from 28% to 15-20%, which is pretty substantial, at least, if you pay yourself that way from owning a company. So, as he said, if dividend tax rates are low, then well, people will pay themselves more dividends. Of course, there are many other factors, such as deregulation & anti-trust, etc., but the dividend & capital gains is a big factor.
