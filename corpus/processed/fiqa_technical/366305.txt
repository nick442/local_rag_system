You can change your withholdings (IRS form w-4) to take additional money from your paycheck and get it back when you file a refund. Maybe you could buy a gift visa, place it in a bag and freeze it in a tub of water. That could help put the impulse on ice for 24hrs. It is natural right to enjoy the money you work for. Be sure to include some enjoyable spending in your budget or you will be miserable. When breaking a habit, try to do one thing different, no matter how silly it is. Anything to bring your attention back to the big picture.
