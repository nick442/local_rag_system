"The dollar menu became the ""sort of a dollar, or maybe $1.39, or sometimes $1.49"" .. went tonight to get dinner for the family, buck doubles are $1.39 and the chicken is $1.69. I got so pissed at the price creep I drove down to Chik-fil-a. Paid more, but at least they don't constantly try to nickle and dime me."
