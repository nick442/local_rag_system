I agree it's crony capitalism. I think people should make that clear instead of just saying capitalism. All those things you mentioned are from the government. Corporations will try to make profit, that's what they're suppose to do. I mean, nobody blames apple for making shit tons of money. The politicians are the ones that need to stop selling out America for their own benefits. They're the ones that doesn't allow buying health insurance across state lines. They're the ones that won't let car manufacture sell directly to consumers. They're the reason I can only get Comcast. You think I love Comcast? Can't blame capitalism for shitty politicians. Love the debate though.
