This is huge news! The implications for the rest of the economy are enormous. This flight away from the stock market into long term money is completely unprecedented. We have huge retirement funds that already were decimated in 2008-09, since then we have seen these funds flee into the money markets like never before, now even as rates continue to lower we continue to see this trend. Now it is just a matter of time until these retirement funds will see massive drops in value, not if but when rates increase.
