So raise taxes on individuals and eliminate business taxes? The government still has to pay for things eventually. The big thing the US pays for that other countries don't is our massive, most-expensive-in-the-world military, which can take up roughly half our budget, sometimes even more depending on how active we are abroad. That includes paying for current wars, preparing for future wars, and serving the veterans of past wars. We defend other countries through alliances like NATO and bilateral agreements. For that, we need a higher tax rate. We can tax individuals or businesses.
