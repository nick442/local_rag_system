You do? So you are a good friend of Steve Jobs? Or is all you know random stories you read somewhere? After all, you are not stating, that Jobs is sometimes mean to his employees. Or that he is sometimes aggressive when he doesn't get his way. You are talking about Steve Jobs true nature. And that, you can't know from some random texts you read somewhere. By the way, it is about as idiotic, as your insult towards me. ALl you make are random assumptions based on gossip and your own prejudices.
