Zinc is a naturally occurring element found in the Earth’s crust. It’s a bluish-white element, which is relatively hard and brittle in its metallic state. At present, it is the fourth most consumed metal and about 50% of it is used in zinc galvanizing processes to prevent rusting of steel and iron. Just a thin layer of zinc can work as an efficient corrosion-resistant barrier.
