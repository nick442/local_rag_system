I vaguely recall a rare helpful employee telling me that, after a ridiculous amount of phone calls. I thoroughly appreciated that person's helpfulness. However, I gave my laptop to Best Buy (I had purchased their service agreement), and even if the third party bungled things, it's BB's job to make sure things are ok/to their agreement. Their employees/management should not be lying sacks of uselessness.
