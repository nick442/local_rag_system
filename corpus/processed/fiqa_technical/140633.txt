"The only problem with taxing ""unproductive land"" is that it causes people to try to make land which shouldn't be productive into something productive. Wilderness areas not owned by the gov't get wiped out, water is wasted trying to make crops grow in poor soil, land gets overgrazed by cattle, etc. So not all solutions are that simple."
