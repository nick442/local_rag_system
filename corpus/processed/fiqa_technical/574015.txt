"> What am I missing? I said they ""were"" in favor of it. They are no longer in favor of it because they losses are being used as an excuse to kill the post office. I can't find a link right now, but the whole assertion that the GOP did this is false. The bill had ~100 democratic co-sponsors (which should be an indication that the letter carriers were in favor of this) and ~50 GOP co-sponsors. This was a widely supported bill. Who wouldn't want their pensions fully funded? They just didn't anticipate that the GOP/Chamber of Commerce types would use the losses as an excuse to try to privatize the post office."
