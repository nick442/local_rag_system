What is tax slavery? Most impacted by higher taxes can afford to put them in off shore accounts. This going to hurt the economy because businesses aren't going to higher more people. Trickle down economics consistently fails. You'll have a bunch of owners saving the profits instead of giving the jobs because most of them are already operating efficiently. Especially in a state where menial labor is the most common form. Tax Slavery is a bullshit term to justify the rich robbing the government of their due while being able to benefit from the clout that comes with being American.
