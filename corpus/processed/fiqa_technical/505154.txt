> ..but we need to start getting over number three. I strongly disagree. It shows Republicans will undermine the spirit of the system and the will of the people to serve their own ends. When a group shows they will exploit anything they can to take advantage of you, you do not work with them. > Besides that, it's completely extraneous to the topic at hand.. It is not. No agreement closes every loophole so there are always plenty of ways to screw over the other side in any agreement. For compromise there needs to be trust that the other side will generally adhere to the spirit of the agreement. Republicans have proven themselves untrustworthy in this area. > They need to try to do that on this one thing and make a fresh start. Question for you: how many times do you think Democrats should reach across the aisle only to be either rebuffed, insulted, misrepresented in the media, or taken advantage of before you would support a hard line like mine above?
