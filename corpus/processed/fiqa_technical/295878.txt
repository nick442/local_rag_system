I feel like everyday the CEO's are making more. The parties are corrupt. Education is overpriced. Unions are too weak. And unemployment is too high. I could not agree more! But that's where it stops, everybody complains and says something. Words words and words. Your words don't create employment, they don't cut CEO pay, they don't reduce the costs of education, or push the corrupt out of government. It's not because you have done nothing. But we must stay away from blanket terms. What companies are shipping jobs offshore? Who makes the decision? Yes the government is corrupt, but who in government? Who decides the price of education? Who is better off from the higher prices? What CEO's take home alot of pay and give no value back? who specifically is responsible for the writing and overall agenda at Fox? What companies don't allow people to unionize? What unions are corrupt? Point the finger at specific people so that wean take them down! The government, economy, economy, rich, poor. These are not specific enough. You cannot rally for action behind these blanket terms. You can only bitch and moan about them. Redditors! Make a change, attack corruption, unfairness, ignorance, and lies directly. Behind everyone of these things is a person. And those people should be blamed!
