Absolutely. We used to go to Applebee's or TGI Fridays back in the 90's regularly. Food was good, atmosphere was fun. Closest analogue I can come up with today would be Bar Louie - nice. Now, they've cut back on so many expenses it's just not what it used to be. Food is crap, service is meh, the value just isn't there anymore. I'd rather go to my local guy with 40 craft taps and a damned good burger I know was fresh rather than spend the same amount of money on a reheated burger and a bud light.
