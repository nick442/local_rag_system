First off, that isn't today's version of socialism or anything like it. Today's version of socialism is democratic socialism as seen in Scandinavia to great affect. Secondly, you may not read 4chan or fox but that phrase is being repeated ad nauseam on both sites as a way to push the narrative away from the racist hate that happened. Which means you're doing exactly what they want and becoming their parrot. Thirdly you're right. I shouldn't have downvoted you. You can have those back. I'm pretty tired too.
