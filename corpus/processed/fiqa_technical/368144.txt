Just saw the video. I think there will be less incentive for businesses and governments to allow automation to reach a point where the majority of the population is out of work. It's not hard to imagine why any economic system that puts automation above everything can end up in disarray. Excess automation will trigger the law of diminishing returns to kick in. In end the system will have to regulate itself to survive. Example: pro-automation gvt and businesses increase investment in automation. Margins increase which leads to more spending and investment. More workers are laid off. The standard of living increases in the short-run. As more workers are getting laid off aggregate demand decreases and spending decreases leading to a recession. The glut of production dampens the market further. Standard of living decreases. Income disparities between disenfranchised workers and sponsors of automation increase. Anti-automation movements commence, social conflict ensures. Production grinds to a near halt as unrest increases. Now two things are possible either pro-automation gvt gives in to the pressure and introduce labor reforms abolishing full automation to allow job creation or they are ousted in a social revolution and an anti-automation gvt takes over, automation is kept in check.
