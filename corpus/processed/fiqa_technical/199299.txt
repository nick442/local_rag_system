"I'd forget raises, as they're hard to predict. Figure in cost of living adjustment to keep pace with inflation, and recalculate if you get a raise. I don't think about it too hard. After I deposit my expected monthly expenditures in my checking account, the balance goes to savings, so any raises will go to savings unless I specifically alter my direct deposit settings. I have to make a conscious decision to inflate my lifestyle if I want to spend that money. Also, realize that ""matching your income"" is a bit overkill. Right now, part of that income is going to savings. If you spend 60% of your income now, why would you suddenly need the extra 40% when you retire?"
