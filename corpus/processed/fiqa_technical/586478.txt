I have a 2006 Camry, 4 cylinder engine, roughly 186,000 miles. Best car I've ever had and will probably buy another one. I commute about 80 miles a day, the car still gets over 30mpg and has no problems keeping up with other cars. I see all of these large vehicles on the highway with one person inside and don't get it. They're such a waste of money. Everything is more expensive on a large vehicle and gas will go back to $4 per gallon.
