This sounds like a real consistency issue, then. When it comes to saying one thing and doing another with regard to spending money it seems common that a company just hasn't figured out why that kind of consistency is important. To me it's a question of ROI. If a company insists on huge money-blowing events, what's the return? What is that event supposed to achieve, and is it worth it? Huge money blowing events can certainly be worth it when they actually generate long-term sales, significantly boost employee morale (in turn generating sales, hopefully) or similar. But as you obviously know, if all the employees involved in the event feel like it's bullshit before, during, and after it goes down then somebody didn't really look at the ROI before approving it.
