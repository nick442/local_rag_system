I find the higher estimates a bit unbelievable. A big part of my job is liability valuation and small assumption changes can have a huge impact on results. They may be right (future) dollar value wise but the proper way to think about this stuff is in present value terms. This could actually be a really interesting study - you all just gave me a great idea for a potential masters thesis :)
