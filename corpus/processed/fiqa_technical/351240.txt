In a previous life, I used to work for a local ISP and worked on prototyping, building, and implementing Canada's first mobile Wi-Fi distribution network for public transit. In the first year of deployment, (unofficially) ridership increased by roughly approximately something like 300% (can't give actual figures, but it's been hovering around that figure). We decided to backhaul it on a 2mbit/s HC-SDMA network for its beam-forming and spatial multiplexing which, again - unofficially, can push its full pipe worth of data (2mbit/s) while travelling at speeds over 160km/h (this was fun to test) without so much as a single dropped frame or CRC error. Not AMA-material, but I think that the push for mobile data in consumer electronics has really bolstered the business model (and bottom line) for incumbents like public transit and long-distance busing.
