> WTF is 'non-government' savings? The non-government consists of the private and foreign sectors. That is, everyone not the government. Every year the government pays the non-government (ie: us) more than it taxes us, our savings increases. Every year it taxes us more than it pays us, our savings decrease. > Its not a bad thing.. unless interest rates rise. The Fed sets the risk-free rate on USD, and there isn't much one can do with USD that's lower risk than loaning it to the US government. It's for this reason that Japan doesn't run out of yen. The Japanese government's debt is just the huge pension funds accumulated by the risk-adverse aging population. Every year the Japanese private sector saves yen, the Japanese public sector is left dissaving it. It's not a problem though, as the Japanese government's no more going to run out of yen than the US government USD.
