"Dear Bot of Doom, I appreciate your concern, and will consider your suggestions. However, you don't know anything about my level of knowledge or the training that I've had, what risks I'm taking and how I calculate them, or where my gambles will take me and my financial situation. A lot of people like to try to tell me that I'll fail. Who knows what my future holds? All I can do is make my plan and stick to it, while educating myself along the way. And if I do in fact fail sometime in the future, walk into a buzzsaw, lose nearly everything, the blame will be solely on myself. Not on some ""professional"" who I've paid to manage my finances. I don't know. Like I said, I appreciate your concern, I really do. We shall see what happens in the future :) Love, Rachel"
