"I would contribute to the Roth over the course of the year assuming the worst case scenario (actually the best base from another POV, since you're making more money!). Save the rest of the money in a regular account, and make your final, ""top off"" contribution when you compute your final AGI for 2011 taxes. You have until April 15, 2012 to make tax year 2011 contributions. I'm in a similar situation due to my wife's overtime, which is very variable from year to year. At this point, I don't make any IRA contributions until I do my taxes."
