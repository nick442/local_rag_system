they were terribly run with uncompetitive prices. I mean I took one walk through a newup and comer like HH Gregg and I was impressed. Limited selection of products but for what products they carried they had a nice range of cheap but workable to expensive but justified priced hardware. Where as Sears had two year old models of TVs selling for the prices of this years. And Kmart is just scuzzy.
