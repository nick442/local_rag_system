Paper money and coins cost real resources too, but it doesn't matter much that it costs resources, except maybe for the environment. No institutions controlling the price and supply is a good thing. I prefer a currency in which the global market decides the price and not some government I don't trust that keeps printing more and more for decades, causing the currency to lose value over time. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will never replace normal currencies, but they are already competing and it's good that governments and banks don't have an oligopoly anymore. Bitcoin is a great mix of a currency and safehaven for longterm inflation. It's easily transactable and divisible without a third party AND because it's scarce, yet more accessible than gold, it's a great place to store value to escape an economic crisis or simply monetary inflation. Now you'll probably say, something volatile isn't safe enough for a safehaven. But I think the higher the price and the longer it exists the less volatile the bitcoin price will be and that the longterm trend will be up, even after it surpasses the marketcap of gold. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies are a great way to crowdfund interesting projects and create value out of nothing, enriching young smart people whom will be able stimulate the global economy.
