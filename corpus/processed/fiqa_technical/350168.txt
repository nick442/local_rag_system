Did you grow up in the country? Is anyone in your family chronically sick? Did you ever get laid off? Did you lose your shirt in the recession? Is your child's father a deadbeat dad? Where I live there are a lot of people on the brink. It's a seasonal resort area and there are simply not high paying jobs around. These people work full time and make shit wages in winter and modest wages in summer. They live in trailers and meager housing. They never go on vacation and they are on Medicaid because they can't afford healthcare. What are they supposed to cut? Food? Heat? When you grew up poor and black, did your parents eat out all the time?
