"As an engineer, my problem with ""bean counters"" is that they simply don't know anything about anything except immediate cost today. I'm not talking about the vice president bean counter; I'm talking about bean counters at my same salary grade that are rated on what things cost today versus what they cost yesterday. In my business, we're mostly all good engineers that take cost into account. We can't afford not to. But we understand important things such as lifecycle cost and opportunity cost that bean counters don't understand. If I mention time averaged rate of return to our bean counters, their eyes glaze over. Things aren't hopeless, though. We can go to the bean counters' management to make the correct things happen, but if we have to do that all the time, then what damned purpose do the bean counters even serve? Maybe they only stave off the lesser engineers that haven't learned about money yet."
