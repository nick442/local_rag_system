Your crystal ball of presumption is clearly cracked. Apple admitted to paying a 6% overseas tax rate in 2015. It has been suggested they pay about 8% in the US, but nobody really knows but them. What an utterly ridiclous statement to suggest they are anywhere close to losing money. Any fool can see Apple is highly profitable and competetive everywhere. Multinational corporations have amasses over two trillion dollars overseas. The competition is over when you get to profit. Cash is useless until transformed into something material. They should want to improve the country of their origin.
