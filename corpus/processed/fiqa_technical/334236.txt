I would agree, my arguments have been from the extreme, because my OP in this thread was a reply to an extreme statement: > Tax evaders are heroes. > I don't think taxes should be abolished. But since it is someone else's income, it needs to be used sparingly and efficiently. Subsidizing internet and electric cars aren't something you should be spending millions of people's money in. Okay, now we are getting to some common ground. Specifics are where the real meat lies. You started with internet and electric cars. Sweat, lets start there. I infer from this that you enjoy / support the internet and gas powered cars, and are against government intervention when it comes to the dissemination of the internet and investment in electric cars? What if I told you that the prevalence and success of both of those inventions were spurred by government investment?
