In reality, it's much more abstract than this feeble article depicts, which is why right/left winger Reddit-heroes often hop on this sub to validate their political views on the subject for themselves. Its economic ignorance to not think that how a governments taxes, and changes to those policies, affect how people & businesses behave. I don't have the answer to all the economic problems but I'm not fooled by OP's nonsense propaganda piece. My issue is with the article's false claim. >the job creation records of the 92 publicly held U.S. corporations that reported a U.S. profit every year from 2008 through 2015 and paid less than 20 percent of these earnings in federal income tax. This study looked at 2%(the 92 profitable) of 4,333 publicly traded US companies selected based on both having turned a profit seven years running & having dodged corporate taxes to make their tax payout close to 20%. Does this sample sound like the entire US 27,900,000 total companies that comprise the domestic US economy? (That's .02% rounding up-yes the decimal is in the right spot.) Even if this wasn't a flawed study from the start on selection bias, this isn't even quasi-experimental because there isn't a control group. Even a null conclusion would be invalidated without call for further inspection. The source is a left-wing think tank drawing a line from the false conclusion to a motivated source. Is this the standard of information anyone should make policy based on? This article says nothing definitive with evidence & is worthless.
