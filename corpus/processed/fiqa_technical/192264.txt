In June 2009 Tesla was approved to receive US$465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the US$8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supports engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology. No secret, It's on their wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors Im pretty sure the Gigafactory will be getting some sweet tax breaks and incentives too.
