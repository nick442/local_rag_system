Well, the simple answer is that I reject the assumptions of demand-side economics. I don't believe that the velocity of money matters, because money isn't real. It's just a proxy for actual value which is derived from the subjective perception of people. The trouble with looking at data is that it's all observational data, not experimental, so a substantial amount of judgement needs to be employed in interpreting causation, and with economics being a politically charged discipline, there's significant risk of bias in making those judgements, particularly if they are being made in an ideologically homogeneous setting (such as much of present-day academia). I look at economics from a rationalist epistemological lens, rather than an empiricist one, which is why I don't take studies as seriously as some others do.
