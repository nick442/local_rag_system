>corporate profits are down [That's not true.](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/business/economy/24econ.html) >my problem with that statement is that if companies just pay their employees more it will 'create' demand People having more money won't spend that money? Especially people who are currently living paycheck to paycheck? How do you reach this conclusion? >If companies pay their employees more for the same amount of output it will just drive up the cost of goods leaving us with the same shitty demand. Also, how do you figure this?
