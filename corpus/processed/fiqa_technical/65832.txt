"Don't assume you will make a loss. I knew a couple of cases where people have made mistakes like this and turned it into a more profitable business than their original venture, causing them to willingly make the same ""mistake""again. Look for the strength: a large quantity, all ready to go. It's way easier to solve than having no stock. Look further afield than usual; talk to people in different parts of the supply chain. Sure, your usual customers don't need that much all at once but would a distributor in a neighboring country or state be interested? It's possible someone out there is having trouble fulfilling an unusually big order and would love your help. Alternatively, do something unusual. Is there a pet event going on at which you could have a blow out one-off sale and work the marketing angle? Think creatively but, most importantly, you're doing the right thing by tackling this now. A distributor won't touch it when it's only got two months left."
