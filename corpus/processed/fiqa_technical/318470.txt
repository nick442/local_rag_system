The article in the OP talks about the Model S outselling competitors' luxury cars and even says they outsold three different manufacturers' cars *combined* in that category. Yet BMW sold 61,514 7-series cars alone last year. Tesla sold under 80,000 cars *in total* last year. They must be picking a very specific luxury car from a series range to make those claims add up. Tesla is a NICHE automaker. A better comparison would be to Lotus, Koenigsegg, etc. They are simply and utterly dwarfed by any real OEM and that isn't going to change for at least a decade or more.
