I don't do corporate tax exclusively, but I don't think you're correct. The idea of pre-tax and post-tax earnings is significantly different from corporations than individuals since individuals see their taxes come out when they earn it and corporations pay taxes quarterly. At the very least, it's certainly not equivalent to a charitable contribution.
