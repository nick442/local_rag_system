"Hi, ""guy"" here! This was me. I think we have a PNC shill on our hands. Anyway, slrrp you're missing the point, I was called and asked specifically about why I'm buying bitcoin and was then told that PNC wants nothing to do with bitcoin. That is news. Me refusing to answer the question is not news, it is not about the response from me or them, it's about the initial impetus to call me."
