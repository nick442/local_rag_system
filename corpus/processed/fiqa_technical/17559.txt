"You may be confused on what ""non-profit"" actually means. I'd encourage you read up on the difference between the non-profit and for profit. Since I don't know your business I cannot even begin to recommend what is right for you. As a side note, the NFL was a non-profit for awhile (not sure if they still are). With some fancy paperwork you can be too."
