"**I'm going to reemphasize this post for the OP** > Also, sales skills are key in this business, even in research, because if you're a sell-side analyst, half your job is going to see clients (i.e. sell to clients) with the sales people. Agreed. Agreed so hard. Too many people think research roles in finance are like academia or some shit. Who do people think pays for the research and who's role do they think it is to sell the research? Sure as hell not your VP's or Manging Directors. More importantly, sales skills are intrinsic in succeeding. The core of sales is communication. If you can't sell your research, how do you plan on selling yourself well enough to make VP/MD or to land a role at a HF doing research. > or is there room for the ""but I'm not good at this!"" excuse. People who have that attitude are out the door just as quick as they finish that sentence. Working at a BB the expected mentality is one of two possibilities: * I'm good at this. or * I will be good at this (and very, very soon) I know someone that took one comp sci course in college and placed Perl on their resume's. They were offered the Quant Analyst role and learned they were expected to be fluent in Perl (knew enough to show in the interview she had *some* experience with Perl). He spent the next week locked in their room teaching themselves and mastering coding in Perl. This is the mentality of people who are successful on Wall St. OP needs to learn this now or step out into a less competition intensive industry."
