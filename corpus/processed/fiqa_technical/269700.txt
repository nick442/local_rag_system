This does sound a bit implausible, even if it is true it is pretty grossly irresponsible and you probably shouldn't just let it slide.. However there is no real benefit in wading in with accusations, I suspect that the most likely scenario is that your tenet simply didn't have the money and was looking for a way to delay payment. This may well not be particularly malicious towards you, they may just be unable to pay and need a bit of room to maneuver. In this case the wise thing is to challenge them but without forcing them to admit that they might have lied, perhaps by suggesting that they might have been mistaken about dropping off the money but it's no big deal and negotiate a resolution. In these situations where it is one persons word against another giving them the opportunity to save face often pays off. Equally you want to make it absolutely clear that putting a wad of cash in your mailbox is not an acceptable way to pay.
