"This is reddit quality material. Don't use reddit to do your homework. The CMO is a type of MBS. The simplest type of MBS is a simple mortgage pass-through. So no, CMO's and MBS's aren't ""basically the same thing"". Don't use reddit for shit like this these Occupy Wall Street fuckers don't know what the fuck they're talking about. All they know is that they're poor and that's about it."
