Your specialty is a lack of versatility. Why does yesterday's skillset entitle you to tomorrow's paycheck? We're paying for seniority often times, but I've done much more work than those of older persuasion when I worked in programming. They were lazy, most of them. When you put a gen in a comfy chair, they get a fat ass and sometimes a head to match.
