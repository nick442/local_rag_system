> but how is this different than when some Mississippi businesses decided they didn't want to sell to gay people? Because sexual orientation isn't a choice, and is in some cases already a protected class. If you're a business open to the public, you don't get to discriminate against protected classes based on their status in that class. (That is, you can't refuse to serve a woman because she's a woman. You can refuse to serve her if she's being a dick to your staff or something.)
