"I think practically, although we most surely will have real estate ""bubbles"", nothing will hit 2008 style panic for a long time, as the banks are now not nearly as leveraged as they were back then. All large banks passed the feds ""stress test"" this year for the first time. Housing prices may drop a bit, and that correction may dip the market (or vice versa), but there will be much less damage to the economy."
