> Really, it boggles my mind that anyone of that rank would think he can get away with it. To me, the fact that they thought they could get away with it suggests that in their circles, people usually do get away with it. There was [a great article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/06/27/110627fa_fact_packer) about Raj Rajaratnam (the guy Rajat Gupta leaked secrets to) in the New Yorker last year. Reading that, it seemed like a widespread practice, with these guys getting caught mainly because they took it way too far. Then again, I know sod all about the finance industry, so I could be entirely wrong.
