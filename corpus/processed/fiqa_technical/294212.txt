Stop defending banks. At the time of the 08 melt down, they opened up multiple ways for large financial institutions to borrow money either for collateral (usually shit assets) or with interest rates akin to free or near free. Do you know what that means? Free money. Borrow money for free, buy treasuries and profit. Who didn't have access? Those that didn't have the inside track in the Fed and in the upper levels of the U.S. government. That's why Lehman went under and Goldman, JPM, even GE (due to finance division) didn't go under. Far far too many people upvote pro corporate comments when they aren't even remotely accurate just because their worldview is that the world is just. How silly.
