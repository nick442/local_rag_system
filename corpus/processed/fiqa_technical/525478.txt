"In the US there are a few different schemes, namely Regulated and Unregulated. In Regulated states (e.g. Colorado) everything except for some of the generators are owned by one company (called a Vertically Integrated Utility) and that company is allowed a specific return on its investment rates being set by a formula that includes the utility's fixed costs, the variable & fuel costs, and this return. In Unregulated markets (like Texas) the generators, transmission system, load serving entities (aka distributors), and retailers are all separate (although sometimes the same company owns parts at various levels). The transmission and load serving entities function like the traditional utilities I described above but ratepayers can choose their own retailer and the retailers then buy energy from the generators. Here is a good video about how the US energy market works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJAPHFGAgRw To answer the ""robustness"" question; I think the answer is actually that, in most cases, the ""wires"" costs for US customers is lower due to the higher density and compactness of the various power systems in the US. In the NEM (the primary energy market in Australia) there are SIGNIFICANT distances between loads and the larger generators and there are overall fewer customers per mile of line. Other than that the system (both electrically and from a market design standpoint) is generally based on the US system (PJM specifically). The other big difference is that Australia does not have a single grid like the US does (US has 3 interconnects but is one big grid)."
