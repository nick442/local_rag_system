You don't see data because you're not looking. What did congress do right after WW2? They slashed spending. All the plants and factories making war time things were now able to make products that people wanted, and the economy took off and people's standard of living rose across the board. You're not looking back far enough in the euro story. Greece is not the same economy or government as Germany, and that's part of the problem. Putting them into the same centralized economic system with the same interest rates was bound to fail because they are so different. When Greece joined the euro, they saw a massive boom in economic growth from the access to cheap financing costs. There was certainly no lack of demand then eh? What you're seeing is the result of years of supply side problems created by the european union in their quest to be a centralized global super power. The best thing for Greece to do in their current situation is to leave the shackles of the european union and take the drachma back. In the short run they would face a massive devaluation in the currency, and there would certainly be a few tough weeks or months, but the devaluation would incentivise all types of entrepreneurs and businessmen to build there and utilize cheap labor, there would be a flood of tourism and Greece would soon be on a path towards real productive growth. Their only other option is to face decades of austerity, and prolonged unemployment, where they are no longer working for themselves, and have become modern day serfs. We saw similar scenarios play out in both Iceland and Argentina, and Greece will only be the first of many to drop the the euro. www.econlib.org/library/Enc/SupplySideEconomics.html
