The advice I would give is :- 1) if at all possible don't expose yourself to any situation where you would require a lawyer . 2) register the site windhavenpress.com ( or similar ) and put a redirect from windhaven.com . 3) make it very clear - which I'm sure you do - that it's for Windhaven Press . 4) don't put any phone number details . Just put an email contact form and supply your full details in response to contact emails . 5) ignore anything that is not for you .
