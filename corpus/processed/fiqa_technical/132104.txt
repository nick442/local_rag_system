"You're right, but netting $150,000 a year isn't really even that tough for a savvy individual with the skill set of talented developer. ""Creating an app"" is far from the only option to make that money anyways (in fact, you're probably correct in your condescending tone mentioning it). Why would an intelligent skilled worker tether themselves to a desk in Seattle, when they could easily do just as well financially, and live where, and work when, they please? There are definitely some people who would value the steady, and certain, paycheck. But, becoming a talented developer requires a level of ambition and self-motivation in and of itself that caters to entrepreneurship well. The issue is that MSFT doesn't want to pay what good programmers are actually worth, according to the market. So, they run PR campaigns and lobby the government to bring in workers that will happily work for under true market rate. Granted, these Visa workers pay taxes, and get great jobs. That doesn't really hide the fact that these workers help lower the wages that they ""should"" be paying, according to basic supply and demand."
