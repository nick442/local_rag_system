"That actually sounds somewhat familiar. I looked them up and the first job on their site that looked like Amazon not only was, but was listed as ""Direct Hire"", and linked directly to what's probably an Amazon-operated site, so I don't know what's going on there. Presumably they just happen to have links for both kinds of hiring. I'd be curious to know what circumstances you've seen contractors at Amazon warehouses. I know there are a couple of situations where we lean heavily on part-time and temporary employees, and I'm far from familiar with the details, but I'm of the understanding that the core workforce at FC's like this one are generally proper employees like I said."
