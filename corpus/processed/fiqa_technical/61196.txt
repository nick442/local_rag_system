"> If he's also a top notch electrician, I listen to him when he gives me electrical wiring advice, I just don't let him choose where we go for dinner. ""Now most folks will tell you that fuses are rated for 20 Amps, but they're just being over-cautious. I go to 25 and even 30 Amps all the time with no problem"" Do you trust *that* electrical opinion? Does his restaurant choice affect how you feel about it? Compare that to another friend who steered you away from another restaurant because he ""heard someone got sick there once."" He also drives the car rated #1 for safety and can tell you exactly why. He always lectures you for riding a bicycle without a helmet, and offers to sharpen your kitchen knives because a sharp knife is less likely to slip and cut your finger. When *that* guy says you can go to 30A on a fuse, how do you feel about his opinion as an electrician? Still say that non-electrician decisions have zero bearing on how you feel about his abilities as an electrician? BTW, I'm done here. I've made my point. We can agree to disagree."
