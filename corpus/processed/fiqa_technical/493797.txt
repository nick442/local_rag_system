I have a sophisticated theory as to why diners are dying: diners aren't very good and aren't very cheap. There is zero reason to choose a diner over numerous other fast-casual options like Dos Toros, Sweetgreen, Glaze, Cava, or a thousand others, which are cheaper, faster, tastier, and (if you skip the bread-like products) better for you.
