> budget would reduce the deficit by $160 billion, while increasing the GDP Sounds great until you learn that $160 billion is only 11% of [the $1400 billion the government borrowed in 2016](http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/us_deficit) and the US GDP is only going up because the deficit isn't shrinking as quickly as it would under current spending levels.
