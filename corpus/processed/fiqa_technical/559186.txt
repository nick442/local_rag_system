I suppose all our (british) newspapers have 'social media teams' which may or may not include spammers, it will become a more common thing. Bear in mind also that the Daily Mail (website at least) seems really popular in the US. They are also taking posts from sites like reddit and putting them into their dead tree paper. I think the issue the admins banned these domains about was that the sites (or agents acting on behalf of) were spamming *and* manipulating the voting system - method unknown.
