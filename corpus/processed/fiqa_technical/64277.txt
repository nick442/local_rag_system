Since we all agree that only engineers contribute to society, I propose that the government replace the high school curriculum with the four years of instruction needed to obtain a bachelors degree in Engineering. Once society is only engineers, we will all have above average incomes and we won't have to suffer the existence of our moral and intellectual inferiors.
