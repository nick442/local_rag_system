Very cool! good for you. We're a rare breed - actually doing something with our finance knowledge. The rotten part I think is they've had enough success to be self employed. At that point, you start realizing the limitations of most people when you are successful, and so you become closed off. I'm as guilty of this as they were. > conservative.. but it's not for me You're right on that part. Definitely have to see what your sweet spot is and stick to that. Anything that requires me to constantly check up on the industry is out for me. But I follow tesla for many reasons and it's something I worked hard to get comfortable with (more than 1,000 hours). My comfort zone is owning 4 stocks after looking at 1,000+. And watching them closely, ignoring the rest. I also don't have time for much more. My other favorite, that might be more up your alley: Davita (DVA). I am a big fan and comfortable with the industry to know they're going to do well from here.
