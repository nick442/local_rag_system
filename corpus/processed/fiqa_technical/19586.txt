As a parent with a 4 yr old, it's not my reason. I want him to build something with his hands. Spend $50 on a Lego kit and what do you get? A tiny set of very specific parts for one build. Or I can spend that money on some other construction toy for half the price (blocks, Lincoln logs, train set) and you have similar enjoyment.
