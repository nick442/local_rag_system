">There's no ""law of capitalism"" that says that companies have to pay their employees as little as possible. There's no law of capitalism that says companies have to ""maximize short-term profits."" That's just a story that America's owners made up to justify taking as much of the company's wealth as possible for themselves. Isn't the relentless accumulation of capital, um, exactly the basis of capitalism? Owners aren't sufficiently incentivized to pay people more and they're not going to do it out of the goodness of their hearts unless they want to be undercut by their more ruthless competition. Wealth inequality won't be solved by guilt or altruism. Just as child labor laws and the 40-hour week had to be enshrined in law in order to become the norm, so will whatever solution we have for wealth redistribution."
