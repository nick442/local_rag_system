"Buffet could easily take the lead here by starting a company solely dedicated to paying off people's mortgages using his own money. Oh wait he wants government to take away money from his rivals and potential upstarts because he isn't going to put into action anything he is talking about for himself. P.S. Buffet could also very easliy dismantle the shield he is using to shelter the vast bulk of his wealthy in the form of the ""non-profit"" he and Bill Gates created and simply write debt riddle state governments (of there own doing and design) like Illinois massive checks but again that would require effort and putting HIS money where his mouth is in the long run."
