Hey man, take my upvote. God forbid a fast food restaurant tries to provide somewhat healthy and fresh options at the small risk of one or two of 2,250 stores having a limited outbreak! I guess if you're an investor it's a good time to buy some stock. It's crazy to me. ONE store out of over two thousand has an issue and the stock drops?!
