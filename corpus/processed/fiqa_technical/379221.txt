You're spot on. I'm coming in because he thinks nobody else is doing a good job, and he's hoping we can turn things around. Everyone will know who I am, complete with family gossip. The existing culture will NOT be helpful. Perhaps a softer teamwork approach would be best in this instance? Slowly work up and earn respect and assume responsibility.
