Bitcoin is backed by math and the ability to exist in a trustless state. That has value. I don't need to care about double spends, or worry about Quantative Easing. That has value. I can push transactions at my leisure over the network, sending money worldwide without needing a third party. That has value. Soon, higher level solutions will be implemented, allowing cheap microtransactions between users, and giving the network a vast scaling boost. That has value. You are stuck in a rut, from what I gather from your comments in this thread. You don't perceive the value of Bitcoin, because in your paradigm value is inherently coupled to companies and their revenue. Bitcoin is the paradigm shift that allows money to be decoupled from third parties.
