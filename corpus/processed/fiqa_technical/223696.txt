"I'm not dismissing anyone from the third world. I'm dismissing the hordes of unemployed kids my age who attribute my success to ""luck"" while they squander what resources and time they have on drinking, smoking and fast food. I had to eat cup-o-noodles every day for lunch for two years so I could afford textbooks without crippling myself with debt. I have a friend who's a single mom, lives with her parents, no help from babby daddy, and she eats at McDonalds three meals a day. She's literally spending more than my car payment just on food alone. Bear in mind her parents grocery shop and cook for her, she just prefers to eat out. If you're from Darfur, sure you might be at a competitive disadvantage. But if you're a poor american, sack the fuck up. I came from a lower middle class family. My dad made ~$35k a year when I was growing up and my mom didn't work. I made it. My wife grew up in rural indiana, two hours from the nearest hospital, in abject poverty. She managed to get herself out it through sheer force of will and she makes more than I do now. My *biggest* complaint about contemporary liberalism is the abandonment of the concept of personal responsibility. I'm all for eliminating systemic injustice but society simply can not function if we all feel entitled to a great job, a big house and an iPhone."
