>They are inalienable rights. Contract negotiations and dispute settlements are **not** an inalienable right. Civil rights, right to a trial of my peers in a criminal matter, sure. Being able to enter in to a contract with the furniture store to rent a recliner is not an inalienable right. > Our grandparents fought and died for this protection and you would simply throw it away without a fight. Shame on you. our grandparents did not fight for an inalienable right for civil trials to take place. Criminal trials, equal rights, sure. civil matters, no. They did not fight and die so that future generations can have their day in court to decide a contract dispute. As I mentioned above, I don't believe in forced arbitration in contracts but to say that's what our grandparents fought for diminishes the sacrifices they did make.
