No chance. cars are much easier to repossess and the cost of doing so is less. People aren't quite as leveraged on autos as they were on homes. Even with a worst case scenario 7 year loan people are usually in par within 3-4 years, in that timeframe on a 30 year mortgage you've barely started paying the interest down. Even at the height of the housing crisis auto loan losses were manageable. when people were losing their homes at a record pace you'd think they would skip the car payments to make the mortgage. That wasn't the case, people generally kept paying their car notes even when the house was going away. Losing your car is actually much more troublesome to most people. they will make that payment over all others.
