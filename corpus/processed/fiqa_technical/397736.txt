So no physical evidence, got it. Drug testing catches other dopers, but Armstrong has a magical anti-test field that shields him and him alone? Thank you NASA! This is of course absurd. You must instead be suggesting that nobody is ever caught doping because none of the tests work, then. Wait, no, that doesn't seem to work either. A conundrum!
