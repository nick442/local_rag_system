My father was a career Army Officer and earned his Master's in management; one of the many things he taught me was that if you want respect, focus on how you make the employee feel about themselves rather than how they feel about you. From my own experience, you have to have faith in people, and demonstrate that by really truly giving them the power to make meaningful decisions. Ask more questions and listen more than you direct/give instruction. Chances are your employees know the problem better than you do.
