Can I ask what the step by step of what it takes to process transaction? I'm assuming the machine itself doesn't do much other than acting as an end point for the user, and that the actual processing happens at an off sitel end point. The ATM itself just opens the connection, sends the request to do what ever, and then acts based on the response received from the off site location?
