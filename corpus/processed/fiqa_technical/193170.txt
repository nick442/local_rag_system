Orlando has an awesome park, they have some of the best rides of all the theme parks. It's a combination of a zoo/aquarium and theme park. My family goes 2-3 times a year. If you have something against zoo's/aquariums thats okay but if you're basing your entire judgement off a movie that was made for one purpose than just remember nothing is as easy as it looks and companies always cut corners.
