"Amazon already has their ""answer to slack"" in [Amazon Chime](https://chime.aws/) but its not nearly as polished or feature rich. Teams is better than Chime but far worse than slack, as well. On the one hand, you're absolutely right that slack is just fancy irc. On there other, your dead wrong about even the likes of MS or AZ being able to clone it in months, maybe years, let alone weeks. That also ignores all of the integrations that already exist for slack. I'm sure some of the OSS versions are decent but I haven't had the opportunity to use them much, yet."
