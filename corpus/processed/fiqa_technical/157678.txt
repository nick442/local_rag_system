"Hm, I took it as ""Ingratiate yourself, build up a history, then when no one's suspecting STRIKE with your marketing/advertising posts."" It's actually not bad advice and I'm sure many here do it. I'm not a fan of it being done for profit, it's just going to lead lower quality comments and posts. I think they could have replaced the infographic with ""Understand How Memes Work"" and achieved the same result."
