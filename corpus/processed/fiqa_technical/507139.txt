He wouldn't have to have his feet at risk if he bought an extra pair. I like Asolos. I buy a pair, break them in, and set them off to the side. I bought another pair, did the same thing, and wear them periodically to keep the soles flexible. It's worth it to me to have spares in case a pair needs to go to the shop.
