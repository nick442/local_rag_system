In both theory and practice the tax results in reduced consumption. Check out the stats from when NY did it. Also check out how cigarette tax worked on smoking statistics. I'm on mobile means no source links for now, should be googleable though. Some people will drive out of their way to save a little. Most people won't. Opinion part: In a society where health care is indirectly subsidied by everyone (higher hospital bills to cover uninsured), it makes sense to me to insentivise healthier eating habits. I'd prefer they take away the corn subsidies keeping corn sugar prices so low. Seems a bit roundabout to subsidise then tax.
