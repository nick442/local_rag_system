"I feel for your situation. I'm in a similar boat with ""high"" income yet little left over at the end of the month. My wife and I are steadily making major adjustments to fix that. While reading your story, one thing that jumped out at me is that 3.5 years is not really a long time. So, the moment those credit cards are paid off (and other debts for that matter), DO NOT let that $1,400 return into your finances! Tuck it away someplace else and forget about it, as if it doesn't exist. You're already in the habit of doing without. Keep the habit. Save the money. From the first day that my wife recently took a new job, we put 25% of her paycheck into a checking account that's hard to access. It goes right in, direct deposit, and we never even see it. To this day, we don't even know the exact dollar amount going in.. ..the crazy part is, we don't miss it as much as I thought we would! In fact, I just got a raise and I'm going to start forwarding the pay difference into that account, as well. At the end of the day, we all make our spending choices based on how much money is available. It never fails: with more income comes more ""worthwhile"" expenses. My advice in a nutshell: Over the next few years, whenever your income increases, don't change your habits to match! That's our plan. Slowly but surely, it's working.. (I Hope that helps in some way)"
