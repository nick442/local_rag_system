There are jobs for all those people - especially with lower corporate income tax. If your addicted to drugs or alcohol - you must take responsibility for your actions and not expect someone who didn't get addicted to bail you out - that only encourages addiction. There are plenty of jobs and it's very simple to apply - just walk up to someone and say I would like to do that job. No excuses.
