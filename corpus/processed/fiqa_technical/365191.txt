This has been made clearly many times in this thread and others, and by myself. I refuse to go around in circles so I will not repeat myself after this: long term investors need to be able to liquidate their assets. Since long term investors by definition trade infrequently, short term speculators are NECESSARY to perform this function. Your argument at times has been that you don't need ULTRA short term speculators, and mine is that the ULTRA sort term speculators have not been shown to do anything negative to long term investors so banning them is reactionary. Short term speculators DO make money out of long term investors and that is by design - they are the very reason markets exist; otherwise people would stick to direct investment!
