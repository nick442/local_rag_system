In Canada this will have next to or very little impact. Whole Foods is generally more expensive than the major grocery retailers in Canada. Walmart in Canada competes mainly with [Sobeys] (http://www.sobeys.com/), [Loblaws](https://www.loblaws.ca/), [Metro](https://www.metro.ca/). we have some Whole Foods stores but not enough to compete against the larger retail chains. We also have the generic brand grocery retailers that are a subdivision of the larger more expensive chains like the ones mentioned above. * [NoFrills](https://www.nofrills.ca/) * [Freshco](http://freshco.com/) * [Food Basics](https://www.foodbasics.ca/flyer.en.html) * [Price Chopper](http://ontario.pricechopper.ca/) Maybe in terms of services that charge for home grocery delivery this might have a larger impact. * [Grocery Gateway](https://www.grocerygateway.com/) * [Longo's](http://www.longos.com/)
