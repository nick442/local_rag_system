"Sue the friend. When you win, garnish his wages. It does not have to be by so much that it makes him quit his job, but get 75.00 per pay period to come to you. This may require the use of a private investigator but, if you want to make this ""friend"" face consequences, this is your only option. Otherwise, let it go and keep paying his bill."
