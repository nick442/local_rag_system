Moving from the Taxi monopoly to the Uber monopoly.. Uber has raised their prices in my city over 10 times in the last year. It's now more economically feasible (even during non-surge times) to call a cab. Hell, the taxi waits have even been less. I don't know. Call me old fashion but I'd rather use a company that is regulated by the state in terms of pricing and safety standards rather than a company that blatantly disregards the law. Fuck, I got into an Uber last week and my driver was an acquaintance from highschool. He is a two time drug/armed felon.. and Uber says they do background checks LOL
