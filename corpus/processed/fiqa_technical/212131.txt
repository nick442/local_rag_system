Summarized article: Recent mishaps causing supply disruptions at 14 California refineries caused wholesale gas prices to reach an all-time high of $4.39 per gallon. Local gas stations increased prices to 30 cents or more per gallon overnight, with some stations charging as much as $5.79 per gallon. Some stations chose not to buy high-priced wholesale gas for fear they wouldn't be able to sell it. While others shut off their pumps after they ran out of the gas they bought at lower wholesale prices. Some of the refinery mishaps include an oil pipeline problem, a power outage at Exxon Mobil Corp's Torrance refinery and a shutdown of the crude distillation unit at Chevron Corp's Richmond refinery. It is unknown when wholesale prices will come down but one solution may be to allow refineries to switch over from the summer blend to the cheaper winter blend earlier than planned. The California Energy Commission is considering the idea but notes an early switch over could impact air quality. The summer blend reduces evaporation of pollutants during warm weather which would be less damaging to air quality in California's current heat wave. * For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit
