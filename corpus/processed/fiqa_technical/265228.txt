"Discussed? The article is an amateur-ish ""discussion"" littered with swears, rampant bolding and Godwin law-esque Iran comparisons. What is his counter-proposal? What is the specific language that he takes issue with? I just read a thousand words of ""this is total bullshit and I'm so emotional right now."" Does he realize that these proposals always start from a strong regulatory stance and drift towards the more reasonable after calling for comments and iterating? It doesn't seem like it."
