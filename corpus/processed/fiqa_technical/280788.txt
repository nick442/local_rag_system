"Are you working for a company that offers a Dependent Care Account? You may be able to withhold up to $5000/yr pre tax for care for you child. If you cover more than half her expenses, she is your dependent. You can't ""double dip."" If she is your dependent, she cannot be the care provider for purposes of the DCAS, see Pub 503 top of p7 ""Payments to Relatives or Dependents."" How do you think a business would change your situation? The DCA is a small tax break, if you have no business now, this break isn't something that should drive this."
