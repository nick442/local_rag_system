This isn't what I found in my travels in India. I visited several textile factories and while standards could have been improved for the men and women working there, it wasn't any more or less degrading than something like orange picking here in the US. And not a child was in sight. Instead, child labor has gone underground. The family I stayed with has a live-in servant girl that they pay 2000 rupees a month ($40 USD).
