"Yes, but the rates at which they're borrowing make all the difference. Japan's central bank is borrowing at about 2 percent on a 30 year bond, and Greece is borrowing at 18 percent. Japan would thus be paying 4.6% of GDP on debt service for government borrowing, while Greece would thus be paying 27% (assuming that all current bonds could be converted to current rates). [Japan](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/japan/), [Greece](http://www.ecb.int/stats/money/long/html/index.en.html). Further, as many other commenters have noted, Japan retains the ability to print money and thus inflate their debt away, while Greece relies on the European Central Bank, which would not hyperinflate the entire Eurozone to help out Greece's government. As a comparison, the US is currently paying 1.3% of its GDP on government debt service. (My calculations are amateur. Please correct me if I'm wrong.) As [Dean Baker notes](http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/cepr-blog/the-devasting-interest-burden-of-the-debt): ""It is important to remember that most of the people in Washington debates on economic policy do not know much economics. They tend not to be very good at arithmetic either. That is why they were blindsided by the collapse of the $8 trillion housing bubble that wrecked the economy. As we get endless pontification about the crushing debt burden it is worth touching base with reality on occasion. In that spirit, CEPR brings you the latest data and projections on the ratio of the federal government's interest payments to GDP, courtesy of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). [T]he interest to GDP ratio is currently at a crushing 1.3 percent, near the post World War II low. However this figure overstates the burden somewhat. Last year the Federal Reserve Board refunded almost $80 billion to the Treasury. This was interest earned on government bonds and other assets it now holds. That leaves a net interest burden of 0.8 percent of GDP, by far the lowest of the post World War II era."" **TL;DR**: what matters is not total size of debt alone, but also borrowing costs and ability to inflate the debt away. Japan is paying very little on its large debt; Greece is paying a lot. **TL;DR TL;DR**: I'd like to borrow a few trillion dollars at 2%, too."
