I might be reading this wrong, but it looks like the cartoon is saying that 4/5 of the USA's population are going to old/retired who are not contributing to the economy. I'm no demographics expert, but I think in 2020 we'll look a lot more like the 1990 pane than the 2020 pane. Hell I think in 1970 we looked a lot more like the 1990 pane than the 1970 pane.
