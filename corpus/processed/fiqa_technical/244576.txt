Wow, that was certainly a change in tone for the worse. So much for civil discourse. >>The multistep law went into effect in April 2015, when the city’s minimum wage became $10 or $11, depending on business size, tips and benefits. Another hike occurred on Jan. 1, 2016. By 2021, the minimum will be $15 per hour for all workers. Minimum wage in Seattle isn't $15/hr, which is a direct contradiction to the article's headline. Furthermore: >>**Much of that success, though, can be attributed to trends separate from the minimum-wage law itself**, such as the growth of Seattle’s tech sector and its construction boom, according to a new report that University of Washington researchers presented to the City Council on Monday. >>“Seattle’s experience shows that the city’s low-wage workers did relatively well after the minimum wage increased, **but largely because of the strong regional economy,”** Seattle doesn't need minimum wage, it just needs to keep growing it's economy (which doesn't happen when you arbitrarily shut down successful businesses).
