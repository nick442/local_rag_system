According to the link you provided, these inflation numbers are the year-over-year inflation amounts for a given month. For example the February number of 7% means from February 2015 to February 2016 the annual inflation rate was 7%. It's difficult to nail down the impact of inflation at a micro level from month to month. You need to understand what's in the basket of goods. As an example, the price of a widget won't move from $1 to $1.04 in one month because of a 4% inflation rate. But considering the incremental price changes of a large number of consumer items over a long time period you can get to an inflation rate. The price of an apple might not have changed but maybe the price of aspirin did.
