>Executives commonly get good payouts from these things. First, when companies are in some of bankruptcy or financial distress, they are forced to pay more to retain certain personnel due to the nature of the situation. If the executives left, then nobody would be willing to come in and wind up the assets of the company. It would end up costing even *more* money in the long run because you won't get talented people and you will have to bring in people with little to no knowledge of your company or your industry. Second, bankruptcy law provides very clear guidelines for the priority of different creditors. And this is tied into the incentives that we want to encourage. If secured creditors did not get priority, then they would never lend and we would not have economic growth. The reason equity shareholders are last in priority is because they took on the risk of owning the company.
