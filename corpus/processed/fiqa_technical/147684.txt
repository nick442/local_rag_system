"You're right to be a bit ""afraid"" (for lack of a better term). It's a guarantee that some crooked people will try to screw you, and running a business in virtually any industry is getting more and more competitive everyday. But, if you're savvy enough to call people out on their B.S. and willing to compete, you can succeed with a solid business model. The two main reasons people don't try and start a small business of their own all the time are 1) because they're too lazy or don't have the drive and 2) don't have the start up capital. Believe me, I've met some fellow successful business owners that couldn't pass a freshman undergrad level business law course. Don't get me wrong, there is always risk involved with a new venture. But, if you're committed to learning how to streamline your service and operations, then market it effectively, you'd probably be okay. The legal side of things will really play an extremely (likely negligible) small part in your day-to-day life once you've gotten them ironed out initially."
