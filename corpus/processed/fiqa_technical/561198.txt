Thats because for some odd reason we refuse to train people to be effective. meetings can be good things that accomplish what they need to do but no one knows how to lead one so it just falls apart, drags on and doesn't work. you only get the people together that need to talk to each other and you only talk about stuff that the entirety of that group need to talk about. You can hammer these things out in 3 15 minute sessions with different sub groups instead of wasting 90 minutes of everyones time.
