Actually making money as an uber driver is pretty difficult, doing it over the long term can cost more than you realize because of vehicle maintenance and gas. Very, very few uber or lyft drivers ive met have been doing it for 2+ years. Only one ive met has been doing it from the beginning. In the beginning, it was a much better deal for drivers. Rates were much better. They have steadily declined to the point where it is noelw challenging to actually come out ahead in the long run. I think thats what they were saying at least.
