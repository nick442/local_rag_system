I work in structuring. We literally have calls with counsel on these very types of fucking issues. I've dealt with the topic in structures for both US and Cayman (english) law. And you realize the AG of any given district isn't a specialist in every field of law right? He could very well have a specialty in criminal or anti-racketeering.
