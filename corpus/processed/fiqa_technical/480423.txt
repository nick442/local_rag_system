"The backdoor Roth IRA contribution has been possible for a few years now and is fairly widely known. The IRS hasn't said anything negative about it. An answer to my question here mentions that it could hypothetically be disallowed through the ""step transaction doctrine"", although that is the only time I have heard that possibility raised. For some background, the income limit on Roth conversions was removed as a ""revenue-offsetting provision"" of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. They want people who have deducted contributions in Traditional IRAs to convert to Roth and pay taxes now rather than waiting many years until retirement. Conversely, people performing the backdoor Roth IRA contribution have already paid taxes on that money and it's just preventing them from having to pay taxes many years later. It's easy to see how Congress would find this a satisfactory exchange."
