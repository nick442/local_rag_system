This is sad, not just for Nokia but for Finland as a whole. The shares used to be a synonym for a Finnish tech stock tracker fund as they not only employed lots of Finns, but also used a lot of subcontractors. They can't all make Angry Birds.. With Elop there like the proverbial dead albatross around the neck of the Ancient Mariner, they must remain with Microsoft, however they must stop Microsoft from killing their platform. Microsoft's behaviour is unacceptable. Nokia's hardware reputation remains good. Their dumb phones retain a market share with those who are challenged for access to recharge facilities and don't want to spend $500. Perhaps they can leverage their far-eastern manufacturing capabilities for not quite so dumb phones (they must climb the value chain a bit), but retaining the excellent battery life. Even in the west, there is a ready market for second phones that you really can use outdoors. I love my Galaxy Nexus, but it is hard to use in bright sunlight, water messes up touch sensitivity and so on. I still have my old E71 for use on the go. Far from weatherproof, but you get the general idea.
