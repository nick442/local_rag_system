I was wondering if someone could recommend a textbook I'm taking a course right now in foundations of finance and we're dealing with subjects such as utility functions, risk aversion, prudence, temperance, Arrow-Debreau securities, portfolio theory, and more I'm finding the textbook we're using (Intermediate Finance, Danthine & Donaldson) a bit hard to understand
