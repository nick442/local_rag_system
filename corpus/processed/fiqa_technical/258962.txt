I think this question is best answered by simply spending 40-60 minutes looking over the tax documents from last year and tracing thru the calculations. As much as we might like to do so, we can't treat taxes like a black box. Tax law is much more complicated than it should be, but its much easier to understand taxes after you've filed them than before or during.. at least you have solid numbers to look at.
