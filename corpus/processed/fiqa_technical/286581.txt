It really wouldn't have been hard to do. Microsoft was approaching mobile developers throwing money at them to develop on their platform. Imagine a world where instead they chose to compete. Come in at a 15% rake instead of a 30% rake android and iOS were on. Instead they too got in with a 30% rake on revenues. The store was a joke too. There was two we had to code for. Two different windows stores with two different apis. It wasn't worth it at all.
