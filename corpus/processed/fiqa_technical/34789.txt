"New Deal type solutions, living wages, and other things with a socialism streak. It's unattractive for people who have been used to the American way, but the alternative is an ever expanding non-working/low-wage class. Many people do not cut it for service and post-college, or college level jobs, many people are best suited for trade work. As more jobs become automated, and more blue collar work gets pushed overseas, and as our economy turns to service/high education work, more and more people will be left behind. Either these people are put to work by corporations by lowering their ridiculous standards for once, or the government steps in and does it for them by putting them to work in pubic projects or service, and for those that can't be placed, a living wage, otherwise they will be poor and desperate, having those people around isn't pretty for a society. I'm not just making this up, people have been predicting this situation for a better part of a century, even the [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204468004577164710231081398.html) is seeing it. The rise of Consumerism pushed it off a bit, but Globalization and increasing technology has taken the edge off of it. People need to realize that this is a problem, and they need to stop being so arrogant and ignorant about the reality of socioeconomics, otherwise it will bite them in the ass. Is the solution perfect? Nope, but I haven't heard a better one that doesn't have ""Maybes"" attached to it, or assume people will just do things out of their good nature."
