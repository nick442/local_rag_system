>You are being extremely aggressive and I don't understand why, I've been pretty level headed. Sorry, this topic is probably my biggest pet peeve in US tax policy, and I have a strong distaste for our government's tax treatment, greed and arrogance. >If our rate is the highest, but we still collect less than the average, tell me how these large corporations are being effectively taxed at the highest rate in the developed world? What am I missing? Okay, let's take two companies with equal profits. One company is an MLP and pays zero corporate taxes, one company pays 40% taxes on profits. The average effective tax rate will be 20%, and one company will end up paying around the highest rate in the world. I will post my source again. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html Anyway, I think we should be doing our best to incentivize corporate formation by lowering corporate taxes to zero and moving the incidence of taxation directly to capital.
