"It's significant. I look at the VIX Index. The VIX futures. etc. Usually stock market scares from financial worries (the economy, liquidity freezes, European country defaults etc) tend to last a bit longer, and non-financial worries (plane crashes, military skirmishes) tend to last a few days - then back to biz as usual. My feeling is that the S&P500 will continue to grind higher as long as the US economy remains on life support (US fed injections), and you will see these periodic -5% S&P500 mini-scares (which are buying opportunities) but the overall trend will remain intact (from the ""lower left to the upper right"" as that goof Dennis Gartman says). Once the US Fed stops the bond purchase program - it's anybody's guess. I also think we're in a tech stock bubble again but that's another topic."
