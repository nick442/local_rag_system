If Amazon perfects same day delivery you can bet your bottom dollar that many other businesses will do so shortly thereafter. Amazon is obviously a very formidable operation, but right now the investment community is treating Bezos like his shit doesn't stink. Retail has *always* been a brutal economic sector in which dominant players do not last long, so let's not treat the Amazon phenomenon as if it's sui generis. It wasn't Amazon that cracked the A&P Company. Incidentally I am growing increasingly impressed with Wal-Mart's online moves. It's unusual for a dominant corporation to adjust like this to a new competitive threat in a non-traditional sector.
