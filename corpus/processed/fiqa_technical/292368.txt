several obvious result: 1. nobody takes US treaty and agreement seriously. It is assumed everything will become political football during election, and any elected clowns will change anything and everything. 2. No smart company will invest mega project with long and initial low return. Semiconductor fab, complex supply chain, base metal and chemicals, shipyard, etc. By default US is now isolated from global supply chain. All complex industry will be outside US. There is no price and political stability. 3. the tally, US is isolated from global supply chain, energy chain, electronics fab and manufacturing, shipping, And most of newer free trade zone. There is no way US can keep maintaining global competitiveness that much longer. US based product price will be completely out of world's market. . Here is one example: Bill calls for U.S.-flag ships for 30% of LNG, crude exports http://www.marinelog.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=25279:bill-calls-for-us-flag-ships-for-30-of-us-lng-crude-exports&Itemid=231 In order for that to happen: a) one has to have competitive shipyard, otherwise the ship will be too expensive. b)somebody has to finance that multi billion dollar projects. c) there has to be steady supply and buyer, long term contract and treaties. US has no steady LNG port and no long term buyers. It is at war/bickering with all major LNG buyers. who is going to buy that kind of deal or who is going to be the global salesman? Trump? yeah sure.. He will just piss off everybody by second sentence.
