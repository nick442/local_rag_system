"It's a form of market manipulation. It makes it look like there is high trading volume, which gets attention from speculators and technical traders who see a ton of volume and think that there is some kind of news announcement or something. People start buying it so they don't miss out on whatever it is that ""everyone else"" is doing, and the price goes up."
