"Your mortgage will not allow you to rent out the whole property - they would want you on a buy-to-let mortgage (which will have worse APR than a standard) - buy to let mortgage also invalidates help to buy schemes. The help to buy scheme does not allow you to sublet. I.e. you cannot have tenants. However, you can have a lodger. My understanding is that they are different. In the UK, you can make up to Â£7500 tax free from a lodger under the ""rent a room relief"" and as this isn't a tenant - this should be ok with both help to buy and the mortgage provider. However I would recommend double checking with your mortgage provider - as if you break any terms and conditions, it could lead to invalidating your mortgage. Another thing to consider with lodgers (or tenants) - it generally makes insurance a LOT more expensive and wont cover you if the lodger steals your stuff or damages the property and this will include lodgers friends if they visit - so just something to bear in mind."
