Nice work! I would not propose anything related to revenue growth, as it will be difficult to tell where that growth came from. If you want a performance aspect you could tie a bonus to particular KPI's that you both agree to. It could be a website done by a certain time along with a certain amount of likes/shares on facebook and instagram followers. Yelp and Google Reviews would probably also be a good place to add value. I would think an insta account would be a no brainer with a tap house, so much easy stuff to photo. Just my 2 cents, if I'm the owner I want this to be easy, so I'd go for base pay and a bonus.
