I have always thought that most of the time spent in a class was a waste. I also do not think that school prepares people for the harsh realities of a full time job. Also I was not prepared by school to make money, manage money, or survive life better than someone who didnâ€™t go to college. I am a pharmacist, I have an MBA and a PhD.
