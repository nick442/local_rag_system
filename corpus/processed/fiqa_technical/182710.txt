From March 26th to May 3rd FACE had an average trade volume of 11,657 shares. May 4th Bloomberg published its widely reported [article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-03/zuckerberg-s-facebook-ipo-will-make-him-richer-than-ballmer.html) about how the upcoming Facebook IPO would make Zuckerberg one of the richest people in the world. On May 4th, 212,000 shares of FACE were traded (an 18x increase) and the price jumped from 3.10 to 3.79, up 22%. Maybe it's not that surprising, considering even news articles in [Yahoo! Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-underwriters-1-1-percent-010320322.html) can't keep the companies straight. Still, if you accidentally bought FACE it's not all that bad. In fact, [you're doing much better](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=FB+Interactive#symbol=fb;range=20120518,20120601;compare=face;). Yes, FACE's 10-Q came out the previous day, but past 10-Q releases didn't result in any sudden increase in trading volume at all: [11/3/2011](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=FACE+Interactive#symbol=face;range=20111018,20111111;), [8/4/2011](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=FACE+Interactive#symbol=face;range=20110718,20110811;), [5/5/2011](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=FACE+Interactive#symbol=face;range=20110418,20110511;)
