Smartass! :) In my younger days, after leaving college and the area where I grew up, I taught myself 2 different careers while working and supporting myself. I see lots of people partying and playing while working at some unskilled job, and I just know they'll probably be complaining when the get older about how they can't find a job because they're too old to do that work now. Anyway, I've gone far enough in the world - if I go any further, I'll drown (I moved from the east coast to the SF Bay Area). :)
