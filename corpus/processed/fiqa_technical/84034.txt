In the terms of profit, you're most likely not going to make any. The other posters had good suggestions about donating and I say the same. The fact that you had no business insurance leads me to believe that you may just have an expensive hobby and not an actual business. Talk to your accountant/tax preparer and see what and how much loss can be deducted, although that doesn't help in the present. This is a hard lesson to learn but I hope it sticks. **Always** have business insurance, especially in an area such as yours where hurricanes are relatively normal. It's absurdly foolish and unacceptable not to have insurance. I hope all works out.
