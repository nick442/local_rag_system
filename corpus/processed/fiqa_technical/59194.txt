If what you're selling and marketing is meaningful conversation, then why focus on your appearance? I accept than a woman is going to want the person they're conversing with the look nice, but what is it they're paying for? Why do you think a woman would want to talk with you? Are those reasons good enough to justify paying your for it? Are you providing something that is unique, or that is better than what the woman can get for free elsewhere? I think you need to figure these things out and have a way to convey them in words, then you'll have something to market.
