Summarized article: In an effort to increase funding to cover expenses, some states are considering selling sponsorship rights for highway rest areas.

Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and Virginia are currently seeking bids from private companies. Ohio is also considering selling sponsorship rights for bridges.
