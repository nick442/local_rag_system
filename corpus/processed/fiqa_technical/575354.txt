The worst part of government induced tuition inflation wasn't even the GI Bill. Although I'm sure that started it a bit. It really took off in the late 1970s / 1980 with the establishment of the Department of Education and the Sallie Mae loan clearing house. There's a massive inflection point in historical inflation adjusted tuition prices right around 1980, when those were established. No coincidence. Also, you know whats worse than the **government** getting in the housing-price-inflation business? The freaking **central bank** getting in on the housing-price-inflation business. https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/quarterly-balance-sheet-developments-report.htm https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/quarterly_balance_sheet_developments_report_201708.pdf The federal reserve holds $4.4 T in total assets. That is the sole source of the entire money supply of the United States Dollar. It does not come from anywhere else. Of course, you get money velocity and money multipliers after that, but this is the origin. Of that $4.4 T, they hold $2.4 T in US Treasury securities. Ok, that's fine. That's the whole point of the federal reserve. They control the money supply through buying / selling (letting mature / redeem) US government securities. But wait, hold up, what the heck happened to the other $2.0 T in assets .. um, where did those go? There are some other assets, but the next largest .. the federal reserve owns $1.7 T in mortgage backed securities. Holy .. effing .. sheeeeeeeet. What in the actual f*** is the central bank doing buying mortgage backed securities? That absolutely, positively, is **NOT** monetary policy. That shit is fiscal policy, which the federal reserved is **NOT** supposed to be engaging in. And now you know why housing prices are even more effed up than tuition prices.
