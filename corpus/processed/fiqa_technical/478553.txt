The problem is the rich and powerful will harness whatever mechanisms you put in place. If we're just supposed to handle all our problems through the court system instead of government you still win up with the rich wielding most of the power by way of their money. The rich and powerful stay powerful now because they've already amassed most of the planets wealth in a relative handful of people. You can remove all the regulations you want and that won't significantly change the general distribution of wealth. You're simply further entrenching their wealth by removing what scant leverage the common man still has against the 1%.
