Why does total debt matter? What really matters is debt service. What is the percentage of GDP that is used for debt service? If you borrow money at 2% versus 18% it makes a **HUGE** difference in how much you pay back. In fact, Japan's debt goes down each year that inflation is greater than 2% (in purchasing power).
