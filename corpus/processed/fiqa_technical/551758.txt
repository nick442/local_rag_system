http://www.catalyst.org/publication/271/women-ceos-of-the-fortune-1000 There are only 40 women CEO's out of the top 1000 companies. Looks like Virginia Rometty is viewed as a star at IBM. And you have Ursula Burns of Xerox. (Those are considered tech right?) Ursula Burns is kind of completely amazing actually. But there aren't a lot of high profile female CEO's because there aren't a lot of female CEO's period. You can look over the list for the tech ones. Also high profile is usually linked with something sexy and interesting to the public. I don't know many male CEOs. Apple, Amazon. That's about it. I don't even know who's in charge of google.
