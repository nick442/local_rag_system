"Right. I think, especially in a professional field, there are ways to exploit your skills to benefit your resume while under unemployment. The big argument with unemployment is that there is a negative connotation around it. ""Why couldn't get get a job in the n months you were unemployed?"" Look busy and just explain that you've been keeping your skillset relevant by participating in non-profits, doing stuff for other local businesses (if applicable) and so on. Creativity definitely helps."
