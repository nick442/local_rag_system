I wonder if Disney will blow this by keeping their movies in a kind of weird release rotation so that you can't just watch all of the classics at once and not having the TV content that people want. Seems like a high probability of them filling it up with “Original movies, TV shows, [and] short-form content” made especially for the service, the straight to video sequels to movies, and their very latest DVD releases for a very limited time (as the only things that anyone actually wants).
