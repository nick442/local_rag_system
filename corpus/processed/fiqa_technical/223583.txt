It is unfortunate to think that people determine as a result of paying a living wage they need to illegally undercut their employees. If your business model cannot succeed by paying living wages then you need to rethink your business model. $12/hour is not luxury. That is still close to poverty for a family of 3. Take home would not afford an apartment, gas, food, utilities, etc for a single person without having roommates. People deserve to afford their basic needs without getting government assistance when working full time.
