I guess it was a bit of a generalisation, I can see in businesses where contacts are important an MBA would be incredibly useful, I'm in online retail (fairly cheap items) and haven't particularly needed contacts, where-as a service industry could highly benefit from the people they met on the course. I think my problem is more to do with the majority of people who do an MBA, or even maybe just the people I've met. I take your point, because I taught myself to be a better manager, good at customer service, finance etc. and it was a hell of a lot of work, and I'm sure I still have a lot to learn.
