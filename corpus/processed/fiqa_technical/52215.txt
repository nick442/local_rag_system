It's good to see I'm not alone in this. I'm not a lazy person, I'm willing to bust my ass to earn a living but no employer seems to want to pay a fair wage. I was working a 9-5 unloading trucks in a warehouse which was practically constant work with a 15 minute break for 8.95 an hour. Switched to a 10pm-6am job unloading for Kohls for 9.50, supervisor couldn't understand why she was losing workers so fast. Decided Id rather be broke then put my body through that and not even make rent
