I have never worked at Wal-Mart. Additionally, the employees under me loved working for me. Nights when I would close, when I came in, workers would ask if I was the only once closing and be very happy when I was. I never received a single complaint and once I left, many of them have since contacted me to hang out in off work hours. I treated them all with respect. As far as the pay itself, I worked for a major corporation so at the store level, you don't have much say in what was a very structured pay-raise scale. You can treat people with respect while also demanding that they do a good job. In fact, I think workers don't respect those bosses that allow shitty work. I know I don't.
