I mainly use Ebates to get cash back when shopping online. I wrote a little review here: http://www.savewithdan.ca/websites-use-ebates-ca A super useful app is the one called Flipp (it's not a website, it's an app, but I think it counts as a valid answer, right?) You can compare prices from several stores and their fliers.
