You're going to have to guess where your income will fall once you retire. If it's low enough, then a 401(k) or traditional IRA (where the taxes are deferred until retirement) would be the smarter choice. If your projected income is higher (usually the case for people in their 20s or people with larger amounts invested), then the ROTH makes sense because of the tax free growth.
