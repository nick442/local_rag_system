This one is pretty interesting in light of this OP's article (bold emphasis mine): >“Mediocre company” Former Employee in Park City, UT – **Reviewed Sep 1, 2010** >Pros – Convenient location, employee covered parking, ski passes (sometimes), competitive pay. >Cons – Corporate Management has no idea what's happening on the local level. **Owner of company sends emails to all employees with his political views, including who you should vote for during election season.** Health insurance premium is more expensive than I have ever paid elsewhere. >**Advice to Senior Management – Keep your political opinions to yourself.** Trust your local GM's and managers.
