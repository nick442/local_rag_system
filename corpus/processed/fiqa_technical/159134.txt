Explain that you are looking for work that is more fast paced than what you are currently doing. You are obviously very smart and probably good with people as you are on a leadership type career path. If you find you don't have the network to talk to people in the industry, or are concerned about your lack of financial background, you may want to look at the CFA. Although not really quantitative, it would show your commitment to the investment profession, and you could join your local CFA Chapter.
