I wouldn't doubt they're real eggs, but them and dunkin donuts, they're frozen + who knows how many other storage / preservative processes they go through. Something about a reheated frozen egg in a perfect circle just doesn't cut it for me. The regular, fresh, non-frozen eggs cooked then and there for the first time off the grill taste less bland to me.
