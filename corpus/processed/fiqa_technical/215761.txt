"Well, the article does go into certain tax schemes. You can use the debt as a write-off to lower your tax rate. That's just a legal tax scheme in the UK and many other countries. The problem though is that the UK department of Starbucks is apparently very profitable: > US executives of the Seattle company claiming in telephone calls with investors [..] that the UK business was profitable. and > Howard Schultz, told investors the business here was so successful he planned to apply the lessons to the company's biggest market in the US. It's just that the books tell a different story: > Accounts filed with Companies House [..] showed a 10th consecutive annual loss. So no, it's not a just a matter of revenue vs sales. It's a matter of boosting your losses with outside, sometimes artificial debt, just so you can run with a negative on the books. This lowers the tax rate on the true sales to a whopping 0.3%, even though the business is perfectly healthy. That's misusing a tax scheme aimed at easing the tax burden on ""national"" businesses which aren't profitable."
