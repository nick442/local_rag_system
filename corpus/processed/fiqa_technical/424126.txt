>Insurance should be based on binary states, and healthy/unhealthy just isn't an actual set of binary states. Insurance is a financial risk mitigation product. Binary states are irrelevant. You buy insurance to make sure that if you have healthcare bills over some amount in a year, insurance kicks in. That's it! It's pure economics.
