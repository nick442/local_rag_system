I'm one that both pays the Obamacare tax and has two sisters that struggle through the costs of Obamacare, i would generally like to see it either changed or destroyed. However, I couldn't be more happy to see the Republican version fail. It was worse than Obamacare. At some point we either need to go to a compete single payer or have a total public insurance system, these mixed versions are a total disaster.
