Just look at equity purchases and follow the corporate bond money trail. 80% of all stock purchases were made by the same companies that issued the stock and they used bond money to do so. Everything is running off of near zero interest bond money. Everything. Notice how careful they are to use words like revenue instead of profit. We never ever hear about P/E ratios now. Meanwhile the financial news sites make up the craziest headlines to explain the constant upward momentum (Dow soars as Trump wipes properly for the first time this week). The scope of manipulation is beyond anything we can comprehend. Tech is one of the worst offenders. We have bubbles everywhere now and plenty of fake ZIRP dependent jobs to go with them.
