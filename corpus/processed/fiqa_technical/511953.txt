It is a simple case of breaking the wrong law. You can commit normal fraud all day long and the SEC won't life a finger. But even get within a hundred miles of a insider trading deal and they'll hit you like a ton of bricks. It is easy an easy case to prove, there is no question as to it being illegal (even the janitor is expected to take a class on it), and the SEC was specifically set up to stop it after the Great Depression. Really, it boggles my mind that anyone of that rank would think he can get away with it.
