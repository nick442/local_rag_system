"If Best Buy gets wiped out, that would suck. Sometimes I like the options of: * Being able to take-home today * Being able to look at products in the store I've made 2 recent electronics purchases. 1. I bought a notebook computer from Amazon. I have been shopping for a few months, looking at Amazon, and looking at computers in the stores. I was looking for a few specific things (where the power cord plugs in, if the Function keys were primary or secondary, etc.) that the Amazon ad didn't specify, so I went to various stores to see how they worked out. But, Amazon had the best price by about $40 (I have Prime), so I had to order through Amazon. I feel a tiny bit bad about that, because I theoretically ""used"" the merchandising of other stores to buy at Amazon. 2. I bought a sound bar for my TV at Best Buy. One day I decided I wanted to get a sound bar. It was something I had been thinking about for a long time, but bought on an impulse that day. It was nice to go into Best Buy and get to look at a whole bunch of options, and then just buy one and take it home. I never even checked to see if Amazon had the same item available. I like to think that if Best Buy *did* go out of business, that some other business idea would come along that would make it easy for me to see products in person and have the option for ""buy today""."
