Heh, I bought my 3ds from sears with discover cash back at 10%, so I got $25 back then when the price dropped I got a bonus 10% on the difference so $88 off I think? Anyway I totally took advantage of them as I was aware (honestly wouldn't consider it insider info since everyone knew) of a coming price drop. Otherwise sears is terrible, but I'm about to buy multiple appliances through them and having them do installs. So I guess I'm helping them float.
