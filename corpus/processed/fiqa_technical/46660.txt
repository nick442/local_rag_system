What does that even mean evidence Chinese on average have high IQ than whites? Is IQ a standard on skills based on experiences or the ability to fill out tests? What Chinese, in what region, in what period? The same goes for what whites? German Shepherds were breed differently than shih tzu's and were trained for different roles. If you trained Shih Tzus like Germans Shepards there intelligence would rise as well. Humans were not breed so using dogs as a analogy is false analogy.
