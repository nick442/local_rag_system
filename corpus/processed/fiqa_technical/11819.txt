"I call BS. Glass-Steagall was an important firewall preventing investment in securities that commercial banks have no business being in, even with 100% reserve. When required returns continuously increase due to shareholder expectations, it is only a matter of time before riskier and riskier positions are taken to meet these expectations. This is a risk that depositors (FDIC in reality) never knowingly signed up for. At some point it only takes one really bad derivatives trade to bring it all down. In the long run, decent interest rate spreads should be enough to keep commercial bankers happy. At the very least, some limitation on certain types of heavily levered trading should be established. I don't buy the idea that if you remove ""one extremely risky way to make money people will just find another."" That is true to an extent, but at least those people won't be doing it on Average Joe's dime."
