"This perhaps would be more proper as an edit to my previous comment. Nevertheless, I find the emotional content of your message telling and deserving of a standalone comment. When I analyze the actual information content of what you have had to offer in this exchange, I found nothing. Rather, I found ""you are stupid"" and ""you lack intelligence"". Perhaps a little, ""you are an idiot"". And this in response to a well-educated opinion: that the common misguided belief that this amorphous concept of ""luck"" gives lie to years of hard work, persistence and study. You, my friend, are the idiot. You're someone who lacks any substantive contribution and tries to influence thought through intimidation. You're the debate about how many angels fit on the head of a pin. You are the living embodiment of dogmatism, so rooted in ""truth"", that the true thinking man finds pathetic. But pardon me, I'm just trying to figure out how to tie my shoes."
