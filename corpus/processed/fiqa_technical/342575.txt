I'm doing my part. I never eat the calorie, salt, and fat loaded crap that chain restaurants offer. Would rather go buy fresh ingredients from the store and make a meal at home that actually tastes good and won't take years off my life. Buy a nice bottle liquor and make a few cocktails cocktail or a six pack of beer and I'm having a much better meal and experience for a fraction of the price at home.
