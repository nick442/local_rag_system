"You are obviously not listening at all. Where did I give the impression that I want politicians or the military or the ""security"" apparatus? Typical statist in one ear and out the other. You are so far off it isn't even funny. I would be opposed to anything forced on people by the government or voter's. I bet you still think there are only two sides to the debate. Shows how far out of the loop you really are. Head firmly in the clouds. Edit. I have looked at all the ""stuff"" you linked I bet you didn't bother at all to even listen to one of my sources. Because nothing matters except what you want and how you are going to force that on everyone around you. Little tyrant in the making. I bet you make a lot of wrong assumptions in your life."
