"> The other big difference between Gen X and the surrounding generations, in regards to retirement, is Social Security. The Baby Boomers will have Social Security for most of the rest of their lives; it's funded, and it won't be a problem. Millenials have mostly come of age knowing that's a joke. Gen X, on the other hand, grew up and worked at least part of their lives under the assumption that Social Security, while having problems, would at least provide some help. However, with the way the economy and government is going, it's very possible that won't be a guarantee without major adjustments (decreased payout, increased retirement age, etc), so they're going to be taking it there as well. Add in the fact that the [FICA taxation rates changed dramatically over a 3 decade time span](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/taxRates.html). Boomers, especially the *early* contingent, were able to earn money for decades at *relatively very low* (< 10%) FICA tax rates, and only faced the higher rates when many were already earning well above the ""cut off""; meanwhile most of GenX have effectively paid +14% on ALL of their earnings for their entire working lives, from the day they left high-school or college. *About the only ""benefit"" that GenX gets out of all of this, is that it is WE who will be able to write the ""epitaphs"" and the final history about the Boomer Generation (and it isn't going to be a ""love fest"").*"
