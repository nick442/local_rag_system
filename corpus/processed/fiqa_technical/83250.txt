It's telling how Taibbi uses numbers like $3.7 trillion (which is the size of the bond market) instead of the size of municipal bonds, which is where the fraud took place (even by Taibbi's own admission), a market totaling $800 billion over years 2007-2008. He consistently chooses numbers to make his stories seem much more egregious than reality. Reading the actual case PDFs shows a much smaller, less well orchestrated fraud than Taibbi's pablum.
