I'm on the other side! I was recently (just today) extended an informal offer from a team that's seeing some pretty big growth recently. I'm 6 months into my entry/mid level management position and I've been thinking about working in client-facing roles. The earning potential is greater, and I'm attracted by the prospect of being your own boss/reporting to your team instead of where I'm currently at, a cog in a giant corporate hierarchy. It's nice as I get to cruise sometimes when things are quiet, and I won't feel stuck in a neverending loop of prospecting and closing. Right now, I'm just a messenger - I figure a research position would be much the same.
