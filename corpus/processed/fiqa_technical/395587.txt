I think he means you aren't legally obligated to show the receipt. However, I'm not sure that store workers know the exact laws, and I don't know what your luck would be refusing to show them. My guess is refusing would get you in an awkward argument and managers would be called and it wouldn't be worth the hassle compared to just showing the receipt in the first place.
