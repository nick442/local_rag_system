Because the HFT bought them in response to the guy buying. The HFT was only able to get them faster because his server and internet connection were faster. That in combination with the fact that they intentionally just spray the exchange with a huge combination of buys. If they don't have anyone on the hook, they just cancel. So the HFT sends the exchange a bunch of buy orders. They know 99.9 won't match up with a guy who's looking to buy and cancel them. However, when they get a guy on the hook they let that one go through and don't cancel it. A traditional market maker doesn't do that. They let all the orders go through and charge a higher price when someone wants it. However, this is accepted as fair because they're providing volume. They're making sure that buyers and sellers will have an active market. So it's expect that they should be able to profit for having that convenience. When a HFT can cancel their orders at will they're not providing volume. It's not uncommon for a market maker to buy as many shares as possible and then force you to pay more for it. However, they give people the ability to buy or sell shares. HFT don't do this. They are fast enough to cancel buy orders unless they have a buyer on the hook. As a result they can be a market maker without any losses. That would be one thing, but they don't provide the market with liquidity. They just dump the shares as soon as they're done taking their haircut (tax).
