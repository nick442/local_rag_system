I have a hard time swallowing this opinion from somebody who actually thinks startups can or should get into a contract with anybody stipulating continuing employment. Nobody does that. If that was done, any VC worth their salt would insist that it be undone before they got involved. As for the rest of her article, I don't care for the venom but underneath theres a lot of stuff that's mostly true. VCs have a set of motivations that you have to understand to be successful with them. Those motivations are often at cross purposes with cofounders and almost certainly at cross purposes for general employees. The problems start when startup folks don't understand the motivations. Yes, you have to check your wallet and your fingers too whenever you deal with VCs but if you don't think that's the case with almost every deal you make, you are delusional.
