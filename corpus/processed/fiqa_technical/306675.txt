One of the guys that started Rovio got investment from his wealthy uncle's company. They surely want to sell some of their 60% ownership, but claim they will be sticking around. With Rovio's pitch to re-emerge as a film studio (or that was one idea I read and Angry Birds was a hit), I wonder if this valuation matches what other film studios would be valued or are they just riding the wave of ridiculous tech valuations.
