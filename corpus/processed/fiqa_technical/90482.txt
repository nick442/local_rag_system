"Money is all relative, for sure. People will pay more if they can afford more, that I get too. The small hiccup here is that you're talking about federal minimum wage, and the original idea was about Wal-Mart employees only. If Wal-Mart workers received 2 dollars more per hour, do you really think that would affect inflation? Also, doesn't importing from countries that pay their workers less have an impact? And, if the market is supposed to take care of minimum wages by itself by always offering a ""better"" choice for workers until it reaches the highest possible rate, wouldn't the same be for prices of goods, but in the opposite direction? And if these things were a functional reality instead of academic theories, wouldn't there be less of a wealth disparity in the US?"
