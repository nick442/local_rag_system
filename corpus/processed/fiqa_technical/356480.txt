"Past work, while certainly an important component, is not a *necessary* component. As otherwiseyep stated before, it is credibility that is important. A farmer can promise a million bushels, and yes, it certainly could be fantasy; but his ""fantastical"" promise nevertheless has value if the other parties involved believes his promise. Actual production has little relevance when it comes to worth, at least until someone actually tries to collect on said promises. This would create problems in a small, closed world, where the breaking of a promise would have huge ramifications on the economy as a whole; but, in the real world, broken promises are countered by the their naturally occurring opposite: under-valued promises. The upset of this balance is, in fact, the essence of every financial crisis/boom. The vastness of the world economy means that money can never be truly representative of actual production. Regarding the complaints about the high cost of higher education; the complaints are that the price of a degree is not indicative of its true worth. The widespread availability of a college education is one of the main factors as to why people believe college educations are too expensive. If there was an actually perceived limited supply of seats at schools, as you suggest, then the general public would value the seats more, and maybe wouldn't complain about the costs as much."
