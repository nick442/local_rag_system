People need to start going to prison for this. That's the only way I'll go back to the market. Earlier this year, I dumped all my securities and rolled it into real property. I don't care if its value fluctuates. It's tangible and has actual use. The market is just a bunch of numbers, dripping with fraud, lies and bullshit.
