What the heck is a CBV? I've worked in finance (in an investment decisionmaking capacity) for over ten years, and I've never heard of it. But that's just me. Either way, you're a degree and four years short of earning a CFA, so no reason to worry too much about it right now. Securing a position in finance where you'll have investment decisiomaking responsibility should be your #1 focus right now if you want to earn that designation.
