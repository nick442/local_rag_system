That's exactly what happened to me except on Fiverr. I had months of activity and hundreds of 5-star reviews. I had real clients. Repeat buyers. Real business relationships. Then one day they deleted both of my accounts (I had one for buying and one for selling). Apparently, buried somewhere in their terms of service, users aren't allowed to have more than one account. I didn't even try to hide it- my usernames were nerdi and nerdi2. They even made me wait months and submit I.D. just to be able to log in and withdrawal my earnings. So much for that.
