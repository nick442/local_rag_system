But the free market opted to use ssn because it was easier and available and only required 1 field versus I'd and state. Those state IDs also have variable lenghts, some have letters and others don't. If you've ever written software to handle state driver's license you know what I mean, I have and it's a mess. Theres all kinds of gotchas that you just don't have with a nationwide standard like SSN.
