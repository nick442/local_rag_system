Interesting piece about Philippine, but there's still work to be done, especially from the state. As the [FT pointed out last week](http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/10/24/the-philippines-ready-for-business/#axzz2Aczv0yBy), one need 36 days to start a business and 16 different steps. That's 32 more days than in Indonesia and 13 more steps than in Malaysia. Considering the lack of resources, such a brake on entrepreneurship isn't really what Philippine needs.
