"There are ""strict"" regulations about co-mingling customer funds with other high risk investments. People that lost money were not investing in MF Global, they simply had trading accounts there. A lot were just hedging commodities (like farmers) to help stabilize prices for themselves. Imagine having a 1 million dollar trading account at E-trade annnnnnd it's gone, because the company illegally was using YOUR money to cover losses in some high risk investment. Would you be pissed- should someone goto jail?"
