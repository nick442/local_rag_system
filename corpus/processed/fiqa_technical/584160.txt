>This means that you may be able to make about $120,000 per year, which isn’t bad. Except you’ll have expenses, like rent, transportation, repairs, supplies, computers and whatever else. Your expenses will probably run a few thousand a month, so let’s assume **after expenses you’re netting about $80,000**. Then there’s taxes, and not just federal. There will be state, local, real estate, school, tolls, export, import, duties and those hard-to-understand fees on your cable bill. So lop about 30 percent off that $80K and you’re down to a net living of $56,000. $80,000 net income before taxes is quite good for a self employed individual. I don't really see what the problem is. His bit about taxes after that is completely irrelevant because you'll be paying federal and fica no matter what, plus state and real estate taxes if they apply to you.
