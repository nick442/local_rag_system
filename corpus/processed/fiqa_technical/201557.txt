It's secret so that it can't be torpedoed by politics while in the negotiation process. It has to be voted on by Congress before it can become law, at that point every word of the agreement will be public and available for everybody. The idea is that they can negotiate in good faith without taking political flak at home that prevents any real deal from being reached. Once the agreement is finalized, then Congress and the public will have the opportunity to review the agreement in full before it becomes law. This is standard procedure for complex trade deals.
