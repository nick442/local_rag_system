THANK YOU. Millennials are moving away from cheaper sit down restaurants in favor of Chipotle, Panera type restaurants. I get it. it is just changing tastes. For millennials to say well just change everything you do, if not you are a moron, IS why others call them entitled. It isn't easy changing the entire concept of 1200 restaurants. Millennials are at fault as the millennials of the 20s were responsible for buggy whips dying.
