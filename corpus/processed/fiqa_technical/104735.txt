yeah, I like that, sp. as I'm as computer scientist working in engineering software and love optimization. guess you just can't push a rope, but maybe we can put in place rules which create the incentives that guide the machine. Often think about the incentives which guide bank lending decisions, how the commissions for issuing debt became somehow much more important to people than the idea of repayment. Debt, created from nothing, only has value insofar as it is going to be repaid. Maybe the knowledge they would not have to cover their own losses was enough to imbalance the equation. lack of diligence became very common. but why? I remember doing business courses in the 80s where repayment was the first thing we were thinking about, all through the course of evaluating lending decisions.
