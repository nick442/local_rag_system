I used to travel A LOT for work, and my work requires AA or Delta. AA always felt like I was on some shitty bus in Nicaragua.. Seats with broken audio ports, ratty uncomfortable seats, overhead bins that would come unlatched on their own mid flight.. Oh and paying for internet (when it's rarely offered) only to have it shit out in the first 15 minutes in the air after you payed 10 bucks and not work the rest of the flight.. To top it all off, the flight attendants always seem like they reeeeeally don't want to be there. Delta on the other hand has way more comfortable seats, the headrest screens, fast working internet and the attendants are super nice and friendly. I will never fly AA again unless there is no other option.
