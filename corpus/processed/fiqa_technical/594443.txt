"I am leaning more towards the belief that Amazon registered for the patent to keep other competitors from using such a system. I mean, the article even states: ""The Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos."" You'd have to be an imbecile to allow a newspaper organization that you own to post an article that is defaming your latest patent. As sick of a human being Jeff may be, he's a billionaire for one reason: brilliance. He intended to have this information released to competitors. Nonetheless, this is a very ominous and scary technological innovation. The rapid, unrestricted pace of technology is beginning to frighten me."
