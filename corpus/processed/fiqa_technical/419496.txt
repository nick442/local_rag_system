Five semesters starting with cal I would give you an extra step past diff eq. I recommend doubling up. You will most likely need up through diff eq, linear alg, and real analysis. That's for the bare-bones minimum math level. If you can squeeze in an advanced prob/stat course you'll probably be in good shape for all but the most intense PhD programs.
