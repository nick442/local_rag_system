I'd be interested to hear your justification for this belief rather than dumb image macros.. The only way I've ever been able to accrue wealth is by participating in an economy with rules enforced by the government. I can go to work because of roads, I can get hired at a job because of my education, and the money I earn doesn't get taken from me by thieves and crooks due to law enforcement. With taxes, I'm well off. Without taxes, I have nothing. Seems like the opposite of theft to me.
