> shopping is the be-all-end-all of consumerism This is a fact. What has amazon acquired that is worse off for the consumer than before the acquisition? I can think of when walmart has been shit, like when they basically bankrupted rubbermaid over a single digit percentage price increase. Amazon seems to have the consumer's interests in mind, directly behind maximizing profits.
