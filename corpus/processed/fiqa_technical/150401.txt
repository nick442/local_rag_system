If an individual wants insurance and a company exists that is able to provide such service, they should have every right to do so. It's a mutual exchange. Of course the government tends to jump in and play games but that's a different discussion. If people want flat fees the same should apply. Citizens pay for the police, firemen, all in the form of taxes. The intention of their job is then to ensure your safety to the best of their ability if something were to happen. I'm not sure where the distinction you postulate even exists.
