No they wouldn't. That's from a pure math standpoint. People would cancel like crazy if they did this, which would probably cost them money in the long run. EDIT: As you can see by $NFLX stock today after MISSING projections on earnings but CRUSHING subscribers, it's all about subs, not hard cash. My point is proven.
