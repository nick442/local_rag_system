"Generally speaking no one is ""irreplaceable"". I have watched someon with ""irreplaceable"" skills and business knowledge leave and I have been that someone. Both times it didn't matter. When it does matter it is typically the exception and not the rule. When that person leaves, someone will step up. People don't know it at the time but the knowledge has been passed on or there is someone will be able to pick up the slack. They just don't know that until it happens. Lastly, being irreplaceable breaks the one of the rules to being promote-able. Someone, anyone, should know how to do you job. If not you are less likely to be promoted. You want to keep you job and maybe get a raise. Be the value add employee and more importantly be able to prove it."
