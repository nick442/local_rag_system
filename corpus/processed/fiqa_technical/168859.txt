"Wow. I'm one of the two people who actually respond to your half-baked idea and you jump down my throat. The example of changing majors is different because you're talking about a share of lifetime income, not a loan that will be paid off in the next 10-15 years. With such a long-term obligation as you mention, the onus to ""get it right"" on your first major will be high, possibly confining. As for ""probably have some penalty,"" that's what I'm talking about. You haven't even really considered the depth necessary to create a system such a vast and liquid system, so you don't really have any idea how massive the costs could be in comparison to such miniscule amounts of principal. And don't flatter yourself. I'm not confusing your little five-minute thought with the Koen brothers' impressive novel. I mentioned it because it's a valid parallel. And while you may not be talking about corporations, you *are* talking about creating securitized investments (aka securities, stocks) on a massive scale. You're talking about millions of individuals who need to be profiled for risk and profitability, who need to be verified, double-checked, maybe interviewed, bundled and approved. By very nature of being securities, they'll need approval from people like the SEC, as well as listings on exchanges or somewhere. All of this conforming comes with a great deal of fees. By the time you're done, we're at a similar complexity level to that of a corporation. I'm sorry you felt the need to condescend, because you seem to be out of your league on this one. Next time maybe explaining your point in greater detail will help people understand what you're saying."
