So you cant compare one model of Tesla to one model of any of its main competitors, you have to compare it to all of their cars? That doesn't make any sense. I know you can see that high end cars are where the profits of most companies come from. It's not like they are making billions from a 15,000 dollar Malibu. At this point, even if the other major manufactures could get off their collective butts, they couldn't build in the supercharger infrastructure fast enough to catch up in any meaningful manner.
