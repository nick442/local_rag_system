The mortgages were pooled with other mortgages and sold off to other firms, in theory mitigating the risk. However, the reason lenders searched out these types of deals was because they could use the lack of credit rating etc as an excuse to charge much higher interest rates. Chase and most lenders made their money by borrowing their funds from some other institution and then lender it out to these borrowers so they were always looking for a large yield spread. Account Executives made more money on sub prime because everyone made more money on those deals. That is of course, until the pools hit a percentage rate of foreclosures, forcing a buy back of the pool. Then all of the small time players, like New Century went bust when their investors called them to buy the pools of mortgages back.
