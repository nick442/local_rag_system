"My local post office is known for not delivering packages. Not just known by people in general, but known by the USPS; I called customer service about a package, told them what was going on and they said ""oh that post office? yeah they have a lot of problems for some reason"". They also don't pick up the phone or respond to redelivery requests. They also don't always leave delivery slips, or sometimes they back-date them. I could go on, but I don't think I know a single person who has any love for the USPS, it's incredibly mismanaged."
