FSA is a convenience to allow you to pay day care expenses with pre-tax money. It sounds like neither you nor your wife are eligible through an employer, so you can't use one. If you do not use FSA, then at tax time you can deduct the cost of day care from your gross income. In the end the effect is the same. Just keep track of your expenses.
