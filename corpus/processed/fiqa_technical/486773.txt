I say it's overpriced because they are in essentially a monopoly position for some shows (which the article said) and thus can charge more than I would pay were there alternatives. I agree there are hurdles to cross in getting new shows out, but really don't care about the entertainment industry's struggles. They provide a luxury service, not an essential one. I suspect that new shows will build an online/word-of-mouth following and be able to make the leap to a wider audience should the demand be there. For the record, I have internet and also a Boxee (poorly designed; do not buy), but things like NHL hockey games are either on paid channels - which many people will simply not subscribe to at current prices. Centre Ice, for example, is I believe ~$200 per year. If the NHL loses ad-supported channels, profits in their industry are going to plummet.
