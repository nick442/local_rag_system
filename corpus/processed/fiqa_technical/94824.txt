>Why do people always assume technology or some change in the underpinnings of society will make unemployment a non-issue? In the movie Wall-E, everyone is taken care of by robots. The society as whole enjoy equal rights and no money issues or whatever issues that is currently plaguing the current society. Why do people like you always assume the society will stay the same as it is today? We went from a slavery to a free society. Looking at the Human history, are you telling me that society will stay the same?
