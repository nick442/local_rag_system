"Even worse: many more times, companies will go through an $8 million project to fix an ""issue"" that costs $20. Just 2 examples from my company: 1. A big project to automate the entry of 2 invoices per month from a supplier. Is would take an employee less than 10 minutes a month to enter those 2 invoices manually into the system. 2. A big project to provide a website for employees to buy the company's products (""employee sales""). I showed that on average, less than 1 order is placed per day, except December when the company has extra discounts, and then there are 3 sales a day. My solution: offer a coupon for employees to buy the same products on the existing B2C site. P/S: Yes, I did the 1st project. Why would I complain and point out the obvious? Those silly projects are more than a job security for me. I would probably even get a prize for ""job well done!""."
