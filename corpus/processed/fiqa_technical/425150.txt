"I agree with you completely that many college graduates are grossly underprepared for the ""real world"", and that many might not want to work with their hands. You're even right that a non-graduate can make 40k a year in a trade. But, if you think that labor jobs are some hidden answer that can solve unemployment, you're nuts. It's no secret that work is drying up in most areas. That means less hours to go around. Instead of older workers retiring, they're staying on the job as long as possible in order to maintain the retirement they envisioned for themselves."
