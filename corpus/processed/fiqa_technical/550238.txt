The tried-and-true policy would be government spending (and not just any government spending, but one with positive feedback on the whole economy) such as specific subsidized industry or high-tech projects (most likely wind/solar, high-efficiency and hybrid cars, etc.). And this includes something like addition education in fields that are needed. Instead we give money to banks, tax breaks for the already wealthy, and then deregulate finance when the problem seemed to stem from deregulation and non-enforcement. If we don't hit a bigger bottom in 1-5 years - I'd eat my shorts.
