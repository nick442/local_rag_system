Your dislike for free trade scares me. Shopping for lower wagers in order to bring production cost down is extremely beneficial to both the surrounding production area and the receiving consumers of the products. If it isn't beneficial then the company loses demand and eventually fails. I believe where you hatred stems from is fiat currency and foreign affairs. Free market has its con-men and hustlers but that is far better than government control. You decide what you spend your money in and no one else can say otherwise.
