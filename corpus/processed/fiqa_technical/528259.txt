Built to Sell: Creating a Business That Can Thrive Without You by John Warrillo. Even if you don't plan to sell, there are a lot of good lessons to learn about running a business. This book opened my eyes. I went from a 70h + work week, to what ever I want(usually around 50 with weekends off because I just enjoy working).
