Welcome to the real world. BTW, you have far too rosy a view of this if you think you're only paying 28.5% of your income in taxes. Remember that your employer theoretically pays half your FICA tax. But as far as they're concerned, that's part of the cost of having you as an employee. If FICA was abolished, supply and demand would quickly push salaries up by an amount equal to the FICA tax. So add another 7.65% to your taxes. Plus your employer has to pay unemployment tax (federal unemployment tax is $420 per employee per year, states vary) and workman's compensation tax (no idea how much that is) for the privilege of having you as an employee. You likely pay sales taxes on most everything you buy. I believe sales tax in Massachusetts is 6.25%. Assuming you pay that on only half of what you buy, add another 3% or so. Do you work for a corporation? Between when they sell the fruits of your labor and when they pay you, they have to pay corporate income tax. There are a lot of deductions so that gets complicated, but figure another few percent. Do you drive a car? You're paying gas tax -- 41.9 cents per gallon in MA. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? Extra taxes on those. Travel by plane or stay in a hotel? More special taxes. When you get around to buying a house, you'll pay property taxes on it every year, year after year. For me in Michigan that's another 3% of my income. I understand it's a lot more in Massachusetts. Etc, many other smaller taxes that add up.
