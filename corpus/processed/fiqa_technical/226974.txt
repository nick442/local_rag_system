I'm genuinely curious how you think a government policy that perpetuates a massive underclass of minorities permanently shut out of the labor force isn't racist. Isn't that the definition of racism? Minimum wage laws, in effect, surgically target minorities for job losses and keeps them in perpetual poverty. These laws are heinous acts of economic violence. On top of that, the left not only supports them but cheers their expansion. It's absolutely incredible how hypocritical it is.
