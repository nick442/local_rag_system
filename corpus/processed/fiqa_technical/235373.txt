(1) You put MBA behind your name? Lol who the fuck does that. (2) Of course it isn't (3) Generally they work for 3-5 years and then go back for their MBA. Some go part time while working full-time (which is what I did). (4) You claimed that there are no jobs without an MBA now - I proved you very wrong in 3 minutes - these are not shitty companies either. (5) The kids won't get anything but an entry level job even with an MBA and ZERO experience..you don't get to move up in ranks just because you have an MBA..you need work experience. If the amount of down-votes hasn't told you that the shear fact that I've backed up my claim should make you re-evaluate your thoughts on the advice you give.
