If it were possible to take a loan out for a SIPP investment in the future . I would suggest having an equivalent invested amount already in an ISA . simply to cover you in the event of a job loss including additional cash in a deposit account. Secondly . to increase your chances of success with this strategy I would also suggest doing this when the odds are more in your favour during the bottoming out cycle of a market crash. Thirdly . it depends on how knowledgeable you are about investment , I would suggest being invested globally & in many different sectors to take advantage of various price movements.
