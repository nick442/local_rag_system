assuming that a couple big players are making the majority of money in the stock market (which is true), it is logical to assume that most smaller players are losing. For example, if one big hedge fund makes 20% a year, it means either 20 funds lost 1%, or 5 funds lost 4%, and etc. Assuming that the economy is not drastically getting much better, stocks are a zero sum game. Therefore, the couple of funds with the most resources will be taking from the people that aren't as advanced or taking a chance.
