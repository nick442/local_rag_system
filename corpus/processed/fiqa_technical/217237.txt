Hello Wall Street! I would like to remind you all once again that the march of computer automation will continue to take your jobs. Put in those 100 hour weeks. Kiss ass. Discard your ethics. Do whatever you want because in the end, you WILL be beaten by a $3000 machine. You cannot win this battle. Nobody in HISTORY has won this battle. We'll see you soon!
