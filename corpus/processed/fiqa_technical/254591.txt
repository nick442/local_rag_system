"I think a lot of people misunderstand non-profits.Their names alone as quite misleading. NPO's often just need to disclose their books and numbers every quarter (while being more open than a privately held company) - and work towards a cause. But anything can be ""a cause"". Facebook is a cause. So is Reddit. So are my companies. Executives get paid more because they made more earnings for their business. I see this as fair."
