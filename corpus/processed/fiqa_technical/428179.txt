If your main area of ventilation is the kitchen or the bathroom, then roof exhaust fan is one of the best option one can avail. They are designed for forcibly removing odor and steam from these areas. They operate through sucking air from any localized area in your home into an air vent and then transporting that warm and humid air outdoors via a duct.
