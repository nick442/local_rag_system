They've had a lot of growth, but the price levels in the stock market, real estate market, etc. are pretty questionable and doubtlessly over inflated. They're essentially propped up on the belief that the central government will bailout the necessary parties before any sort of crash. I think the numbers this year are particularly suspect due to Xi's new array of policies. He seems to be rather unpopular right now, so he'll be wanting to use any good news to his advantage, and fabricate good news if there isn't any.
