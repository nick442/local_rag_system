This story really misses the point of this deal. This is not an inversion fueled by tax savings. In fact, it would likely end up in very little tax savings for the new companies given the effective tax rate that BK actually pays in the US (They actually pay 27% in the US vs about 26.5% in Ontario, where Tim Horton's is now). Headquartering the new company in Canada has a lot more to do with placating Canadian regulators. The Investment Canada Act allows for the government to block any merger it doesn't see as in the best interests of the country. Clearly, one of it's biggest and most visible companies being swallowed up by an American firm could fit that description. Politically, it is easy to see why regulators would have an issue with that. However, if you make the new company Canadian.. then it's seen as a win for regulators.
