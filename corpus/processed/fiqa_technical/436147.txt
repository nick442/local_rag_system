Does anyone remember what Porsche had amassed when they attempted a hostile takeover of Volkswagen (before Volkswagen countered with a Pac-Man defense)? It wasn't anywhere near the scale of the assets Apple has under management, but it was still funny that a small racing company and sports car manufacturer quite nearly pulled it off at the time.
