I think increasing funding to public colleges are an -okay- thing to do. Certainly it is better than the current system which guarantees student loans to benefit the bankers. So, we're talking about two different kinds of subsidies: one directly for schools and one for bankers. While ideally, I'd like to see no government involvement whatsoever, I can compromise as long as bankers are bearing the full risk of their student loans. The student loan system is what is bubbling up tuition prices, very similar to what happened in housing.
