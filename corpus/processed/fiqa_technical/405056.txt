I love how people still think we need to be working as much as we do right now as a society. 9-5, 5 days a week all year? Fuck, wake up people. I bet we worked less as hunter gatherers. We have everything we need: access to water, shelter, food, technology. Why are we still working like we're slaves? And I know some people like work and there are economic arguments for why we work this much. Doesn't change the fact that what is happening is ridiculous.
