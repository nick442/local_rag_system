"e-mimosas, ha. I first thought you were referring to just pictures of girl's drinks, as that's a subgenre of ""food porn,"" along with close-up pictures of cupcakes, donuts, and candy. E-mimosas, e-martinis, e-margaritas, and e-mojitos.. Wait..*emo*-jitos? Forget I ever said that; they don't need ANOTHER way to get more traffic."
