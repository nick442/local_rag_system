"Right so doesn't that mean they would be more inclined to have you trade when you don't necessarily need to? Also, wouldn't trading on a retail be easier and less restrictive (ie. they may make you use a certain strategy, your capital is tied up with them for at least a year, you don't need a 56 / 7). For me, i'm starting to see the only benefit is their ""guidance and insight"" which might not be in the trader's best interest."
