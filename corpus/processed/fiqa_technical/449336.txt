"Sitting for the exam won't really make you ""stand out."" If it was a choice between evilyogurt vs. evilyogurt and taking CFA L1 I suppose I would take the latter. But if it was a choice between evilyogurt CFA L1 and goodyogurt w/ internship or some experience I would choose the latter. So in other words, it won't really open doors but it certainly won't hurt. Only take it if it is what you want to do, not to stand out. Also, most places care more about the letters CFA than actually taking the exam and they know you need 4 years qualifying work experience. So they don't really care if you have taken it now or a year from now cause you won't be able to use those letters for four years anyway. Anyway, good luck on your job search."
