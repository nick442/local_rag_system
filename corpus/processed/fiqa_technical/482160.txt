I have many friends in the skilled trade fields that are not experiencing the shortage of workers. They are experiencing a shortage of jobs. I don't get where the idea of a shortage in manual labor is even coming from, because we really wish we were seeing that here. I chose Computer Science because there was no shortage of need for CS majors, and when I graduated, my friends and I couldn't find CS jobs in our area for new graduates. I moved onto IT purely through connections. Some of my friends moved to other fields. One became a stay at home dad because his wife was able to find better paying jobs in his area than he was. We're sold these primrose path stories where you just need to fight for what others are offering, and you, too, can win! But the reality just isn't fitting the narrative! My friends fought and still fight! To give up is to die! But they are in no means doing well. Maybe you don't have to see that. Maybe you just get to hear the stories of the liberal art degrees that want better jobs. Good. Then your area is doing better than mine, or is more shielded. I am still in America. I work hard and have hard working friends. Some, like me, are doing well. Some are struggling despite doing their best. The primrose path is an unfortunate lie.
