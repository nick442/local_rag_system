The car has software that will automatically plot a route using chargers, manage charging times and notify you via a phone app when the car has charged enough to continue your route. Also, most superchargers are located next to a restaurant or thing to do while the car charges. Most of the US is already covered by the by network this year, but next year the network will triple in charging stations. It's really much better than it seems, unless you are constantly driving very long distances. In my five years of Tesla ownership I have never had a problem driving between California and Texas.
