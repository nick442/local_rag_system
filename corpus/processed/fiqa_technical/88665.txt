I don't disagree. My iPhone is made with products from Fox con. They have a horrific record for taking care of their employees. I need to own that. Simultaneously, Apple goes out of its way to do everything they can in order to stifle that victimization. This includes searching for other vendors, overseeing as much of the production process as they are allowed to, and also creating factories and processes here in America that are more under their direct control. I do not see rival companies (like Samsung) doing the same thing. I would never say that I live a purely virtuous life. But I try to make a stand where I think it will make a difference while still being able to provide for my family. And I provide for my family very well.
