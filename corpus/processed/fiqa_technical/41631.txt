I don't think things will get better, anytime soon. Globalization. Automation. None of those are under control of any President anymore. The game is rigged by Big Finance, Big Pharma, Big Agriculture, the military-industrial complex, Big Oil, fucking *Comcast*..our economy is just not healthy. A grid-lock of regulations and established monopolies. How can any single man impact any of that? The Big Wheels will keep on turning, good jobs will become fewer and fewer, benefits will dwindle. Even the best-intentioned President can't tackle any of that, anymore. I think there's an extremely *slim* chance we won't become a South-American style country, with 2-5% owning everything and a brutal police force keeping the poor at bay. You can see glimpses of that possible future today. Ferguson will be an every day occurrence, and it won't be just black people anymore. Oh well, it was a nice experiment for the 200 or so years while it lasted.
