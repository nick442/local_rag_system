"Wot.com or Web of Trust is a website where people add reviews/complaints of websites for things such as child safety, hate propaganda, fraudulent claims, phishing scams, etc. Anyone can post a review, there's no standard or criteria for reviewers. Using WOT to prove a websites information is accurate would be like using a Yelp review as a source in an academic journal or in court. > what would constitute ""scientific methodology"" regarding political analysis? When researching for media bias, you'll need: A. Clearly defined terms B. Objective criteria for doing measurements C. Accounting for error/bias on the part of researchers D. Having experts in relevant fields peer-review and publicly scrutinize your research This isnt just about science, these are the foundations of any attempts at determining truthhood. You're trying to tell me what websites are biased and which are legit, you don't even understand how to go about determining what bias or truth is without basing it on someone else's unevidenced opinion. I understand that we might be able to intuitively recognize bias on the part of overtly right-wing (Brietbart) or left-wing (CNN) news sources, but websites like this can't call themselves fact-checkers when its based entirely on their own intuitive opinions. Sourcing blog posts and unsourced websites is the level of research you'd expect from a conspiracy theorist."
