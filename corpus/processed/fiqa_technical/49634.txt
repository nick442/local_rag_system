I don’t know what you mean by “fair price”. A lot goes into pricing and you haven’t really given enough details. How will the customers be getting your decks? What have customers paid in the past for your decks? What advertising have you already done or are planning to do? How exactly are your decks higher quality? Are your designs original? Who did them? How will they be packaged? There are lots of variables. You’re going to want to differentiate yourself as much as possible going forward and price accordingly.
