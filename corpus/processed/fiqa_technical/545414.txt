I have a $2500 Roth IRA that I set up 40 years ago..it is worth about $2600. I keep it around for this exact talking point. Compound interest at .1% is outstripped by inflation. I have put away $18k a year in a 401 for 30 years now. It is worth just under $800k. The bankers took the excess with their 2% fee and the GFC. Its all in Vanguard now I cleared +$5m in medium and high end residential real estate in the same period. The first 18 years was sleeping on floors and having cardboard boxes as furniture. Sad really.
