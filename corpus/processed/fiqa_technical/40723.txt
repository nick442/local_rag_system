> People who don't understand leverage shouldn't be writing articles about them Agreed. I wasn't condoning the article, just offering my thoughts. > why should there be a cap at 3x for ETFs when you can get way more leverage with other instruments 3x seems arbitrary. 5x seems arbitrary. I'd love to see a study that analyzed what, if any, would be an optimal 'ceiling' for these. > 3 seems to be a valid point to some degree 3 was getting at speculators using them in excess. A potential solution to limit misuse would be to impose higher costs on levered instruments and capping at 3x or 5x or whatever can be viewed as an (extreme) cost.
