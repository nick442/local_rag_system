"Indeed. I would've had a full-time position with the company I worked for part-time over the past year.. but through no fault of my own, mine was cancelled due to ""budget miscommunications"". I absolutely cannot stand people claiming ""Oh well, it's all just hard work"". Bullshit. I put in the hard work. I have the talent. What's my reward? To get flung out in the cold."
