You're totallllllllly right - companies on social are mostly trying to make dough, but fuck me they royally fuck it up. Less than 1% of anyone liking a business' page are going to see anything the company posts. Yet here we are in 2017 with SME's still buying Facebook likes inventory as ad objectives. The fuck? When you hook your PPC into analytics and you run your hotjar and then see who's buying, who's abandoning and WHY - then you have a potent force for remarketing and ultimately selling stuff successfully via social. But as you say, most companies still going for organic social traffic which jusssssst ain't going to happen. Pay to play. <shrugs> Good convo with you man - appreciate a good Reddit yarn like this.
