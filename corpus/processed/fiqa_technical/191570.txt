I get the feeling the value of reddit is not presented as something that makes profit, but rather an entity that can shape public opinion. In that way it is extremely valuable. The fact that mods are clearly paid by someone yet not officially employed by Reddit is a huge red flag that money is flowing, just not in the traditional ways.
