It seems to me to be a pyramid scheme, where the holder will reach a point where they decide to sell for more traditional currency or throw it into the traditional economy through mass purchasing. The sudden increase in supply of bitcoin will help the eventual plummet in value and leave a lot of people in the cold with billions in real dollars lost by those who are still holding bitcoin to those who dumped it all before the crash. Why? It's unregulated. The one characteristic that might draw people to it will be the cause of it's demise.
