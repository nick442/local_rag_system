Just like Switzerland lost its banking privileges by not being in the EU, huh? The truth is none of us really know what's going to happen so we all need to stop throwing out opinions as fact. London has an already established stable banking climate and the cost and effort of relocating to other places might prove to be too high as opposed to just working something out between the Brits and the Europeans. We just don't know yet.
