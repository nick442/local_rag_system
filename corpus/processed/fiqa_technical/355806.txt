Even if you can pull this off (I think it is possible with creativity) it is likely not worth it. The number of ways this can come crashing down is high and the benefits are marginal at best. The opportunity cost of carrying this out is likely higher than the saved interest from just carrying the $500 balance. Do this with too much money and you can find yourself in real trouble if one card gets cancelled (late fees, penalties, and no way to make repayment). Basically this is theoretically possible but not worth it. Just work an extra hour each month and pay the interest. Or, if you don't have a job, just pay the interest and spend the time you save to look for a job.
