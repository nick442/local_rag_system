It may be that marijuana should be removed from the test but it is still illegal in our state and like was already mentioned, not testing for it and someone has an accident leaves room for the company to be blamed for being negligent. Not trying to say marijuana would be the cause but would be hard to argue in court and even then that would mean probably going to court at all.
