It doesn't matter if he is Russian.. Putin is not trying to be a Stalin. The west has been holding Russia back since the days of the Czars, Russia will never conform to the ways of the west so this angers the Western trading blocs like the EU, America, Japan now etc.. Putin is not a dictator when he has more support from his people than Obama does of his. What Obama does have is the support of the rich however, which Putin does not. The sanctions being placed on Russia are targeted to effect the richest Russians with hopes they will overthrow Putin themselves. They are losing more money with every sanction placed, where the lower class Russians do not feel the sting of the sanctions as much as the rich so they continue to support their President. the USA seems more like a dictatorship these days than does Russia. Our government has gone to a Monarchial system lately where Congress is being bypassed completely simply because the President wants to take action. Our government cannot get anything done, so corporations that were founded in the USA are leaving at an astounding rate to save money on taxes. Putin does not feel that Russia is the only country in the world when he does a huge deal with China and Iran. Obviously he knows that he has to have allies and since the West has alienated Russia thoughout history, they have to turn to China. Also you have the BRICS bank, which will be a huge hit to the Western superiority that has existed for centuries. I don't care if he is Russian, Putin's actions contradict what he is saying. He is only alienating the traditional western powers while aggressively working with BRICS countries, Iran and many others.
