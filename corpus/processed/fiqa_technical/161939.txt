I agree with this as well. I don't think a lot of people in the US realize that immigration is one of the US's saving graces when it comes to future economic growth. Only India's population will grow faster than the US's on a % basis over the next 15 years or so. I also agree on the financial panics lasting 7 years. The Reinhart and Rogoff piece even suggested that the US experienced a run of the mill financial panic based on previous historical experiences.
