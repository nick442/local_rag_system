There IS an amount of money you can pay to make people deal with very unpleasant situations. Offer me my old pay + 50% to go back into the workplace daily and deal with my last boss? Yeah, I'll tell you to go fuck yourself. Offer me 3M+ a year to do it? Okay. I'll take that and do JUST ENOUGH to keep the job for a year or two, and then I'll never fucking work again. Or I'll get fired and laugh all the way to the bank anyway.
