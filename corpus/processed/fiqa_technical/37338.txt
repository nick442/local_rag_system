So, they can either do this OR they can take their in-store customer experience up like a dozen notches. What they can't do is have baseline in-store customer experience and higher prices than online. That *can't* work, and they must know this. As the generations roll forward there will be fewer and fewer people wandering into a Best Buy with no idea what a TV costs. In fact, more and more people are walking around with internet connected barcode scanners that will do an instant nationwide price compare on the spot. If you find an item you like in Best Buy and you scan the barcode and find it 25% cheaper online..can you want 3-4 days to get it? Probably. If they just keep trying to go along as a high price retailer they're done. They'll be bankrupt in less than 10 years.
