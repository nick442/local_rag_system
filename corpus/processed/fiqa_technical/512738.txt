Do you have an emergency fund? If so, one idea is to put money into a Roth IRA, and invest it conservatively (short term government bonds, or a IRA savings account). Since you can withdraw your contributions from a Roth at any time, this could serve as most of your emergency fund, which means you could then use your existing non-tax-sheltered emergency fund to pay down the loans. This way if an emergency does come up, you have access to the money. And if an emergency doesn't come up, you have some tax-sheltered funds that you would not otherwise have.
