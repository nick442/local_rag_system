LaRouche is not right wing. get your facts straight man. he's calling for a new deal 2.0. that seems more like Roosevelt Democrat. The larouche movement laughs at the Ron Paul mises libertarian austerity economic bullshit. Webster Tarpley used to be on the LaRouche movement, and Webster is all for more power to social programs and called out the Ron Paul campaign's deceit even before support for romney was announced.
