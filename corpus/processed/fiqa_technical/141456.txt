No, it's like a kid asking for a cookie - of course the kid asks for the cookie. Kids are short-sighted, irresponsible, and focused on instant gratification. The problem isn't the kid asking for the cookie, it's when Mom, who is *supposed to be* responsible and in charge, gives the kid the cookie when the kid shouldn't be having cookies. Lobbyists asking for modifications to tax & legal code - fine. There's nothing wrong with asking. Sometimes the ask is a good one. Legislators & regulators agreeing to the modifications to tax & legal code - 100000000% their responsibility. The onus is on the PERSON IN CHARGE to exert their power and control, and not do the stupid thing. Why do you people blame the companies or lobbyists but exonerate the legislators & regulators who are **ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOWING THESE THING TO HAPPEN!?**
