Sad for me. Their happy hour was amazing in college. Half off drinks + apps was cheaper than any local bar we had in my small college town, while the food was the same quality and Applebees had a wider selection of beer. Even in my mid 20s when my friends and I wanted drinks and were low on money, Applebees + TGIF were our go-to.
