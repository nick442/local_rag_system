I work as an investment risk manager for what would popularly be called a top tier investment manager. Most large asset managers use vendor models like RiskMetrics, Algorithmics, Barclays Point, Barra or something similar, and use those to calculate endless varieties of analytics and risk metrics. Some of these are granular risk models (single asset based and computing covariances between them) while others are factor models (e.g. mapping bonds to a yield curve and sector and country spread and computing the risk largely based on that mapping). Things like Value at Risk in any of its many flavors (simulated vs non simulated, mainly), ex-ante risk relative to a benchmark, stress tests, duration, beta, yield, spread, expected shortfall, what have you.. Counterparty/credit risk is a whole different world I could get into. What else do you want to know in detail?
