There's so much wrong in such a small space here.. Why do you think this is a component of working in government? Is it a component of working in the private sector? Non-profits? Military (Which is still government)? If someone specializes in shale gas extraction commercial rate setting for the purposes of royalty calculation, why do they need to remember what it's like to be Joe Sixpack? Why do NSA administrators who monitor foreign intelligence channels need to remember what it's like to bargain shop? The argument is nonsense from the ground up. At the same time, how is flying coach teaching them this *valuable* lesson? And why do you think they can't remember it without flying coach? Plus, I'm not sure you understand what forms a bubble. I fly coach. I don't interact with anyone around me. And the government officials we're talking about are not so well compensated they don't have ordinary lives. Instead, the concern you're really alluding to is that homogenous groups of professionals tend to develop institutional blind spots. Flying coach won't solve that.
