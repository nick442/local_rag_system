It seems smart to me to have a profitable business with a troubled future take today's profits to pay tomorrow's biggest expense. Those pensions won't be ignored when USPS is bleeding even more profusely in the future and the Government will have to bail them out; these payments only soften the blow. The pension payment requirement only serves to make the long-term effects of the USPS poor retirement choices apparent today rather than later.
