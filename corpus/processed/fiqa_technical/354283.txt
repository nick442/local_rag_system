Some of those could be bubbles since they violate price-rent metric. maybe or maybe not. People parking money is not necessarily a bubble if the money stays parked. I look at overseas real estate and some areas will never have prices anywhere near in line with incomes because they are global markets. locals couldn't dream to afford to own their own property.
