I have and I was close to going that route but I live in a relatively rural area and the only viable antenna would need to be powered and roof mounted. This is something I would be willing to do as it's still cheaper than having cable/satellite but even with this I won't get many of the games I want (we would still not have clear reception for some major channels). I found that basically, without ESPN I cannot get the majority of the games we want to watch. That's what it boiled down to. No ESPN. I was all set to get an Apple TV (or similar device), a powered antenna, a VPN so I could catch the European soccer I like but I couldn't find a way to get ESPN and that eliminates too many of the games we like to watch.
