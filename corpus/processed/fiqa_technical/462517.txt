From [the story I linked above:](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240150767/Facebook-shareholders-sue-over-misleading-IPO) >It has emerged that only a select group of insiders were aware that Facebook was forecast to earn tens of millions of dollars less than had been publicly stated. You can announce news, or you can withhold it as corporate proprietary information. What you most definitely *cannot* do is just tell a few friends.
