[I appreciate the attitude that you wrote back in, seriously!] Look I'm not against some form of help if they are working 60-85+ hours a week (we can discuss exactly what should be done). However my whole issue is that this women has been working at a minimum wage job for a long time (I forgot the exact number). Why isn't she trying to advance away from that? (Maybe she is, but the article didn't talk about that). Look I know it's tough, living in the Greater Seattle Area is very expensive and it's hard. But I'd not only do what I have to to support my family (which she is trying wry hard to do, props for her), but I'd also try to educate myself (not talking university) and try to develop/enhance my abilities so they are attractive to employers. She has tons of years of experience, why not try to move up in management?
