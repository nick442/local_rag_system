Developing the right culture is easily one of the hardest tasks for a manager. Look to hire the right people who can motivate and set the tone for the rest of your firm. Once you do that, managing won't be as strenuous. Write down on a piece of paper the values you want to instill in your organization, and make sure your early employees embrace and showcase those values. You'll know right away who fits and who doesn't.
