Amazon was a terrible addition to town. They sprouted condo towers and congestion in South Lake Union, then shipped in interns and employees who live in dorms and eat in the company cafeteria during their two waking that they are not at work. These people don't even take transit. There is near zero benefit unless you're a landlord downtown and enjoy the increase in rents.
