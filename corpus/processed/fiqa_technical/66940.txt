"When I looked at the historical numbers it looks like nothing special happened since 1970. Visitors and gambling revenue have had what looks like a relatively stable annual percentage increase. Maybe the ""feel"" or culture change in 1989 but I don't see that in the numbers. I would say the 90s were good to any tourist destination in the us and the 2000 not so good. Vegas appears to be no different."
