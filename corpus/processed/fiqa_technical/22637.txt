> Point being, the problem hasn't been fixed. The deficit went from enormous in 2009 to simply large today. Deficit is currently at 2.3% of GDP. The USA is analogous to a person who is making $200,000/year, has $120,000 in debt, and took on an additional $6,000 in debt this year. The $6000 number (the deficit) is not the large number in this equation. The other piece of course is that this person consistently gets raises that meet or beat inflation.
