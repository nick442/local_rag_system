"Really? Why do you think that if they were any good they would be available through regular channels? I like Tupperware. And so do a lot of people-that's why there were so many companies who created their own versions. Also, what do you mean by a legalized pyramid scheme? I've heard that before and always wondered. My understanding is that a pyramid scheme is based solely on the recruitment of people, and that the ""buy in"" is what pays the people up at the top of the pyramid, and there are no products or services of value rendered."
