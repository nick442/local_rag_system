And that's what I'm getting at, it's like an 8th grader failing a class. It's not great but we don't write the kid off as a failure and kick him out of school. There is a lot of schooling left and chances are he will get his diploma. there is plenty of time for them to pass something. And chances are you will see something get passed when they start to run up against a sort of deadline that could prevent them from passing it at all. And that deadline is like what? Next November at the earliest?
