Seems like this was a tough situation, but Dave Brandon has not had success recently. Dominoes straight up apologized for what their product became with him leading, he got ousted from UM Athletics because the ticket prices crashed and students were revolting, and now this. Doesn't look like a good few years for him from where I'm sitting.
