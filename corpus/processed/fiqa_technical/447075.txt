Im trying to figure out where the best place to open my pet shop would be around my city, most likely the place where people have the most dogs or spend the most money on dog supplies in my area. Essentially, I want to know if I should be looking for central property in town that is easy to get to from all around the city, or should would it be more beneficial to find a place closer to the rich suburb north of the actual city.
