Based on several of the comments, I can foresee a situation in which an activist investor kicks in a lot of his own money, which, along with funds from kickstarter and possibly some of the investor's buddies, are enough to purchase a major share in a large bank, and by persuading other sympathetic shareholders, they are able to make headway in changing the industry. While improbable, it would at least be plausible.
