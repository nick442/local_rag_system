Agreed that luck is important, but in everything I've read about the extremely successful, it seems that careful measured analysis played just as crucial a role in their success. Something that these guys appear to be advising startups to ignore. But again, maybe pure instinct is the only way to run the fast-paced type of business they're operating. Also that quote I cited may have just been an off-the-cuff remark, not meant to be taken literally.
