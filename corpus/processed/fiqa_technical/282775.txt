What's really going on here? Why is a foreign company that has the majority of it's factories and workforce in China, now suddenly wishing to build a factory in the US. FoxConn is not exactly known for high paying jobs in China. [1] Now the claim is that they're going to spend billions on a US factory where the claim is that they'll create 3,000+ jobs with an *average* salary of $54K+ not including benefits? Why not build another factory in China where you could arguably hire cheaper labor, and you wouldn't have to build up a new supplier chain? What's suddenly making building an American factory, a smarter business decision as opposed to say FoxConn's stated 2016 aggressive push to eliminating jobs via automation.
