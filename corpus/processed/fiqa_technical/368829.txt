"There is no ""shortage"", what there is is a lot of untalented unskilled fakers who think they can skate their way through an I.T. career after 4 years at college. Because HR people can't tell the difference they have hired too many of the fakers and because management can't deal with the social differences that people who spend all day working with machines are going to have they have fired all of the true experts. The business world brought this situation upon itself because of arrogance and ignorance and it deserves all of the suffering that has resulted. Wages for high tech work have actually dropped by 50% over the last 10 years. If you folks want skilled computer workers to support your organizations again you need to increase average salaries by 200% and treat the experts with the respect we deserve."
