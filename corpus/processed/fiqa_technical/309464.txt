A California Chevy Volt owner here.. it costs me about $0.95 to charge the car over night (super off-peak rates between midnight and 6 AM are cheap) and I get about 35 - 47 miles per charge out of the battery before the gas engine kicks in. The mileage changes depending on the weather.. it's been over 100 Fahrenheit here recently which requires the A/C to be on to cool the battery in addition to the cabin resulting in the advertised 35 miles per charge. Now that it's cooler, i'm getting 47 almost every day.
