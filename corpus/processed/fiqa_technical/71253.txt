"The usual approach is to set up a ""Friends of X Park"" charity. The charity raises money and then donates it towards work done in the park. Here's an example that's local to me: Friends of Hastings Country Park. There will be quite a bit of work needed to set up a new charity, so it will only be worth it if there's enough money likely to be raised."
