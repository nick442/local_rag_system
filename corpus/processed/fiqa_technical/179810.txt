Free Market as in Laissez-faire? Because that is economic anarchism and leads to either monopolies or market shutdown. I believe in heavy restrictions myself, force companies to play ball, follow the rules, allow small businesses a chance to grow unopposed by big businesses, a few social programs here and there to incentivize employment and working - not giving out free money - except in the case of disability - which just ends up trapping people, myself included - and of course a reasonable minimum wage, so one person doesn't require more than one job, opening up those positions for other people. This system makes it harder to get rich, sure, but it allows those at the bottom, especially hard-workers, to be able to survive, if not thrive. They pay more Sales Tax because they spend more, and they pay more Income Tax because they earn more, the currency strengthens as a result.
