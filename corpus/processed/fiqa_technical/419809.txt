"Ya, when my buddy who is by no means a financial wizard, and paid to have his TV installed (not even wall mounted..), told me he was looking to invest in a condo, cause apparently it was ""easy"". I think the quote from the friend who told him got broken down to, ""The market only goes up, so as long as your rent handles the interest on your mortgage you just make up the difference and gain when your value doubles!"" That is one reason I am worried for the eventual decline if all of those types of people rush for the door at the same time. I really hope it is a case of broken telephone."
