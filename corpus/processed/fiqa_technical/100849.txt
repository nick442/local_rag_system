Good points. I'm sure twitter has data on the value of Trumps account, but IMO the data for how much value Trump keeps away from Twitter is much less readily available. Anecdotally, I know many people that have either not gotten a twitter account or quit using the service altogether because of him. And I live in a red state. I'd think if the investors proved the economic value of the account was actually damaging to twitter user growth, they could have a case. One way would be to see where people are going for news, or creating new accounts, or time spent on the platform vs others like Facebook.
