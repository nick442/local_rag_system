So if the power company decides they're losing customers because of associating with Comcast and a quick cost/benefit analysis says they should stop providing power to Comcast then that's okay? Comcast now has to close their doors and their company is done for because no power company in the world will provide for them because they don't want the bad PR. It's okay to hold an entire company hostage because, it's just business? Then of course you might say, well switch power providers! Tough luck Comcast PECO is your only option. You could use this small solar farm that gives you some power and not nearly enough to sustain your current business but you have another choice so it's not a monopoly!
