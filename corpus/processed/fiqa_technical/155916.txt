"What you said was: > glad to have people skimming billions of dollars from the economy with exactly zero added value How is that different from what happens in the absence of algo trading? Why does ""on the matter of minutes"" matter? Is on the matter of hours acceptable to you? What I know is that 30 years ago, before the rise of algos, human market makers quoted in 8ths and regularly backed away to quarters. If they sensed some information asymmetry or just didn't like your shop, they might not even pick up the phone. The presence of entities that increase volume and thus price discovery, collapse that spread, encourage competition and innovation is beneficial, unless you're ideal economic model is some slow-moving, $-capturing brokerage oligopoly. Given that, it's on you to bring forward a model that demonstrates some magical specific sub-daily timing is ok but some other speed is ""bad""."
