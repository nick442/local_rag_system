Taxi regulations exist to protect the public. It's not some racket to keep people out of the market. Insurance: Uber/Lyft only insure their drivers while they are loaded. Meaning any other time they are driving around, even if they are driving to a call, they aren't insured. If they get in a wreck, their own car insurance won't cover it because they don't have taxi insurance which is a shit load more expensive than regular car insurance. Red-lining: Red-lining is where taxi companies will not server certain neighborhoods, meaning they will neither pick up nor drop off in the area. Discrimination: All classes are protected under taxi regulations with serious repercussions for discrimination. This also includes people with disabilities, like the blind and those in wheel chairs. Rates: Taxi rates are typically approved by the city so that companies can't constantly change them. This is a big one as far as Uber/Lyft goes. Really what it comes down to is Uber/Lyft need to operate on a level playing field. They are a taxi service. There is absolutely no question about this and it isn't up for dispute. They need to obey the same laws that taxi companies are still held to or be fined into oblivion. If you actually bother to read the taxi regs for your city, you will see they are there to protect you as a customer and have little benefit to taxi companies. About the only rule I can think of are the regulations regarding paying your fare. For all the rest, the taxi companies would be better off without because they wouldn't be forced to serve people they don't want to. In my experience, the cab companies don't care about additional competition because it's the nature of the business. The fact that Uber/Lyft completely disregard all the regulations is what they have a problem with. //Source: 8 years in the taxi industry.
