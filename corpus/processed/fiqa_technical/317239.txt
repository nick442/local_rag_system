I knew my question was coherent and I knew what I was getting myself into when I started this thread. I actually do have a lot of trading finance and stock books in my bookshelf. Although I can go try to find a solution to my problem it's still not the same if I were to ask someone just gave me a straight answer. But if you want to respond abstractly then I understand.
