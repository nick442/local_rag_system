While I'm not an accountant, this is how I do this for my personal accounting: Note, if you don't want the expense to take effect right away meaning it'll affect your Profits, then the transaction date here needs to be something in the future, then when you hit that date and the bill is still not paid, you just unpost the bill and repost again with a new date . So you end up with something like the following: 4. Now you post the invoice to Liabilities:Accounts Payable:The Cable Company, the invoice due date should reflect what you had in the invoice. This is important as gnucash will warn you that your bill is due if you want to pay it every time it starts: When you're ready to pay the bill, just find the bill and click pay invoice. If it's already paid and you imported transactions from your bank, find the transaction then right click and click assign as payment then choose your invoice. Note: I've being using this to also record cheques that are given to people but not cashed yet. I hope that helps.
