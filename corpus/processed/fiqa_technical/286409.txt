"I carry 2 devices. That said - at my job we were getting emails 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And at the same time there was no recognition of it by my employer and they wanted to know if you took a ""sick day"" or ""vacation days"" --- which is bizarre since for 6 years I never had so much as one day where I was truly off-off. I was answering emails right before I walked outside for my wedding. You HAD to be on it all the time. It was nuts."
