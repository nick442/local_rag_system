"How do I leave 0 tip and not feel guilty or make anyone feel bad? Rationalizing the wages of restaurant staff is not within the control of the wait staff. In fact, the IRS assumes that restaurants where tipping occurs will receive at least 8% of their gross receipts in tips: IRS Topic Number: 761 - Tips â€“ Withholding and Reporting If the total tips reported by all employees at your large food or beverage establishment are less than 8 percent of your gross receipts (or a lower rate approved by the IRS), you must allocate the difference between the actual tip income reported and 8 percent of gross receipts among the employees who received tips. So, as little sense as it may make, tipping is baked into the US tax code. There's no way you can refuse to tip in an establishment where tipping is the practice and not make someone feel bad, since it will have a real impact on their earnings. If you are serious about your principles, you should exclusively patronize restaurants with a ""no tipping"" policy. They are becoming more common. If you patronize restaurant where tipping is expected and refuse to tip, then people will suspect that it's less about your principles and more about being a ""free rider""."
