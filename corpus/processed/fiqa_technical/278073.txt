The 401K match has limits, but it is not taxable until you withdraw the money from the account. You can think of it as an initial lump of interest or gain. When you leave the company you are allowed to keep it, if you are vested. You can then roll it over into a IRA, or another 401K. When you withdraw money in retirement you will pay taxes on the match and all the gains from the match. Taxes on what you contribute will depend on if it was pre-tax or post-tax, or if it was deposited into a Roth IRA. The amount you deposit pretax is noted on the W-2, which you attach to the 1040 form. The company match does not appear anywhere on the w-2 or 1040. It should show on your 401-K statements. Those statements should also tell you how much of the match has been vested.
