"Yes, and the reason for that is because things that are above the market (eg regulators, politicians et al) manipulate it constantly. I think personally the market is still a price discovery mechanism, the rules of the game have just changed. I.e. risk now has taken on additional dimensions, so a lot of conventional theories of asset pricing can effectively be chucked out the window. Whether we ever see the return to a more ""econ""-driven reality in market expectations (and by that extent therefore asset pricing) is anyone's guess, for now bye-bye to the established light-touch framework of decades past, hello to interventionist randomness."
