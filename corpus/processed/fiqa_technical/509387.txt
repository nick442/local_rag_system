I have a cleaver plan. Seriously though instead of U.B.I. pay people to go to school. It might up end the profiteering of the U.S. system but screw those guys . You pay people to go to school , at least they're doing something and they could if they are motivated use what they are learning to get a job or start a business or become part of the creative life of there communities .
