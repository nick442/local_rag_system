I would suggest to start small and grow it up. By starting small I mean. Start online with something like a website. It is amazing what you can do if you simply just put an hour a day aside to do this. Do some research, listen to audiobooks on your commute or when you're eating breakfast in the morning, and get your family involved that will definitely help a lot. If you haven't read this book I would highly suggest it: The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau 100startup.com/ , and The 4 Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss https://fourhourworkweek.com/ . I was not sponsored by these books I just think they will genuinely help you.
