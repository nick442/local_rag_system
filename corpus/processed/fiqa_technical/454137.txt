Let me guess.. starte rejected the Medicaid expansion? Didn't join the exchange? I was in the same position, difference is I was able to cut my deductible and premium in half without hurting my coverage because in the exchange all of the policies were presented and compared apples to apples while before they were hidden or difficult to compare with larger financial benefits for brokers to push the customer to policies that we're bad for them but very good for the broker..
