I was unaware that first-class mail was intended to be that fast. But really, the postal service is legacy infrastructure at this point. Its last major purpose, aside from spam, is servicing bills and miscellaneous government paperwork like taxes and the census for those who don't have access to the internet. The post baby-boom generations are overwhelmingly computer literate; it's not going to be too terribly long before we have mandated universal internet connectivity, like we have with telephones and electricity. At that point, the postal service will pass into irrelevance.
