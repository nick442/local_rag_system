Did it in late 2012, did well, got quite a few requests but not many follow ups. Would recommend though, if you do well it helps to connect and find out about opportunities, and if you don't it didn't affect anything and it's still free, right? If you are a finance major shouldn't be much of a problem. Try some prep material if they have those, I suppose.
