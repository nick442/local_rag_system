"Well, I started with ""is shadowstats accurate"" on Google and there's a Wikipedia page with a well established background. I'm not much into the MSM, but I do see value in the statistics the government reports. Though it seems less of the MSM and more of a bunch of highly degreed people in economics fields who are debating him. But maybe jet fuel can't melt steel beams. My formal education and experience isn't financial, so I don't know if I'm qualified to speak for it. I think I know more than average person about personal finance, but that's about it. I can speak for myself, that I am doing well with the markets and my life seems stable and secure. The rest of the country? They're probably 500 dollars away from financial ruin and living paycheck to paycheck. That's what the articles posted here say. It's a shame, if so."
