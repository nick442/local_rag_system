"> Every I have said is 100% factual. That isn't true in the least bit. >During the 50s there were plenty of women in the workforce and nothing changed. There were a growing number of women and wages were trending toward what they are today. For analysis like this you can't just take a snapshot of data and use that to justify the conclusions you've made about entire periods and the their trends. >If that's the case the income should have halved but in reality it's been reduced to about 30%. You are forgetting that there have been enormous productivity and human capital gains over the past half century. More people are college educated and thanks in large part to things like computers and the internet they are better at their jobs. > More to the point companies today couldn't afford to pay people the amount they paid in the past. Some companies in some industries sure, but nothing said here could possibly support that kind of blanket statement about all companies in all industries. So in conclusion only two things you've said could possible be facts(""there were plenty of women"" and ""reduced to about 30%"") everything else is either poor analysis or ideologically motivated conjecture. And to top it all off your ""facts"" are so vague(and unsourced) that they are rendered meaningless."
