The answer is simple. People are sheep and creatures of habit. Apple has maintained a simple design and marketing ethos for a long time and over time they have convinced people that their phones are superior in quality and reliability. They have been endorsed in mainstream media over the decades as top of the line. Apple phones and products are not immune to software failure and don't have the best build quality. Trust me as a “nondenominational” repair technician I see more broken iPhones then anything else. Personally I find the iPhone to be an enigma of social engineering. Dell computers are another example of tech that is widely considered to be the best among pc manufacturers when msi can deliver an outstanding product as well. Dell built their brand to make people excited to get one. DUDE your getting a DELL!? When you buy an iPhone you are not buying the hardware you are buying their product which includes their name and ecosystem. Unfortunately for Apple fans it comes at a premium.
