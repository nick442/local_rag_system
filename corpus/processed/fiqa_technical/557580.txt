I have a degree in Finance and thought I would enjoy a job in personal finance. I was wrong. If you enjoy people, speaking on the phone, and selling constantly then you'll love financial services. If you dont mind working many hours in a high paced, stressful job then investment banking may be your thing. If you are more of a numbers guy then you should concentrate on corporate finance, possibly get your CFA or some other such accreditation. If numbers are your thing you may also enjoy accounting or being an actuary. If I were you, I would stick with engineering. But that's just me. Take my opinion with a grain of salt.
