Friendly reminder for everyone to not reuse passwords across sites. For most people, the best solution is to use a program to remember their passwords. Personally, I'm a fan of [KeePass](http://keepass.info/), which is open source and allows you to use very high encryption. It has a password generator to create very random passwords for whatever requirements various sites have. Plugins allow KeePass to auto-fill fields in your browser. And if you put the database in your dropbox, you can access your passwords from your phone or another computer easily. It was a bit of a pain to get set up (4 or 5 hours of resetting passwords, which I spread over 2 days), but now I'm never going back. It's so much easier.
