I don't know if they did or didn't, but my thinking is they did not. But saying 'they didn't pay taxes' is only literally correct, and not correct in the way that people will receive it as. In other words, it's not telling the whole story and letting people draw erroneous conclusions as a result. Basically, if a company takes a loss one year, then they get that loss reduced from their taxes the next year. I assume GE took losses in 2009 due to the 2008 crash and thus did not pay taxes in 2010.
