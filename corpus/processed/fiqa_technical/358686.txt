"Look, as my final comment. You're overthinking this. Companies routinely have waaaay more cash on their books than they ""need"" because they keep a rainy day fund. Yes, there are extreme examples like Apple that has about 60 billion more than they need but practically all companies are going to maintain excess cash for emergencies, acquisitions, etc. As I said in another comment, the common theme between a DCF and an EV multiple is that they are both capital structure independent. Even here there are going to be differences, companies with a really shitty capital structure (read: too much debt) will trade publicly at a lower enterprise value multiple because of the risk that they go bankrupt. In an acquisition, this (probably) would not be the case. In the case of a DCF, you would probably raise your discount rate to account for the risk of bankruptcy."
