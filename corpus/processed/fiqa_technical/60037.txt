"Updating current reactor tech largely reduces ""radioactive waste?"" Exactly by how much will this reduce radioactive waste? And I hope you can clarify, but when you put ""radioactive waste"" within quotes you could be misinterpreted as downplaying the perilous nature of a deadly substance who's mere milligrams will poison and even kill every orgasm that ingests it -- over the next 250,000 years. Something /energy ignores and even censors on their subreddit is the question of where will nuclear waste be stored. Our species has had a strong couple thousand years but considering how we collectively mishandle even the simplest of tasks - how arrogant are we to believe we can safeguard the storage of a deadly substance for the next quarter-million years? Windmill 1.0 can just be taken down and even recycled into Windmill 2.0"
