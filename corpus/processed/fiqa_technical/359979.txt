Most jobs have fairly standardized raw inputs. If you're counting the number of widgets produced, that's easy. If you're counting sales performance that's easy (so long as someone's not handing out all the best clients to their friend while shafting some other sales people). With teaching, you have a year with 20-30 students. A bad batch could make the teacher look terrible despite the fact that the teacher would have rocked with a different batch.
