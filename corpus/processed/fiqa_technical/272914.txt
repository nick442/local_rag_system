There's more to this tax than meets the eye. California, along with countless other states, issued municipal bonds backed by tobacco taxes/tobacco sales/tobacco judgments. Over time states become dependent on the revenues, and enjoy the ability to raise taxes then get the cash immediately by issuing bonds to bring all those future cash flows to the present. There's a big problem, though; smokers are quitting. Here's an article by [HuffPo on the topic](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/20/tobacco-sales-california_n_1289514.html). tl;dr: Politicians spent money from tobacco on other purposes, so now they want to tax smokers more because the state government projected more revenues than they're currently receiving.
