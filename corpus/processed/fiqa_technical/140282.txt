Hedge what risk? What is your risk exposure? I don't seem to understand what is your risk factor (is it a basket of metals), if its a non market product you can do the following: 1. Calculate correlation matrix between your basket and potential candidates (mining, etf's etc) 2. Sell the strongest correlation, however be careful as you are not only selling the rare earth prices but also the extraction margin and market risk. 3. Ideally you would find a futures contract or create some way to isolate the rare earths while cancelling out the margins (will be tough!).
