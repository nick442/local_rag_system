Problem is, are most consumers asking for any of this R&D? Seems more or less they're just spraying and praying with R&D features. Clearly, since they're continuing to downsize, they're not selling. Not to mention they always have their proprietary formats, be it software and/or hardware. That doesn't help their case. I don't want to be tied down to a platform for w/e reason. It always costs more because of scales of economy, and when they move on from that format and/or no longer support it, then what?
