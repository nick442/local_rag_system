Ahh, that's embarassing. I read two articles on Uber on hackernews this morning, one with this title, and the other talking about uberPool which said that they aggressively offered discounts because without those rebates drivers wouldn't have enough passengers, but if they could reach a critical number of users they would have enough passengers that the ride was (barely) profitable. I went back and found the articles posted on hackernews and feel pretty silly now. I should definitely tone down my smugness in the future, so sorry for that. Glad you found it amusing though!
