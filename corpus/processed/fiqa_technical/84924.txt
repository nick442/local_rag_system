"Dude, you are over analyzing this way too much. The fact of the matter is, if someone is sketchy enough to help you rob a bank, their character and judgement is suspect. >Moreover, it can't be that hard to find a group of 4-5 people who aren't stupid. I can think of a dozen friends of mine off the top of my head I'd have complete confidence in if we decided to rob a bank. This sentence is a bit of a fallacy in of itself after reading the linked article above. You want to find ""4-5 people who aren't stupid"" that will ""rob a bank."" We just read about how the return on bank robbery is complete garbage, so anyone who would think it a good idea is de facto stupid. Chances are, someone who was willing to commit such a large crime, will be willing to commit other, possibly smaller crimes. And if you think there's any loyalty among criminals, you are incredibly naive.."
