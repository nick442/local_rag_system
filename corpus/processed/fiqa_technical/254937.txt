> Too much work for me. Agreed. That's why I just make sure I keep the daily minimum in there at all times and I don't have to worry about it. I think our fee is $45/mo, so I'm not willing to waste $540/yr. I contemplate moving to a credit union, but I don't like the idea of having to update dozens of accounts, bill pay, direct deposits, etc.
