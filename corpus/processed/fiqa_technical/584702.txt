Since the article made it sound like the data was based on a self-selecting questionnaire and was not representative, I checked the source summary for more: >The 48th annual PDK survey is based on a random,representative, 50-state sample of 1,221 adults interviewed by cell or landline telephone, in English or Spanish, in April and May 2016. Previously the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup Poll, the survey now is produced for the association by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y. http://pdkpoll2015.pdkintl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PDK2016PollExecutive-Summary.pdf I think the political correlation is critical, as is mentioned in the article. Support for Common Core standards is clearly a political issue as well as one driven by an initial confusion from parents seeing it for the first time, but with Democrats in favor at a rate of 53% and Republicans at 17%, issues like state's rights vs federal power seems like as much of a motivating factor as confusion over employing mental short-cuts when doing division.
