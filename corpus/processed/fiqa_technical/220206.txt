"Yes, as long as you are not filing ""Married, Filing Separately,"" you can deduct student loan interest expense as an adjustment to income. Since your MAGI is < $60k, you can deduct the lesser of $2,500 or the actual interest expense. http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc456.html http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch04.html You didn't mention how you might file your return. If you're filing jointly in future years, the MAGI threshold prior to any phaseout is raised to $125k (for CY 2013)."
