Echoing the others, never lend money to a friend or family member, just give it to them. If you must have a contract in place then consider it a pay it forward type contract where the friend simply gives the same amount to someone in need at a future date. The value of the friendship can never be measured, but it surely will be diminished by the amount of the loan between the two of you.
