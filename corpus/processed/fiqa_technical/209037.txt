"That's increasingly untrue. Zynga products are essentially ""poke with cows"" which means that they need access to the user's social graph. That doesn't necessarily require facebook or google plus or whatever, though those platforms do make it easier. Once they have an installed base, and know the connections between users, they could move away from those sites if they had to. It's not ideal for them, but if facebook wants to impose some serious margins, it could be a viable path forward."
