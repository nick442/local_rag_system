Can anyone elaborate on her role in the company? Is she really more than a pretty face which helps the company grow revenues and attract a high valuation? I understand she is a co-founder and I'm sure that she holds a significant chunk of equity, which will make her even wealthier in the future following a liquidity event. However, I don't see how an actress with no prior technical or business schools would be helpful beyond the marketing aspect. From what I gather, it's Brian Lee who actually runs the company. Either way, I give this woman props as she has managed to transition to being an entertainer and a businesswoman at the same time.
