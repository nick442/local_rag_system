The iPad screen is big enough that it an comfortably fit the page, IMO. Also I acquire them through less than legal means, so i'm saving money there, too. Searching within textbooks is the BEST part about it, though! A good friend of mine told me the same thing you said a year ago when we had this discussion. He moved twice in the spam of a year and had to lug two boxes of books around, which sucked, he ended up downloading Kindle on his iPad, his laptop, and buying his girlfriend a Kindle, he says it made their life much easier as far as their last move is concerned but especially with finding books.
