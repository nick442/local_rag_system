This just proves when you're able to offer a physical product or service it is always a good investment. Especially because they own so much land. It's nice to see a company IPO that isn't an investment group, or an online business, but an actual producer of physical goods. And also the fact that it has a market cap of $3.3 bln, a number that looks like it can easily grow over time (citing Facebook's ~$100 bln entry point).
