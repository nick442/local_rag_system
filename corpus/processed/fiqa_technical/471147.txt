You can't have it both ways. Either in average blacks are stupider than whites or IQ is a poor measure of intelligence. There's no middle ground. A standard deviation us enough to matter statistically. That's what a standard deviation means. If IQ measures intelligence, then blacks are statistically less intelligent than whites. Individual variation is accounted for within the model. I don't believe blacks are stupider than whites, but that's because I believe that IQ is a shitty measure of intelligence and that it doesn't cross cultural barriers well. You on the other hand think it's perfect so face up to your racism and own it.
