"Yes, you've successfully proved that I think NPV and marginal utility are the same thing. Let me state this explicitly. You didn't hesitate to throw out tools that don't agree with your prescriptions. You invoked the false premise that indivuduals manually and exhaustively calculate NPV of possible decisions. Instead of refuting the points of the argument you resorted to personal attacks. That's fine, I've already lowered my expectations after reading your first comment. If NPV should be thrown out because you claim noone explictly uses it to guide their decisions what does that say about marginal utility? Why should 1 tool be thrown out but the other kept? Essentially you are saying we should keep all of the tools that confirm your absurd assertions and throw out the tools that may cast doubt on them. But hey, maybe I should ""stop acting like I know what I'm talking about"""
