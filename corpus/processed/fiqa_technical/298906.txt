I want to encourage diversity in means of producing goods so I organised subcategories by the means necessary to produce said goods, I organised categories by the same types of items that are all in a similar price range than each other, the randomiser will pick an item of the same category but of a different subcategory. (yogurt and cheese are in the same category, and same subcategory because the means of production is the same, so price change of one won't affect the economy as much)
