And now we get to live through five years of cargo-cult copies of this deck (and managers who force their team to use it as a template) because there will be people who take the article at face value and think it's all about the deck. It's not a $10M pitch deck. It's a $10M pitch team, and this is one of their tools. There were also phone calls, emails, meetings, etc. And in fact it's very likely that what closed the deal wasn't the deck, but what was said in that room.
