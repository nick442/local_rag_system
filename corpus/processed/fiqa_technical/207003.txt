"No, I think the US should be under a single payer system. Care in the US is is shitty as it is. ""It is hard to ignore that in 2006, the United States was number 1 in terms of health care spending per capita but ranked 39th for infant mortality, 43rd for adult female mortality, 42nd for adult male mortality, and 36th for life expectancy.. Comparisons also reveal that the United States is falling farther behind each year"" [New England Journal of Medicine](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0910064). Also another point I didn't mention is that most US 'middle class' families are literally only one sickness away from having to choose between medical bills or mortgage payments. I personally have had friends who had to drop out of college after their dad got sick, and I wouldn't mind paying more taxes if it meant that never happened again, or happened to my children once I start a family."
