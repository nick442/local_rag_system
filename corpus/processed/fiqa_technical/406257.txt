I couldn't tell you because I'm not American, so I've only experienced different countries during short trips. What I can say with reasonable confidence however, is that while coverage is pretty reasonable (Japan is a pretty easy country to cover with very high urban populations crammed into relatively compact spaces) speeds aren't that amazing. Where Japan excels is regular internet. Optical fiber connections of between 300 Mb to 1 Gigabit are widely available. I regularly achieve speeds of over 20 mega**bytes** per second when downloading. I think people naturally assume that this automatically translates into super fast mobile networks, but in fact Japan isn't that much better than many other countries, particularly Europe, partly because they've hung onto their old, well established, outdated networks for too long.
