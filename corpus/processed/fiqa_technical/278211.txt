That doesn't really matter. It's already figured out in the percentage. Japan makes more money but also has more debt. What does matter is that Japan has a high probability of being damaged by natural disasters and losing hundreds of billions of infrastructure and goods. Not only that but as long as global temps rise the chance of major disaster rises with it. Greece is comparatively well insulated compared to Japan. If you were to say which nation looks better at a 100+ year projection you have to consider these things. The Tsunami that hit Japan was not large by geological standards and that means Japan has a reasonable probability of near total destructing in the coming centuries. Certainly not a good place to make a long term bet on.
