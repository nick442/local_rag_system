"In California at least a little known secret is you don't have to pay traffic fines older than three years. I had my DL suspended for three years from 3thousand in bad tickets. I went to pay after I saved enough, and the nice lady said ""the law says you don't have to pay the fines over three years old and we can't legally hold your license and we legally can't report it to credit agencies or the DMV"" She got her gold star that day!! She said no one will tell you, but being nice sometimes gets you a long way. I'm sure most people take out their frustrations on her. So I paid about 1300$ and walked out a happy licenced man. Thanks to that lady!!"
