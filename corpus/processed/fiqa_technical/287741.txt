When it launched it was more 'what's *right* with Apple maps?'. Dublin airport was somewhere in the mid Pacific, etc. Of all things to get correct, maps is the one. Perhaps they've made it better - I won't check, it should never have been launched like that and such lack of care of accuracy on a *map* is reason enough not to give it a second chance when there are other maps I'm happy to trust already. It certainly doesn't bring anything new to the table.
