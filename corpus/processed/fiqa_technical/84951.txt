This isn't the movies. Killing someone's family to pressure them into DOING something for you is one thing, but that tactic doesn't work when you're trying to get someone to give you something they don't have. Let's say they kill his daughter or brother or parents, what then? How is he going to magically raise $3M? Go to a bank? Ask a friend? Tell the police? (btw, I find it interesting that his partner in that company was a police chief). It's not like he had the money but was just hiding it either. He simply had no way of paying, and they knew it, they probably worked with him for a while to get paid back and he couldn't get it done (maybe even tried gambling as the last option). Some other loan shark sure as hell isn't going to give you a loan to cover the loan you already can't pay back. They basically got fed up and decided to punish him by taking his life. Keep in mind him being killed bc of debt is purely my suspicion. It could've just been some random murder, Phili isn't the safest of places.
