Yet we are told, and I assumed, to be a profession of honor. I always thought of bankers as stodgy concervatives who DEMANDED a RESPONSIBLE borrower, not a daredevil trying to become ultra wealthy. It was a service for growth, not a confidence scam. Too many people are chasing money/wealth as opposed to service and responsible growth. With our GROWTH in population we get a growth in greedy people and predators (and parasites) who's only wish is to obtain wealth for no cost.
