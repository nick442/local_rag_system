I have no problem with H1-Bs, though if prefer the government open immigration up more generally all these folks wouldn't have to essentially be indentured servants. That said, having worked for years as a consultant doing tech-related projects at many of the world's/America's largest corporations, they are all using H1-B tech workers as cheap labor. This isn't being done in small pockets here and there. It is on a massive scale. In some companies, there are probably 5x more H1-B tech workers than there are citizens and permanent residents. These H1-B workers don't have any skills that are impossible to find otherwise (in fact, much of the time they are lower skilled). They are simply cheaper.
