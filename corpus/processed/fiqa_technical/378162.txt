Also you have to be aware that there's an academic finance which is very nice and clean and mathematical, and then there is finance how it works in the real world, which is chaotic and unpredictable. CFA books, as mentioned by another poster, would be good for learning the former, but don't expect that knowledge to be of any practical value unless you are trying to get a degree or certification. If you do want to go that route, focus more on information about individual financial products and less on financial market behavior. If you want to learn more about how the markets actually work I would have to say that it's going to be very hard without any industry experience. When I started my first job after getting my finance degree I knew absolutely nothing about how things worked. There are some good books, though more of a good story than teaching material. Try Michael Lewis.
