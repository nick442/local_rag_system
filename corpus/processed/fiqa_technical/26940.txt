"First, on Applebees: >Applebee’s is also assessing “whether the brand truly gets credit for hand-cutting steaks in the restaurant and whether we should continue with this approach,” Cywinski said. No, you don't get credit for doing that. Because we don't believe you. Your steaks aren't hand cut.. They are frozen, vacuum packed in plastic, hand opened, and hand microwaved. Just like everything else you serve. You are a liar, you don't employ chefs or even cooks, and in place of cooks, we believe that you have an army of high school sophomores in back furiously pushing buttons on the microwaves. And even if your food isn't microwaved, it tastes like it is. If it really, truly isn't and that taste is the result of actual cooking, you've got an even bigger problem. Cause cooked food isn't supposed to taste like that. You suck and your restaurant sucks. You think you deserve more affluent customers? One of the whole points of becoming more affluent is not having to eat at Applebees anymore! On IHOP: IHOP got rid of their Chorizo omelet. For that, fuck you IHOP. FUCK YOU UP THE FUCKING ASS FOR GETTING RID OF LITERALLY THE ONLY REASON TO EAT AT IHOP! I went there for breakfast just today, and they completely ruined it by not letting me have the Chorizo Omelet I went there for. You know what they replaced it with? Guess. Just guess.. A mother fucking **cheeseburger omelet.** **CHEESEBURGER. OMELET.** **IT LITERALLY COMES WITH KETCHUP, MUSTARD AND PICKLES ON A FUCKING OMELET.** ""Oh good morning! Welcome to IHOP! Would like some breakfast? Some coffee and pancakes? Yes?"" ""Would you also like if I went ahead and SQUIRTED SOME FUCKING MUSTARD ON THAT FOR YOU?!?!?! WOULD YOU LIKE SOME FUCKING PICKLES WITH YOUR COFFEE?!?!"" ""WELCOME TO BREAKFAST IN HELL MOTHERFUCKER! WELCOME TO IHOP!"" Applebees and IHOP can both fuck off and die. Bring back the Chorizo Omelet you fucking assholes!"
