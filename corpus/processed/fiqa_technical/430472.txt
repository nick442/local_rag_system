"Rating agencies are pretty garbage, the market is always a few steps ahead of them. However, India is rated lower as it has not been an economic ""power"" for a long time ans is still developing. However the market rates on bonds tell a different story, and that is that India is safer than Spain to lend to. It is also easier to go after assets in Spain a Eurozone country than India, however Indian debt in Rupees should be safer than Spanish debt in Euros as India can fire up the printer if necessary. Indian yield on the 10 year is ~ 8.5% inflation is 7.5% giving a real yield of 1% Spanish 10 year is 6.87% and Eurozone inflation is 2.4% giving a real yield of 4.47%. The market doesn't agree with S&P."
