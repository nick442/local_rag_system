BoA was coerced into buying Countrywide by the Fed, to try to keep the housing industry from falling apart. It didn't work, but it did make for a more managed failure. After the sale, BoA and the Fed found out just how screwed up Countrywide was, after BoA had assumed financial liability. Now that BoA has sorted things out a bit and has money, New York is going after a bit of the damages caused by Countrywide in the first place. EDIT: [This is the guy](http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-197.htm) that caused the mess in the first place. Probably should have been some jail time along with his record fine though.
