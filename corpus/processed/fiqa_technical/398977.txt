So, you don't necessarily have to have your job be your life to work in finance. That's good to know, and makes sense, since surely there aren't enough Type A's to populate an entire, large, industry. Man, I don't understand how one could work 100 hours a week for more than maybe one week. It would seem like basic needs such as sleep would become difficult with that level of work.
