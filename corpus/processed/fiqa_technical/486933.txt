It’s like you don’t listen to what I say, and instead listen to a narrative in your head that you are thinkzing I’m saying. If you look back, what, two posts from me ago, I specifically say I don’t want either of those options. Take back control? How is giving control to the market taking my back control? There is no control there at all! If I say, “Okay kids, your parents are corrupt. You can policevyourself now.” that isn’t taking back control! That’s giving up all pretense of control! If Obama and Bush picked and chose their rules, then we have a bigger problem, because that means we have an anarchist nation. But Trump is following the same abuses of power! WTF are we doing in Niger? Why are we attacking Iran? Why isn’t Trump pushing for more accountability, and instead wants more Market Freedom? This is hipocracy!
