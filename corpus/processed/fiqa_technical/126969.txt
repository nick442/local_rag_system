Hear that cackling off in the distance? That's Delta laughing their asses off and eating AA's lunch. Delta's not a demonstrably superior airline, normally, but they now have more destinations, fewer delayed/cancelled flights, and, uh, none of the cluster**** issues AA is dealing with now. I'm a platinum business traveler, and Delta matched my status and then some to steal me away a while back. Pretty much the same story with all the other frequent biz travelers I know.
