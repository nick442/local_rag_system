That's not the debate here. I get your point, but the issue was on-the-go charging. It takes time, it's an inconvenience, but it's not insurmountable. Asserting because YOUR use patterns mean you don't need to recharge en-route = it charges in 5 seconds is simply wrong. Personally I can't wait for an EV. Likely will be a motorcycle for me first, followed by an eGolf / Bolt / etc down the road.
