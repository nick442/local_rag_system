Lacking in any nuance as well.. For a while, the trend has been that more generic / flow products are on the downswing for profitability (while some individual traders are still outliers), but the stuff that is not able to be commoditized is actually paying more in many cases. Essentially, follow the money, and look at more than the surface.
