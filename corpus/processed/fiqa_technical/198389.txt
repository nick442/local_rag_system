">Single payer is simply meaning you pay one outlet for your care. So I go to ER and have surgery with overnight stay. I would have 10 or so different bills under the current system or with single payer one bill with the details. No, it's not. And with that description it makes sense why you think ""what's the big deal with single payer??"". Single payer is where the State pays for all healthcare, through tax funding and other revenue generation programs. Single payer is absolutely *not* that you only have to pay one bill to a single institution - I don't even think there's a term for that but if there were it would be Single-Pay*ee* not ""single-payer"". Regardless, single-payer actually just refers to state-funded healthcare. Think medicaid for *everyone* regardless of income levels. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare"
