Do you know what a derivative is? Did you know it is possible to own derivatives of assets that you do not own? Did you know there are derivatives of derivatives? Did you know that the derivatives market is many times larger than all the money on earth? At some point modern markets became so many steps removed from the basic principles of business that they no longer make any sense. Most trades today are done by supercomputers with high speed connections running incredibly complex algorithms invented by the most brilliant mathematicians money can buy. All of whom are studying what each other are doing and trying to manipulate each others algorithms in such a way as to make money faster and harder than the other guy. It is way beyond what any human can comprehend let alone regulate. Teams of the smartest people on earth can kind of grasp a tiny sliver of what is going on.
