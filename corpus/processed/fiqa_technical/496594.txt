"I find myself being very skeptical about robotics' use in society. I think robotics will splinter off into many different specifically designed forms. the ""irobot"" dream of a humanoid robot doing all the menial tasks that humans don't want to do will never happen. Instead, there will be robots designed for specific tasks, because that specific design will be better for that purpose than any generally designed robot will. Also, AI will solve most of the use cases that i see robotics used for and it will not require the expensive electronics and manufacturing required."
