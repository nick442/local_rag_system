It seems ideal to have the employment be all about both income and ethics, but the problem is that for most people in the industry more often at one point or another they will have to choose between their income or their ethics. Ethics should always hold supremacy over personal gain. Because ethics maintain the relationships (formal and informal) between entities involved in the markets. Without those long term relationships, there is no room for trust and therefore no reason to be willingness for entities to exchange with one another **fairly**. If you don't have a overall fair financial markets, on the long term it will hurt the overall economy, why? Because people will have no trust in buying equity prices, there will be no trust in prospects. People will save most of their money in cash and outright avoid anything or everything about investing. If there are less clients, there is less capital for the entire industry. The trust of the aggregate non-active investing clients with the capital range between 100k-500 million matters. And to make it common knowledge to hold personal gain above them is not a good way to have them keep their money in the markets.
