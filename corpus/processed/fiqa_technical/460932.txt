You are being extremely aggressive and I don't understand why, I've been pretty level headed. I agreed with the central point that the rate is too high, but I also think all loopholes and tax breaks should be removed. I also agree that chasing profits made in other countries is silly and is obviously a major contributor in the issue of inversion. I just simply disagree that our largest companies are paying the highest taxes in the world, when the data I've seen clearly shows that other countries with lower rates are still collecting more. If our rate is the highest, but we still collect less than the average, tell me how these large corporations are being effectively taxed at the highest rate in the developed world? What am I missing?
