I spent a year at the Democratic National Convention as an intern. It sucked in more ways than one. I come from nothing, putting myself through school, management at my coffeeshop and I am still in school. Everyone else was there only because they knew someone in politics and no matter that I should up everyday with a positive attitude, a willingness to work, and going above and beyond. I was interviewed for the position of human resources coordinator and instead it went to the best friend's daughter of the HR director. So yeah. I feel ya. Oh, one last thing. It was all unpaid. Just stick with it man, you wont always be in a job you like.
