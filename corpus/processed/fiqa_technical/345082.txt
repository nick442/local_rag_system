I resisted the SUV thing for a long time but I got one recently. There's no way to go back. I can finally see in traffic again they way I used to back when there were just normal sized cars on the road. I do actually believe the government should have set a maximum height for passenger cars so they'd all be mostly the same (a huge safety issue IMO). But that didn't happen so fuck it, I'm in an SUV. Mostly drives like a car anyway, better ground clearance, the car parks itself, I'm happy. It's like driving a tall car.
