"Heh, that reminds me of the ""mutant"" disproof of God. God is theoretically perfect. If God is perfect, he has laser eyes. If man is made in God's image, he should also have laser eyes. Man does not have laser eyes. In conclusion, no perfect God. The logic is wonky, but the argument always makes me smile."
