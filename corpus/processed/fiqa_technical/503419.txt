"You're probably not going to be able to get a loan from any kind of bank if your credit is bad. On top of bad credit if you don't own a home or car that only decreases your chances of getting a loan. On top of all this you don't have a job. I don't mean to be blunt but I don't see any way you could get a loan from a bank of any kind. Also what makes this business a good investment? Have you read over the business plan? Have you looked over financials to see what your investment would be helping with? Are you familiar with the legality of the business and make sure they have proper documentation. There's no guarantees in business and you saying there's all this free money out there is honestly not true. Do your homework, don't just throw your money into something because there is ""free money"". Also money and friends is not kosher at all i would not suggest borrowing that kind of money from anyone close to you. One last question, will you be a part owner in this business if you invest this kind of money?"
