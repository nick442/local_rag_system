> And did you find my previous post alarming? Now you don't even understand simple definitions. I'm sure your commentary on our national economic system is top notch. >Sometimes I post something, only to realize a day later, I said something very ignorant. The flip side of it is, if I had kept silent, I may still hold some of my wrong beliefs. Those aren't the only two options. At least you understand how little you understand. The key is to ask questions about things that don't make sense to you. At least then you might learn something instead of misleading others who don't realize how ignorant you are.
