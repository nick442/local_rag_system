1.) Corporations are very lean. They can't cut any jobs because all the jobs they were able to cut have been cut. 2.) They pay the lowest wages possible without causing mass turnover. 3.) They have already added all the global customers who can still pay for their service or product. But, they can still turn a profit if they invite illegals to do the work for 5 dollars an hour. So don't worry investors. There is still one more thing you can exploit.
