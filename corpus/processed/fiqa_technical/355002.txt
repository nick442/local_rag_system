> the meal has become more expensive and also shrunk in size and quality > So, like every other place that serves food? Not like every place. McDonald's food has decreased in quality and prices have gone up. There are too many fingers in the pie - corporate, shareholders and franchisees are all trying to get the most money out of it. So prices go up and they slash and slash the quality. I live in Arizona. Here, McDonald's has priced itself *above* offerings from small independent restaurants. For the price of a Big Mac combo, I can have a sit-down meal at a real restaurant with much, much better quality. If I want to spend less, I can get takeout for less than McDonald's. The takeout will have more food that is of higher quality. There's no reason to go to McDonald's. None. You can get better food at a lower price. No wonder they're suffering.
