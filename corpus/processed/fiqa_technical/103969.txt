frankly, it's got very good advice. It teaches you how to look at your purchases of assets and determine which are truly investments (2nd home rented out) vs those that are not (the ones you live in, don't count on appreciation). Gives you a very simple but very clear method of accounting your expenses for becoming financially independent. Things that are simple and you probably know but he puts it in a way that allows you to focus on it more clearly. However, it is not a get rich quick scheme. It doesn't tell you which gimmicks to become rich, just how to manage your investments clearly. His later books are all a money grab and you can see him start to drift to the dark side of greed.
