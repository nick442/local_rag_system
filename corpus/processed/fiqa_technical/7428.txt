> How do I guarantee that people are held liable for damages and/or trying to steal the stuff? Would a credit card number be sufficient? This might belong more in /r/entrepreneur or /r/business, however.. you could do a few things: 1. The renter's agreement can (and imo should) include language that obligates the renter to pay for damaged goods and/or stipulates a fixed charge for non-return. 2. As part of the terms to rent, you can demand a credit card hold as part of the renter's agreement. 3. You can insure your rented goods, either in addition to the above or as an alternative (note: because the goods will be changing hands multiple times throughout its life, there is a higher chance of insurance claims. This fact will likely mean higher insurance payments).
