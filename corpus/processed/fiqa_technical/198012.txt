Here at taap.it we support local businesses and efforts that they partake in every day existence. Our motto to “live local” is backed up by over 5,000 bakeries, electronic shops, and t-shirt stores that are signed up with us and use our services. We strongly speak out against conglomerates and monopolies that try to destroy the experience of shopping in your neighborhood. We are passionate about the cause and have started to lobby New York politicians to inform them about this precedent and our voice will not be unheard. Join the revolution in the way you shop! Join small businesses that truly care about their customers and not senseless machines that try to make as much profit as possible! Join taap.it!
