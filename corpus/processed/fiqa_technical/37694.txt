Do you know what you're interested in? Sounds like you're focused on debt/equities with your certifications and past experience. Do you want to stay in that field or do you want to try other finance related activities? The first I cannot comment on and the second may require a pivot of your career (and potential earnings change). It really depends on if you're generally happy doing what you're doing today or not.
