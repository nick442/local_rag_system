Again, I get it but you can't honestly argue that random people or companies deciding which regulation they want to follow is at all good. You agreed this time but what about next time? The one after that? You can already see this problem. You summarily dismissed zoning laws because 'they aren't comparable' but that's your opinion. You, apparently, think that Uber can just decide it doesn't like them so does that mean YOU just get to decide what is and isn't comparable. That's not how this works.
