I'm on the other end of the spectrum. I'll never buy an e-book, I don't like reading off a screen. But that's only part of the issue. You can't trade e-books, you can't put e-books in your library, and you can't buy used e-books. If you don't have a charger and you run out of battery, you're screwed. My biggest thing is I can't put them on bookshelves..I have a mini library starting and I really enjoy having physical books around I can pick and choose from whenever I feel like reading. For me, the only e-books worth considering are textbooks. I keep 5 textbooks on my iPad and it lightens my load considerably. I can bring them all to my classes and not have to lug around 20 lbs of books. But the difference with textbooks and books I read for fun are that I don't keep my textbooks around when I'm done with them.
