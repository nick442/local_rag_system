Well it goes without saying that you aren't trying to get one over on the company you're complaining about. I had an icemaker that I paid a crazy amount of money for and the company refused to admit that 5 service within calls six months of installation was out of the ordinary. One complaint to the BBB and suddenly they were tripping over themselves to send out a new unit. Was still a piece of shit, gave up, bought a $200 ice maker from walmart and have never had a problem. But between BBB and chargebacks I've stopped eating shitty company behavior.
