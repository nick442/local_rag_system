> Second, ensure your product experience is outstanding, creating ongoing repeat from happy consumers. TiVo's customer experience IS outstanding. I have been a loyal TiVo DVR user since 2003 and their interface and feature set is greatly superior to the junk DVRs that the cable companies provide. The problem for TiVo seems to be overcoming the convenience and cost benefits that the cable company provides with their inferior product. What would have been an ideal business model for TiVo would have been to get cable companies to offer TiVo boxes - or cable boxes with the TiVo interface, perhaps as an upsell product from ther basic DVR. I honestly believe that if a user tried a TiVo for a short period of time they would choose to pay a little extra for it.
