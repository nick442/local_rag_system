Since I am no longer a minor, can I start contributing to this account right away and claim tax relief for my contributions? Yes Do I need to submit some paperwork to the bank Not to my knowledge. Best check with Bank. What will be the features of such a PPF account with respect to maturity, withdrawals, interest, tax on interest, etc. No difference. i.e. the Account would continue, as it was opened 10 years back, it would mature in another 5 years. You can extend this by a block of 5 years as long as required. The withdrawals are tax free in your hands including interest.
