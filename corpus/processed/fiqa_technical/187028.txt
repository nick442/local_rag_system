"No, this really doesn't happen. When states buy power from that great a distance, they really are only buying renewable ""credits"". The electricity is not actually directed through 16,000+ miles (NY <-> CO) of cables. That would be incredibly inefficient. When a state needs power, not merely credits, they buy from one of their neighbors."
