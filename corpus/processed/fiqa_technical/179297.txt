I've just finished reading The Power of Habit, by Charles Duhigg. A great book using the scientific explanations behind how habits are formed to look at how this can impact management skills and change organisational habits. Lots of great anecdotes. I run My Business Book Club - a website which offers book recommendations and starter discussion questions. We've got lots more suggestions here: http://mybusinessbookclub.com
