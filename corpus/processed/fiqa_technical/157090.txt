**Very Misleading** redditor title: nothing in the article talks about the 'industry at risk'. Here's what it *does* state: >But there is tremendous variation in an individualâ€™s response [to various diet plans]. Some might gain the weight back, some might not, but nothing in the article states that the 'industry' is 'at risk'. [UPDATE: this article is like sound-bite heaven. You could probably make a dozen different redditor submissions from the sensationalist style that the article writer uses]
