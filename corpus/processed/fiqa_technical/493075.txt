The government gets part of it. The remainder: Borrower relief will be in the form of mortgage modifications, including first-lien principal and forbearance forgiveness and second-lien extinguishments, low- to moderate-income mortgage originations, and community reinvestment and neighborhood stabilization efforts, with initiatives focused on communities experiencing, or at risk of, urban blight. This includes lien releases, uninhabitable and abandoned property demolition, and remediation and property donations. Also, Bank of America will support the expansion of available affordable rental housing. Bank of America has committed to complete delivery of the relief by no later than August 31, 2018. The consumer relief will be subject to oversight by an independent monitor. - See more at: http://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/corporate-and-financial-news/bank-america-reaches-comprehensive-settlement-us-departm#sthash.AR7aJl3o.dpuf
