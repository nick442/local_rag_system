"You're welcome. I think what Trump could do is give a deep discount to federal employees. Many hotels already do this. Make the price the lowest in DC. That would go a long way to diffuse this type of conflict. I honestly don't think he's trying to profit from his office. He's even donated his salary to the Federal Park system. Trump has a huge ego. He's said stupid things. But if I was to rank ""most evil presidents"" it would be the Bush's and Cheney. They were war mongers and war profiteers. Reagan and his trickle down economics was bad too. Trump would be pretty far down that list. If Trump drags us into an unnecessary war, that would definitely change my opinion of him."
