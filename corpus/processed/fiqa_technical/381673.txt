I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this statement. As a libertarian myself, the only thing that's really surprising to me is that it was Keynes who said it. It's pretty much standard fare for liberterian socioeconomic thought to decry corporatism / rent-seeking while simultaneously praising industriousness and capitalism as we understand it to be. All this is saying to me is that Keynes *understood* what capitalism was, but recommended what he recommended anyhow. Which is unfortunate, but not really surprising now that I think about it given how the Chicago School operates in general.
