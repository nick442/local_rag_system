"Scammers know you're not stupid enough to fall for this. So when you balk, he'll understand and offer to send you a check. When he sends you a check, he'll say cash it, keep $XXX for yourself, then forward him the rest for some other expense (or even possibly send it to someone else). Know in advance that that's a scam, too. When his fake check bounces you'll already be out the money and he'll be long gone. ""If it's too good to be true, it probably is"""
