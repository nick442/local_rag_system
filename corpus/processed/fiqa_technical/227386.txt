"Financially speaking, you are absolutely right. But there are lots of conflicting messages out there that can't be boiled down to economics: EX: >""Why aren't you giving your grandmother children before she dies?"" >""I bought a house at 23. Why are you still renting?"" >""Who is going to take care of your parents when we they get old?"" >""If you don't have X by age Y, then there's something wrong with you"" Everyone had their own life, with their own circumstances. One person's formula for success might not work for others through no fault of their own. I have a very good friend who will never be successful in the eyes of her family until she is married with children. She works at Bank of China and makes a ton more than I do. This is not to mention all of the industries promoting *their* product as the benchmark for achieving life goals. From real estate to jewellery, these industries can't survive off of the super wealthy alone, and they don't care what poor decisions customers make so long as it's poor decisions buying their products. All I'm saying it's we shouldn't be blaming the deer for dying when the forest is covered in traps."
