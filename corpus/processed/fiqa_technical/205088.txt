As non-EU citizen who went to university in England and also doing an MBA in Spain, I can assure you they are not hard to get. It literally is filling out a form. I went to university in England because of England's strong university status and I went to university in Spain because I wanted to improve my Spanish. I'm sure a small percentage of people will maybe go to a different country due to having to fill out a visa application (maybe. We don't know if U.K. will allow visa-free studies for EU), but we don't have any way to measure the *possible* impact (if it even happens) right now. If visas were such a hurdle then why do so many students from around the world come to the USA and Canada to study? They do it because US and Canada have some of the best universities in the world and students want to improve their English - all factors that British universities still have. I get it. You don't like Brexit. But just try and look at it objectively.
