The program placed orders in 25-millisecond bursts involving about 500 stocks, according to Nanex, a market data firm. The algorithm never executed a single trade, and it abruptly ended at about 10:30 a.m. ET Friday. So it changed its mind every single time? That's either a bug or it's front running. I think it's front running no matter how you look at it. If I ran the SEC, I'd put in place a rule that says all orders must stand for 2 seconds before they can be cancelled. That's enough time for humans to react in the market. This 25 ms for 500 stocks is nonsense. That's just front running to defraud real investors and make money on very small differences in price millions of times a day. It distorts the markets and does no good for anyone except the brokerage that is running the scam.
