I fear it's too far gone at this point. When I was a kid in the 70s & 80s, Sears was probably the main place we shopped. I always loved when the Christmas Wish Book arrived, meant it was time to start on my letter to Santa. These days, the few times I wander into a Sears it's sad, it's often a disheveled mess and there's barely any customers.
