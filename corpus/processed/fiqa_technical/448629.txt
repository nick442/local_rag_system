On the flip side of that, those employees that you are so passionate about protecting will now be out of a job because no one will go to the restaurant. Isn't that the end game of a campaign such as yours? Which is better, a low paying shitty job or no job at all? This is the financial reality we are in. And please don't take this as me advocating their practices-- I disagree strongly with them, however there are two sides to the coin here.
