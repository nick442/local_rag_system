Indeed you are correct sir. But my response would be: does the customer/regulator not also have a model? And can a financial company exist without these two stakeholders explicit endorsement? Models always have assumptions: the key is figuring out what they are and why they should or shouldn't be made. I would argue that any investor sophisticated enough to be stooging around with leveraged ETFs, CDS index tranches, or illiquid long dated interest rate swaps better have a damn good reason to buy 'em..and if their model breaks is that the fault of the bank or the customer?
