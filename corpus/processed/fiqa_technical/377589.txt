Sears has pretty good prices on appliances, TVs, and sears/kmart's deals on video games are great (they go as far as to directly post to cheapassgamer.com, even). They have some good things about their business that they could focus on, get a little quality control/ratings on the resellers they have on their website and they might be able to get more success.
