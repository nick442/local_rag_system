For those interested, here is what I have managed to find fo far: [Communist Robot](http://www.communistrobot.com/index.php?page=&nav=1&article=1) [Robotic Nation](http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm) [Robots are taking mid-level jobs, changing the economy](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9221334/Robots_are_taking_mid_level_jobs_changing_the_economy) [Agricultural Robots â€“ Applications and Economic Perspectives](http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/5324/InTech-Agricultural_robots_151_applications_and_economic_perspectives.pdf) (PDF documant). [Economists Grapple With the First Stage of the Robot Revolution](http://www.economonitor.com/blog/2010/09/economists-grapple-with-the-first-stage-of-the-robot-revolution/) (with many external links to relevant articles). And one last thought for Gigolo Joe and Gigolo Jane in AI: [How would robotic prostitutes change the sex tourism industry?](http://io9.com/5902113/how-would-robotic-prostitutes-change-the-sex-tourism-industry) (Edited for additions).
