Honestly man, that's awesome. I'm super happy you have a great job and a caring company. I've been out of school now for a year and at my current career just over a year. They haven't offered me an increase yet, but I know I could snag another job and make 40% more. It's tough knowing that no matter what they can't / won't match it. Granted I'm probably at a different level /seniority of my career then you, but I speak for my current market and those in my age group (<25) it's much more lucrative to move out and up then stay within. Edit: and their business model is to hire outside rather than promote (don't ask me..)
