Yea there stock dropped big deal, their former CEO ken Lewis made a massive about of money during the sub prime era. Not to mention the massive amount of money Anglo mazillo made at country wide which BOA took over. When BOA foreclosed on people's homes they made even more money selling homes. when the ended mark to mark accounting in march of 09 they got bad assets off their balance sheet. The stock price means crap, the price of a stock is what the public values u at, make no question they are and have been making money. As far as ur communist reference u can go fuck yourself I work on the street I don't have time to search the web for the knowledge I've collected working in the industry.
