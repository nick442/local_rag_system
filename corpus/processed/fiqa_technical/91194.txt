One thing is for sure, no matter how you look at it, Obama's 8 years will prove to be lost years in America. Gridlocked congress, Health Care Reform, and the inevitable double dip recession/ depression will be the blame, and most of it will be directed towards the policies of the last 16 years. I used to be a stone cold republican. Super Conservative. That is when I thought I had the entire world ahead of me. Now, with having to work a minimum wage job, and paying back my student loans to clear my debt, my views have changed a little I want to believe that America will take their eyes away from Fox News and MSNBC and look outside of both the Dems and GOP point of view, and invite a third party into the discussion. I believe the Libertarians may be able to bridge the gap. Most Americans would fit their beliefs and political platform, and they do raise some great questions. I just hope it does not get sabotage by the extremest like the tea party did. But in short, if their is no unity, and a split in America, things could get ugly by 2018.
