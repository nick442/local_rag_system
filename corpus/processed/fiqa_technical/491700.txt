If by exempt, you're just referring to the fact that the income is less than your standard deduction and personal exemption, then yes, that money can be used to fund a Roth. Great time to do it. To be clear, in 2014 the limit for an under 50 year old, is $5500 ($6500 if 50 or older). Only earned income may be used for deposits. No interest, dividends, etc.
