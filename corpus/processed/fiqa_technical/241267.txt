Is your argument that a company should be responsible for paying an employee enough to support whatever lifestyle that employee chooses? Because that's definitely what it sounds like you're arguing for. The minimum wage should be exactly $0. If you don't have the skills to earn enough to support yourself, then you need better skills not laws forcing someone to pay you more money.
