I understand why people think its wrong, but I don't blame Apple for doing this. Right or wrong the way our financial system works businesses must be growing or they will start to die. Also, Apple is not responsible for the laws of the nations it does business in. They could take a moral stand, but then that would be open them to a lot of hypocrisy. I mean, Tim Cook and Apple might be against the death penalty, does that mean they can't do business in the US? Besides, removal of the apps from the store does not mean people can't find ways to install VPN apps. I don't think Apple should be responsible for taking a stand against the laws of a country. That's for the people in those countries to do.
