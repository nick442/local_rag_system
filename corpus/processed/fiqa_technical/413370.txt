I don't think you understand the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect does not allow a bank to loan out more money than they have. The multiplier effect is the theory that when a bank loans out money, that money will come back to the bank in the form of a deposit, which they can loan out again. With this banking idea, if there were enough popularity, then when they loan out money, they could be getting it back in the form of deposits, that they can lend out again.
