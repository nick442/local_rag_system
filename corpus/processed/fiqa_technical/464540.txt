You may feel like your not learning anything but the amount of doors that remain closed to you without a degree is very large. You can go directly into the work force but your potential to grow in salary will be a lot less than with a degree in addition to starting at a lower wage. This also depends a bit on the field you go into. I would recommend either staying in school or going to a trade school. Shorter amount of time, less money, and you'll be working quicker with room for growth. If you want to stay in school take it upon yourself to learn more. Study up applicable things. Joint career focused organization. Your additional skills will show on your resume and soon after joining the workforce.
