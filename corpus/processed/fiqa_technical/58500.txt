Problem is that in California it's up to the lawyer to prove that the employee is lying. So if an employer is sloppy as was probably the case here the employees can say whatever the fuck they want to say and it's considered the truth until proven otherwise. Just writing down all the hours you supposedly worked the night before reporting it to the labor board is sufficient. Had an employee once that lied their ass off. Overwhelmingly proved they were lying. Still had to pay legal fees in the thousands of dollars (while they get everything free). And they can continue to do this as many times as they want for up to three years after their termination as long as each time it's a different complaint (in theory someone bored and persistent enough could bankrupt a small business this way with no and I mean no recourse whatsoever) Fuck California.
