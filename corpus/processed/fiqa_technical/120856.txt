Transparency. If I need materials to build a house or food from a restaurant, I can get up front pricing easily. With healthcare, you have to jump through flaming hoops to get an idea of what you're going to pay. Also, healthcare costs are very negotiable and consumers don't realize this. There aren't a lot of B2C businesses that accept bargaining and negotiation as a part of doing business, unlike B2B so the consumer assumes that the quoted price is the final price. You can always negotiate things with your healthcare (for example I negotiated my dental bill before agreeing the to service).
