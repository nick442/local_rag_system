I think you're mixing up being incorporated with being public. A corporation is just a financially separate organization from the owner(s). There might be only one owner, but the company's assets are separated from the person's. A public company is one entity whose ownership is on the market - a shareholder can sell his or her portion easily. A company that decides it no longer wants to be public just becomes a private corporation, with ownership of its own assets, but with a few owners, not many.
