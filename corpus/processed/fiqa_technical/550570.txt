"This is a technical term referring to the ""double entry""-styled book keeping of trades by brokers. Suppose a client executes a buy order with their broker. The broker's accounting for this ""trade"" will be recorded as two different ""deals"" : One ""deal"" showing the client as buyer and the broker as seller, and a second ""deal"" showing the broker as buyer and the clearing house as seller. The net result of these two deals is that the broker has no net position while the client has a net buy and the clearing house has a net sell with respect to this broker's account as accounted for internally by the broker. (And the same methods apply for a client sell order.) The client/broker ""deal"" record - i.e., the client side of the trade - is called the ""client side booking"", while the broker/clearing house ""deal"" record is called the ""street side booking""."
