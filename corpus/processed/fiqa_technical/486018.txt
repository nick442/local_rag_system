Actually, I hate /r/politics but I think this is a great forum for this topic. This should what happens when you treat your customers poorly. I was one of those individuals that moved from Bank of America to USAA and I would do it again. Banks got away from the original business model and became investment banks and they suffered as a result. I would love to hear a more refined business perspective on this.
