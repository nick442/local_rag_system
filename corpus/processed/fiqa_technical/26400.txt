You fully support the free market. Good for you. I support the worker over the corporation. What the fuck is the point of having a job(s!) which don't support you? You can go on and on about market equilibrium or whatever. Flat out I support raising the minimum wage. I support ending corporate welfare. I think this country has the means to support anyone willing to work as hard as her to make sure she and her kids have the very basics. Define value for me.. Not everyone worships money or the 'free' market. I get what sub were on. Maybe you're a super practical person. But try and imagine you have her life. No life is not fair, slavery wasn't fair but humans tried to put an end to that. If you think it's ok for this to be how it is, we have nothing to speak further about. And to your hypothetical- no I cannot come up with a number, congratulations. Bet if you went over to personal finance, gave them a location for this hypothetical, they would come up with a smaller range of numbers than you think. Also the argument that a teenager doesn't need to be paid a living wage is ridiculous. It's the exact argument that's been used to under pay women. Maybe empathizing on this scenario is beyond you.
