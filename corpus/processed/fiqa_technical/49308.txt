I would say that the WebMD's sellers are getting a good deal, to be bought out in cash (of certain value) rather than in stocks in KKR / Internet Brands that are of uncertain value (because you can't sell the lot overnight without affecting the price; you have to drip feed the stock onto the market slowly over months or years, and who knows that they'll be worth by the time you've managed to sell them). In *The Intelligent Investor* Benjamin Graham is quite critical of management funding acquisitions by the dilution of stock. Acquisitions seem to be KKR's raison d'Ãªtre, however.
