Since you say you are a student, perhaps you should look carefully at the requirements for contributing to an IRA, whether Traditional or Roth. Unless Congress changed the law recently, one has to have earned income to contribute to an IRA. So if you were a teaching or research asssistant receiving W-2 wages while completing your Master's degree, you are eligible, but if you had a fellowship you are not eligible (unless you had other income, whether W-2 wages or self-employment income reported on Schedule C). The amount that one can contribute is the smaller of your earned income and $5000 ($6000 for 50 and older people).
