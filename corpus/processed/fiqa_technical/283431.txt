"The _only_ commercials that work on me are fast food ones. And usually only when I'm sitting on the couch thinking, ""I'm hungry. I don't want to make something."" and even then, it's a crap-shoot. The idea fast-food commercial for me would be a side-scrolling list of menu items with names underneath the name of the place to eat. So I could go ""Ooh! Jack in the Box tacos!"" (not that I ever would.) I don't give two shits about ""funny"" or ""edgy"" commercials, etc."
