"If you do so in proportions to match juice, then yeah, you have juice (with added colorings, which are listed in the ingredients). There's a reason there are limits, and that's to prevent such pedantry as what you suggest. There are small losses or gains allowed. Rarely does any industry hit things dead on. For example, when making ham, one can add water (brine), and then cook the product, and as long as the finished product is not more than 0.9% from the original weight of the ham, it isn't ""water added."" It's pretty amazing what modern equipment can do, but I still can't hit the green weight dead on every time."
