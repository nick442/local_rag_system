Going to the grocery store, while a pain, still seems less painful than trying to find and order stuff online, and then having to wait around for the delivery. I can go to the grocery store and back in an hour and I'll know immediately if they didn't have something, I can make substitutions, I know different brands/names of things are okay, etc. Fiddling around trying to make sure they get the right Thai chili paste or suitable kalamata olives seems like more trouble than it is worth.
