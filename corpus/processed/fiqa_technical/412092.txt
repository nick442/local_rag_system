That argument seems pretty false. Companies will compete and try to always undercut each other. I have never seen one actual study where prices rose on par when the minimum wage was increased. They of course will increase but it will still be below what is costs now. Mainly it takes money from the larger corporations and gives it to the people. I do agree prices will rise, but since TONS of companies already hire illegals where are we going to be hit? Produce will be slightly from stock boys who dont make that much. For the most part all menial jobs are always using illegal workers.
