I don't think all MBAs are useless, but this quality of an MBA is depends heavily on the institution that issued the qualification. I have seen many MBAs incapable of managing, disrupting existing well-functioning teams, who got their degree at an obscure institution. But I have also seen management geniuses with an MBA from a top shelf institution. An MBA is not a goal, but a small tool. That's key IMO.
