I 100% agree with you. You have to have a really strong bank acquire the shitty bank, the concept is that the strong bank has the capital reserves and loan loss provisions to absorb and write off the bad debt. Hopefully if shit goes right then in 5-6 years you now have written off or restructured the bad loans and have double the assets. Kinda like how Santander bought Banco Popolare recently. However, I dunno how that's going to work in India as it's a shit bank buying a shit bank. You kinda need the government to step in and recapitalize the banks which is going to suck, IMF says it could cost up to 2% of the country's GDP to do it.
