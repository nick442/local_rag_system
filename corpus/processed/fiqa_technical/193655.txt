>offering nothing in return Well, we have no idea about what else the contracts stipulates. It may have all kinds of attractive features that make it worthwhile for someone to sign it. Perhaps access to a spa, complementary champagne, access to a nice beach, live musicians, jumping the scheduled list to get your wedding sooner, it could be anything. The libel example was just to show that the ability to speak freely, as you pointed out, has a value (which can be very high negative numbers if you say the wrong thing). This clause is not about proving libel or first amendment rights. Contracts can have all kinds of stipulations in them, you have to be a certain weight, have certain colored hair styles, stay away from certain places, partake (or not) in particular behaviours. You can sign all kinds of contracts willingly that penalize you financially for doing things that nobody would legally be able to force you to do without a contract.
