> But the big banks are not 'people you know'. They are legal persons just the same as a private individual, with exactly the same rights a natural person would get when signing the contract. Otherwise, they would never loan you any money in the first place. > They will take from you all they can legally get (or less than legally if they can get away with it). That sounds so human I have a hard time finding any difference to my last carpenter. > They follow the coldly rational, impersonally merciless path of greatest profit in the most immediate term, without the slightest concern for your humanity or needs. My humanity and needs do not exactly entice me into first making a contract, reaping all the benefits in it, and then breaking it when it becomes inconvenient to hold up my end of the bargain. If banks lose money, some very real people lose money because they trusted me. Besides, if banks are so evil, why would I ever do any business with them?
