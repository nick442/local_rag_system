I have always assumed that there is a regulation that either prohibits, or makes noncompetitive, internet bank business accounts. All of the 1%+ savings accounts offered at the banks listed are internet only. If you broaden the search to include other internet only banks like Capital One 360, American Express Savings, Goldman Sachs Savings, Discover Savings, you'll find they all also only offer accounts to individuals (some may allow a trust to own the account) not businesses.
