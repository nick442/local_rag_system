Even if they did publish historical usage rates, those numbers might not be relevant. The previous resident may have been an energy hog who left appliances on 24x7, or a luddite who sweated out the summers rather than turning on the A/C. Beyond that, I've lived in Kansas my whole life, and have never found a good method for estimating utility costs. The best I've been able to do is track expenses month by month to get an average. But one year we have a mild winter, then the next we'll have a week of sub-freezing temperatures, and the estimates from the previous year are worthless.
