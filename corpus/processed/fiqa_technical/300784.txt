"I agree! But what are you going to do about jobs where ""a bachelor degree is required""? P/S: once, to be a teller in the bank, you did not need to finish high school, but you needed to know how to add numbers. Today, you can't be a teller unless you have a bachelor degree. You know why? Why not? Too many people have degrees, so, let's require a bachelor degree."
