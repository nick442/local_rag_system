Unless it's an international flight, first class flights are remotely better than economy. Yes wider seats, food's better, and you are attended to - but all the psychological side-effects are still the same. Travel across timezones, or in the same zone on a 3+ hour flight (add and extra 60mins-120 in airport wait times), it takes the same toll. Business and First Class just make you hate Economy more when it's your only option.. But it's shitty either way.
