"Call me rude, but I would be less concerned with taxes and more concerned with increasing your income. Double your income and say ""fuck you"" to the taxes! Also, I'm no expert on taxes, but a corporation would not prevent you from having income so you would likely be passing the profits through and still paying the same income tax rate."
