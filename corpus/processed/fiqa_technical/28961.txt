>Would businesses make infrastructure if they had to? Yes. Would it benefit all users equally and would they allow anyone (including competitors) to use the infrastructure they built? Not likely. It doesn't necessarily look like say Wal-Mart building roads between it's stores. It could be a company coming in and building roads and then charging a toll to drive on them. I don't think that is unreasonable at all and it would cause those who are getting the most benefit from the road to pay the most in and those getting the least benefit to pay the least in. If there is profit to be made, then someone will perform the task.
