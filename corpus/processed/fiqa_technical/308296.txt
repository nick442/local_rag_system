Right, but compared to the crimes of the monopoly (government), who threatens us with enslavement (prison) if we don't give them collectively $Trillions to waste in wars we don't want, and welfare checks to stupid people (rather than the actual circumstantial-needy, those who would get our sympathy help in the absence of govt welfare). Any and all criticism towards business is dwarfed by the fact that we have much, much, much less control over the government than we do over a company we voluntary give our money to. Did you know that since 1955, 89% of companies that were on the Forbes 400 are no longer on that list?
