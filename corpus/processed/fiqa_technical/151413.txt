"Good. It's created a redneck capitalist conundrum. They either realize that they pay shit wages and need to up their hourly to attract ""lazy millennial 'Muricans,"" or they realize that all of those hardworking immigrants are the only ones they can exploit for profitable operations. But, I don't expect it to necessarily make sense to them. I've heard many ""dey took errrr jerbs!"" and NAFTA/TPP/trade in general is Satan from more than a few mouth breathers that I've watched shuffle into a Walmart looking for dirt cheap products. They didn't get it then as Walmart carpet bombed their towns/states/country of decent paying jobs in manufacturing and mom and pop retail; why would now be different?"
