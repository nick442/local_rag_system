"No it isn't. Socialism has never flattened disparity. Learn some history and stop giving old concepts new names in an effort to clean the slate. Giving everyone an equal quantity of money does nothing. If you scale the support relative to ""need"", well then.. the 20th century would like to have a word with you. Few more dangerous, oppressive and disastrous forms of government have ever been seen."
