"I agree with you about automation making this an AH FUCK YEAH for most busy household ""managers."" As the person in charge of purchasing all household essentials, I can pretty much tell you *to the day* when I will need to restock pantry essentials like Olive Oil, Salt, etc. Not to mention things like toilet paper & shampoo. I'm really curious to see how Blue Apron evolves over time. I've used them before and am generally not impressed with their recipes - they lack creativity and generally aren't all that great. Now, if I wasn't an avid cook, was just moving out on my own, and had generally no idea what to cook for myself, I think it'd be great . . . but then again I didn't have that kind of disposable income when I was at that stage in my life."
