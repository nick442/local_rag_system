Thanks for your informed perspective on this. >Twitter is a massive time suck to market on I'm curious if you happen to know if bot presence on Twitter makes advertising on the service even less advantageous. Do you think Instagram has a long term strategy to keep their users interacting with the service? What do you think will drive this over time? I work for a game development company (on the side) and we tend to get a lot more interactions with our posts on Instagram, but are suspicious of the actual benefit these interactions have from a marketing perspective by comparison.
