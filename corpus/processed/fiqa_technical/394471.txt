1.) The majority of credit and loans do not go to publicly traded companies. 2.) Companies can and do trade commodities with paper. 3.) Can't keep up with all the crazy you are spouting. Smart people lose their shirt in commodities all the time, it's not a fun place to play. If you really believe the majority of publicly traded companies are going to lose their value, then invest in them when they do. Money always has to go somewhere. Insurance, pensions, governments, businesses, don't like to just have cash sit there because nothing happens (you can point to Apple, etc but they're making acquisitions) anyways, they need to buy and sell and will always have to do it. My last piece of advice, look up the Hunt brothers.
