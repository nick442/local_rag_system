No miracles. For me the interesting part is that he keeps doing stuff I like. When he stops that, I wont like it, but to this point he is saying and doing the right things from my point of view. It's like when people jumped up and down about the google 'no evil' thing - it just resonated with people. If we see Tesla making greedy decisions that slide away from an electric-for-all, customer-first, shakeup-the-industry mode, many will fall off the bandwagon. As long as they keep going, I say cheer them on!
