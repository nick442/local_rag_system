> These publishers are running e-books into the dirt by price fixing them to same price as physical books No, they are not: > We set our ebook prices far below corresponding print book prices, reflecting savings in manufacturing and shipping. More than 80% of the ebooks we publish are priced at $9.99 or lower. Those few priced higher—most at $11.99 and $12.99—are less than half the price of their print versions. Those higher priced ebooks will have lower prices soon, when the paperback version is published.

And how is this not abusing their market share? > For the average consumer books are so easy to pirate we are just skipping all the middle men entirely, but I think a lot of those people would mind spending 4-5$ for a book (At least soft cover prices, paying the Hard cover price for a god damn e-book is extortion). Again, no one is trying to make people pay the hard cover price for an ebook. Hachette just wants the ability to price some of their popular new releases at a few bucks more to more quickly recoup the money they fronted the author, editors, marketing teams, etc before that book's release. And then to lower the price around the same time the cheaper paperback version of the book comes out.
