"I would look at the wording of the question. ""Expect"" does not necessarily mean that they plan to work until they die, or that they want to work until they die. ""Expect"" here likely means that they think they will have to work until they die - in particular, think that they will not be able to save up enough to retire. Thinking that you will have to work until you die doesn't mean you shouldn't save money - that's just giving up if you don't, right? Instead you save up money and hopefully you're one of the luckier ones."
