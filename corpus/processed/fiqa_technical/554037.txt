"> Well, technically, Apple didn't ever terminate Jobs. He left on his own. But I take your point. No you don't, because actually, if we're speaking purely ""technically"", Apple fired Steve Jobs. But then they rehired him, because he was a genius, and they couldn't do anything without him. > I do wonder if that type of brash personality would still work in today's overly sensitive corporate culture. Look at Uber and Travis Kalanick. Absolutely. The smartest guys are the most capable guys and they invent the best things. It's not about personality, it's about capability. Uber is a weird case, and I haven't heard anything to suggest it's CEO is any sort of genius. However look at Tesla, Elon Musk supposedly has an ego problem. He also invented re-usable spaceships."
