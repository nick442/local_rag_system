It isn't Santander that's running XP, exactly, but that particular NCR machine. Hasn't been upgraded because, presumably, they don't want to pay for the software. That is, the actual ATM software running on top of Windows + drivers for the hardware. I don't actually know what a full package costs, but I'm sure it's not cheap. Modern ATMs--all the ones by major manufacturers, anyway--run some version of Windows. For large ATMs like you'd see at drive ups in banks, there's a regular desktop-style PC inside. Smaller ones often run CE on various flavors of all-in-one boards. Source: Bank equipment tech who fixes ATMs almost every day
