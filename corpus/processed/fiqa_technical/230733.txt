"Classic investing guru Benjamin Graham defines ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return."" He contrasts this with speculation which is anything else (no thorough analysis, no safety of principal, or no adequate return). The word ""adequate"" is important, since it contrasts adequate returns with those that are either lower than needed or higher than necessary to reach your goals."
