Cato is hardly an unbiased source, as they are a libertarian think-tank. They pretend a whole list of other important differences don't exist, and conveniently ignore the fact that Kansas switched to the Texas model and then experienced steep economic slowdown and budget shortfalls. Setting taxes is a process of balancing competing interests. High taxes can absolutely be damaging, but so can taxing too little. Both the libertarian and statist ideologies tend to lead to ruin.
