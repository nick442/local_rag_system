Neither of those links disagree with me to be honest. And the first one seems conservative relative to other reporting. > I mean yes, you’re all there together, but if you and I are doing ostensibly the same (and possibly dangerous) work, you’re getting rich and I’m not…. I was once in their place too (presuming we are talking about military). They know that. Any anger I have seen from military people is from either senior enlisted (who are mad that they didn't get out and make a better life for themselves) - and senior enlisted are lower on the totem pole than security contractors so no one gives a fuck about their gripes - and some officers. The best part about being on the top of the security contractor food chain is that you worked for the State Department so you could be openly shitty to military people who copped an attitude of any sort. >Strange also that taxpayers don’t care more about this, although….perhaps not. The amount of bullshit is just too overwhelming. I'm not sure there's a lot to care about. If you asked a random person if they would be willing to go through 4-8 years of military to have a potential shot at getting a job that pays like that one did, but it's in the most violent city on Earth, I imagine they would answer with a resounding no. >Sounds like you could tell lets of stories about the women, though I’m not sure I want to hear them after a good lunch, and I’m pretty sure you don’t want to remember. Good choice.
