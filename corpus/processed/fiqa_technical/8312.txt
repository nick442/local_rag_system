I don't know of a country in the developed world with legalized cocaine, I think it was at least decriminalized in Portugal, but I doubt they have a substantial cocaine problem to begin with. It would be a bold step to have cocaine become industrialized like alcohol in the US, and my concern is that it would be even more widely used in exchange for decreased cartel violence; which would be a wash at best. Marijuana decriminalization is another story, but I don't agree with legalization of cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine.
