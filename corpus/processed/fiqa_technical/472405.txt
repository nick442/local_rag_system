I dont understand pushback from companies regarding wage hikes. Where are these customers going to spend their money? Companies Where are employees going to spend extra money they recieve with wage hike? Companies Whose products become suddenly more viable to a larger portion of consumers thanks to increases in income? Companies. I understand short term profit incentives, but good god opening entire demographics to new purchasing power has never in the history of ever NOT made companies risiculous amounts of money. Look at every major economic development in the US history. Low wage workers get more time of and money? They buy more and consumer markets rise. Anything else is a small group of insiders penny pinching for their own pockets and not thinking beyond this month.
