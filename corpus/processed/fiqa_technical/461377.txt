> Wouldn't a competitor just offer a similar cream at a cheaper price? In addition to patents, the FDA is a barrier to entry because of [its long approval process which can take several years](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm143534.htm). This can give a drug manufacturer years of an artificial monopoly and disincentive other companies to make a competing product since the market could look very different in a couple of years. So if you want the free market to provide cheaper drugs you are required to eliminate the FDA from the process and accept that it is okay to sell untested drugs to people.
