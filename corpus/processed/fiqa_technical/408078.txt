According to the US government a percent of your income from all over the world, whether or not any part of it happened in the US. You sold a burger made of US meat on a US bun in a US city? Yeah pay taxes to the US on it. You sell a burger made of Canadian meat on a Canadian bun in a Canadian city? You should pay Canadian taxes. In a reasonable world you should pay US taxes on a single burger and Canadian taxes on a single burger. In the real world you pay Canadian taxes on a single burger and US taxes on two burgers. Unless of course you keep your Canadian income overseas and never bring it to the US. Though you'll have to deal with a million articles about how you are hiding money from the US gov in overseas tax havens.
