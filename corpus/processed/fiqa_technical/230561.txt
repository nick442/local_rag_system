I'm paying 730/month for a 1,600 square foot, 3 bedroom house with an attached 2 car garage and quarter acre lot. And I own, not rent. So yeah, that still seems retarded expensive. Even the cheap and shitty places are way overpriced. Also I would say some parts of Brooklyn are awesome and beautiful and the majority is pretty shit. It has come a long way in the last decade or so, but the majority of it is still not what I would call a nice place to live.
