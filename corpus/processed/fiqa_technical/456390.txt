That's not really the point. A small percentage of the 70% of the US population living within 150 miles will have disposable income to throw at marked up groceries. Until someone can explain how this reduces overhead and lowers prices I'm just real skeptical. Whole thing reeks of Webvan 2.0. Walmart and Marc Lore are at least bringing creative ideas to the table. The associate delivery for last leg is an interesting approach.
