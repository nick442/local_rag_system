There's a lot of hate on the SEC in this thread, but having had to deal with various daily reports generated by several different clearing firms -- I think a story about of all the different methods of delivery and file formats used in the industry would be worthy of TheDailyWTF. There seriously needs to be some industry standardization here. It's a nightmare for everyone involved.
