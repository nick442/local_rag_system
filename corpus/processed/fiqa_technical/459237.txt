I agree. Once it hits the threshold of cost / value it will flip completely in a few years to nearly 100% of new vehicles. Sometime in 2025-2030 is my prediction - unscientific of course. I think the question will be do hybrid gas engines stay for longer. I think they are an ugly stop gap and once cheaper it just won't make sense. I do think we need at least one more generation of charging capability, but I think that's doable in that timeframe.
