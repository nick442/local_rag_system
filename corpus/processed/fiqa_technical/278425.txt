>you're not one it's the fact you don't see your chains that makes you believe you're free, so will never try to fight. you don't think w/ the school loan shenanigans (within a span of a decade tuition rose insanely) they (government & it's corporations that control it) haven't just enslaved an entire generation? there's a reason a great many people who are against the entire system can't fuckin muster the energy to protest or fight back. the students are beholden to their debts, but if the banks run amok and give out endless bullshit loans they knew would go belly up we *MUST* save them? too big too fail was the bullshit reasoning remember? it's always about class warfare gotta keep the anger, other we slip into complacency
