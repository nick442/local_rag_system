It makes sense for civil service jobs where you want the bureaucracy to remain apolitical. If layoffs are based on performance, you end up with gamed performance stats to favor the current regime and oust the opposition. This is especially the case in jobs where measuring performance is extremely difficult or subjective, and, in these cases, seniority tends to act as a decent proxy. (or at least, it's the best of a few mediocre options)
