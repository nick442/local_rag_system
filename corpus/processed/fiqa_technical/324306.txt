The profit maximising level of employment: Now we consider how many people a business might decide to employ. The profit maximising level of employment occurs when a firm hires workers up to the point where the marginal cost of employing an extra worker equals the marginal revenue product of labour. I.e. MCL = MRPL. This is shown in the labour demand diagram shown below. http://tutor2u.net/economics/revision-notes/a2-micro-demand-for-labour.html So the cost of each additional unit of labor is 8 (MCL = 8) as the wage is 16/hour and Q = 2*L in the short run. Find the right quantity produced by taking dP/dQ of your original inverse demand curve, which will give you the marginal revenue of each product. Set it equal to 8 and solve for q.
