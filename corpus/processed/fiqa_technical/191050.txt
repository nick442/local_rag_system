Mmm, well if that's the argument, then I can't sign onto that.. it's certainly not the case that *anyone* can do *anything* but for circumstance; that's a pretty vapid statement. But were there 5,000 people out there that were doing the same thing at the same time as Mark Zuckerberg? Even at Harvard there were dozens; I knew some of them. That's an extreme example, but the operating principle is the same. Michael Lewis' speech here treads the line carefully and well IMHO.
