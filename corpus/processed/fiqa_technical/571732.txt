How would it be a monopoly if a monopoly is a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity, When the United States began to enforce for fairer competition between businesses in the early 20th century, it focused on two kinds of monopolistic organizations: horizontal monopolies and vertical monopolies. In the steel business, for instance, a horizontal monopoly buys up a lot of steel mills, such that other competitors would be boxed out. A vertical monopoly buys up and down the supply chain—acquiring barges and trains and coal mines—essentially barring other companies from competing with it. Amazon does not fit into any type of monopoly, It’s like an octopus spreading its tentacles across different markets.
