"> A significant part of the rate of increase in costs is likely due to the shifting demographics bulge of baby boomers aging. And two good ways to factor that out is to a) look at other countries with different population bulges and b) look at the cost inflation over several decades, 20 thirty, even fourty years ago What we see is all countries with direct government intervention are either seeing some sort of queueing (Australia, search for ""Ramping"") or costs that escalate beyond the rate of inflation regardless of where their baby boomer bulge is at. Next we see that this trend, at least in the US has spanned over half a century, long before boomers ever reached maturity. In fact it seemd to have started ever since the early 20-th century when blue cross formed to allow patients to pay flat rates every months for unlimited access to their local hospitals."
