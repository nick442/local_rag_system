"Who's economy? Just because unemployment is high doesn't mean there aren't quite a few people prospering. If you want to work in a factory, chances are you're not feeling too good about the next 10 years, because you know your job is going somewhere where someone is willing to work for $2 per day. If you work in health care, or IT, or engineering, or any number of other highly skilled fields, then chances are your outlook is nowhere near as bleak. Most companies are making tons of money, the stock market is doing well, sales number in retail last weekend were great, etc. When it comes to jobs and the economy there really are two Americas right now. The real problem is the number of people have joined the ""screwed-up-the-ass"" half and have no way of making it out."
