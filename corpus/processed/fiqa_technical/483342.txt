Indeed you very are correct. I just didn't want to emphasize too much details as I couldn't recall the video. Kinda wish I had a copy for reference. I vaguely recalling that while the labor may be more expensive than if they were to have done it in their homeland China, they got tax incentives as it was a former furniture factory, they hired most if not all of those workers from said factory and changed the factory too handle fridges and similar hardware. While they had to ship sober back to their homeland China, I think it was mentioned exporting here to there was cheaper and easier.
