"> Where is the EVIDENCE that they're 'just as bad'? Give me 2 hours of their broadcast and some time to sit down with you and point out the things, and I can show you in person. Unfortunately I haven't found any well written studies which do that, and creating one myself would require a bit more time investment than I'm willing to volunteer. I'm not especially interested in saving the world, it just seems fair to shout ""hey you guys they're making the sky fall"" from time to time. Those of us capable of recognizing the enemy should make a minimal effort at least to point that enemy out to everyone else."
