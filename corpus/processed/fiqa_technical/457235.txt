"> A true economist ~~or economic academician~~ is searching for facts, the truth, the reality of a situation. Exactly. And none of the people doing any of these things are ""true economists"". Instead they are ""academic economists"" -- and like all academics they are not (despite protestations and assertions) actually pursuing ""truth"", but rather are part of the establishment and in support of the status quo. >Your claim is completely arbitrary and unsubstantiated. Nope. Solidly substantiated.. you're just (willfully) oblivious to the reality. >If you're going to make an assertion, at least attempt to back it up. I've tried to do that with everything that I have claimed in this thread. Already did.. multiple levels of comments above. You are just blindly dismiss it because it doesn't fit with your (gullible) dogmatic ideological view of the world."
