">That would be great .. if there were an objective and impartial standard for ""worth to society"". But there isn't, and so the price system (if uncorrupted by coercion) works beautifully. You don't have to decide if he's ""contributing to society"", you just decide if you want to buy his good at his price. But now you haven't answered the question, you've changed the question."
