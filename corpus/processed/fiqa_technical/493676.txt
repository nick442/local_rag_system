"They're over-regulated, but no sifi favors 0 regulation - that's fucking stupid and breaks the ""stable"" state of competitive universal banking. But consumers are suffering because the regulations are so fucking stupid and costly. It's a bunch of academia-branded lawyers imposing regulations on 30-50 year bankers. That wouldn't go well anywhere. Most bankers have different views - Kashkari is a Goldman guy who wants to break all the big banks up into regional competitors. If that happens, your deposits will have a higher return window, but then you actually have a daily risk to your deposits in the name of competition..I mean, fuck that."
