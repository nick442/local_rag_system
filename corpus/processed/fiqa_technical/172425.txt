When Obama took office, the yearly deficit was $1.6 trillion. When he left office, it was only $600 billion. Yes the total debt continued to increase because he never got the deficit down to zero like the last Democratic president, Clinton, did, but he made a lot of progress. In fact, the only time we've seen the yearly deficit decrease is when a Democrat is in the White House. Unfortunately, Trump seems determined to reverse that trend. He wants a tax cut, a wall (which he now demands Congress pay for), a roughly 10% increase in the military budget, and a $1 trillion dollar infrastructure spend-fest. Odds are the next Democratic president will have to start digging us out of that hole.
