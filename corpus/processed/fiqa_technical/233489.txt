"He entered into a contract to pay because he liked the payment methods offered He entered into a contract. Full stop. End of story. Therefore he is off the hook for repayment AND doesn't need to add a new method of payment Your friend needs to look at the contract (or better, have someone who actually understands contracts look at it for him). He needs to understand not what he thinks it says or what he wants it to say or whatever farcical interpretation of contract law he's talked himself into, but what it does in reality say. Which, in every such contract I've ever seen, has never, ever, said ""you will pay in the manner you choose and if we choose not to accept it then gosh darn you win and get to live here for free!"". I suspect your friend is in for a lot more very bad outcomes in life if he thinks this is how contracts, and life in general, works. :-)"
