Phone 3 years old, very unlikely to upgrade -- few reasons to. Will likely go Android next time around because I hate lightning jack with a passion. I don't think Apple is in trouble yet.. but there will come a time when most people will see their existing phones as good enough and that will undercut the upgrade cycle many of these companies rely on.
