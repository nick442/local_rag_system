">That is absolutely not the point at all. It is a bridge to the next job. People should not have to sell their homes and move on, especially in this environment, simply because they went without a job for several months more than they expected. Isn't this what a savings account is for? Are you to tell me that these people don't have enough money built up in a ""rainy day"" fund? I am about 900k from making a million dollars a year however i still have enough saved up for 8 months of being laid off, so that i DON'T have to get on govt assistance right away. You can't honestly expect me to believe that someone who has this kind of wealth didn't properly plan for this."
