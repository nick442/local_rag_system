How is this different from Ford offering a performance tune on a V8 though? It's the same thing, just a software upgrade allows you to access more power. The alternative to not having that model is not having access to a car that cheap. Plenty of companies do this all the time, I don't understand how this angers you besides the fact that it's Tesla doing it.
