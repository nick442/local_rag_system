The funny thing is - this is total bullshit, the major assumption underlying VAR along with many other financial products is that your assets have a certain correlation to oneanother, and you calculate your risk hedges on this assumption. VAR is a terrible way of managing firmwide risk, and always will be, because it doesn't protect you from a deleveraging environment, when all asset values fall and former inverse correlations don't protect you anymore.
