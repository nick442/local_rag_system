Good course or book that goes deeper in quant math? There are quite a few courses and books out there that cover finance and quantiative math. What I have observed is that online courses tend to be high level, introduce concepts like option pricing, greeks etc, but does not necessarily go into details of the math behind them. There are some books which cover these ( eg: Hull book, Paul Wilmott etc) , however they are better as reference books rather than book that you can learn in a structured way. Can someone recommend a course ( free or paid) that goes into details of the finance math including concepts like local vol, stochastic vol, derivation of Blackâ€“Scholes , pricing of barriers, var swaps etc? Ideally these books should introduce low level concepts probability etc, have some worked examples and slowly build up into higher level concepts. Thanks in advance.
