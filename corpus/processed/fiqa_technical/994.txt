"I could keep a couple of cows fed for weeks with all that straw. But seriously, we could come up with hypotheticals all day about why we should do nothing. ""I've got mine!"" is cheap and feels good to say. But like anything else that's cheap and feels good, gently tutting at the life choices of imaginary millennials will only hurt us if we do it too much. The fact is that our education system and work system cannot or will not handle the large number of Americans. They therefore cannot participate in the economy, and the only ones who will hurt from this in the end will be America as a whole. It's our responsibility as a group to find a solution, and that includes Americans of all means. We could also of course move in with our fiscal drug dealer and have China prop up our economy. That will come with all sorts of nasty costs which I don't think we're prepared to pay for."
