Summarized article: The NASDAQ announced it will offer $40 million to compensate clients who were disadvantaged by technical problems during Facebook's IPO on May 18. NASDAQ's technical glitch caused a delay in the opening of first day trading of Facebook shares and traders experienced slow order confirmations. NASDAQ said $13.7 million will be paid to its affected investment firms and the balance will be given to the firms as credit to reduce trading fees. The benefits would last as long as 6 months. Investors who are eligible for compensation are those who placed orders to buy Facebook shares at $42 or less but were executed at an inferior price or those whose orders went through but were not immediately confirmed. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opposed the compensation offer saying the move would allow NASDAQ to undercut them on prices and would take market share from competing exchanges. NASDAQ's compensation plan is subject to regulator approval. Facebook shares are currently down 30% from the IPO price of $38. *For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit*
