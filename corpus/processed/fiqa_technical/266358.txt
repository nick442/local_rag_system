I would recommend you look at Credit Karma and assess your situation. The site is free and will offer a score similar to your FICO score enabling you to best judge when to apply. They advertise, like any web site, and will offer credit card signups, which is how they make money. Disclaimer - I am a blogger and have written about Credit Karma, but no payment from them. I've actually been out drinking with their marketing team, but that was it. Nice bunch.
