">Skinned knees will become life threatening Not true at all. Antibiotics ASSIST the body's immune system. Standard antiseptic practice can prevent, and a healthy individual's immune system can fight off the vast majority of infections. Now the problem is that places like hospitals are not only breeding grounds, but are often becoming endemic community repositories of super-infective antibiotic resistant bacteria; so if the kid with the skinned knee goes to the Emergency Room.. then he's in store for a life-threatening problem. As to the viability of things like hip surgeries, they are already a problem -- the solution will be to separate that kind of ""elective"" surgery to a different location (probably an outpatient/overnight-only surgical center) away from the normal ""hospital"". The trend of rolling ALL medical care in an area into one big building/facility (combining clinic, emergency room, surgical, long term care, etc) -- has actually been a big (but seldom talked about) source of the problem. The benefits of doing that are actually minimal, and the detrimental effects far outweigh them."
