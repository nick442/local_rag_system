"> So with all those ""maybe""(s), and since Trump did not Act on the subject, for God sake, why is that the FIRST thing you could say against Trump? You interjected those ""maybe""(s), not me. My issue on this topic has always been, and still is, that President Trump said he would do something that would really help America, then he said he would not do that thing, and he has not done it. >> Global warming is a serious risk to this country. > Absolutely not! /shrug I would usually suggest we agree to disagree but in this case you are simply wrong. I have long studied arguments on both sides. The science is solid and the result in unequivocal. You are wrong. I know you don't believe me. I am sure you think I'm gullible, scared, and have been manipulated but you are mistaken. I have dug through the studies and I have analyzed the data. I can prove this is real but you have been conditioned for at least a decade to reject anything I might tell you. So.. /shrug > So, please, tell me one substantial reason why you are against Trump? I have given you two and you have rejected them both. The first you reject because you suggest President Trump is actually doing the opposite of what he appears to be doing. The second you reject because you deny the existence a danger for which there is more evidence than tobacco causing cancer. Your dismissals are literally denying reality. What could possibly be accomplished by giving you a third thing? > ..do you really think that if Hillary was in charge it would be better? I'm not touching that one. I can not imagine what you believe after the three-year smear campaign the Republicans have waged."
