Based on that logic, go to a casino and bet it all on black..you have a better chance of being right..certainly it will minimize the duration of the pain.. I hope to gonzo that you have better research behind this decision than a simple feeling..don't forget that with options it doesn't matter if you are right or wrong as to if gold will drop or go up in price..what matters is WHEN that will happen..options have a limited life..If you think this is a bubble then so be it, but make sure you have done your homework with regard to TIMEFRAME!
