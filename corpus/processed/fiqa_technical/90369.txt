Atlanta, and I hate it. I'm really not a city person - I like mountains and trees and streams. I'm not trying to hate on city people, I was just hating on this dude for hating things he hasn't experienced. Like I said, I like the state of Nevada - the parks and stuff are awesome, I just hate Las Vegas like I hate NYC and LA and SF and every other big city. But anyway, going back to the GP, he said he has never visited Las Vegas and he hates it. That's lame. You should experience something before you hate it.
