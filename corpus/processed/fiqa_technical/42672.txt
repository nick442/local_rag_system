"For a little while, online stores had much lower prices and no tax. That advantage is fast disappearing. A lot of things are just better to shop in person. You can touch and feel, you can try on, you can have instantly. With some niche items, I feel deprived that I have to shop online to buy things sight unseen hoping that it meets my expectations. And bullshit shilll reviews all over the place don't help. When almost every ""review"" is by someone who gets stuff for free to review and barely uses the product, it's not helpful and it just muddles the waters."
