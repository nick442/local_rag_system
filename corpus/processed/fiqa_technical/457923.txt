It’s funny, though, that, although those boomers got their jobs 40 years ago with just a bit of education (often not even a high-school diploma), nowadays, you need a master’s degree to get them… And we know how much education is grossly overpriced nowadays, almost as if it was intended to keep the rabble out of good jobs.
