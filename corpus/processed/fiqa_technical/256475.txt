Uh..2017 MSRP for a Camry is [$23,070](https://www.google.com/search?q=toyota+camrt+price&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8), [$22,455](https://www.google.com/search?q=toyota+camrt+price&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=2017+honda+accord+msrp) for an Accord, and [$27,110](https://www.google.com/search?q=f150+price&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) for a F-150. None are close to the $35,000 asked for a Model 3. EDIT: I fucking love Reddit, where you get downvoted for posting *facts*! Can the Tesla groupies cool it and actually read what I am writing?
