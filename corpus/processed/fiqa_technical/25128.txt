well it 2008 was six years ago, over time we would expect some price inflation. however it's only really a good thing for people who already own houses (it increases their net worth on paper) and people who want to sell, and move to a cheaper area. If you aren't selling, it doesn't help you much. If you're a young person trying to get into the housing market, it's obviously bad. A housing market where young people can't afford to get in is unhealthy. If you already own, and you want to move up and buy a bigger house, that's hard if no one is willing to buy your existing house. I don't know why the govt is helping create a new bubble. But, if the underlying issues that caused the last crash are not fixed, well.. the bigger the bubble, the bigger the pop.
