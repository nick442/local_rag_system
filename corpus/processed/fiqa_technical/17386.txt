While there probably is something around dropping out of college and starting your own business, there are a lot of things that you don't see. For example we don't know their family situation and what sort of fall back plan they had. A guy like this I see everywhere telling people this kind of stuff is Gary Vaynerchuck often times what's left out of his story is the fact that he got his start working for his dad's 4 mill a year wine business. That's a hell of a platform to have to build your own skills and convince other people to purchase your services. Now this isn't taking away from his accomplishments or even saying that his advice is bad but it's important at looking at the totality of someone elses circumstance before trying to emulate them. I will say the number of billionaires that dropped out of college is strangely high but this seems like a case of survivorship bias.
