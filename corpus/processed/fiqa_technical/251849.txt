Their business model was based on annoying your friends with constant ads. Evertually Facebook is going to see things like Zynga as parasites instead of adding value - people who thrive on Facebook as an advertising platform without paying Facebook for ads, while simultaneously reducing the pleasure of the user experience as any distracting advertisement would. I get annoyed when my Facebook queue is flooded with details of my friends' gameplay. I'm Facebook is aware of this. Being a thorn in the side of the owner of your platform is *not* a good business-model.
