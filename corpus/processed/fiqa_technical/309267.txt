Silly poppets, you begin to sense the nature of the beast and his work now. Its too late to panic now, you have as little chance of stopping this demolition as you would have had if you had stood on the ground floor, of the WTC, and made patriotic speeches while the first few floors started to pancake. This is what it feels like to see the roof coming down, hate to say I told you so
