"What about 2nd hand pants from Craigslist? Walmart's ""evil policies"" are the reason they can offer those cheap prices people ""need"". It's hypocritical to claim to be against those practices while you continue to take advantage of those low prices. It's as hypocritical as welfare recipients who are ""against big government."""
