No it would not. Source: algebra. Also their test is completely stupid. I'm sure the 1000 people getting free money will do well. But that isn't the part people are concerned about. The problems with a universal roll out would be inflation, huge tax jump to pay for it, disincentive to work for all of society, and economic migrants from other parts of the world that hear about your country giving out free money. None of those things are getting tested if it is just 1000 random people spread through out the country.
