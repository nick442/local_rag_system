"This doesn't make sense to me. Writing a covered call gives him a long delta position - the exact opposite of what he wants. And the tax losses won't turn a losing position into a winning one. Is there something I'm missing? Edit: Also, doesn't ""shorting against the box"" mean he has to have a long position, and short against that? That means you've got zero net delta, which isn't very useful at all.."
