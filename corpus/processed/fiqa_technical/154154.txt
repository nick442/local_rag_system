I work in consulting and Risk Management. Most of the top IBs in US are our clients. Risk Management is a very broad field. You need a solid understanding of Statistics, Stochastic Calculus, Pricing, Regulations and some accounting as well. This area of finance is very quantitative and its becoming more quantitative almost every day. With that being said there are some niche fields in here like model governance, enterprise risk, strategic risk, regulations, process and controls which are not quantitative. Work load is crazy. I think almost everyone in our group works 10-12 hour days, with some people working 16 hour days on average. This isn't twiddle your thumbs at your desk either, I mean your head buried in your monitor or trying to understand a paper work. At the banks the work load is usually but not always a less.
