Actually regulation was really helpful here: some investors tried to invest into facebook privately, having very limited information. IPO just made things visible. Perhaps a shitty analogy would help you to understand: > When John was beating his wife privately that was OK because nobody saw her face. I'm sure she was asking for it. But now due to stupid federal regulations there is an open investigation and everybody knows she was beaten. This sucks. Start at the root: fight with those stupid federal regulations which break into private homes. This makes as much sense as your comment.
