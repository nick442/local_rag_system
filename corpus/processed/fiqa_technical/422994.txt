"Get a will completed ASAP. It sounds like you are not doing a standard inheritance, so you will want to have it down in writing. If money is an issue, I would research were you can get a will done for cheap, but I would avoid doing a ""fill out the form yourself"" kind of a thing given that this is non-standard."
