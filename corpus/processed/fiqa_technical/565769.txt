I don't think you know who you are talking to. I build houses for a living. I'm a guy that works with his hands. I hire hundreds of people who work with their hands for a living. Do I assume the worst of the guys that work with me? Absolutely not. There are plenty that do great work and are a joy to work with. However, there are plenty who are not. One of my workers bought a giant truck while dodging child support for the 4 children he has with 3 different women. Should he own a house? Is he capable of consistently making the payments while maintaining it? If he didn't get paid on Friday he left the job because he couldn't afford his bills. When he was overpaid on a Friday he blew $400 partying over the weekend and was right back to broke by the next Friday. It's a pretty silly argument to suggest that everyone is capable of owning a house. A house is a statement of value in society. It takes hundreds of people thousands of hours to build. That work culminates into a finished product that is paid off over a long period of time. If you are untrustworthy and cannot handle finances, you can't afford a house. If you do not provide the value to society that is comparable to the house you want, you can't afford a house. That being said, the initial argument is as bogus as yours. I have a 2 bed 1 bath apartment for rent for $500 right now inside 610 loop in Houston TX. It's 10-15 minutes from downtown.
