The title is misleading. They're just offering employees the option of a lump sum and they're giving the rest to a separate company to handle because the massive pension liability hanging over GM's head makes investors nervous. The workers aren't getting screwed, they're still getting their pension payments. The unions have had pretty much unrestrained complete control over the US auto makers for much of recent history, and it wasn't until they realized that their demands were choking the life out of the whole industry that they finally started to back off a bit and the companies have been able to recover somewhat.
