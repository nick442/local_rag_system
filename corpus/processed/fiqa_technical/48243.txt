"Regardless of what they are doing, you can't ""kill inflation."" Every single dollar created by the federal reserve is done so out of debt through a promissory note loaned by the US Treasury. The note which is essentially debt, is created & loaned with the understanding that the federal reserve will one day pay off it off. However, this is impossible because more money would have to be created to pay of these notes which in turn creates more debt. But wait, let's not forget to factor in tax! The debt can never be paid off, it is literally impossible through our current system of currency circulation carried out by the Federal Reserve. In other words, due to our crippling debt that cannot be alleviated, inflation will continue to occur because our currency will continue to devalue. Those that created the Federal Reserve (in what? the 20's) knew all of this to be true. There goal was to destabilize the economy and they succeeded, they being large influential families such as the Rockefellers and the Morgans. This is the exact reason Andrew Jackson shut down the original central bank. They are a foundation for corruption and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ill informed or in on it. It is impossible to kill inflation & the notion that one company or one man can do so is preposterous and simply click bait."
