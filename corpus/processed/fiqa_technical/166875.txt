'Perfect' credit would be defined by your credit score. You may have a perfect repayment history, but that is only one factor in your credit score. Paying off a loan early doesn't by itself cause your score to go down. A lack of history, however, will result in a lower score. Lenders use the score because the general consensus is that what you have done in the past is the best indicator of what you will do in the future. In essence, your credit score tells a potential creditor what type of risk they are taking by lending you money. If you have very little history, the risk is not necessarily higher, but it is less predictable, so you have a lower score.
