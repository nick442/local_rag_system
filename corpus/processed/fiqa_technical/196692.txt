"The problem with this story is it's basically saying run your business like betting on the lotto. Just because there's anecdotal evidence that a ""Bob"" *MIGHT* grace your company doesn't mean you should sell the company trying to please every customer. For every one company that bumps into a ""Bob"" there are thousands who helping those disgruntled customers drive the business into the ground. This is not to say that companies shouldn't try to go above and beyond. It's just above and beyond should be controlled. For example, if I were to own a restaurant and I see a customer drop food on the floor, I would enable my wait staff to clean it up and give free food as a replacement. But I would also limit this. If the customer starts THROWING FOOD AT THE STAFF, I would also enable the staff to kick the mother fucker out. Sure the customer might be a ""Bob"" and come back later with 4 million dollars to give me, but I'd prefer my staff keep their fucking dignity."
