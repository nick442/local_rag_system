If we spend 50k on an education that is unused it goes to waste unless the person is doing something that is as productive which sometimes they do but you also have a lot of retail degree holders that would have had a better chance with a less redundant education. College is not needed for a good understanding of civics, this was and should be once again taught in high school and expected of students graduating from a primary education. Just like basic life skills and many other topics that were dropped from schools across the nation. There should not be a price tag on an understanding of civics, we might as well add a poll tax if that is what you are suggesting.
