Maybe this is part of his master plan to get So with all those ""maybe""(s), and since Trump did not Act on the subject, for God sake, why is that the FIRST thing you could say against Trump? >> President Trump is not against any method or measure to reduce pollution or emission. >Global warming is a serious risk to this country. Absolutely not! Boy I wish you lived 10,000 years ago at the end of the Ice Age. You would be screaming ""End of the world!! The world is warming up to the point of no return!"". The Earth will do extremely well with slightly high temperatures, like it did many times in the past.

And here, as an example, you really really really believe that Trump has anything to do with global warming or against addressing it. **So, please, tell me one substantial reason why you are against Trump?** Also, let's go the other way: do you really think that if Hillary was in charge it would be better? I'd like to hear your answer to this one."
