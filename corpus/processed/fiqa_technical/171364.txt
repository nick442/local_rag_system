"> ""No action is not an alternative,"" McConnell was quoted as saying. ""We've got the insurance markets imploding all over the country, including in this state."" Except that Republicans are actively sabotaging Obamacare. [Trump has made it clear the mandate will not be enforced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-signs-executive-order-that-could-lift-affordable-care-acts-individual-mandate/2017/01/20/8c99e35e-df70-11e6-b2cf-b67fe3285cbc_story.html?utm_term=.11771cb5ed77).

I think Democrats should consider help after Republicans do three things: 1) Take steps to implement the law as it was passed. Until Republicans take ownership of the law, they will just sabotage it again and blame Democrats. 2) Officially admit that [the ACA was a compromise bill agreed upon by Democrats and Republicans over 31 meetings in the Senate Finance Committee](https://web.archive.org/web/20130111185729/http://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/index.cfm?PageNum_rs=1&maxrows=100). The Republican opposition has been mainly political theater to deny a Democrat president a victory. 3) Senator McConnell himself must apologize for refusing to bring a vote on President Obama's Supreme Court nomination to the floor effectively stealing a Supreme Court seat. To make things right again, he should agree Democrats should block every Republican Supreme Court nomination until the balance is restored. Until I see these things, I have no reason to believe this suggestion of bipartisanship from Republicans is nothing more than an attempt to trick Democrats to not be as destructive and selfish as they have been for the past eight years."
