They don't need to know how to actually write code, but they should understand the process of writing code. I don't expect a CEO to understand each line in the chain of the distribution centers but I do expect them to understand the process enough to make a logical decision. CEO's don't need to be able to write code, but they should understand what it takes to get that code to a production environment and what risks are involved with different types of code pushes.
