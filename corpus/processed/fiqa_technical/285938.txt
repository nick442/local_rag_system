Visually, it's nice. But the problem is actual usage. Apple maps does not work. As someone who has tried using it many times, it simply does not work. It can't find addresses that Google Maps finds with ease. That is what a map program needs to do. And it doesn't. It also is completely wrong for the typical New Yorker, which is what I am. It doesn't have public transportation built in. When zoomed out, it shows me gas stations, like I fucking need them. It also shows icons for chain restaurants that I could give a shit about.. why does Burger King need a big ol' icon taking up 2 blocks? Who thought of this feature and didn't give me the option to turn it off or even configure it? Sorry.. it is not a very well done app.
