"I'm sceptical of your position. I reckon that people who put crazy long hours into a business that fails are lacking some intangible qualities of entrepreneurship. There are people you can just tell, they don't have what it takes. They're putting in loads of commitment or loads of money into an idea that just isn't right. Or they spend money in the wrong ways - you know how all these internet companies spent money on champagne breakfasts and $1000 chairs during the dot-com bubble? I've seen the small-scale version of that, as people rent expensive offices when I'm thinking ""why aren't you just working from home?"" As a (small time) entrepreneur I'm obviously biased, but if you've got what it takes (so I think there is an element of ""predestination"" here) and you work hard then you *will* succeed, to some greater or lesser extent. I mean, I know electricians and builders that have started their own contracting or supplies businesses - they're not rich by the standard of mutli-multimillionaires, but they have a bloody nice house and a bloody nice car in the driveway and they probably take an afternoon a week off to play golf. They're doing better than most of the other guys they worked with as electricians or builders 20 years ago, and I don't see that they're really doing anything too clever or sophisticated. Also, the classic figure of 9/10 businesses failed - ""failed"" here is a very dramatic word, implying that the entrepreneur lost his or her shirt. Often it's not a case that the business lost them money - they pissed away thousands on rent or wages or misplaced marketing - but more that it made a bit of money, but not enough, so they moved on to something else. That something else might be regular employment for some people, but there are *plenty* of entrepreneurs - perhaps some of the greatest and most famous ones - who have gone on from one failure to a much bigger success."
