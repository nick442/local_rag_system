Abso-fucking-lutely not. And the idea that vegetarian or low fat items make them healthier should be called into question as well. There's nothing inherently healthier about eating vegetarian, except vegetarians tend to make more mindful food choices and live healthier lifestyles in other respects. But I've known very overweight vegetarians who survived on sugar and carbs as well. Fat is not your enemy at taco bell. It's the tortillas wrapped around corn chips filled with beef mix that has oat flour as a filler - and the processed fake cheese made of vegetable oil and god knows what else. Carbs are responsible for the obesity epidemic and saturated fat is not the dietary villain isn't been cast as. Everyone would be better off cutting out sugars and grains and sticking to real meat and veggies. Cook with real butter and don't buy the leanest meat you can find. Bread and pasta and sugar will spike your insulin levels and promote fat storage as well as wreak havoc on your body over time.
