Um, where did I say the ends justifies the means? What I am saying, for the tenth time now, is that these animals are born, raised and killed to be our food. Period. Thats it. What does it matter if he is mean to a turkey, that is going to be eaten in a few weeks? Its that simple. Its our food. What, am I not supposed to be rough with my carrots as I pull them out of the ground? They are living, they are food, they are under the same circumstances as the turkey is. Again, how you can eat turkey, then complain how the turkey is raised, is amazing to me. More over, spend the energy worrying about how our food is raised on something that effects everyone, such as education or health care, both of which deserve more of our attention than a turkey, raised to be slaughtered. Again, you are putting words into my mouth and changing the situation to meet your argument. We are not talking about dogs in Korea, or Gorilla poaching, or gall-bladder draining. We are talking about a turkey, that is raised to be killed. No where did I mention ends justifying the means or anything along those lines.
