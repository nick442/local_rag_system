"It depends on whether your goal is to ""teach a man to fish"" or setup an ongoing system where his neighbor is required to keep giving him fish every day for the rest of his life. From my point of view a true solution involves getting people standing on their own two feet, not relying on the government for handouts the rest of their life."
