AI isn't just a thing you plug in and let it take over. Their not all created equal and different groups are making different things. Also different groups make differing qualities of AI. Take this example, all phone based gps is the not the same. Google, apple's, Microsoft's, Tom Tom's, waze's (owned by Google), etc. All use the same roads and same GPS system so they should be right? We no since some use the same initial data while others have their own cars to take pictures of the streets and their own imaging satellites (Google). They all have different user interfaces, different algorithms, different map storage, behave differently when cell/gps signal goes out, handle traffic differently. Some use time of day and day of week to give better directions and arrival ETAs based on history. Some use information from other phones to improve the system. These are all different kinds of AI used in something we think of a simple task of navigation.
