He employs financial advisors because he's good at making money. That sounds like what any smart person would do.. so I'm still confused? He built his own brands, he created his own company's, and whether or not he had any financial advisors is completely irrelevant. You're accusing the man of being bad with money based on nothing more than a few articles you read where he spent money in ridiculous ways, and you also read that article that said he needed the money from the McGregor fight to pay the taxes from the Pacquiao fight.. his current net worth is 340mil.. that's not a number that many people can boast.. these articles are just clickbait to get attention, which is only helping him make more money. Honestly I hate the guy, but I'm absolutely fascinated by everything about him.
