The dividends on CD's typically get put back on the balance of the CD depending on the instition. That money then becomes available to withdraw if you so decide, but if you leave it in the account you will earn more interest. The interest is compounded off the total balance which includs any dividends that have been added in the CD. You essentially only get paid out once typically on a CD which is the time of maturity. After that you have 10 days to either roll this into a new cd and cash it out. The dividends typically get paid out (or put back on the cd) quarterly, but it depends on the institution as well. Try going to the following website to find out how much you will make. You will need to ask your institution if they pay out monthly or quarterly first. Put in the beginning balance, how often it's paid out, the interest, and months and it will tell you your ending balance. http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/bank-cd-calculator.aspx My suggestion: Stay away from CD's at this time. The interest rates are too low to bother with.
