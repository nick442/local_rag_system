"The years since the start of the crisis have been largely defined by two camps, the “too-muchers” and “not-enoughers.. I posit both are wrong, so you can put me in the ""wrong-targeters"" camp. Wrong target because that's what the Fed has done, chosen the wrong target: Dumping money into the banking system isn't doing squat for the real economy (but it surely is making the bankers happy.) You want to see the economy improve, then put the money directly into the economy and not the banks; our banking system has precious little to do with the real economy in the U.S."
