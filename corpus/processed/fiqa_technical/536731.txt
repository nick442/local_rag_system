"They keep completely remaking the interface in Office. Half of these people at their desks had issues trying to figure out the version they've been using, then they got upgraded a couple years back, and people still have more difficulty with the newer version than the old one. We won't upgrade Office unless we have to - because no one *wants* to learn the new interface. Users tend to become mildly proficient with the programs they have, re-arranging the entire thing fucks with them, and lowers their productivity. It's been years and people still say to me ""I knew how to do XXX on the old one"". Which means that MS loses sales on Office, which is the bread & butter for the whole damn company, because people don't want to deal with their changes, and IT people don't want to deal with people who can't cope with the changes."
