">**He tells buyers** he ""is involved at every capacity"". This is a lie. In the link you provided, this was never mentioned. The only claim made about 'The Donald' is that he said he was basically a spokesman for the project. I'm not seeing any reasons given for the project collapse, or any context for the why's and how's of it. It is too bad that it never ended up happening, but sometimes investments are lost, for a variety of reasons."
