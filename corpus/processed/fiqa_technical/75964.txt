Offers usually have an expiration deadline. As long as the signed offer is returned by the seller to the potential buyer before the expiration - it is a valid contract. The fact that the seller countered and his counter-offer wasn't accepted is irrelevant. The buyer can void the offer, as long as it is not yet accepted, by notifying the seller in writing that the offer is null and void. I'm not a lawyer, you should ask your real-estate attorney to be sure, but that is my understanding of the contract law.
