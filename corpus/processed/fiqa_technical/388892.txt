Same here. I think wind and solar can play their part, but to be viable in a large scale you need enormous amounts of storage to cover times with no sun and wind. Solar and wind itself is cheap. But the amount of storage required is expensive. Nuclear is very high tech and elitist as few people understand it well. It is extremely regulated and new developments are difficult to due to this and the huge costs incurred. People are afraid of it, so politics are against it as this is politically feasible there. China looks at technological facts, not peoples emotions when deciding what to invest in. I can very well imagine that modern nuclear tech will come from China in a decade, because it is one of the few countries still developing it.
