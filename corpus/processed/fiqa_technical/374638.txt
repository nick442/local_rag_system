"> If a penny worth of copper is worth 1.8 cents and I choose to make it into a a coin with a value of 1 cent then my opportunity cost is .8 cents. No, not at all. A coin represents value, it is not value (in terms of its denomination). A coin does however have value as facilitator of exchange of value, but that is in principle unrelated to that coin's denomination. So the value of a 1 cent coin (as a facility of exchange) is unknown. It is however easy to make the case that this unknown is very low, or even negative. > A gold coin back before fiat currencies was worth its weight in gold. Gold is just very slightly different in this regard, and substantially the same. It is used to represent value, and has very low intrinsic value. It's just a naturally limited resource instead of an ""artificially"" limited one such as fiat currency. This would be immediately evident if by some freak act of nature there was an abundance of gold raining down on everyone tomorrow. Nobody would become rich (just some unfortunate people overloaded with gold assets would become poor). Gold teeth and jewelry would become cheaper, though I imagine the latter would go out of fashion quite quickly. > When I make the spending power less than the value the purpose of a fiat currency breaks down. Not at all, there's in principle no relationship between ""value"" and denomination. You just need means of exchange that are cost-effective and practical. Single cents are becoming impractical and basically useless, and this would be just as true even if they cost .0001 cents each to produce."
