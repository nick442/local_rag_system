"Your reply is an ad hominem, which would be fine if that wasn't all it was. I'm waiting for a refutation of any of the facts I've put forth that paint the system in a critical light. Things that would make this system okay: - Banks being allowed far less money creation power, or none at all, forced to literally lend out only the money they have on deposit, and not create any through a pyramid of leveraging which starts at the Fed, coupled with a currency backed by a basket of diversified goods. - A truly nationalized national banking system, without the inherent conflict of interest inherent especially in the New York Fed, which has as its board members and shareholders the very Wall Street banks it regulates. The NY one is the worst example of this because it is the most powerful. - Banking regulation power removed from the Federal Reserve completely and back to Congress. - Stronger federal oversight of markets and corporate governance, which would help prevent the very malfeasance that produced the panics which justified creation of the country's central banks down through the years (the Fed is the fourth central bank, and the third of this kind of scheme in the nation's history). Dude, I mean, the Federal Reserve was started by a bunch of robber barons, is owned and controlled by the very banks it purports to regulate, and it is the largest factor in the character of the national economy. What's not true in any of what I've said? Seriously, what's not true? I mean, I'm pointing out a conflict of interest in a very serious area, and you're like, ""TINFOIL HAT!"" What a fuck is wrong with you."
