"Week after week, I make remarks regarding expenses within retirement accounts. A 401(k) with a 1% or greater fee is criminal, in my opinion. Whole life insurance usually starts with fees north of 2%, and I've seen as high as 3.5% per year. Compare that to my own 401(k) with charges .02% for its S&P fund. When pressed to say something nice about whole life insurance, I offer ""whole life has sent tens of thousands of children to college, the children of the people selling it."" A good friend would never suggest whole life, a great friend will physically restrain you from buying such a product."
