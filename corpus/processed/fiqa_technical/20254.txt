Sure, its gross, but my meta-research indicates its safe, and its a more efficient way to use the whole cow. We praise native Indians for using every part of the buffalo - but we can't do the same in the modern era? Efficiency when it comes to beef production is probably a good thing, considering how greenhouse intensive the meat is. Ground meat and sausages have always been about using the final scraps of the animal. If you don't like it, don't buy that type of meat.
