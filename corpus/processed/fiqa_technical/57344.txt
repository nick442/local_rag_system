A lot of newspaper and magazine sites were trying to use advertising as their primary online revenue stream and in recent years we've seen them shutting down or forcing annoying popups that say things like ""Please disable your ad blocker"" which is really embarassing. Also, advertising is only a viable income generator for sites with a lot of traffic. When you are just starting out you should not expect more than 10 or 20 visits per day at most, and that's assuming you advertise your website in various places. If you don't advertise you'll see 0 visits per day until you start getting organic search results which can take several months on a new domain, because search engines give priority to ""older"" domains."
