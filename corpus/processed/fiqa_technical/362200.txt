As a person that has used android for a long time and use an iphone for work. noification lights are good so it doesn't double alert you if you ignore it is nice. custom keyboards, anything you don't like that's stock can be changed (especially with the s4 and s5 because the samsung keyboard and touchwiz launcher are shit) the one thing I can give the iphone over my other phones especially on the 5s is the Camera even though they seem to have that iphone picture look the camera just works so much better
