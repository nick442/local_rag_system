"Well, if blodget's scenario comes to pass, it won't be rewarded. Or at least, *I* won't have to watch it, there being 6.02x10^23 other shows to queue up instead. I think a large part of the reason reality shows persist is that there are a limited number of channels, so if you aren't watching sports, etc, you have to settle for this garbage sooner or later. Also, it may be true that they save them money, but I can't imagine that they command the advertiser money that a real, good, popular show does, so they really don't want to shift to them full time. Thus we have this crap situation: try a show idea, then pull the plug and substitute something else. ""When Gravity Fails"" was shaping up (finally) when they pulled it. Boy, was my wife ever mad! Personally, I have gone out of my way to avoid anything that sniffed 'realitytv', starting w/ the first season of survivor. I feel the same way about the plethora of cop/doctor/lawyer/other formula shows too."
