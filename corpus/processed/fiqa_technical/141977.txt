> If there was, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation. personally, i haven't been to walmart in probably six years, despite living in cities. i buy my necessities at my grocery store, since i'm already there to buy food. i use amazon a lot. i think the problem of monopoly (i'm using this term loosely - walmart isnt technically a monopoly) will be fixed with cultural improvement. people will become more aware and smarter. people will become richer and care more about a company's human rights record, environmental record, etc. but for now, walmart is a good company. it provides a lot of people with cheap products, which allows them to have a better life and spend money on other things. the main problem IMO is that the govt/fed has caused our economy to self-destruct. so people are eager to get low prices. if the govt were smaller (something i assume you are against), our economy would get better, and poor people would be better off. ron paul and libertarians DO believe their beliefs are best for the poor.
