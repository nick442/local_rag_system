As a CFA charter holder, I would wholeheartedly encourage you go through the process. As someone that interviews potential employees (financial services industry), I would advise you to be prepared to defend your pursuit. I often come across resumes that state, “CFA Level I candidate,” and when I do, I immediate ask related questions – and most applicants respond inadequately. Don’t do it to simply pad your resume; do you it because you are committed to the franchise.
