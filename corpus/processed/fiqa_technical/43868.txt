If they all own common stock, no, everyone has to be treated equally. There are also lots of protections against, say, A and B finding one shareholder to vote with them and using their 50.1% to grant themselves special rights. there are a million ways you could do that - issue preferred stock to A, issue options to B, buy a service from A for $10mm, rent a basement from B for $10mm, etc. etc. This stuff has to be prevented otherwise nobody would be willing to be a minority investor.
