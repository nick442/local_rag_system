I think the strategy may be promising, you can run seasonality tests on a lot of different instruments... but always fear the data mining bias, meaning the future probability of these events may only be 50/50. I.e. Is there an actual relationship or are you uncovering a relationship of noise? The classical way to doing this is to partition your data into two sets, (i.e. every odd year vs even year). Uncover relationships in one set. Then test the other to see if it is present there.
