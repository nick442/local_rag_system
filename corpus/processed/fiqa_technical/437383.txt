You clearly are not paying attention to what Walmart is doing and how smart they are doing it. They have an insane amount of stores and network far beyond Amazon for shipping/receiving and a far more dedicated customer base. They are also diving into areas that make middle class Americans love the fuck out of them. There stock price is where it should be unlike Amazons insanely inflated price. The best part is they are doing it even more intelligently than Amazon who is putting far to many hands in the cookie Jar. Their spending power and market cap can easily match Amazon if not exceed it. They are also not trying to squash out the middle man they are building UP the middle man. Also, if you think Walmart has no manufacturing you need to educate your self heavily on what they are doing here in the states. EDIT:I'll clarify..I in now way like Amazon or Walmart as a company past financial gains. I think they are both cunts of company's that could and should treat their employees better and I wish they would.
