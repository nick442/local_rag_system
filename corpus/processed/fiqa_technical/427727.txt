I've given up on trying to understand how the allowances correspond to my number of dependents. What I do instead to achieve the same end goal of having the right amount of money withheld is using a paycheck calculator. If I get paid 24 times a year (twice a month) and I figure I'm going to owe about $6,000 of taxes, then every paycheck needs to have $250 of federal tax withheld from it to make sure I am covered. Go to the paycheck calculator and play with the allowance numbers until you get $250 as the federal tax withheld and then submit a new W4 to your employer. This is the only reliable way I've found to figure this out on my own. Because my calculations are done in dollars instead of exemptions, etc. and my taxes do not wildly fluctuate year-to-year this works well for me.
