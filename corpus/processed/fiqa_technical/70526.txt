"It's a fair complaint to have. People have grown accustomed to road trips needing only 5-10 minutes to refuel and continue on. That's currently a problem in the EV market, and one that lots of manufacturers are working hard to try and fix. Porsche just unveiled their 800 volt, 350kW charger that's 2-3 times faster charging (on paper) than the Tesla Superchargers (which operate at 480 volts, max 120kW). For example, a 75kWh battery on a Tesla can ""supercharge"" from 0 to 75kWh ""full charge"" in 37 minutes (although the battery should never be fully depleted). With Porsche's supercharger, a 75kWh battery could charge ~13 minutes. Tesla is expecting to upgrade their supercharger technology to match or exceed Porsche soon. However, the addressable component to ""range anxiety"" in EV's is recharging, and as more companies are focusing on the EV market, addressing that problem will become first priority. Further, the batteries being used will increase in density and capability (therefore, increased range), so charging a battery will become even more important. The goal is that, in the future, you can have a 500+ mile battery and still charge it in <10 minutes. If a 500+ miles battery, or a 150kWh battery pack, had access to 350kW chargers, the charge time would be ~25 minutes."
