It is crazy. The same guy (Madigan) has been in power since the EARLY 80's, and yet public opinion is split about 50/50 between whether he or governor Rauner who has been in power 2 years is to blame. Politicians paid off unions through unfunded pensions to members to ensure support. This has happened for decades, and has finally gotten to the point where the money ran out and the pensions are falling due. Illinois and Chicago also regularly borrow for day to day government expenses (as opposed to infrastructure). This means much of the debt being paid off today, paid for government expenditure decades ago in areas today's residents gain no benefit.
