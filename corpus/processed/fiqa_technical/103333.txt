Perhaps I can: my city is full of towers of Chinese investor owned condos that were purchased to gain EB5 visas. These visas require a $500k investment in the US, in an economically depressed area. The census tracts were gerrymandered together to make a nice part of town qualify. They were sold with 30 year property tax abatements, and at the end of that period they will likely have to pay something like 50k/yr in taxes, which is likely about what they will be renting for. These condos do not exist to be lived in, but have manufactured a huge bubble in property value because of the visa program. Jared Kushner is a primary investor in this vehicle. These will crash if there are changes to this program or any change that forces more units on the market. Otherwise they'll crash in 25-30 years when nobody wants a timebomb with massive expenses incoming. The other bubble is of course the huge real estate bubble China is creating within its own borders, which rivals the real estate bubble within US borders, both of which are driven by unsustainable low interest rates.
