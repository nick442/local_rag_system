BigBOX specialty stores can't compete with Walmart and Walmart can't compete with Amazon and Amazon won't be able to compete with China's Alibaba and Alibaba Express. Let Walmart and Amazon fold and you will see the rise of the independent retailers.. we have to start producing our own products and taxing Chinese imports to level the playing field for American businesses. This is one MONOPOLY everyone in congress seems to NOT recognize.
