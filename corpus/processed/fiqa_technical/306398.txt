"Who are all the failing female tech CEOs? Meg and Carly? And now Marissa that inherited a company that has had ALL past male CEOs fail at turning it around? Meg who came aboard a ship that the past male CEOs failed at turning around, and that I do think Carly mismanaged HP into the failure it is now. Yahoo and HP won't fail _because_ of Marissa or Meg. Unless we absolve the previous male failures as blameless because of their maleness. Turning around either of these companies is going to take something very very elaborate and hard to implement, and I don't see any gender of CEO really having an easy go of it. Maybe the problem with females is they accept jobs guaranteed to make them look bad? ;) Or perhaps the real problem is that it's easier to pin the blame on their femaleness. The previous Yahoo guy was just considered incompetent, his ""maleness"" wasn't the issue. (I think he had a hard road, and that's the biggest issue, the second issue is he didn't have the vision necesarry. This may hold true of Marissa as well.)"
