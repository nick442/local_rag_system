Once your listing ends, the buyer who has purchased your item pays through Paypal within a window of allowed time (ie. 2-3 days). The item then gets marked as *'paid'* and a confirmation to you is sent. Once you are paid, you, the seller, ship the item and marked the item as shipped, providing any necessary tracking numbers. http://pages.ebay.ca/help/sell/sell-getstarted.html
