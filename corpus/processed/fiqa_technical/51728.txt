What do I need to know if I'm unemployed and need to take out a home loan to finance a litigious divorce? Which companies are best to shop around at? How do I present my self and situation? What harms or hurts my chances of getting a home loan? Is this the same hung as refinancing a house? Is there a website or article you can recommend about this?
