Impaired is impaired. Too many pot heads act like smoking weed is so harmless that it's ignorant we don't let babies smoke up. If someone dies and they find THC in their system, pot heads band together and say well he was a reckless driver so weed had nothing to do with it. If the same thing happens and they were legally drunk, they will say alcohol was the factor..
