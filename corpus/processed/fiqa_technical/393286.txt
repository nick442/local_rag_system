"Pardon the pun, but these are the ""fruits"" of the Jobsian ""reality distortion field"". That, and the fact that being a ""desirable job"" (in the form of ""playing with gadgets"") there is an apparently endless supply of applicants.. So the law of supply & demand applies to the wages. Probably the thing that is most surprising is the fact that Apple Store employees are somehow earning ABOVE the minimum wage. Apple would probably have about the same supply/quality of people, no matter how low the wages were."
