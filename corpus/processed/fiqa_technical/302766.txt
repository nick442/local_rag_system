IT *IS* a cost center. Investing in improving the operation a cost center to increase it's efficiency and reduce its overhead does not magically make it into not being a cost center. IT will never make Home Depot or Lowes profit because they don't sell IT. It is a cost center. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-center.asp If you want to get into pedantics, this is why Amazon is eating the world - they figured out how to take their largest cost centers (their retail IT operations and Logistics operations) and actually turn them into profit centers (Amazon AWS and Fulfilled by Amazon). As a result, Amazon actually does not HAVE many cost centers anymore.. they may have crappy margins, but when you eliminate cost centers outright, it will have dramatic results over time. It is hard however to imagine Home Depot or Lowes figuring out a way to replicate this.
