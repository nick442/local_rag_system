What do you propose a fair share should be? They pay nearly $900 million per year in income taxes. Their effective rate is reduced due to them paying higher taxes in years prior, plus they lost money and can deduct that as well. Not to mention, they are double taxed as a corporation and payroll taxes are not part of that $900 million, so they're paying even more than that. Part of what makes the US awesome is an environment that helps business grow. What do you think will happen when a business pays let's say 20% on revenue generated in other countries and then another 20% tax on that revenue here? Either companies will move to a country with a lower tax rate or they pull back on global trade. Both are bad for the economy.
