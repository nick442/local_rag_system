The GOP has a lazy Susan of bad ideas. The proposed tax cuts would reduce federal revenue by two and a half trillion dollars over the next ten years. The argument in favor is that cutting taxes will boost the economy enough to make up for the cuts. IT NEVER DOES. Ever. The proposal is loaded with tax cuts for wealthy folks. Some middle class folks will see an increase because there won't be a deduction for mortgage interest and property taxes. Thanks Obama.
