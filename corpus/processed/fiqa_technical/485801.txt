>What is your prediction for the next 12 months of the stock market? Not good. I'm not seeing any of the factors that contributed to what happened in 2008 change, which suggests, imho, that the market is still really unstable and prone to wild fluctuation and crashes. If you like risk perhaps that's okay, but for most investors it's a nightmare. Austerity seems to be winning out in government reaction to economic problems instead of stimulus, which is only going to shrink demand across the board. If you can find something for which there is a hungry consumer base willing and able to pay, maybe that's a good direction to go in, but those are more and more rare these days. I'm almost completely withdrawn from the market, save for my 'fun stocks', investments I've made not to make money but just to toy around with, and my Apple investments, which defy logic. And Netflix, which I support on principle. Last year was a good year for investing in healthcare, but I'm not sure how that's going to pan out this year.
