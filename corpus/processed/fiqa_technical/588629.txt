I work for one of the big 3 but there are no cars from them (yet) that fill the market segment I'm looking for. Buick has an AWD wagon coming this fall that is supposed to be a poor man's A4 Allroad. I'm hoping that's the case. It's nearly impossible to find a nice awd wagon with a turbo from an American manufacturer. Edit: it's a rebadged Opel Insignia. The new model looks MUCH better than the previous one. I'm hoping the performance is better as well.
