And what has sporadic research turned up? Why did we change to fiat money? What was the issue with the gold standard? What underlying models helped secure fiat money? Were there alternatives? Why weren't they chosen? And of course because you already know all that, what alternative would you have chosen? I have sporadically researched physics, biology, and chemistry. But I don't post my opinions on those subjects, because I am poorly informed. I do not want to risk the possibility of misinforming someone with my stupidity. You should consider filtering the things you write in the same manner. Trust me, you would be doing the world a service.
