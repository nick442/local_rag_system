I would say not. I feel like the narrative here is supposed to be that these closings are victims of a shift to online shopping, but in reality I feel like that's only partially a cause. Sears and Kmart were on the downswing before online shopping was as significant of a competitor. All their locations I've ever visited are/were poorly run. Bad customer service, understocked shelves, bad presentation, etc. I'm sure the internet hasn't helped brick-and-mortar stores, but these two don't exactly make me feel bad that they're on the way out.
