China's GDP and foreign investment are an increasing portion of real growth, including massive infrastructure investments, from Africa to Asia to Latin America. That is what makes their financial system and currency strong. The US is still stuck with financial bubbles. We would be better cooperating with China on their Belt and Road plans, joining the AIIB, and giving up the Neocon dreams of world hegemon. THEN, the dollar might be restored to some greater real value.
