Fuck that. Let the market do its work. I'm telling you now, I simply refuse to eat manufactured meat in its entirety. I am a hunter I eat meat that I harvest in the wild it allows me to provide healthy, free range meat to my family and take part in not only nature but a cultural tradition that is older than humankind. Sorry but whilst factory meat might make up some of my diet at some stage in the future it will not account for the majority of my meat consumption.
