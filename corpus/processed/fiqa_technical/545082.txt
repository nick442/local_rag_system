I've had many home loans, and all have been sold to a big bank. They have certain rules about how much insurance you need to have, but I've never had one buy insurance on my behalf - they always send letters telling me I need to increase the insurance. They do say that if I don't get enough insurance, they will do it for me, but this has never been necessary.
