I think we are arguing the same side of the coin here from different perspectives. Let me re-phrase what I'm saying here: I'm arguing that wages should be higher; that business takes advantage of the social safety net to keep wages low, pushing the balance of what they should be paying off to the taxpayer. I'm not arguing to get rid of the social safety net. It's there for two reasons: First, people who have no income (as per your argument). Second, people who have *insufficient* income. My argument is meant to address the latter.
