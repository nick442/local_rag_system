Jesus Christ, man. What is your obsession with the election? YOU are the one who brought Hillary up. Since it's apparently relevant, I am not a fan of Hillary at all. Gun to my head, I would say that I believe she would have done a slightly less shitty job than Trump is. The fact that i don't like one candidate doesn't mean I particularly like the other. A person's opinion of both can be mutually exclusive. I don't understand why you're so fixated on the fact that he won the election. Is it maybe because you can't think of a single specific thing that your boy has done that has actually had a quantifiable positive impact on anything, other than the vague buzz words that you Trump folk are famous for parroting?
