Compared to most places in the suburbs, their coffee's actually come a long ways. But yeah, their burgers are terrible on their own level. Just soft, greasy, mushy things that people who don't eat there on a regular basis almost unanimously agree make them nauseous after eating. Not to mention the smell and the grease all over the bags and boxes of everything there. As for the breakfast, it's edible, but it says something when even an egg sandwich looks and tastes like overly processed unnatural garbage. In new england most gas stations have some kind of grill inside. I don't know if I'd trust their burgers and such, but as for breakfast sandwiches, they're fresh, not microwaves, and it's a real egg cooked on a grill that blows mcdonalds or even dunkin donuts out of the water when it comes to breakfast. But aside from that, there's been a pushback against this proud unhealthy eating because 'merica. I'm not surprised by this at all.
