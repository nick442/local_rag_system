"Rand Paul is an ideologue believer who makes his living as a politician pandering to other ideologue believers. He doesn't know shit about shit but will run his mouth non-stop *forever* talking about all the shit he doesn't know about because, as a politician, it is his job. Ignore the fool or believe him, either way he is irrelevant. The ""Free Market"" is an ideal, abstract concept which has practically no value whatsoever as concerns real societies and their economies. There is no ""free market"" and never has been; it is a toy that theorists use when they want to push their theories off on gullible rich people who need justification/rationalization for their behaviors. Real economists examine the forces effecting market economies; the ""free market"" has no such forces to study. Why? Because the ""free"" in ""free market"" means that the market is free of such forces."
