"Here's what's going to happen: At the last minute, he's going to ""discover"" that for some reason first you must send him $10,000. He'll tell you not to worry, as he's still going to send you $40,000.. now $50,000. In fact, he's going to tell you that he'll send you $60,000 and tell you to keep the $10,000 as a ""finders fee"". Then you will send him, $10,000 and he will walk away with your $10,000. You'll never hear from him again. This is a very common scam. The best way to avoid it is not to tell him you won't do it for IRS reasons. The best thing to do is to stop accepting email from him and (optionally) report him to law enforcement."
