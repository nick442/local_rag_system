This is a problem more than the first commenter realizes. I have visited the UAE and marveled at the buildings in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Yesterday I learned that they have to get sand for their concrete from Australia! Just the waste in shipping sand. Then again they've got the money. I knew like others, desert sand isn't useful for concrete. Concrete is amazing stuff and under appreciated. There is r/concrete where I read that modern Portland cement technology that's used in modern concrete uses far more heat to process than ancient Roman technology, the original concrete builders, and that the Romans made a longer lasting durable concrete. Modem concrete, like plastics, are not designed to last hundreds of years.
