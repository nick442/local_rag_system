Congress said they coudln't run their own airline so UPS/FedEx rus them. Overight package with USPS still goes FedEx so might as well pay less. UPS and FedEx use USPS when it is in their interest not to deliver to the end clients (the expensive part) and only handle the hauling to a local distribution point (eg smart post) So yeah there are plenty of stupid mistakes going on. USPS should cancel those services to begin with, many of those clients will return to the post office directly, then they should run their own airplanes (if it is cost efficien) also lifetime salaray pensions are not realistic..
