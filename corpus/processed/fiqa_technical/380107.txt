It's not just the executives. Many of these companies are franchises and are also public, so they have shareholders. When corporate, franchisees and shareholders all compete to make the most money, things turn to shit. Look at McDonald's. The food is total garbage, some of the worst in the fast food business. They aren't particularly good to their employees, either. That's because you have corporate, franchisees and shareholders squabbling over every last cent. Now look at In-N-Out. It is a privately held company and the food costs almost the same as McDonald's. Except In-N-Out has good food and they are pretty good to their employees. That's because In-N-Out doesn't have as many greedy, grasping hands as McDonald's. These shitty fast food and fast casual places are doomed. You can't have that many people demanding a piece of the profits. That turns the food to complete shit and employees are underpaid and stop caring.
