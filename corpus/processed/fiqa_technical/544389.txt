For IT departments internally billing is essential for managing expectations. Otherwise they are treated as an endless pool of free resources. That said, it doesn't have to be just in terms of a dollar amount. For example, each department can be allocated a set number of hours per year for software development. That way they are forced to prioritize what they want instead of asking for everything up front. IT shouldn't actually charge-back labor. To do so would force them to give up their staff budget with the hope that the other departments will give it back. Only charge-back actual physical items like computers.
