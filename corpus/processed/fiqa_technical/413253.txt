"Sounds nice in theory, but let's be honest here. Competition between channels is weak. There do exist people who go on google, and search for products (though generally, these people are looking for reviews, which they will later go to Amazon to purchase) but most people go directly to Amazon, and use it as a product search engine. Amazon owns search, they own the marketplace, they own the distribution. And they get to look at all your data.. if and when they see you got a good thing going they can choose to manipulate their listings to favor themselves, and drown you out. It's easy to say ""yeah, being in the marketplace sucks, just don't do it"". But if you don't participate in their marketplace, you're probably going to go out of business. There is not a sufficient amount of competition in the other markets that are viable to go somewhere else. eBay, Sears marketplace, google shopping, they're a pittance."
