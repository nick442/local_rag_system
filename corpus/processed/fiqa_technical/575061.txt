"Yeah, I understand the financial realities of it, but as others in this thread have pointed out, our *current* situation isn't ""insurance"", it's ""government bailout at a net loss to the public for a token fee"". Whether I have to pay more in insurance premiums or more in taxes, at least make it *honest*. And I think you overestimate the financial savvy of the average consumer. It may be ""common knowledge"" that most homeowner's insurance doesn't cover floods; but somehow it *still* manages to surprise half the people actually affected by something like Harvey, when they discover that fact."
