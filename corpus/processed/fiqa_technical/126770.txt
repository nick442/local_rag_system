You're welcome to disagree. Lol, and actually it'd be fairly easy to do an artificial markup on labor expense on a P&L, then show you price increase necessary to maintain margin, assuming a constant volume increase year over year. I've done many similar exercises. My family has a small business too, yay. They probably wouldn't hire outside help at $15 an hour. I've worked for minimum wage before for multiple years, it's not like I got some small loan for a million on birth. Also, I'm referring to a blanket national minimum wage increase. It would wreck small companies in cheap areas if too high.
