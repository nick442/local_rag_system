It's the federal government that is blocking progress on this: > [The federal government regards marijuana as an illegal drug; it is classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a controlled substance with no accepted medical use, on par with heroin. Banks are regulated by the feds; most will not touch cannabis cash. \(Neither will most armored car companies.\) > ](http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-cannabis-cash-20170129-story.html) At any rate, I don't necessarily see Las Vegas' marijuana reputation becoming anything near that of Amsterdam's. Marijuana is tolerated and sold openly specifically in Amsterdam (laws vary elsewhere in the Netherlands as far as I know), whereas many states in the USA have legalized marijuana and more will continue to do so. Rather than tourists who go to Europe picking Amsterdam for marijuana, tourists coming to the USA might pick Boston, Seattle, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Portland, etc.
