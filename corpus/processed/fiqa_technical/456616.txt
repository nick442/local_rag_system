Rapid prototyping is a group of techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model of a physical part or assembly using three-dimensional computer aided design (CAD) data. http://rpgroupltd.com/rapid-prototyping/ provide the flexibility to order production in low quantities using processes such as CNC machining, vacuum casting with silicone moulds and low volume injection moulds until they are ready for higher volume options.
