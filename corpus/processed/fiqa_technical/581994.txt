"Senator Orrin hatch (R-UT) is the same guy who famously endorsed remotely destroying the computers of people who pirate music and software. He's an all around douchebag and I disagree with his positions on pretty much everything. He is quoted in this article blasting the decision because of the recent security breach. I never thought I would see the day where I nod along and scream ""YEAH ORRIN GO GET 'EM!"" Equifax seriously fucked up and I think they might actually suffer the consequences because there is so much bipartisan hate against them across the political spectrum. Also rich people got fucked over here too so they have reason to go after Equifax. We live in interesting times."
