The issue with holding gold or silver is the liquidity of the asset. How are you going to unload on thousands of dollars of silver when you want to buy something? I dont think there will be hyperinflation period. It will be slow and solved politically eventually. If the dollar collapsed we would be in deep trouble. Investing in guns would likely be more profitable than silver and gold and in the anarchy you'd better believe someone will try to take your stash.
