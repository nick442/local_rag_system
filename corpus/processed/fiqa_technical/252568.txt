And now it has come out about another breach in March. They hired an outside firm to come in and do damage control. Are we really to believe that the CFO had no knowledge of this before he sold his shares? Seriously spending that kind of money (at least six figures per month) on an outside security consulting firm wouldn't require sign-off from the CFO?
