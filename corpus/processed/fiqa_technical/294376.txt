I'm talking about the seed industry, not industry in general. As I said, I don't know how it is at other stations in the U.S., but here even the most poorly educated field workers without a G.E.D. or the ability to speak English get better starting wages than Costco offers. The work is hard and requires attention to detail and knowledge, but they train on the job. As for educated employees, after 10 years my wife makes 6 figures with a masters degree. From the inside looking out the seed industry has done wonders for our world, both economically and agriculturally. Food is (too?) cheap and plentiful because of the work done by these companies, just like inexpensive smart phones have become the norm because of the work of tech companies. Do you want to go back to an LCD flip phone? Likewise, would you like to go back to when we harvested 25 bushels of corn per acre when today we harvest more than 140? That's 6 times as much food from the same acre of land.
