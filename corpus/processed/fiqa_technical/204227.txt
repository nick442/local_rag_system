Stay away from college debt. You can't default on it. Your wages will be garnished if you're unable to pay it back. Even when your and old man, they will garnish your social security money. In effect college debt makes you an indentured servant. Maybe even worse than the 7 years of servitude people served in early America. Lots of grads are working in restaurants and retail stores.. even some computer science grads. There is great risk in the college investment compared to 40 years ago when it was a sure thing. Do not take debt for college. If that means you can't go to college then so be it. You're future self will than you.
