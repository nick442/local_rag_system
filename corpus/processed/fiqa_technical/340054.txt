I was in London about 6 weeks ago, and all of the locals were constantly talking about how squeezed the taxi drivers are. Their business has taken a huge hit because of Uber. From what I can tell, most people are giving monumentally more support to them than USA did to taxi drivers -- but the hit is there nonetheless.
