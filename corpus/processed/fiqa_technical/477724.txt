"That was indeed a typo. I would not go into details regarding Germany, Japan's economy is pretty much in stagnated state for the past two decades. US has a high deficit and this issue is a major topic if you follow the current election season. And yes, that is not a good thing. Britain (Still, is not that UK?) and Italy seem to come off as time wrap living in colonial era where they can just get free stuff off others. Note the high debt cost of Italy. It is not as if debtors are lining up to give money to these nations. More often than not, it is the leftover state of pre-world war mindset where some people/organizations try to hold on to the money and influence as long as possible. I think this topic itself is extremely complicated and has various facets to it but to even moot such ideas - essentially saying ""lets exchange goods and here take our currency"" and then saying ""our currency has no value btw"" is criminal. It just voids the legal contract written on a dollar note."
