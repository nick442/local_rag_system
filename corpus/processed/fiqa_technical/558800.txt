Make sure that you have the smallest house in the neighborhood. Then hopefully anyone with nefarious intent ill go elsewhere. Don't have anything visible from the street that is expensive. This includes cars (park the BMW in the windowless garage), fancy grills, pools, bikes, etc. For maximum effect, put a broken down car in front of the house. Preferably something 20-30 years old and up on blocks, like an old pickup truck. A couch on the front porch and a old tub in the yard (unmowed) will complete the effect.
