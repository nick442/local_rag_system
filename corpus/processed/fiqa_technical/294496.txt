The solution is most definitely not P2P. Do you remember when Skype used P2P to route its traffic through your home internet, slowing your browsing and streaming? Imagine if YouTube used P2P distribution. This also doesn't work for serving up new videos, as you absolutely NEED an updating main page with DNS in order to disseminate new content even if you're going to share it via P2P. There are no websites out there that work solely via P2P torrenting. Site hosting costs money. YouTube historically has been operating at a loss because of its massive hosting bills. They're providing a service for you to consume for free. It's naive to think that P2P solves this cost issue. Even if you somehow implemented a site that used P2P DNS and P2P web traffic, it'd still require the end-user to pay money in order to host it. It would just offset the costs from the website-owner to the website-user, and create a ton of negative externalities. Your internet connection would be tied down by other people accessing content, and you'd likely see data caps instituted and your monthly ISP bill would go up. We have a workable tradeoff at the moment, and it's taken popular sites a while to make it so. Ads pay for your web experience, and they will continue to do so until the majority of users are comfortable with a site-based subscription model.
