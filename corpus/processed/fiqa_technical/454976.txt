I went through a very self damaging phase in my teens and wound up having to get a GED. I eventually followed it up with a punt for college and got a 2yr Assoc in Business. When I finally got my head out of my ass around my 30s, I realized how much I was stuck in the ~$25-30k bracket. I got an entry level job doing computer repair and started hitting the books & web. Soon, I was taking on web design and basic server admin duties. I got downsized and wound up looking again. Wound up in an entry level again doing first level support & inventory for a local ISP. I took an interest in networking and self studied for and got my Net+ and Sec+. I was acting as their local level network engineer but they weren't willing to change my pay or title so I began looking. I wound up getting picked up by a recruiter who helped me land a job that over doubled my pay and got me into a position where I'd get a lot of experience with high demand technologies and they'd sponsor my security clearance. I'm now closing in on the magical 6 digits but it's all about self motivation on constant education and learning. It should also be said that patience must be remembered. I knew I had dug a hole for myself and it wouldn't be overnight.. I'm now in my early 40s so it's been a full decade of effort and just getting by.
