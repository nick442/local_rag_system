They OPENED a new store?! Management must be out of their fucking minds. When I worked at Sears the very first day a guy came in with a clearly fake credit card. Perfectly flat, no raised numbers, colors were off, when swiped it didn't do anything. He had 900 dollars of merchandise. I called security, they said to just sell it. At that point the guy grabs some more stuff and ups it to 1500 or 1600 dollars. Walks out with all that stuff no questions asked. Woman puts a shirt in her child's carriage and our 300 pound security guard runs top speed across the store and nearly tackles her to the ground. That place made literally no sense.
