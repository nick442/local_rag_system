>People don't think critically about what they're getting for the money- they just see a huge check written weekly. In at least a few industries, the people have a point about the product. Huge amounts of that money disappears into a black hole of government and administration at exorbant costs. Let's look at medical education for example. It's completely unnecessary for doctors to get a bachelor's, but they have to anyway because AAMC requires it. Then, they have to attend a four-year medical school, at least half of which could be done at home with $2,000 worth of E-books and computer programs. The end result is about $150,000 of utterly unnecessary loans and subsidies per doctor. After medical education, there's medical practice, which is anything but efficient. Let's look at taxis. For decades, supply was artifically restricted by the medallion system. You know what happened next. Construction. I don't even want to talk about this one - it's *that* bad. We *do* have an enormous problem of *extremely* inflated costs in many, many upstream industries. Daycare is absolutely one of them.
