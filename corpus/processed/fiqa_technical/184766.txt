">Why are we still working like we're slaves? Do you ever wonder how we can put, in our pockets, computing power that people could only dream of decades ago, with access to the entire world at instantaneous speeds? Why we can maybe colonize Mars someday, why we have nicer homes, more secure cars, more advanced anything really? It's because everybody is still working so much instead of taking the mindset of ""we have everything so let's just chill out."" We still have 40 hour work days ingrained in our mindset instead of ""we could probably get away with just working 3 days a week."" Maybe you just want to chill out, but generally, it seems like the world doesn't want to."
