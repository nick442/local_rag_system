Well -- It hits them where it hurts 140 to 113 in 3 days of trading -- Yep that hurts and hurts them exactly where it should. Yes I am aware of the executive selling prior to the announcement. But other CEO's are seeing this too and will not want it to happen to them. So I respectfully disagree that they won't be held into account. They already have been by the market.
