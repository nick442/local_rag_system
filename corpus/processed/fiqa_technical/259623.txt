"The three stores you mention will be the ones that remain. I'm not wrong. We are saying the same thing. Home Depot on the other hand will carry less and less of the more obscure things. Your three examples are stores that carry the exact type of items i mentioned. People still buy appliances,it's just that they do it online. What you call ""urban shopping malls"" like kohls and old navy are actually discount retailers. They will suffer too, look at their inventory now, they carry items scientifically designed to appeal to the broadest set of people who ""need some new clothes right now"" As time passes people will visit stores less and less. Retail will be turned into office space and apartments."
