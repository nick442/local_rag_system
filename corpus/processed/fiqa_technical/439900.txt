This is really important for business in general. Silicon Valley goes through more venture capital in a year than most countries spend in their budgets or make with their GDP. Almost none of that goes to women founders and there is every reason to believe that is largely because of the poisoned culture. So this is really big no matter how you measure it, whether you focus strictly on following the money or zoom out to consider the cultural implications of small business support structures being not merely male dominated but thoroughly exclusionary toward women. Women play an increasingly important role in commerce because of the need for social skills.
