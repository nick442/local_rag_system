Last night I got a message through the Mac Messages app on my laptop from an automated AOLsysadmin letting me know the service was shutting down. I had forgotten I still had my AIM account linked to Messages, haha. My AIM account is my longest running online account at 19 years. I think my yahoo email is next in line at 17 or 18 years.
