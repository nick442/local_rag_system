"1$? No, my SSN is worth way more than that. I've gotten a ""our system has been hacked, your info might be compromised, here's one year protection"" letter 3 times in my life from 3 companies. I'm so thankful I'm lucky I wasn't someone who's info was used for nefarious deeds. Having personal info like this stolen should have a much more sever penalty. Try $1,343 per person's info stolen, as that is the average cost to an individual who is a victim of identity theft [as determined by the DOJ in 2014](https://www.csid.com/2016/09/real-cost-identity-theft/). You lose 143 million people's info to hackers, you bet your ass it's going to cost you. It will cost you $192,049,000,000 Since that would destroy most companies, and identity theft destroys individuals, having the average cost as a penalty would make companies think twice about skipping out on solid infrastructure and protection for their user's data. I'm currently coding an application with a database that takes user login credentials (including passwords). You bet your ass I'm making sure this ship is secure before I let anyone use it."
