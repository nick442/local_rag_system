Even for those sites that do offer yields (i.e. not Kiva), there are much better ways to make money. If you're not interested in it from a humanitarian standpoint then I would suggest you stay away from microlending. Otherwise: Kiva is awesome. I've lent through it for a couple years now and never lost any money, and they're helping a lot of people.
