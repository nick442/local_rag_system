I really don't understand. Do many Greeks actually feel entitled to having the rest of Europe pay to keep them afloat without making any changes to curb corruption, fraud, or fix bloated government programs or raising taxes? It seems so simple when presented by the media Problem: Greece can't afford to run the govt or pay off its national debts Responsible Solutions: 1) Make spending cuts and try to curb govt bloat and corruption. 2) Increase taxes and make an effort to prevent illegal tax avoidance. The stories I've seen imply the people refuse to accept either approach to a solution. If they refuse both of those approaches Europe must pay to keep them afloat. It seems so ignorant and childish to me. You gotta pay for your own shit, otherwise there will be consequences.
