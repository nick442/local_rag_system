Mostly true. Very few plans allow for in-service withdrawal options. In most cases plans that do, only allow pure after tax sources to be withdrawn prior to age 59.5. The other case would be if you had rolled money from another k plan into your current plan. In almost all plans that money is always accessible. Otherwise you generally will have to wait to request a distribution until you turn 59.5 years of age.
