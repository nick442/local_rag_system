"There is an economic principle called ""non-satiation,"" which translated into plain English means ""people always want more."" (This was best illustrated in the movie, Oliver Twist, ""Please sir, can I have MORE?"") Over time, most people won't be satisfied with ""things as they are."" Which is why growth is so important. Many behavioral economists would argue that it is not the LEVEL of utility, but rather the utility CHANGES (in calculus, ""deltas"" or ""derivatives"") that make people happy. Or not."
