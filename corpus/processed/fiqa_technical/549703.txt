That's just not how it works. I'm in Europe by the way, and am actually in the process of hiring someone for my company. We know how much we are willing to pay them (the pay is pretty good). What we care about: the job being done quickly and well. What we couldn't give less of shit about and what would get you laughed out of a conference call: the person's life circumstances, their heating bill, their three kids, or anything not strictly related to their role. You put an inordinate amount of value on comfort for the employee, but none on the risk that the employer runs. Employers don't just drop out of the sky to gift people jobs and money. Particularly in the case of a franchise, which are typically run by small-scale businesspeople and whose risk rises as employees are paid more and are harder to fire, strong labor laws are a disincentive to hiring.
