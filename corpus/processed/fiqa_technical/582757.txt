There really cannot be a straightforward answer to this question. It all depends on what lengths you take to make the situation advantageous. If you manage to have a constant flow of people living at the place during all of the times you are not living there, and manage to find a cleaning service for a reasonable price. Then yes, there is a chance that this could be advantageous for you. If you are simply looking for a way to offset some of the costs of the place you aren't living at full time, then you need to draw a comparison between upkeep and how often you will actually have customers. It is likely you will have down time, in which there will be no one staying at the house. Hiring a cleaning service will cut some of your profit, and depending on how much that profit is, it could be a pretty big cut. Now, not being an expert on taxes, I cannot say how this will impact those, but it is likely that you will have to pay taxes on money earned. All this in mind, its a decision you will need to make taking all of the factors into consideration. Maybe give it a trial run, see if after one tenant you make any kind of reasonable profit in the end, and decide from there.
