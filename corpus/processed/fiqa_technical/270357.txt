That all depends. When you fire someone, did you actually make the department operate more efficiently, is the department just increasing their backlog of work/delivering worse service, are they having to authorize more overtime hours for the remaining employees, or are they hiring contract labor to make up the difference? Are you going to have to pay out severance packages or defend wrongful termination lawsuits? Generally, unless the layoffs are done via a long and slow workforce reduction process, the savings can't be booked in any sort of a meaningful manner.
