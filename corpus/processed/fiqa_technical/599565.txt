Who the fuck cares what most voters think? Most Americans also were unable to do the simple math to tell you whether you would have more or less purchasing power in a scenario where annual interest on your savings account was 1% but inflation was 2%. There's a reason we don't allow the average citizen to have a voice in regards to the economy and that is it. The profound level of ignorance from the average person regarding even the most simplistic elements of finance is appalling and disgusting.
