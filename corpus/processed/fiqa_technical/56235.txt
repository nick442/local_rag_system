Walmart has been rolling out click-and-collect for the last couple years and is doing an amazing job of it. I've talked to a lot of mothers who have tried it and they absolutely love it. When you've got a bunch of kids, all you have to do is pull into the parking lot and Walmart places your groceries and anything else you bought into your trunk. The workers have been trained to pick out the best produce and I've heard nothing but praise from those who have used it. If anything, this seems like Amazon playing catch up this time.
