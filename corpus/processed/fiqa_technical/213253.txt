> Oatly said it plans to work with three more farmers to demonstrate the environmental benefits of switching from livestock to more crop production. But Arnesson says livestock farmers need government support in order to do so in large numbers. Yes, because why would you expect a European farmer ever to conduct their business in a profitable way if they can just keep their hand up? 38 percent of the whole EU budget is still being spent on subsidising farms that should have gone bust decades ago. I'm not saying the market always knows best, or that environmentally sound farming should not be promoted somehow, but this attitude that government funding will happily keep your outdated lifestyle business alive is just pathetic.
