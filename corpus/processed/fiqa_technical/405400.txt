Despite what the article discusses, I personally have gone to McDonald's less and less because their service and quality seems to be getting worse. I think they need to retrain their staff. How is it I order two double cheese burgers and I get a McNuggets and a fish sandwich? Or I order a chocolate milkshake and get a vanilla one with one swirl of chocolate in it. :(
