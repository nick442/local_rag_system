As you see these types of hacks escalate year after year with more and more consequences, at what point does the public realize that collecting immense volumes of personal data in a giant honeypot centralized repository is a bad idea? There is a fundamental difference systemic risk and compartmentalized risk. Compare the technology of bitcoin/blockchains and it becomes obvious quickly that the future of digital security exists in decentralized wide open platforms. Bitcoin gains its security by *allowing* access to everyone, databases such as this Equifax one gain their security by *denying* access to everyone. The traditional approach to IT security is the creation of a bubble boy, buried deep within the private intranet, nestled in tight within it's private VLAN. The swarming AIDS of the internet buzzing around the corporate firewall, just waiting for even a tiny micro-crack to open the flood gates of hell and implode the death star. 143 million Americans now at risk of identity theft even never had a choice.
