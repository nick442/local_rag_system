At this point, fault goes to those who show up to these BS meetings. At the very start of his Presidency, there were hopes that he would consider the thoughts and concerns of the advisory boards he had created. Now, after just a few months, it is very clear that these advisory boards are just for show -- to make it seem like Trump is this well informed President with all of these inputs from tech leaders. But, Trump really doesn't care and he more than likely will go with the most selfish option. Ask Musk -- he tried but finally realized that the Trump isn't a President of all of the American people. Trump will go with the option that benefits Trump (politically or financially) and the backwards desires of his supporters. Trump's own WH staff can't get him to behave. At this point, joining these meetings is just padding Trump's ego so he can tell the world that he had Apple's CEO come in to the WH and give ideas -- but, then do the exact opposite of the recommendations. These meetings are photo ops and marketing gimmicks.
