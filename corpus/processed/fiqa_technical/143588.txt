I'm delighted that wired pointed out comments were disabled on their 'doubling down' [repost](http://support.godaddy.com/godaddy/go-daddys-position-on-sopa/). It would have been very inconvenient if someone posted a link to a piratebay torrent in the comments which would have made that post illegal under SOPA. Luckly, there are plenty of blog posts where comments are [enabled](http://support.godaddy.com/godaddy/category/go-daddy-scoop/).
