During my time in the UK I've never seen saving bonds or other term deposit accounts that were not denominated in GBP. The obvious downside of converting the money into GBP would be that you're adding currency risk to the whole scenario. If the EUR appreciates against the GBP, you'll have to make up for that too, just to keep your nominal capital intact.
