In the tech hubs of the country (SF, Seattle, NY, Boston, etc) there usually meetups or talks that deal with how to properly do a startup. There are programs you can apply to that will help you learn the ropes of that world once you have a bit of work done on your own. (YCombinator is the famous one) If you aren't in those areas, it'll be much tougher. Even the best unicorn idea won't go anywhere without the right people to do it. Those people are in those areas. It's part of the reason they are tech hubs. People with ideas are in college, and then either finish or leave college to work on this idea. They don't want to move far, so they stick around that college. (SF = Stanford, Seattle = UW, Boston = MIT, NY = Columbia). As some of these blow up, they get attention from other people in the country that want to either join in, or do something similar so they move to that area to be around those people. The positive feedback loop then keeps growing.
