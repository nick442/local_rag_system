A friend of mine had a really tough time with the job market and spent a year in the traditional route (sending resumes, etc). When she moved, she decided to try cold-calling/messaging people (in the industry/fellow alums). In one month she had a job. If all it takes is placing my professional information *with the intent that someone finds it attractive*, then by all means they should make money off of me.
