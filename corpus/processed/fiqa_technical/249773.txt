>Actually, government bail outs are in the socialist/communist section. Does that make George W. Bush the American Stalin? Cronyism happens everywhere, in communism, capitalism, wherever social connections are an important influence in any decision-making. >If it were capitalism fueling it, the government should have let the companies fail, since apparently the population doesn't want to support them enough. No, the reason the public supported it was that they'd spent the last 4 decades putting money into their 401-k and other investments like they were told to, and the investment banks threatened to 0 out all their accounts if they didn't get the money they deserved.. So that worked out fine then.
