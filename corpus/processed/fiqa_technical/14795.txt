Postmodernist-marxist pushing agenda. In reality democray is still the only option, the key is an informed public. And I think we are going through a big change with this now. Why not make a paper related to public important knowledge on democratic issues, teach them how to make informed decisions. That would be a real contribution to society, this paper is filth.
