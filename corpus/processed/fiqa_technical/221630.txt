I mostly eat mcdonalds when in my home town, if I'm 'away' I don't eat it as much. I know enough about the family that owns the mcdonalds here and it doesn't surprise me that things are as consistent as they are. I'm sure ownership plays a big role into the quality and consistency of the franchises.
