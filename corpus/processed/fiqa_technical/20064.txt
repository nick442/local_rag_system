This is really shallow analysis. Just because revenues are up does not mean the market is healthy. This might indicate that a market dominating participant such as Amazon is causing prices to be aggressively driven up. The real issue isn't so much quaint dead tree versions facing off against e-books, but who is getting the money from this trade which is getting locked down to various shiny devices.
