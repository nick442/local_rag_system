GM acquired the startup Cruise Automation to develop their robotaxis for $680 million (it was money well spent). Cruise was cofounded and is led by Kyle Vogt who sold his first company, Twitch, for a billion dollars to Amazon in 2014 at age 29. So he's already had his *PayPal payday* and now, as Cruise CEO and the youngest GM vice president ever, he's doing what he really wants to do, which is build self driving cars. Vogt and the Cruise team have the full force of General Motors behind them, they basically have free rein to strip the company for parts. I guess it should be noted that Vogt participated in the 2004 Darpa Self Driving Car Grand challenge as an MIT junior. It's been his thing since he was a kid. So watch out; Kyle Vogt is major League. Right now Kyle belongs to GM, but in 5 or 10 years GM will belong to him. Autopilot 2, which is Tesla's better late than never autonomous driving system has yet to surpass the capabilities of the comparatively tiny Mobileye eyeq3 chip used in Autopilot 1. Musk claimed last October that AP2 would be able to drive coast to coast without intervention before the end of the year, which is bs. I honestly don't know how they managed to get it so wrong. The Autopilot division is now on it's 4th director in a year, all is not well. The AP2 system is way underpowered. Magical thinking isn't going to make cars drive themselves, you need LIDAR, high res 3d maps, giant fucking computers, and it takes years to fully validate these systems and train them to handle every conceivable edge case that can occur in real world drivjng. Cruise has been at it since 2013. So when you see GM execs acting cocky, and calling Elon full of shit, there's a reason for it.
