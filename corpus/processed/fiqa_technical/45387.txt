The best we can do in the Equifax case is freeze (not lock) our credit files at the credit bureaus and use the free annual credit reports via FTC.GOV. Unfreezing is an extra step one would have to go through before opening a new credit line, renting a new place, getting utilities hooked up, etc. But the freeze (versus the lock) essentially makes oneâ€™s data worthless to the credit reporting agencies.
