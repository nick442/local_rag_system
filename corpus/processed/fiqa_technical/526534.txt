I disagree that this is a bad thing. I just found a new job after a lengthy search. I was, thankfully, employed the whole time, but decided to tell my boss a while back that I was interested in finding something else. I did this for a few reasons. 1. I didn't want to screw them. I like the people at my job, just not the work. Why spring a surprise on them with a two weeks notice when you could make sure everything was ok before you leave? 2. I wanted to help in any transition. I ended up training my replacement and have full confidence that there won't be any downturn in productivity once I leave. 3. It's not a good idea to leave anywhere, even if you hate it, on bad terms. It gives everyone there a bad sense of you and can come back to bite you in the future.
