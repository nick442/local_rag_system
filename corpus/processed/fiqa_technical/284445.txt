Screw the downvoting haters. I think you're absolutely right. Who cares if the editor posts a link to his own story, or if a regular reader posts the same one? As long as its relevant, it will be read and upvoted just the same. Spam should be downvoted into oblivion. There is no reason to regulate content when there is already a natural regulation system in place.
