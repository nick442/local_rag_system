"The linked article is good at explaining the current situation. What it is not good at is explaining the basics of the situation. It's roughly 3 paragraphs before we even learn the first part (""original use of the name 'Windhaven'""), and 10 paragraphs until we learn that there exists a ""Windhaven Insurance"" and they're being dicks. Maybe that's not TL for printed word, or someone interested in the topic. But it _is_ too long for something serving as a primer."
