"I'm guessing what happens: 1) Business owner notices they have a bad review on Yelp. If they're dishonest they astroturf and get busted.. but what if they're honest? 2) They start asking customers to review them. Maybe put up a little sign ""review us on Yelp!"". 3) This produces honest reviews.. however, none of those users are regular Yelpers. They're single-purpose accounts made just to review this business. So how does that look to Yelp? Like astroturf. Like they're faking it. So they get filtered. 4) You get a business whose only online user reviews are the *one* bad review, with a million filtered good ones."
