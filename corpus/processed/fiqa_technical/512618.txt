"> why would it be so hard to say ""Monsanto #204054 Strain Corn"" instead of ""Yellow Corn""? Because it's incredibly hard to track individual strains like that. >The whole ""let's engineer herbicide-resistant crops"" model gives a license for carpet-bombing with herbicides, instead of judicious use. Do you know the application rate for glyphosate? Or the relative toxicity and persistence of the older herbicides? > It would not surprise me if such crops end up reaching the market with higher average levels of herbicide residue. You could look into it. Instead of making assumptions. > If the benefits weren't obvious for the consumer, it became easy for the conspiracy-theorists to take hold of the story. The benefits aren't to the consumers. At least not directly. More efficient yields and transitioning to less toxic herbicides while reducing insecticide usage are benefits for farmers."
