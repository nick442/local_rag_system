"The only people who benefit from ""Kleenex's consumption"" are Kimberley-Clark's owners, workers/management, and the people that consume their products. A being called ""kleenex"" doesn't exist to reap the rewards. If you are truly in support of ""money going to the people who work for a living"" then you should be 100% in support of removing corporate taxes, and simply taxing wealth. This is because corporate taxes cut equally among the owners, and every middle-class citizen is going to have a 401k or IRA. On top of corporate taxes hitting the middle-class, if the good that the corporation is selling is relatively inelastic, and a lot of goods are, then a portion of the costs of corporate taxes get passed onto the consumer anyway."
