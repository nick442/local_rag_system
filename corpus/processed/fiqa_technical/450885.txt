I see what your point is, but I would argue that the barriers to enter the web market are almost non-existent. It doesn't take huge capital to create a great product. Check out the author's product at http://letsfreckle.com/. It's a perfect example that it doesn't take VC's to make a good product and viable business. Everything that you mentioned can and is being done by entrepreneurs without the help of VC money. By the way just because you have investors involved doesn't mean you'll create a commercially viable product either. That being said some people will still opt for the VC route because you can't be the next groupon without VC money right? Without investors how would companies with no business model survive?
