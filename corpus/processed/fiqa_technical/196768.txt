No one here said doctors were infallible, so you're fighting your own strawman, as usual. Points raised were 1. Efficacy of aspirin. To which you said doctors were bad at stats, irrelevant to the question of efficacy of aspirin. 2. Doctors are likely better at stats than the average person. Then to back up your strawman you post an article about stats related specifically to cancer screening, not apsirin or to doctors compared to the general public. You sure defeated that strawman. And the beauty of your reasoning? Trying to argue with the poster about the efficacy of aspirin, you said doctors were bad at stats, yet in the article you posted, who do you trust to talk about doctors statistical skill? Other doctors using statistics! So apparently the statistics of doctors only are trustworthy when they support your point but not when they don't support your point. You are an amazing collection of logical inconsistencies. And inability to answer a question on topic. Your logic is baffling. It is as if you expect people to believe you because you post a lot of peripheral things, and you confuse strawmen you introduce as the main point and then keep defeating it. This is almost as beautiful as you trying to defend your claim a few days ago that India has more people than China. Here's a tip on what might be useful evidence 1. Show that the evidence for or against aspirin is sound or unsound, not by ad hominem on the whole class of doctors, but by looking at the actual evidence. 2. Find statistical literacy for doctors and average people, either through some large survey or test, and compare them. Or even make a plausible argument why doctors would be worse than average. Good job, Plato. Excellent display of logic.
