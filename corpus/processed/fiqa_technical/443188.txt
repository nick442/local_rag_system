No one pays 35%, due to the loopholes. Effective tax rates (what they ACTUALLY pay) are lower for major corps than most individuals. > Does it not make more sense to lower the corporate tax rate while reducing loop holes etc.. to make the American corporation more competitive. This makes sense, but people put those loopholes in there to help themselves and they'll fight to keep them. It's such a mess of tax code.
