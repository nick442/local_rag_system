I used to work at a toys r us after my freshman year of college. There were about 4-5 of us responsible for the 2nd most busy/profitable store in Atlanta. Half the time I had to handle the overflow of customers in my R-Zone. They did not pay that great, offered no advancement, and treated everyone like crap.
