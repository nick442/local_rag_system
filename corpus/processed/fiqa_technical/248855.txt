It is beyond US. US is simply not a large enough global player to try to regulate everything. The world will simply bypass US and remove it from global supply chain. Syngenta, Chemchina, Bayer are not US companies. The world largest chemical producer and buyers are not US companies. Recent merger like Dowdupont, monsanto, in the US is simply an indication the lack of competitive pricing. BASF, Chemchina, etc are killing it in the global market. Dupont sale to DOW is really a bailout of bleeding company. Monsanto is next in line. They won't make it against Syngenta-chemchina. US chemical industry is simply shrinking, can't compete globally. http://cen.acs.org/content/cen/articles/95/i19/Top-50-US-chemical-producers.html
