The best scenario I've heard is by Tyler Cowen: Basically, the Greek Government runs out of Euros. So they print up IOUs to issue to their workers, pensioners, etc promising payment of Euros at some future date. The first day, some wag holds up the IOUs says 'hey, look at these drachmas'. By the seventh day, the IOUs are trading at a discount - there's an exchange rate between the IOUS and Euros, and you in essence have a Drachma currency. What that does in terms of converting external debts, bank accounts, and etc from Drachmas into Euros I'm not sure about. Obviously this isn't the best way to go about getting out of the Euro, but it's the best 'muddle through' option and given how Europe in general has been dealing with this problem it's highly probable this is the method they'll take.
