Chipotle is not some huge chain that impacts American's total consumption of beef. Shit. they only have like 5 menu items anyway. The place is for tools who like to pretend eat healthy. Next we'll hear Panara Bread is driving the nation to sustainable agriculture. Antibiotic free meat does not have a large market in the US. Sure.. that tiny market may be growing, but it's comparable to preaching that Apple is about to overtake Microsoft. Without legislation people will NOT make the right decision. They will eat what's cheap. Just look at the numbers. McDonalds rules fast food with low quality dirt cheap burgers. When Chipotle makes a dollar menu then they might have a real impact.
