"Think about it this way: prop desks wouldn't exist if trading didn't work. Part of trading is adapting. That includes algos, manipulation, housing crashes, etc. On a practical side, you have to find a way to make money or else you won't last long. I have heard that it takes longer for new traders to be protifable, but that's second/third hand. Personally, my first few years were tough, but I still think it's better to try to achieve something and fail than to be content in mediocrity. Despite wanting to quit a couple times and thinking, ""I should be doing better"", I stuck through it and it's worked out pretty well."
