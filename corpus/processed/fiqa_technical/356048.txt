I still cannot food shop online, for everything else it's fine but for some reasons when it comes to food I just need to be able to wander around looking at the produce on offer and thinking about various dishes that could be made. If someone can make an online browsing experience which isn't centered around you searching for things you want, that would make a huge difference.
