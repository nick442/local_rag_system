People can take off 15 minutes (some of my co worker even take off 1 hour early) early if they want as long as it didn't affect their works. They can also go to doctor appointment or any personal function if they tell their manager about it. Look, I don't know or care what you are trying to get it. If you are trying to imply that OMG! Euro is so much better than U.S. or whatever. I don't really care. I replied to your comment regarding working less than 40 hours as I stated it depend on the company that you work for. Good company doesn't care as long as it didn't affect your work. Regarding common/regular, yes. It is very common/regular in a good company. Like I said if you work for a shitty company. It doesn't matter where the company is located. US or otherwise.
