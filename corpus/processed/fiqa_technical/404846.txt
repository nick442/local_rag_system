Talk to an insurance broker. Dealing with property can be risky. If someone slips and decides to sue, the lawyer is going to drag everyone into it. Look for business insurance, but also personal liability and umbrella insurance. You might think you're doing things as part of your business and find out you're actually doing them as yourself and when sued, you are being sued, not your company! An insurance agent will be able to sort things out for you though.
