Diploma mills will sell a piece of paper to anyone who pays them, but that doesn't mean they have learned anything or will be able to get a job. They trick prospective students into taking out massive student loans for something that will bear no resemblance to an actual education. The worst part is that allegedly legitimate colleges and universities have been playing this game too for at least a decade. What is going to be done about it? Nothing. In the United States of Avarice, only those rich enough to bribe congress get their way.
