On what do you base that? They are literally selling all the $90,000 cars they can build, at a per-unit profit, and the only reason they're posting losses is massive R&amp;amp;amp;D outlays, which is perfectly normal for a company in its growth phase. You could argue the novelty will wear off soon, but what makes your take on that market any more reliable than any old guess? Mercedes and BMW prove there's steady streams of people with $80k to drop on a car. They are just ramping up in China and they have a HUGE appetite for American luxury products. I totally think they're current share price is, oh let's call it incredibly optimistic.. But going bankrupt?
