"This doesn't really make that much sense either. The amount of ""can't predict"" should be pretty consistent on a whole market basis. Even if stock markets aren't perfectly efficient, they're efficient enough that you can't predict that there will be less information risk in the future. Even with information risk, the stock market throughout history, trends one way, up. Not being invested is the surest way to miss that."
