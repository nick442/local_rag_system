Oh jeez. Really? Ok. Yes. I am a millenial. No, I am not unemployed. I work for a living. I pay all my own bills. I feel satisfied by doing it. I have my own hobbies, plans, and goals for the future, and I don't expect anyone to hand me these things or map them out for me. Why? Because they haven't. Millenials got the shit end of the stick. I don't understand how the hell you think that makes us more entitled than the people who grew up before everything started going into decline. We have it harder and we have to clean up all of your fucking messes. That being said, I pay for all of my content, or I find it available legally for free. This article is in fact available for free on Bloomberg's website, and the Daily Herald in no way deserves my money for content that they didn't even produce. So eat all the dicks, old douche.
