Deposit accounts lists savings rates for most of the online banks that offer savings accounts. Select one of the accounts with higher interest and you'll earn more on your money that you can with a savings account at Wells Fargo. You can transfer the money from Wells Fargo to one of the online lenders using electronic funds transfer. If you plan to invest the money, you should consider what the purpose is long-term. If you don't plan on needing it for ~5 years or so you could consider a bond fund from Vanguard. Understand that while, this would be low risk, you could still lose money and this doesn't provide the same level of safety as a bank savings account from Wells Fargo or one of the online banks.
