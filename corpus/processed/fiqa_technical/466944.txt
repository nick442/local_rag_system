"The fundamental question I'd have to ask here is - when will the interest you owe on the loan on your house be capitalized? I think thats a fancy way of saying - how is your bank calculating the amount of interest on the loan? Is it based purely on the principal, or on the principal + existing interest? Your situation is similar to that of having a student loan - it sounds like your loan is in deferment, but is equivalent to being ""unsubsidized"" - that is, you still are being charged interest on the loan. The question really boils down to - will you be paying interest on only the principal of the loan or both the principal and the interest of the loan? Here are some helpful steps: If the interest is capitalized immediately, I believe it is correct to say it doesn't matter if you pay the principal or the interest of your loan first. If the interest is NOT capitalized until your deferment period is over, then its definitely best to pay off the principal first. Hope this helps."
