Yikes man. I got really lucky with the job I have now. They'll let you work 60 hours a week if the works there. Her mom qualifies for OHP so my GF can't get help from her. She also doesn't qualify for Medicaid or graduated subsidies either. We're talking about a weekend job for us both right now. (It's amazing that it comes down to that in this country). The situation truly is screwy. She works for a a hospital who has satellite doctor offices (she's actually in a doctor office) and the best plan she offered was nearly $200 a month.
