> Back in 1957, these high school students were asked to list three people they considered their closest friends. Those who had their names written down the most were deemed the most popular: Theyâ€™re the ones that many people consider close friends. Seems to me that those considered popular by the study might not match with the people perceived as popular. What the study really says is that people who make good friends are more likely to succeed than people who don't connect well with others.
