It is my understanding that the money in the HSA is yours to keep forever, even if you leave the country. When you leave the country and no longer have an HSA-eligible High Deductible Health Plan, you will no longer be able to contribute new money to your HSA. However, you can still spend the money on eligible medical expenses, even if these expenses are outside the U.S. However, there are a few caveats: The HSA money will remain in a U.S. HSA bank account. You won't be able to transfer the entire account to a new account in your home country without paying taxes and penalty. Therefore, you need to have a mechanism for accessing and transferring the money from abroad, so that you can reimburse yourself as you have medical expenses, until the HSA account is empty. Even after you leave the U.S., as long as you have the HSA in place, you will need to file a U.S. tax return (form 1040NR) in any year that you have an HSA distribution. If you decide to take the money out without medical expenses, you will need to pay income tax on the money plus a 20% penalty.
