This article highlights Romney's true position on outsourcing of jobs. He cares about the bottomline. He was like any other businessman, after profit. So, he understands and sympathizes with companies that outsource their business activities. He's a politician now, and the people are the number one priority, not corporations. I doubt he will institute hardline policies on keeping companies in the US, especially if it will lead to decreased profit. It goes against his political beliefs.
