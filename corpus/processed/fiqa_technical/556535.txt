The conspiracy theorist in me says this is a huge bet on a future of high crime and civil unrest in the US. Otherwise, why would owning most of the American consumer gun industry be such an attractive investment, unless you're banking on a high demand for guns? EDIT: Either that, or they're possibly betting on the US invading yet another country, depending on how heavily these companies are involved in military contracting. If I want to spin conspiracy theories, anyway. Probably they're just undervalued companies, like any others. But it's awfully intriguing..
