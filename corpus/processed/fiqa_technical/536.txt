Agreed, this article is crap. I have no problem with venture capitalists. They give you the oppurtunity to attian: the capital, the tools, the hardware/software, the knowledge systems, the networking and right talent to work with for your innovation. I'll take that and burn through their capital, than use my own capital and lose it all.
