Google Fiber won't make sense as a standalone business, as it can't become profitable in near future. Google requires internet infrastructure for its core business, and monopolistic ISPs are reluctant to improve infrastructure. Google Fiber aims to provoke these monopolists by spreading awareness and direct threat of competition. Google isn't concerned with lack of profits from Google Fiber, as its core business is profitable and they can easily afford side-projects like that. That won't be true for a typical company: who can invest billions with only of small chance of seeing return on investment in next couple of decades?
