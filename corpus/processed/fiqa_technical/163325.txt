> Short of packing up and moving, what is an effective way to network with people from these larger cities? Alumni groups should be able to help. Join a CFA society as well, there may be some interconnectedness there. > Is there demand for quants and junior quants, or is there too much supply? I think there is still enough demand for the time being. This will change, of course, but I think it's still in demand. > Will I need to get a PhD to be relevant? I don't *think* so, but I have seen postings requiring a PhD. Browse job postings to determine this. Generally speaking however, it seems like overkill to me. > Can I transfer my background or skills into another area of finance first to get the networking contacts? Yes. CFA material shows interest and knowledge, as does the degree. Programming knowledge is in demand in many places now. Have you considered valuation work?
