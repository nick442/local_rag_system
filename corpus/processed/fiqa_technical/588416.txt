Canada here. Want to know how we spend about $4600 (USD)/per per person to cover every single person while you guys spend $9700 USD per person for spotty coverage? We nationalized most of the system. Hospitals? Bought out by the government in the 1970's. Insurance? 100% public. No profit margins on anything. We bill out an aspirin at $0.65 instead of $65.00. Most of the costs are built into our tax base. At the highest income level, I pay $70 a month for medical. Below $35k it drops steeply and under $25k or so it's free. You will never ever have affordable health care if the hospitals can keep generating the insane bills that they do. $30k average for a birth? Seriously? This is why Canada can afford to give young families at 12 (or soon to be 18 month) maternity leave. We have private clinics everywhere, but their fees are 100% paid for by the health care system and are tightly regulated. The system works well. Nobody gets stressed when ill because there is never a bill to worry about. Maybe $15 if you want the fancy fibreglass cover on your cast. Drugs? Cheap and affordable thanks to government negotiated price controls (like basically every country except the US). End result? The average Canadian lives 3 years longer than the average American. Think about that for a minute. 3 years. Those are the crappy years, but you are still kickin'.
