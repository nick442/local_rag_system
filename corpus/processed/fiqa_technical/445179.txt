TLDR summary: Automation helps drive the economy rather than cause unemployment. Just look at the last 10 centuries (forgetting that the combination of information technology with automation started with the generation of milinials and has never been seen before in history.) And milinials are happy with their jobs even though they are replaceable because they have no kids, friends, or family to enjoy. Their low paying jobs and occasional vacations are all they have to enjoy.
