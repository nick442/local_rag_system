Not really. There are rules against subsidizing markets that inflict injury on like industries among WTO nations. Bombardier is violating that rule by getting subsidies for commercial airliners. Boeing gets government loans for Department Of Defense contracts, but not for commercial jets. Canada has a bad habit of side stepping NAFTA and WTO guidelines and they're upset someone is finally calling them on it. If Canada wants to subsidize markets that fellow WTO nations do not participate in, fine. They have that opportunity. Bombardier was not that.
