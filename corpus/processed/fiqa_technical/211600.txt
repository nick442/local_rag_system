> I'm strongly considering the military as an option to pay for it. They have a program where you commission as an officer, with that salary, and they cover school. Aren't they going to make you work for them and send you overseas whenever they want? In high school I took the asvab and they wouldn't stop bugging me and told me they would cover all expenses, but from what I remember I had to be their property for a while which I wasn't okay with.
