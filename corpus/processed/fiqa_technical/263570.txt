That's a good question, you should ask the 100,000 current Tesla owners as well as the 500,000 people on this list for a Model 3, why they went with a Tesla instead of another product. Tesla is THE gold standard for cars. I don't think I need to provide much anecdotal evidence to claim that people in affluent countries are more than willing to cough up $$$ for the prestige that goes with the product. And America isn't cash strapped. We could be doing better, sure, but we're still affluent. Where are these much cheaper cars you talk about? Anyone in the market for an electric car has $ to spend
