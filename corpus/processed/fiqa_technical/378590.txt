There are dogshit parts of every field. Literally, every field. I went to an SEC school and don't know a single person who had good grades in finance that ended up in one though. Everyone I know is murdering it. Or, fuck my anecdotes, look at the actual data. Finance and Econ is above every non-science field (and plenty of science fields) which is exactly what I said. http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors?page=23 So take this dumbass troll shit elsewhere. Not sure your vendetta against Finance - its as good as it gets for business majors.
