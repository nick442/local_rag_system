You are right, and it's 40 cents per liter, not gallon as I originally wrote. After 60 liters per month, it goes up to 70 cents per liter. It's around 90 cents per liter right now where I am in the US. Like you said, still cheap compared to the rest of the world ($1 per liter in India, $1.90 per liter in Britain).
