"The statement that contractors outnumber troops on the ground is correct. That over 10K contractors were used for ""security"" also speaks to the privatization of the military. The attempt at nation building was a military venture. I'm not even saying outsourcing the military is wrong (or right), just that it's reality. Quibbling over how many carry guns versus wash dishes isn't the point, really."
