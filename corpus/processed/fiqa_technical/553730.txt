">on behalf of the general public That's where you're wrong. They did this for one reason, to enrich themselves *at the expense of the general public*. The general public got nothing from this. Actually, they got less than nothing as they're almost certainly going to be charged more to cover the expense of the settlement. This was a completely self-serving lawsuit brought by a bunch of greedy lawyers cloaking themselves in the guise of ""doing good by the public"". These people should have their fingernails removed with rusty pliers. They're the scum of the earth. This is exactly why people say class action lawsuits are massively subject to abuse. This is a textbook example, and why the whole system needs to be reformed."
