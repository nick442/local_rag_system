Why don't you like unions? An IBEW electrician is guaranteed to have the skills and have gone through the apprenticeship and journeyman programs. Its a safety and skills thing. Unions also fought for and got us a 40 hour work week and overtime pay. Benefits and disability insurance. Perhaps there isn't much of a need currently for unions because of all the federal and local statues that mandate worker protection.. but currently politicians are rolling back those protections. The way things are going there is going to be a major need to unions in another generation.. And the work to get those benefits will be that much harder. Police are pepper spraying old grandmas and people sitting down not doing anything. Imagine how many heads will be cracked when people fight for a 40 hour work week again?
