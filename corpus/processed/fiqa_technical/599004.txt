Well you have to understand that even when working full time at minimum wage you generally have very little money or time that can go towards going to school, having kids or having any kind of fun at all in life. Do you really understand what it's like to start from the bottom? It's always getting worse for the bottom subset so it's always getting more difficult to change their lives. It's not impossible but it actually is incredibly unfair. This is not a meritocratic society. This is not a utilitarian society. All the rich really want is to feel like they are better people than others. They don't have the incentive to want to actually make people better around them. When almost everything is owned in society and you don't own any of it than you yourself are effectively owned as well.
