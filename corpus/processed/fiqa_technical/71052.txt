A few gadgets on credit is no replacement for a viable future, nor does it invalidate poverty. It's easy to get a couple thousand dollars, but difficult to amass any significant amount of self sufficiency. Besides that, it fucking sucks being poor. If not for my PC I'd be forced to commit some very depraved acts upon various orifices of strangers. Sure poor people might be able to get a couple of gadgets, but what we cannot get is decent healthcare, education (without massive debt), economic opportunity (without nepotism) and a home of our own (instead of renting from the landed gentry and having the bank own more than half the houses in our country).
