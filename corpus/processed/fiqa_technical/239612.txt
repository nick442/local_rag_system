I'm sorry but this won't ever happen without regulation from the Feds. I'm a banker and I use the credit agencies daily. We pull credit reports on borrowers and without it, banks won't lend. A credit pull is a huge part of the credit underwriting process. Literally no bank in the US will stop using credit reporting agencies. Sorry to burst your bubble.
