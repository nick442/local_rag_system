"Costco does indeed pay its employees well, and is modest in terms of executive compensation, but make no mistake: they aren't selling chickens for $5 out of the goodness of their hearts. The Costco setup doesn't lend itself for consumers to ""pop in and out"" (i.e. their locations, both physical and the actual store layout/mass aren't conducive to quick trips). Costco sells dirt-cheap rotisserie chicken (and even pizza, hot dogs, etc.) to spur members to make a quick trip, and turn that into a larger purchase. They do a lot of things the ""right"" way as a company, but these are deliberate business strategies."
