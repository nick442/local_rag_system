You know, half the population has an IQ under 100.. I am fortunate enough to have a decent brain, and can get a high paying job, there are many people who don't have such luck.. should they be punished for this? Should they have to struggle just to survive? Assuming they can 'just find another job', isn't in tune with reality.
