This is me going off my assumptions here.. With Lyft, I think you'd be right. Most people are doing it as a part-time gig and would otherwise own/lease a car. With Uber, most people are doing it as a career. Most drivers are former taxi drivers. Uber has started promoting programs to help drivers lease new cars with -- I'd assume -- discounted rates. Thus, Uber is promoting its drivers to make a financial commitment to get new cars but is still treating them as independent contractors who can be terminated from the system without cause and are subject to Uber's whims to reduce or change the business model/pricing structure. It's a huge risk for drivers to take, and I fear most aren't accurately assessing the risk when they sign up.
