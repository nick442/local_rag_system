> will end up over taking instagram AND facebook in the next 5-10 years. holy shit LMAO I wish there was some way I could bet everything I own against this statement. Facebook will not be overtaken by ANY other social media company for the next 10+ years, and will NEVER be overtaken by snap inc. Facebook is actually the smartest long term investment out of everything you mentioned (and amazon as well). Snapchat and gopro are horrible long term holdings. Gopro will be worth half of what it is worth now in the next 5 years. The money you are bragging about is peanuts, and irrelevant. Because you were talking about long term holdings in your first reply, and now you are bringing up day trading which is a completely different story. Yes snap is probably good for some short term gains, but I dont see how you are parlaying that into thinking that is good for long term retirement funds. FWIW making money in this climate is easy as fuck, it wont be like this forever. And when the markets begin to crash, companies like twitter and snap inc who have no revenue will be the first ones to freefall to nothing. I have a 37% annual return since 2009 (entered the market a great time) and I have no background in investing before that. So dont get a big head about making correct choices in the short term.
