Personally, I'm a big fan of second price auctions anyway. It seems that applying that structure to this market would drop the incentive to get any sort of last look or any of the other collusion coming from these bid rigging schemes. Also, it seems like this is buy side collusion which is really strange. Generally it's considered a good thing when the price of goods drops closer to the marginal cost. In general, any points that a municipality gets on the money above what they're paying on the bond issue is a good thing. The less the banks have to pay to borrow those funds in the short term, the less they can loan them out for.
