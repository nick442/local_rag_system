If the company is stable. I like to recoup losses by buying in the valley and selling it all at the plateau and then learning as all beginners do, don't buy stocks because there's a feeding frenzy..or because Joe told me too. Pick your strategy in stocks and learn to stick with that. If you have no strategy, buy land.
