"How on Earth could there *not* be racial inequality in a nation that was 99% ethnically homogenous for a couple thousand years, during its greatest imperial (wealth building) stretch. And only in the post-war era of e 20th century did it begin to have very significant ethnic minority groups. And those minorities were mostly poor and uneducated on arrival. By what magic would that wealth be equally distributed now, just a few decades later? And in what universe is wealth equality by race now to be expected? Doors were opened to other cultures. This is a good thing. But. Was the plan to re divide the wealth of individuals upon doing so? Where was that written? The immigrant groups in the UK are largely Pakistani and Indian.. And in more recent years, Middle Eastern. They came with vast cultural and educational differences. Not to mention challenges like higher rates of birth defects and genetic abnormalities, crime rates and massive cultural impediments to female career success. Why would wealth equality have happened, and how? It would be more ""shocking"" if there actually was racial wealth equality now."
