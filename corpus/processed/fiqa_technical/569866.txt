It's tricky to calculate what us Europeans pay equivalent to US 'gas' (petrol) prices. I currently pay about â‚¬72 for ~42litres of petrol. Heard on the radio that we pay the equivalent of ~$9/US gallon for petrol. Why haven't the Germans gone all electric with their Mercs and Beemers? With the prices we pay it would make even more sense over this side of the pond. It's strange to wait for Tesla to mass-produce the electric car. Shorter average distances too mean shorter commutes, so the range issue of batteries is also more favourable to European geography.
