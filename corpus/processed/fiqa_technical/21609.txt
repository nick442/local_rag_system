Um, no? The business pretty clearly laid out what it expects out of its employees, and what it expects is illegal. You can't hire on the basis of religion, period. It's not even a he said/she said, the business already admits what it does, and based on its members it's quite easy to prove. If this were an atheist that was just trying to ping the business because they hire on religion that's one thing. But this guy WAS a Christian, he just wasn't Christian ENOUGH. That's excuse enough in my book to nail them.
