Global warming is not flaw of capitalism. It is due to crony capitalism. In the economic theory I told you about, it is called externality. Usually externality are handled via regulation. For global warming, best way to do this would be via carbon tax and etc which most economist support. The whole market solving everything by itself is myth created by republicans. All economist agree good regulations are needed on certain areas. You are right that you can't credit capitalism for us success, but those natural resources only go so far. It really is the strong institution we have in US capitalism that made us so special. There are tons of research on effect of natural resources already. I am not asking you to refute me, but google some lectures on some ideas starting with Ricardian theory. It really is eye opening stuff. It was for me at least.
