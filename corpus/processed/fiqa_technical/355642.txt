"I'm a big fan of modern nuclear, but I'm happy to see obsolete PWR projects die. The thing to keep in mind is that today's commercial nuclear technology is using the old razor/blade business model. The ""blades"" they sell are pre-cast fuel rods, which are exactly the thing which causes the nuclear waste issue. Better reactor designs don't work that way - which should make them cheaper to run but require a new business model to get them built."
