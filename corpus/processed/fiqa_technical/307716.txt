There are not always capital-efficient ways for a company to reinvest its own profits. This is why dividends exist. Imagine a company will reinvest 80% of its profits into a project with a huge projected return, but the other 20% of the company's profits cannot be reinvested efficiently because there are zero projects in which to reinvest the profits into that would return a better profit than what the company's shareholders could make by reinvesting those profits in their own way (ie: a benchmark market index like an S&P 500 index fund). Since the shareholders could make a better return with this than the company could with any company project, it would be irresponsible (technically maybe even illegal) for the company to reinvest that 20% of the profits. This reason for companies sometimes paying out profits to shareholders in the form of dividends is a market-efficient part of the economic system, and it really is great. If a CEO/CFO/anyone is paying out so much profit from a company that it is irresponsible to the company's investors, then that would also technically be illegal since the company is evading efficient project that would benefit its shareholders more than they could benefit themselves elsewhere in the market. (These legalities with shareholder laws are not explicitly put into action very often, but their effects are always there) It's also worth noting payout/plowback strategy is very important for the strategy and financing of a company, particularly for public investments.
