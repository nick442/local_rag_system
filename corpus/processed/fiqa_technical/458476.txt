"Nice try Amazon. Logic is faulty here, ""The lower the price, the more books people will buy, and the more books people buy, the more theyâ€™ll read."" is false because it just means people will have more money when buying from an online retailer or megastore like Walmart. It doesn't mean they will read more and quite possibly can read less due to the lag time of shipping. I don't go to independent bookstore, I have a library that I fund through property taxes and it's already paid for. I don't read anymore than I do because I don't have all the time in the world to read."
