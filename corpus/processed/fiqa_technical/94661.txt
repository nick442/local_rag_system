There are many barriers to breaking out of poverty. We almost incentivize it. We take away benefits when people get jobs and make them work harder when they finally have an income by raising taxes and what not. It's hard to make money when you don't have a stable home, car, or even cellphone. There's basically 3 ways out of poverty: education (however loans are fucking that up$, the military, (though not all can get in and I hear they are being more selective), and then marriage. There's so many different people and different stories that you can't just say 1 thing is stopping them. Yes there are lazy people. But there are also hard working people who can't get ahead. If we really wanted a meritocracy why can people inherit wealth they did not work for themselves? Why not have huge inheritance taxes where offspring basically get nothing? The truth is that the issues are vast and complicated.
