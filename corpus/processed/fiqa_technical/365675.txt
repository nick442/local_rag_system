"Mutual funds can be relatively low risk and a good starting point. Really it depends on you. What are your goals? This is a pretty open ended question. These can all be low risk and provide some return. Note ""Less Knowledge"" is never a good qualifier for an investment. Your money is your business and you are entitled to know what your business is up to."
