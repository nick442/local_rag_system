> Because /u/Wanderer360 is the one who turned this into a political issue, as if the monopolies mentioned in the article had suddenly sprung up on November 8th 2016. I read the comment several times and don’t see anywhere that /u/Wanderer360 has stated or implied that the monopolies are so recent. You also pegged them as having a Democratic leaning but they never claimed any such stance. > Its not a political issue, it’s a government issue, and both sides are to blame since they allowed legislation that makes it easier for monopolies to keep competitors out of a market place. If you drain the swamp, then their will be more competition. Maybe you didn’t understand the comment the same way I did. /u/Wanderer360 is saying the structure allowing only two parties to maintain the control of government is part of the problem. You’re saying that both sides are to blame. They’re saying that the problem is we have no viable alternative to the the two sides that could propose significant changes. Really, it seems like your both arguing the same point from different angles.
