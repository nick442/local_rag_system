"It doesn't matter if the terms are a ""fair deal"" or are ""too good to be true"" â€” either way, it's definitely a scam. They are ""phishing"" for your personal information, including your banking information, and have no intention of giving you a loan. How can I tell? Simple: all such offers like this everywhere are scams. There is no economic situation other than being a scammer to do this. Why would an individual put out their money to strangers at such a high risk for even a much, much higher purported return? They wouldn't."
