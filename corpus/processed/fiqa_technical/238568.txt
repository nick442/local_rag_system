"This is accepted law in Pennsylvania, however, I will defer to your expertise and state that the decades long precedents are incorrect and every judge that allows cases to continue is wrong and you are correct. The Internet is great for things like that. Hopefully the next person in court can simply state: No your Honor, the landlord did not follow established law! Court rulings be damned. I was on reddit and /u/OriginalSimba stated unequivocally said that what is happening is ""legally impossible"" and that the decades of precedent that exist is simply because ""the court screwed up"". Heck, they can take it further to state that ""every lease in Pennsylvania is illegal"". I offer sarcasm as a response but if this was a single ruling I might agree with you. It's well established here in the great Commonwealth of PA. I say it's been around 30 years because I've been a landlord here for over 20 years, and a renter for about 10 or so before that. The clause has always been there. The basis for today's laws here in PA are from the Landlord Tenant Act of 1951. I'm not a lawyer so I can't tell you when the first waiver of rights came about but it's very possible it could go back that far."
