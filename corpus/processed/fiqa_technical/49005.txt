"Doesn't California list literally anything that has the potential to cause cancer cancerous? And don't most of those things have to be ingested to pose any risk? I remember ordering a backpack that ""contained cancer causing materials"". Well, the chemical in particular was harmless unless you ate it. Are people eating backpacks now? I can understand Monsanto not wanting to give the organic, vegan, hippy, people more affirmation of why they hate Monsanto, but honestly Monsanto sucks for a plethora of reasons. Cancer would just be another drop in the bucket of shit they impose on the world."
