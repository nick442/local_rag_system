Not exactly nonfiction, but [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator) is a can't-skip portrait of the very early days of Wall Street (early 20th century). It's a narrative memoir, not a work of analysis, which makes it an easy read. If you're looking for something more analytical and recent (but not too recent), the can't-skip recommendation I would make is Burton Malkiel's [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street). If you're looking for something more in the biographical range, I'd look for a biography of the man who's had the most influence on the theory of portfolio construction, [Harry Markowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markowitz). I don't have any titles to recommend here, although [this brief biography](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1990/markowitz-bio.html) might help you decide how to proceed.
