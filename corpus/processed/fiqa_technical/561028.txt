Everything before long term plans seems fine. Vanguard and index funds is absolutely the smart, safe option. What most people should do. Not sure about the specific allocations or funds he chose (too lazy to look) but at worst this would be a 'solid' plan. The long term plan looks more iffy but he seems to have a good head on his shoulders and I'm sure he'll figure that stuff out better with time. >Is this a safe plan? Yes. >Is there anyway this could backfire and he loses all his money? No way he loses it all. He could lose up to 30% or something in a bad year, but over the long term, if he follows this, it's highly unlikely he'll lose anything at all.
