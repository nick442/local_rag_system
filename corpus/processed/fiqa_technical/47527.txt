Not just lack of vision. Blockbuster was a large, comfortable, slow moving behemoth of a company, they wouldn't have risked cannibalising their current business model in order to create a new business model that might have become profitable a decade later. Not one chance in hell. If Blockbuster had bought Netflix, they would have killed it. No doubt at all about that. But the market disruption was inevitable. Some other actor would have seized the opportunity instead, just a year or three later. When a market is ready for disruption, killing the disruptor doesn't change anything, it just delays the inevitable by a short time. That's what happened with reddit. Kevin Rose invented reddit, he called his original version Digg. Digg is the original that reddit was a carbon copy of, but then Rose came down with a serious case of delusion of grandeur, started treating his users like utter shit, so they all left for the carbon copy that was reddit. Today, barley anyone remembers Digg.
