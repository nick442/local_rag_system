You can try to hassle them via any customer service contact methods they provide (email, phone) and pressure them to give you your money back. Good luck with that. Or you can try reporting them to authorities and/or bringing legal action against them in the country where they are based, which is apparently Malta. Good luck with that too. As you say in your question, some internet searches reveal that other people have had similar problems with Entropay and were unable to resolve them. Unfortunately, there is a good chance you are screwed. In such a case, the best thing you can do is to post your experience on scam forums and trust websites like trustpilot.com and webutation.info so that others won't face the same fate in the future.
