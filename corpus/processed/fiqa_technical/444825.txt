Not really. The only degrees worthwhile are engineering, sciences, math, medical, and business (moreso accounting/tax), IMHO. Business offers diminishing returns as tuition increases and so does engineering, to a point. If you're getting a degree in anything else, in-state tuition and working summers/while in school is a must. You're better off learning a trade (plumbing, A/C, carpentry, electrician, construction, landscaping etc.) and, if you desire to make more money, strike out on your own than you likely are getting a marketing degree and thinking you're gonna be able to pay off debt when you're done with salary.
