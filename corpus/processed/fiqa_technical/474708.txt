>The reason medicine is expensive is because the system allow it to be expensive. No. The reason medicine is expensive is because of government intervention that limits supply. Period. Full stop. The FDA is the cause. People are paying $600 for a fucking $2 dose of epinephrine in a plastic autoinjector. Why is it $600? Because the FDA is actively preventing other companies from entering the market.
