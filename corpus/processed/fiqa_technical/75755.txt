"Amazon has some major issues with growing out in Seattle, primarily infrastructure and geography. Seattle's infrastructure is stretched, leading to some hilarious activity - ""http://kuow.org/post/seattle-traffic-got-so-bad-guy-started-flying-work"". Also, Seattle is locked between the sea and the mountains, and with a limited supply of land, there isn't anywhere to build economically. NO ROOM TO GROW. Ontario has a few good things going for it: Healthcare, Immigration, Low corporate taxes, Education.. But there are also some elephants. Ontario has some of the highest land costs in the world, longest commute times on the planet, and a government which will inevitably need to raise taxes. If I had to bet, we'll probably see Amazon set up shop in a City with low land costs, ring roads, and a low debt government. A place with room to grow.
