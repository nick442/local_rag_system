"It frustrates me that basically all ""media"" shops could be that way. Want a CD or DVD? Here's a kiosk; select what you want, insert a $10 note, and it burns while you wait. Need your textbooks? Pick 'em off a touch screen, come back in 20 minutes and collect them at a counter. It's all technically doable, but the legal machinations to do it on a useful scale are a nightmare. If only we could have some single rights clearinghouse that you could say ""I want to license *everything* for reproduction"" to."
