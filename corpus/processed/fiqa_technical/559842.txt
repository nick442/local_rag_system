I got an xbox one s, an extra controller, some charger thing, and 3 games(two of which I probably would have gotten anyway) for $240 I think that's a pretty good deal. I had been looking for a switch since launch, but since apparently I still can't buy one (at MSRP) anywhere in a store, I finally gave up.
