That's always been the case, though. In fact, it might actually be *less* the case now. In the past there was basically no way for small companies to know what was going on in the world, consumer trends, etc. they couldn't afford the data big companies rely on. Now that data is much more accessible. Yes, big companies can burrow down into it more, but small companies have more than they ever did before. At the end of the day, though, big companies are definitely going to be able to trample small ones - but then, they always have. The real difference now is one of control. 50 years ago if you had stores in different states, they had to run almost independently. Now, not only can you directly control everything they do, but you also have your internet store selling everywhere, that you directly control.
