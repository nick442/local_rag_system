I heard a very smart business guy (prof from UPenn) tell us that GE's lack of focus (what does GE do?) probably hurt the stock price. He said that splitting the company up into multiple more focused companies would probably help overall value. They'd be more susceptible to variations in the businesses though, so risk to the individual parts would go up. So I don't know how right that guy was. GE definitely can't seem to excite the market no matter how many times it tries to reinvent itself.
