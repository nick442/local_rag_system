"#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; Section 35. [**European tax avoidance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks#European_tax_avoidance) of article [**Starbucks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks): [](#sfw) --- >In October 2012, Starbucks faced criticism after a [Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters) investigation found that the company reportedly paid only £8.6 million in [corporation tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_tax) in the UK over 14 years, despite generating over £3 billion in sales—this included no tax payments on £1.3 billion of sales in the three years prior to 2012. It is alleged that Starbucks was able to do this by charging high licencing fees to the UK branch of the business, allowing them to declare a £33 million loss in 2011. The UK subsidiary pays [patent fees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_fee) to the USA subsidiary, purchases coffee beans from the Netherlands subsidiary (where corporation tax is lower than in the UK), and uses the Swiss subsidiary for other ""miscellaneous services"". A [YouGov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov) survey suggested that Starbucks' brand image was substantially weakened by the controversy surrounding how much tax it pays in the UK several weeks after the allegations surfaced. > --- ^Interesting: [^Michael ^Majalahti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Majalahti) ^| [^Hear ^Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hear_Music) ^| [^Kara ^Thrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Thrace) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck06iea) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+ck06iea)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)"
