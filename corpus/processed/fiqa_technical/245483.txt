>In addition, US debt is the safest debt. I am really sick of this argument. The U.S. is believed to be the safest debt at this point in time, but that won't necessarily always be the case. We have been taking on debt for 30 fucking years and at some point investors are going to see us as a risky investment and stop lending. At some point we are going to have abused our global reserve status to the point the world doesn't want to extend it to us anymore. How do people not get this?
