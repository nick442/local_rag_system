If English is your second language or not, it is still incumbent on you to be clear. Especially when you are making a strong, specific technical point. As Adorno said, “what is vaguely put is poorly thought.” And the quality of your comment is not improved by carping about whether I’m a “grammar Nazi” or not. That said, autocorrect can get even the best of us.
