"In my experience, in a house share situation, it seems to come down to how comfortable the occupants feel and how much of their own space they want. For example, I've come across lots of situations where someone is renting a room from a live in landlord, but in practice the two housemates (or roommates if you prefer) have equal run of the place and may even share food and hang out together and also the opposite, where people are sharing a property as equals, but tend to stick to their own room and don't share, or even more extreme, where they are technically equals but subject to one or more very domineering housemates (roommates). This happened to someone I know who was renting with two ""friends"" but was forced to move out. I run a website - aimed at lodgers and live in landlords, and house sharers to a lesser degree, mostly from the UK, but relevant everywhere as I deal with much more than legalities and tax. I came across this thread as I wanted to explore the difference in the US between a lodger and a roommate. From what I gather, the term ""lodger"" is understood, but the term ""roommate"" is more typically used to mean a lodger, which in itself suggests a more equal arrangement than in the UK, where we're more used to owning property than renting, and certainly sharing. However, I believe that if you're letting a room to someone, and they pay you a reasonable rent and respect both you and your home, you should be prepared to treat them as an equal on a day to day basis. If you're not, then you naturally won't attract either the best rent, or the best lodger/roommate, however desirable the property."
