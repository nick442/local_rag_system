"Move in fees in my experience as a landlord (though I do not charge them) are to cover the costs of stuff like changing locks or having new/extra keys made. However, in Japan there is the idea of ""key money"" that is sort of the same concept as a security deposit, but typically much larger and not refundable. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_money#Japan"
