"I will be attending an ""Information Session"" today with a BB firm with reps from back office/middle office divisions. I've never attended one of these before, but have done a fair amount of research on the firms and divisions that will be there. Can anyone give me any insight on how these events usually go? Should I try to introduce myself to a few people from the divisions I'm interested in, and then follow up with them right before/after I submit my application? Or just ask them some general questions or something. Sorry if this seems like a silly question, I've just never attended any event like this for finance before."
