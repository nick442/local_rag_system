"But why? To expand Amazon's Fresh delivery service? Whole Foods is stupid expensive to shop at, I'm not sure at what premium I'd be willing to have home delivery. Edit: a Politico article gives a clearer reason: ""But the purchase of Whole Foods and its 460 stores in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. gives the company access to instant infrastructure — including the expensive facilities needed for handling perishables — in scores of urban and suburban markets."" That makes sense, I'm assuming since Whole Foods hasn't been in the best financial shape recently it was ripe to be acquired."
