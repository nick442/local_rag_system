A lot of online savings accounts, and even high-yield checking accounts, have equivalent or better rates than CDs. So, do you research, and I bet you can find a great rate, while keeping your money liquid. The problem with CDs is that you can't get at your money until the CD matures (without paying penalties). If you can keep the money in a savings (or high-yield checking) account you will be much better off. Ultimately, a blend of the two approaches may be the best option.
