They mean the OS, and they have a point. Thanks to Steve Ballmer, Microsoft lost its technical leadership across the board - he could never come up with anything new, only follow everyone else. When a product group *did* come up with something new, he had no clue how to execute on it to make it successful, so it withered and died on the vine. Now Nadella is so obsessed with the Cloud he's completely neglecting the desktop, so it's just sitting there trying to light its own farts on fire. With everyone moving applications to containers (whether it's the phone, tablet, TV, game console, browser or.. virtual assistant) Windows is becoming irrelevant. If we get to a point where *all* the code you want to interact with is hosted in one of the containers above, why bother running Windows at all? Get a linux or IOS or Chromium notebook or desktop that does nothing but boot up the app container you need.
