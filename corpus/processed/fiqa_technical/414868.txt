"We were on the ""gold standard"" in name only since about 1910. There was not enough gold to remotely back the US currency, which is why during the great depression when people started wanting to turn their cash back in to gold there was no enough, and gold possession had to be outlawed (well, partially). So no, we were not on a gold standard. Secondly, when you're on a (any fixed item) standard, your economy only can grow at roughly the rate you fond more of the (fixed item). There are many reasons for this, and it is partially why for thousands of years of various gold standard there was so little economic growth. Once countries stopped limiting the amount of total economic growth to the amount of gold they could dig up, that economies were able to grow at the sustained rate they have for the past 200ish years. So, besides the fact that the US has not in modern history been backed by gold, despite the name, there is ample evidence from hundreds of economies and thousands of years that being on a gold standard = little or no economic growth."
