I prefer the TD Gold Elite Visa issued by TD Canada Trust. The card offers a 1% cash back reward, and I can completely avoid the annual fee by maintaining a minimum balance in my TD bank account. In addition to the 1% cash back, other features that I like on the card are: There are some other features (see complete list here), but those are the ones I care about. I used to carry both Aeroplan and Air Miles type of reward cards, but when I wanted to book a flight and discovered the hassle involved, the value of travel points evaporated as far as I was concerned. I also decided I would never again pay an annual fee to earn rewards; it's counter-productive.
