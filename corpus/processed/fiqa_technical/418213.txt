Taxing divident earnings hurts bank shareholders, customers, and qualitatively impacts the equities market for the worse because it A) Lowers the incentive to hold an equity instrument over long and intermediate periods, incentivizes short term holdings creating a more chaoticly traded stock market with more pronounced crises occurring more frequently. B) The resulting dead weight loss of long term equities investment constricts the capital available to banks and investment firms, limiting the services they can offer their customers, decreasing product yield and increasing borrowing costs. C) The banks, having lost business in long term equities trading, then of course make less money and return less money to their shareholders. No such things as a free lunch, my dude.
