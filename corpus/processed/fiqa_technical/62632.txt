Agreed, but you also have to consider that wages have not kept pace with house price growth. Many millenials in Canada either can't afford a home or took a mortgage with a small down payment that will put them underwater if interest rates go up or they lose their job. We live within 100km of the border, but there are only 35 million of us too. And population growth is slow, even with immigration. Once the boomers die off there's going to be more housing available than demand, they are just holding on longer than expected.
