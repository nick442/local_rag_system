There is something special that binds workers together, and too few of us recognize it. We work. Every man for himself? If only that were true. Capital is very well-organized and working collectively for its best interests, and you can bet your ass they look out for each other. And it's better for them if they keep the rest of us divided and hating on the people slightly worse-off than we are.
