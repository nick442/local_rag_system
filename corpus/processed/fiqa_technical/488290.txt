You're absolutely right. That is why I eat at local restaurants instead of fast food. I get better food at a lower price. The real problem with fast food is institutional. Typically, you have a large public corporation with shareholders. I do not like shareholders. They usually want maximum returns, but they don't care about the business. They don't have to work there and they do not make choices about the food or anything else. They only care about money. Further, most fast food chains are run by franchisees. They care more about the product, but there's still a lot of profit motive and they don't have much, if any, control over corporate. So you end up with competing interests driven by profits and, with that many people demanding money, the product suffers and prices go up. I think this is a *terrible* model for delivering a quality product. All the forces at play are trying to cheapen things and increase profit. A small family-run restaurant doesn't have these problems. They know they need to make a good product at a fair price or they go out of business. Without all the grasping hands, that's an easier and less expensive thing to do. Which is why the small local restaurants get my business. They give me a better product at a lower price. I don't think a company like McDonald's is capable of that unless they go private, throw out their shit food and focus on delivering quality at a fair price. That's just not possible with a shareholder/franchise business model. It is not efficient.
