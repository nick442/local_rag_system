Private equity is not entirely comprised of turnarounds, however, I understand what you're looking for, and I suggest you take some time to read this article: http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/22306-my-week-at-private-equity-boot-camp Note: the people who sit in offices and crunch numbers or figure out how to structure deals are generally the middle or lower-level staff of a firm. At the top of a firm, you generally have people who decide what the fund should be invested in, and what strategy they should use. PE is a business, and you should think of it that way. So, if it were your business, you'd naturally hire really smart guys to crunch numbers or come up with solutions. Then YOU look at these outputs and choose one to go with. Such is how an efficient PE firm runs.
