Payroll taxes are only paid on salary, so you will be paying SS Tax and Medicare only on the $60,000 you pay yourself. You will still pay income tax on the distribution, of course, but the payroll tax savings seem significant (~$13K according to the calculator below). While tinkering with a new web technology some time ago, I created this JsFiddle application. I can't swear to its correctness, but I'm pretty sure it's solid (use the UI in the bottom right quadrant of the screen): http://jsfiddle.net/psandler/NKAZd/
