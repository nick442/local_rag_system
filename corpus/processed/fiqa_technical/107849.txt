Don't even remind me of poor CS. My mom was on the phone for 5 hours yesterday 5 HOURS with Expidia because they messed up on their end. They offered my mom $25 credit but they never emailed it. After the 5 hours they said that they had no record of the calls and we had to call the air plane company ourselves. I am never using them again
