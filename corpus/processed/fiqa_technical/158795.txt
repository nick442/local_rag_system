"Agreed, but going back to Amazon Prime itself, haven't you seen how the shipping charges are routinely just put into the price? Every non Prime item is $x plus $y for shipping. Then you see the Prime item listed for $(x+y) ""and free shipping!"". Just curious as to how you aren't more upset about that."
