Pay attention to the guidelines for the number of questions on each topic, master the subjects that have the most questions. IIRC, it was regulatory stuff (memorization) and value calculations/options (logic). Memorize the stuff you have to memorize, UNDERSTAND the stuff you have to use logic to get through, so you can deal with questions as they come up.
