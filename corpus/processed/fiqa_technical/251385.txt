"If your friend is loaning you KRW which you are then converting to USD, then there are tax implications. This would be a Section 988 transaction so ""gains"" or ""losses"" made during repayment (partial or complete) due to fluctuations in exchange rate would be treated as ordinary gains or losses. For example, imagine you borrow 100,000 KRW and, at the time you borrow it, this is worth exactly 100,000 USD. At some future point, you repay 20,000 KRW. If the exchange rate at that point is such that 20,000 KRW is worth 15,000 USD, then the IRS sees that you have ""gained"" 5,000 USD in ordinary income. This is a particular concern if the loan is a mortgage and you refinance the mortgage at a moment in time with a more ""favorable"" exchange rate than the exchange rate when you first got the mortgage.
