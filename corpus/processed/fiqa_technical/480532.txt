My point was more that I've seen, firsthand, people *not* take financial responsibility for their dependents or for themselves, and that they can't be trusted in investing in any future. Like I keep saying though, I just wish *those* irresponsible folks didn't benefit from the social security. I wish it went to their burial costs, to the bereaving family, etc. Personally, I have modest Life Insurance available through my employer, and I usually opt-in to any additional programs offered at open enrollment. Given I'm still in great health and in my 20's I probably ought to look into getting more/real Life Insurance, as well. Of course I'd rather be investing in my family's own wellbeing than the state of, well, the State, but for the aforementioned reasons I see benefits in the status quo model, as well.
