Reducing the lowest tax bracket to zero from ten, and the next one to twelve from fifteen, is a tax cut for the one percent? As someone on the cusp of one percent, I'd be paying more under Trump's plan. Fortunately I'm getting married and my wife doesn't make as much as me so when we file together we'll still get a break. It's pretty sick how deficit spending only hurts the lower class and helps the one percent when there's a republican on office. It's also pretty sick how the author's hypothetical spending cuts are to welfare, as if there's nowhere else in the budget that could be cut. The article is partisan nonsense. The tax cuts are directly to lower and middle class only. True, there are massive corporate tax cuts, but any individual getting money from a corporation is paying income tax on it. All a corporate tax does is reduce the amount of money the corporation has to invest in itself and its employees.
