Interesting. I've actually experimented with my Uber rating from time to time by tipping (in cash, obviously) every time for a week and then never tipping for a week. Tipping definitely does impact the rating (even though I can't imagine why I'd ever have deserved less than 5 stars every time, tip or otherwise). I travel a lot, so I've also noticed that it depends on where you are - in certain areas tipping is expected, even if that's technically against the rules. I'm not sure how that expectation would change if the driver knew that he *may* have gotten a tip, but it would be an interesting experiment.
