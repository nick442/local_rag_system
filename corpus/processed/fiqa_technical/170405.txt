I bought a digital game and I had to use their stupid app to get the keycode, which it never gave me. I ended up wasting shit tons of time on the phone with their idiot reps who passed me like a hot potato and then they had the nerve to say my pc was the problem and that I needed to pay for Best Buy's geek squad to fix it when clearly there are a lot of threads that show the problem is on their side. A bug or multiple bugs in their app that appear to have existed for at least a year and still hasn't been resolved. Even if the prices are good, this is why you shouldn't shop there. Because they treat their customers like crap.
