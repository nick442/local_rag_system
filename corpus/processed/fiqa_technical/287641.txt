Once I was buying a water filter for my refrigerator. Amazon had it on sale, but I was tired of dealing with it and I was at Lowes for unrelated reasons. Well, they price match so I grabbed the filter and had them handle it. >We don't price match Amazon. We only price match competitors. Uhh, I believe the sale of this item is literally in competition. Also your price match guarantee does not make that statement. >Let me get the manager. One eternity later. >We only price match competitors. Honestly, Amazon is stealing a huge volume of your sales and you are telling me with a straight face that they are *not* a competitor of Lowe's and that you are refusing to price match this item? Also, I believe that generally competition is unwanted and unavoidable - in fact it is an existential problem for retailers. At this point, several other customers start backing me up. I was too busy texting my wife at the time how ridiculous this was to react in time to film the cringe spread on the manager's face as he agreed to price match a fucking $30 water filter. I almost felt bad for him but he was a real dick about this and I got to see some small portion of his life force extinguished in utter dismay. It took me nearly 30 minutes but I saved $7. Fuck Lowe's.
