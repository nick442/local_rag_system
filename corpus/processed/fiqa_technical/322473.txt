The pirates will always pirate, it's their nature. But I believe that artists and other creators should be paid for their work. I would gladly pay for a commercial-free, on-demand video service.kinda like netflix except with a better selection I suspect that there are enough people like me to allow the scheme to make money.even if the pirates never pay.
