It looks like you are very well read. So here is some advice that you might have heard but dont take seriously and let me warn you since you are signaling a high intellect that you should take this very seriously. Do not do drugs. Even alcohol or cigs. You most likely have a high possibility of addiction since from what i have noticed the smart ones get easily addicted. This is not a joke. You will be much better living a sober life and i want you to do good for the world.
