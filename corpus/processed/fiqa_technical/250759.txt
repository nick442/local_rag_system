Definitely. The only reason I didn't mention banking was because I know there's currently a lot of speculation regarding the impact Brexit will have on financial institutions operating from London. But the core foundation of banking is still so strong in London. People keep saying London's banking can't survive leaving EU ... but look at NYC, Geneva, and Singapore - none of them are in the EU and are considered the worlds largest banking capitals.
