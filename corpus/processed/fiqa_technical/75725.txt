Yes! You totally get it! I find the previous comment from the other to be the shinny example of what is wrong with the perception of working with an IT professional. Yes there are issues within this industry, but there are in every industry. Yet, the level of rudeness my employees receive from clients because they perceive us as an intrusion in their day is very draining. We're trying to help, tapping your shoes and sighing every 2 minutes that we're not done yet doesn't make the work go faster. One of my employees was screamed at by a manager of a client because their network was down. New to us client and their previous internal person basically used duct tape to assemble their network. We walked into a literal dumpster fire. What the manager didn't realize is that his managers weren't agreeing to what we proposed and there were over 200 emails back and forth between the talking heads before they would finally agree to the work that needed to be done. It was ridiculous. Overall though I am glad I posted this quandary. It gave me some ideas that hopefully will be really good.
