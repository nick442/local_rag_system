Serious question here..at buffet places, do we have to tip? What's the normal percentage? There is a new lunch buffet place and all the waiter does is bring you the drink and I guess clear the table when you're done eating..That's a bit less work than taking your order, bringing your order, making sure stuff is not missing from your order, etc.
