It is allowed to transfer money between ISAs however you like in one year. It does not count against the limit for how much you can pay into an ISA in a year, nor does it count as paying into two ISAs in the same year. But make sure you transfer the money. Don't withdraw it, then pay it into a new ISA. If your provider doesn't like you taking money out of one ISA while keeping another, then it's about time you found another provider.
