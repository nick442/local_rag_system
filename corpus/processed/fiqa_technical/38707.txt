I'm a 911 paramedic that brings in patients to ERs all the time. I've never brought a patient to an ER that wasn't staffed by an adequate number of doctors. trauma centers are held to an even higher standard. The hospital group has too much to lose if they lose that trauma 1 or trauma 2 rating. They will always maintain adequate required staffing.
