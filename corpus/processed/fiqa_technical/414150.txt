Wait, your dream internship is to do it an an insurance company? Seriously? Were all the internships with with debt collection agencies and waste management companies taken? Yes, I'm fucking with you. Anyhoo, to answer your question, and although it's been a really, really long time since I had to bother with an interview, my advice is this: get a good night's sleep the night before and don't sweat it. Appear interested in the company without kissing ass and stay relaxed (not feet on the interviewer's desk relaxed) and focused. One last thing: since this is your first time wearing a suit, wear it on and off during the days before the interview so it doesn't look like you just stepped out of the store without having ever worn one. It will also help you relax by not focusing on how you dress. In the end, if you fuck it up, it's not the end of the world, it's just an interview.
