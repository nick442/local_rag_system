This is high-order scumbaggery, and Bank of America must be dissolved. I really cannot describe how angry this makes me. These are the bastards whose fraudulent asses we bailed out, many paying for that bailout with the new taxes on unemployment insurance? While BofA execs buy Ferraris and yachts with our money? Good God. Hang them!
