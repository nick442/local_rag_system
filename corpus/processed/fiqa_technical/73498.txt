"Well, FB was trying to be nice to its female employees 2 years ago and initiated a ""freezing egg"" programme at company's expense. Taking fertility clock off their minds, freeing them for more around the clock work. Really considerate of them. INSTEAD OF JUST ALLOWING THEM TO GET LIFE OUTSIDE OFFICE! Yes, in the modern Western gulags, jailers wear kid gloves - the essence, though, is the same. No matter how much free organic yogurt and ping-pong tables you get. The chain's still there."
