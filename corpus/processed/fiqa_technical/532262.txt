Let's say you own a store, and you are looking to hire a front-counter person. You'll be leaving this person alone with the cash register on a regular basis, so you want someone trustworthy. You have two candidates: Bob has never stolen from a cash register in his life. He has spent the last three years working a job where his employer regularly leaves him alone with the cash register. Ann has never stolen from a cash register in her life. She has never had a job where she was left alone with a cash register. All else being equal, Bob is the slightly safer choice because he's had more opportunities to fail and hasn't, while Ann is a more unknown quantity. By the same token, a person who regularly borrows money and pays it back is somewhat safer to loan money to than someone who's never borrowed money before, simply because the latter is a more unknown quantity.
