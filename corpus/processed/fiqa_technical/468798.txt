"> Because: people with lots of money donâ€™t spend it. They just sit on it, like Smaug in his cave. Do they actually sit on cash - or are those ""money"" invested into factories and companies? When you have more ""money"" than you can spend in a lifetime, those are not the same ""money"" you had then you were struggling day by day - they are power and control over livelihoods of others, and not your own livelihood.. People with money are like politicians that no one voted for but that were elected nonetheless."
