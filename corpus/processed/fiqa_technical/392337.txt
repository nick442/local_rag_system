Fidelity answers this pretty well: Yes. The IRS requires that you keep your receipts for HSA account expenses. While you will receive an HSA bank account statement each month and you can access your account online, the receipts will be required should you ever be audited by the IRS. You may upload your receipts to the PilotHSA system for easy retrievel at a later date.
