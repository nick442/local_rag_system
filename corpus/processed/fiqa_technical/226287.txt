"According to communication expert and author of Small Message, Big Impact: The Elevator Speech Effect, Terri Sjodin defines an elevator speech this way: >""An elevator speech is a brief presentation that introduces a product, service, philosophy, or an idea. The name suggests the notion that the message should be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride, up to about three minutes. Its general purpose is to intrigue and inspire the listener to want to hear more of the presenter's complete proposition in the near future."""
