If you've ever taken a look at Amazon Fresh,it's full of pretty much the same stuff (just much less variety than Whole Foods) - I'd imagine the WFM model isn't going to change from the brick and mortar standpoint, but will see a full scale integration of Amazon Fresh's delivery service, which will be good for both. Still not keen on 8 dollars for a gallon of milk tho. wtf Whole Foods.
