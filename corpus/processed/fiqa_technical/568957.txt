the taxi industry? each city has it's own way of regulating taxis, car service, and limos (a lot of times they fall under different jurisdictions). the regulatory bodies aren't really a cash crop for municipalities. radio companies and fleet owners are separate a lot of times, and neither are really rolling in the dough (a fleet owner i know drives a 2004 camry and only recently was able to buy a house in his 60's). the drivers usually lease from the owners, and bring home about $20,000 a year even if they take radio calls and drive like a maniac. it's not some giant industry monopolized by bigwigs holding everyone back with their draconian style of operation. it is easier to compare taxis and car service to other public services like buses and trains.
