"I somehow doubt there's any ""cast-iron"" reservation. Like airline carriage contracts, I bet in those multi page, tiny font legalese that actually is the rental car contract that everyone agreed to when they book (but few will read in its entirety I imagine)..there are clauses in there that probably say your reservation is not guaranteed and the rental company reserves the right to cancel cars for any reason. Obviously if you're one of those frequent rental program person/top tier member you will likely be not nearly as likely to be cancelled on as opposed to some rando guy renting.."
