"The failure of the Facebook IPO has everything to do with public access to markets. It certainly was overvalued at issue and there were a host of other problems as well but, the main issue that has caused the problem is that there were too many ""Armchair Analysts"" in on it. Less sofisiticated investors got in on Facebook at $38+ because they liked Facebook and everyone they knew liked Facebook. By and large they couldn't read a balance sheet or describe how the firm made money. As such as soon as it began to decline they sold without regard for the loss. Very few if any professionals actually baught it at launch and more than One pro shorted the position and cleaned up. I find it humorous that while most people would never think of trying to buy a house withotu a realtor they are perfectly happy buying thier own stocks without professional advice. Say what you want about the finance industry but, for the VAST majority of people having an advisor is a far smarter option."
