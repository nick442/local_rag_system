Lawyers who are paid quite well for it. Who do you think mortgages the future of their firms in some case dedicating themselves to fighting those corporate lawyers for settlements when they've wronged consumers. Unless you want to claim that having a codified legal system is bad I really don't see how thats relevant.. It's like saying all people are bad because some were nazis
