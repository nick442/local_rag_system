Are you kidding me? There's only one reason. Greed. If CEOs pay their workers less they take more home for themselves. Period. There is no other reason. It's wrong, because the front line workers are the ones who make the company work. They're the ones who earn 90% of the money. But they get 10% of the profits. It's crooked, and it's greedy, and that's all.
