Hmmm.. I am self employed. and I spend what ever time is necessary to learn the required skills.. this year I spent hundreds of hours learning about website development. Ultimately it's your choice.. if you can outsource some of the learning curve, why not.. You either need to have the skills yourself, or know people who can do the work for you. BTW. finding the right people is another skill.
