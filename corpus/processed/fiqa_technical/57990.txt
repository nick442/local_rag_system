The main concern I'd have is that something will happen to the account while it's unattended. While you may not have any money in it to risk, you could have a fraudulent check written against it that causes you to incur NSF fees. Your bank also might change its no-fee policy (I assume these are no-fee accounts, or there's an obvious drawback). If it does, it's possible you might not notice, and again then the fee might be assessed, overdrawing you and causing additional NSF fees.
