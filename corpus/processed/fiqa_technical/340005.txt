You're suffering from two basic mistaken ideas: First, major breakthroughs basically never happen in one big step by a single, identifiable person or team. Even Einstein's theory of relativity was composed of a bunch of existing work - what he did was show that two or three disparate pieces were compatible. Second, granting monopolies is a terrible way to promote the use or improvement of ideas, since it makes the first more expensive and leaves the second stuck in a legal morass. If the government has to get involved in research, steady funding + prizes would be a much more effective model.
