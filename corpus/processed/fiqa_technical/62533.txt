">""Those measures all reflect a new way of measuring VaR though, one that switches the model from a four-year look to just one year, removing the rocky years of 2008 and 2009 from the current measure"" From my understanding (and I'm no risk mgmt or quant), and the specifics are lacking some in both articles, excluding 2008 and 2009 reduces the volatility of results in their VaR model. If you look at a chart of S&P Volatility, you can see that 2008 and 2009 were anomalies, even though volatility was prevalent in every year since, until 2012.
