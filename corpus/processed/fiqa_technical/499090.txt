I agree. I pulled my free reports (by going to ftc.gov first to get link to the truly free reports). The Equifax data was out of date. Didn'tâ€‹ bother trying to correct it. As I don't need any new credit lines, I just put a security freeze on my records at all four bureaus. Makes my data virtually worthless to any potential identity their, and (best of all) nearly worthless to the bureaus.
