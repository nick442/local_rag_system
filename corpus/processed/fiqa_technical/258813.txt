I know bitcoin. I don't understand ethereum except that the smart contracts bit is an abstraction of the blockchain concept to expand it beyond a mere ledger to a crypto-enhanced trust system that could be the escrow of the financial world. I still need to read more about it and understand how ICOs are done. I had those sources open already. Some 10 tabs that I still haven't gotten to read in 4 months. Oh well, some incentive to get to it this weekend I guess.
