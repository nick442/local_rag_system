Indeed - the math. I bought my car 6 years ago. It was an ex showroom model (not demo) so came fully kitted and with a decent discount. I had the cash, but the salesman wanted me to take financing on half of the price *and gave me a discount* so that I would. It was a 3 year loan at a very low rate and was therefore lower than the cash price I had gotten. So I took the deal. I can only assume he was getting better commission rates for financing than he was selling cars. Either way, worked out for me.
