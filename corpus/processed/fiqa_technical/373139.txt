Romney isn't really a capitalist in the sense that he didn't place his own capital at risk. Bain Capital was founded by a guy named Bain who launched it with $30 million of his own moolah. Romney was recruited to run the operation but did not kick in anything. That's not capitalism; that's called being born lucky.
