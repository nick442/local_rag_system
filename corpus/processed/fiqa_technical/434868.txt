Dunno who downvoted you. Yes, that (as far as I understand your US Glass-Steagall act) is what he's advocating. In the late 1990s, when you guys were repealing your GS act, we in the UK were doing the same with our version of the same idea, thus permitting lunatic, risk-taking investment bankers to start playing with the deposited money of savings banks. Yadda, yadda, yadda, time passed, investment bankers took all of our money down the shitter, and then we had to pay them off because they hadn't just lost their own money, they had also lost all of *our* money, too. Hence bank bailouts, which were really the government bailing *us* out, because we had all been *gigantically goddamn fucking moronically stupid* enough to invest our money in investment banks instead of savings banks. Merv wants to re-separate the investment banks from the savings banks again because this is the *second* time this has happened, and we could do with the peace that will come from putting up walls that it will take another 80 years for the bankers to lobby down again.
