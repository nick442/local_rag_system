"These are all virtual meetings. The reasons are varied. For a lot of the best people, they are simply too busy to be that proactive - they are constantly in fire fighting mode, but want to be involved and help, so they dial in, and multitask. I get that, but in the end it is a poor use of everyone's time and focus. I try and suggest things to people like booking time on their calendars for catching up on paperwork or emails (and avoiding all day meetings), but in the end I have no control on how they manage their time and work. My peers are also at fault in that - there are way too many managers that think any topic over three emails must have a meeting, or have massive meetings every week just to read a powerpoint. I would love to have some enterprise rules on meetings, like - ""meetings should only be between 9-11, 1-4."" Or ""no more than 10 people per meeting,"" - think about the per hour cost of a 30 person meeting."
