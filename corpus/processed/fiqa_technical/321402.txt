There are few things on reddit that bother me more than seeing someone I disagree with making an honest attempt at reasonable debate, providing facts and arguments to support their position, and being downvoted and *ad hominem*ed away. Thanks for trying to engage intelligently on the topic. I'm all for solar, but you *do* make a good point here.
