"BPI would have won this lawsuit. This was not a ""spurious lawsuit"". LFTB is a quality beef product that brings very lean, high protein beef to a market that allows more consumers in the US to be able to buy and consume beef at a price point their budget will allow. ABC misled consumers by putting out a one-sided piece that was highly sensationalized to grab ratings. I have seen LFTB before it is blended with more coarsely ground, higher fat trim which is whay is used to make hamburger. It is beef. Pure and simple."
