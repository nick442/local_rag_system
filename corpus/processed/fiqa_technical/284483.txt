> Shouldn't all pieces from think tanks be thoroughly fact-checked? > Whether it be CATO, Center for American Progress, Brookings, Heritage, or AEI, it seems reckless to me to publish their pieces without fact-checking. I agree. Nothing that gets published as news should escape fact-checking. This goes double for opinion pieces. This is an inevitable consequence of treating journalism as merely stenography, reporting what is said without consideration for accuracy. However, > I don't even fault Stephen Moore for this. His job is to spread certain economic views.(ones that I tend to disagree with strongly, but that's his job) I don't think anyone's job is to simply spread an economic, political or any other view. I think any job involving analysis should include an imperative to make sure the views expressed are supported by facts, not to filter or alter the facts to favor a view. The latter is what Moore has been doing.
