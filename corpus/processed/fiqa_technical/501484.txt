Catching up to Apple in a market they already dominate is like rolling a stone sphere up a hill. I've seen reviews of the Zune that were pretty good. I don't think it was a terrible device but it came when Apple was hitting the sweet spot of every part of the mobile music market. I wish they had stuck with it. I'd probably switch as I truly loathe iTunes.
