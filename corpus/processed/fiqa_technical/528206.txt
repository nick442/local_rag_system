"Rather than thinking of becoming a landlord as a passive ""investment"" (like a bank account or mutual fund), it may be useful to think of it as ""starting a small part-time business"". While certainly many people can and do start their own businesses, and there are many success stories, there are many cases where things don't work out quite as they hoped. I wouldn't call starting any new business ""low risk"", even one that isn't expected to be one's main full-time job, though some may be ""acceptable risk"" for your particular circumstances. But if you're going to start a part-time business, is there any particular reason you'd do so in real estate as opposed to some other activity? It sounds like you'd be completely new to real estate, so perhaps for your first business you're starting you'd want it to be something you're more familiar with. Or, if you do want to enter the real estate world (or any other new business), be sure to do a lot of research, come up with a business plan, and be prepared for the possibility of losing money as with any investment or new business."
