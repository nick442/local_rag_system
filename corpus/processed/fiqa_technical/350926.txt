"Terrible service, apathetic staff, horrible managers, absurd prices, and last-in-line status compared to other comparable food joints. The only good thing about bdubs is their sauce, and you can buy that for five dollars at the store and make your own food and not have to deal with their bullshit. Literally had this conversation with my girlfriend last week: Me: ""I want bdubs but it's wednesday and their wings are only even almost worth it on the tues/thurs specials."" Her: ""Also we always leave there in a bad mood because of the terrible service."" Me: ""Good point. Let's go to <local mom and pop burger joint>"" But no that's fine, blame millennials for your business model that has been dying for the past ten years. It's not your fault! The children are the ones who are wrong!"
