"There are way more than ""some successful ones from millions."" Nearly all my close friends are employed professionals (I'm talking about doctors, lawyers, university professors, software developers, business owners, government employees, working artists, you name it) who use marijuana. Same goes for my parents' friends. If anything, they smoke much more than my generation. Yet they all seem to have had decent careers and are now retiring happily. [More than half of Americans have used marijuana.](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-poll-finds-majority-americans-have-smoked-pot-n747476) If what you were saying were true, there would be a huge underclass of people wasting away in basements, doing nothing more with their lives than eating Pringles and playing video games. But that's just a derisive stereotype that does not represent most people who smoke pot."
