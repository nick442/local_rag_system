Had a professor in college for one the business classes. He would teach inmates finance. One class he had a student that was in for some sort of fraud/money laundering. The professor was not sure how much the student had taken but he did ask if it was wroth it. The inmate said yes, explained how long his sentence is/was (it was less then 10 years) and that they only found part of the money.
