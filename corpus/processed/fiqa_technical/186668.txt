Agreed, if it is only for interviews buying an expensive suit is not wise. I personally am looking to only wear suits from now on (not just yet since I only have two lol) but eventually. That's why I don't mind dropping that kind of dough. But who knows? Maybe in a few years I'll look back and think it was the stupidest thing I did haha
