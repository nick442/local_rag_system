Not the same. If Walmart were to actually make a product and then let the same people who made it buy the product before any customers, that is a problem. Heck, it even pisses me off when a new product comes out (not made by Walmart, say Star Wars ships) and Walmart employees buy all of them up before they hit the shelves. That's fucked up. They aren't customers at that point. They are taking unfair advantage of their employment to buy things not yet available to real customers. Also, it has been long standing practice to not let employees buy the first X products off the line. Why? Because they might put more into the product that what they are paying for. Imagine if ALL the employees were to buy the new 3S before Tesla let a real customer get one. Imagine how many customers who put deposits down would be pissed. IMHO, personally and professionally, it's just wrong to let your employees have first dibs.
