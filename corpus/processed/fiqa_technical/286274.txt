"It goes beyond that, its the number of human beings we can think of as ""people"", we cannot imagine the possibility of there being thousands of people out there (let alone billions) so we associate the actions of many people to be done by one agent, so people say things like ""The government wants"" and ""The elite want"", ""the Jews want"", ""China wants"". You can also do this with companies like that guy did, who took the actions of thousands of people, which our meat minds cant understand, and made it the action of one person, which we can understand. I am an expert on the subject, I read both the cracked article and the wikipedia article, sorry sir but you are wrong."
