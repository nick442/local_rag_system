So your point is that you know a guy that isn't good with money and has made some not great life decisions, thus **ALL** people that work low skilled jobs (even at the minimum wage level) are thus bad with their money and not cut out to own a house? Really.. is that your argument? Correlation is not causation. Just because someone works a low skilled job and is bad with money, life decisions, and shouldn't own a house does not mean that working low skilled jobs are the root of those problems. >That being said, the initial argument is as bogus as yours. I have a 2 bed 1 bath apartment for rent for $500 right now inside 610 loop in Houston TX. It's 10-15 minutes from downtown. And rent here in the Seattle area is way higher than all of that. Yes, rent is different where you live. It still doesn't mean people in my area should have to live in a shack because you pay $500 in Houston. Honestly, that should be an incentive for companies to move to Houston to reduce costs due to cost of living difference, which is why companies are leaving California. But if you are here in Seattle, or another city, there should be the expectation that your workers can afford to pay rent somewhere in the area. Also, just curious, do you pay any of your employees only the minimum wage?
