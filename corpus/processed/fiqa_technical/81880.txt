The issue with spending a lot on a particular project (e.g. SWAT) is that you're compelled to use it, even when it's not necessary. Same with riot gear, armored personel carriers, pepper spray, tazers, helicopters, rubber bullets etc. If you paid for it, you have to use it as much as possible. So you end up with more violence and death because of poor investments. That said, there's of course a balance to be struck. No sargeant should be making $200k+ and no officer should be making <$40k.
