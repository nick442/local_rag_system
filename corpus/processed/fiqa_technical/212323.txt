"Yes I agree, I remember the British Airways flight I took to Florida when I was 13 for the family holiday and idiots were rushing the gate when they weren't called. Eventually the gate agent got so pissed off he made an example of this stupid middle aged man who was trying to act all entitled in the style of ""LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS MAN HERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO ARRIVES AT THE GATE WHEN THEIR ZONE IS **NOT** CALLED, AS A RESULT OF THIS YOU WILL BE BOARDING THE AIRCRAFT LAST SIR"" or words to that effect. He tried arguing against a piece of paper, you can't really win.. Also usually gate agents and checkin desks are staffed by airline services companies like Menzies Aviation as far as I know, I'm not sure if that's relevant however."
