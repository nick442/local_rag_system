"You're not making any sort of a persuasive argument why predatory HFT should be allowed to levy a tax on the system. Yes, computer trading is heck of a lot better than paper trading. You're citing an article from 2010 that states things I'm not even arguing against as somehow supporting this ""tax"", the mechanisms of which the author was not even aware of at the time. There is no valid argument for why this tax is necessary or good for anyone but the firms profiting from it. I'm all for lower spreads and near instant order processing, but that doesn't excuse some greedy prick from scalping my 401k a point or two of compounding interest every year."
