"If anything, this makes their salary even more stupid, in light of the fact that we already have a system that does their job. We don't pay people to dig tunnels by hand anymore. We don't pay people to taste the Queen's food to make sure it isn't poisoned. If a job is dangerous and can be automated, it is stupid pay for the hazard of doing the job. Now, I am not crying for the automation of all menial jobs. People need to work and not everyone can do educated labor. It's just that certain jobs are better suited to automation. We should not pay out the ass for the hazard, insurance, and lawsuits that result from such jobs. It's like paying a human 500k to perform the job of ""suspicious bomb parcel opener."" Sit back and let the robots breathe the fumes, get blown up, get crushed, etc."
