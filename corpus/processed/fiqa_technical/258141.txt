It's the equivalent of you being required to keep some of your savings in a near-zero percent interest savings account vs. being able to invest and grow that capital. Even if the capital requirements were peeled back slightly, (most) banks still hold more than enough capital to absorb extreme losses. Net/net the economy is safer, but less robust than it could be.
