"Don't forget they're trying to rip that fabric of society away from everyone else. They demand their social security, but fight tooth and nail to take food stamps away from others. They had quality K-12 and nearly free higher education, but do everything they can to cut spending on education, cut teacher pay, etc. They have Medicare but want to take any kind of healthcare safety net away from everyone else. And then they blame the young for not buying enough houses and ""wrecking"" the economy."
