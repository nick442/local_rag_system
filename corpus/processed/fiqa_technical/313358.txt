I froze my credit online yesterday. Last page of process confirmed I had frozen credit and told me to print last page because it has information I will need to unfreeze it. Page was blank. So I waited. Then I got timed out. Then I got a page telling me I had not frozen my credit. I had called a few times yesterday but always got a busy signal. So, at 5:06 est I called them again. Before patching me through to a live person that asked if I'd be willing to take a short survey after speaking with rep, which I agreed to do. When my call was transferred I got a message saying they worked nine to five and to call back later. Then the survey started. Needless to say, the scores were the lowest possible. And apparently unfreezing my credit will be problematic. Yippee!
