"I like this explanation the best. EV is trying to get at the value of the underlying business, excluding the capital structure you currently have on the company. If your lemonade stand is worth $100, but the business also comes with $50 in cash lying around (and no debt), then the EV is $100. But the price you'd pay the owner (the ""market cap"") is $150, because it's like you get an immediate cash rebate."
