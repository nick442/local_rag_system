Looking at this very thing with my work as I am out in CA lately. It really depends on the situation as far as I have read the laws for this, the law on certain breaks and overtimes varies based on being exempt or not and then of course there are exemptions for the exemptions so its not quite an open and shut situation and a judge will need to sort it out due to the high ambiguity of the laws. Based on my laymen's reading of the laws it appears that your lawyer could tell you that you are in compliance and another one (such as a judge) might disagree entirely.
