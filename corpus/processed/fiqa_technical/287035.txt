"I honestly think lowering the corporate tax rate and allowing money to be brought back into the US are both good for the ""average american"". I also think his main point is regarding the post 08 rules regarding mortgages and business loans being unnecessarily burdensome and restrictive, which has limited the amount of capital he's able to give those same people. Mind you, this is coming from the guy who didn't take advantage of the ""too loose"" regulations as well, so I can understand where he's coming from."
