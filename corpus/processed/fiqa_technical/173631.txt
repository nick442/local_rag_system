I love his example of channels that everyone watches still, in the midst of the collapse of the entire TV business: > **The majority of what we pay our cable company is wasted.** We get broadband Internet from our cable company, and we use that constantly. But we also get 500 channels that we almost never watch, along with a couple (HBO, Tennis Channel) that we pay extra for and do watch occasionally. Ah yes, what *would* we do without the Tennis Channel. Fast forward 10 years: only the Internet and the Tennis Channel are left standing, and are in fierce competition.
