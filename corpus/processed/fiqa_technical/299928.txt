I checked my account right before lunch because i was still thinking about what i wanted to do for my B-day. I had just got paid and my account was $30 and change. I had also just written my rent check as well. Some ass hat used my card and withdrew $300 at like 5 different atms(i'm assuming because they had different POS ID numbers) within like 5min. i didn't even know you could withdraw that much cash at once. Needless to say i looked like a bum infront of my landlord who gave me the sure that's why your check bounced look and 1 shitty birthday sitting at home eating top ramen. And since it was cash i had to wait almost 2 weeks (seems like months when you have no cash and a dwindling supply of instant and canned foods) for the bank to replace my cash. Yeah worst b-day ever. edit. oh and no i had no idea when they did it or how or where but the guy on the phone at the bank basically told me that it's happening a lot lately and asked my permission to file charges which i of course said yes to.
