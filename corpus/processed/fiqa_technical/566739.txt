You think that you could get Malcolm Gladwell to stop writing? If you took away all of his money, and told him that he would never get paid residuals ever again, do you think he would just stop? First of all, he would make it all back with personal appearances and book signings. Second, no real artists do it for the money. They get their rush from being influential, and helping people understand the world a bit better. The money helps pay the bills, yes, but monetary incentives have actually been shown to damage creativity. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y Commercialization of art is a perversion.
