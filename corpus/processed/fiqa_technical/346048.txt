Honestly, I've shopped at both and found Market Basket to be better. The produce usually seems fresher. If you want to rely on it for one stop shopping, the selection at MB is broader, just because the stores are bigger and carry more name brands, and more constant. If you're in New England, a better comparison to Aldi might be Price Rite.
