This More or Less podcast has a fantastic section on executive pay in the US and UK. With some economists whose research determined that there is basically no relation between remuneration and performance. In Germany, Switzerland etc where there are different rules and factors there is less overall executive pay and it is far more tied to performance. http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/moreorless/moreorless_20120511-1640a.mp3
