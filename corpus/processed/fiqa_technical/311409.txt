If your goal is to make your child's cleats or sport shoes more comfortable, you need an insole designed to cushion their foot impact. Our KidSole memory foam or gel insoles will make any uncomfortable sports shoe soft and wearable. The sport combo is the best possible solution for kids who do not need arch support but do need extra cushion.
