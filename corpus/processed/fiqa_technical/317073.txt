Good post. I remember about ten years ago TV wall mounts started at about $300CAD for a cheap one, and people couldn't buy them fast enough. I remember thinking at the time that a basic metal shop could pump them out for just a few dollars. One guy could probably make 10+ every hour. Oh well - lesson learned I guess.
