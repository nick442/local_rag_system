I'm not a lawyer. If someone signed a contract agreeing to that .. you could make a case that if someone agreed to it, caveat emptor and all. But I strongly suspect that a court would find a reason to strike down such an obviously exploitive contract, say you were taking advantage of someone's mathematical naivety, etc.
