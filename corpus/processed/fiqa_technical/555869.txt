>I disagree and see it all the time. Here's one example: people who grow up in towns where business has died off and don't move because it's all they have ever known. I'm talking about the economy as a whole. There are more towns where business has died off/is dying off than there are towns with business booning/on the rise. You are highlighting the extent of the problem, not a potential solution to it. >Sure there are legit reasons to hang around (family obligations, etc.) and not leave, but many just don't take the initiative to go where they can earn. If the stability of your economy depends on people *having* to leave the majority of towns in order to go to cities where they can make money, your infrastructure will crumble and the society will fall apart. >People did it all the time before the New Deal but afterwards are more content to draw off the government and stay poor.
