I wouldn't say this is a lie. Person 2 just made themselves the offer of 38k. If it sells then they were outbid. If it doesn't sell then they're stuck with the asset as if they had bid themselves. They're paying themselves, or they're representing a party that is paying themselves. That balances out to a $0 profit/loss + ownership of the asset. I think something like this would be unethical: Person 1: I'll buy your car for 30k Person 2: Okay Person 3:That's my car!
