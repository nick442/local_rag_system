Iâ€™m preparing for an interview with Vanguard & What I was told to do was to practice answering behavioral questions in the STAR format. Made a word doc answering popular questions in that format. Also just know as much as possible about the company. Reading their market and economic outlook and asking a question based on that could be good too.
