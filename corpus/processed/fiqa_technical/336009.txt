There are so many patents because solving the problem is a multi-billion dollar idea. IFAIK, no one has announced a storage system that can replace the grid during peak usage. I understand storing energy as potential energy is a simple concept, but if we're talking about GW of electricity, systems like [this train](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/forget-elons-batteries-fix-grid-rock-filled-train-hill/) which has a fairly large space requirement can produce 50MW for 15 minutes. If you had 20 of them you'd be approaching the power of a nuclear plant (a very small one), and you would exhaust yourself in 15 minutes. I know someone who was working on compressing fluids to store potential energy and that seemed fairly promising. But the fact is it's not a solved problem. Everyone is trying to solve it because it's the holy grail.
