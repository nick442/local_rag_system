I think the two have split in many ways. The majority of academic courses of course elevate competency levels, but they are only available either to those who can afford it, or those willing to suffer the debt. Competency in this context refers to direct training with companies in core skills needed directly on the job. Major organizations are now offering those from low-wage backgrounds a direct route to a career by developing their competencies. After a few years they might not have a credential (i.e. qualification such as a masters degree) but they will have a resume that's skills-rich; and all of those skills will have been industry tested, not college tested. Hope that makes sense :)
