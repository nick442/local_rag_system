A nice little summary, but with regards to the closing comments. I don't see much reason to be hopeful for change/awareness. Politicians are driven by lobbyists and election cycles. It is difficult to imagine a circumstance where policy makers would ever be inclined to pay attention to long term cycles, or this kind of basic economic philosophy.
