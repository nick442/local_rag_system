Are these estimates? I didn't see a link or source in there to actual financial statements. As a private company I'm not sure that information is public. A quick Google search didn't bring anything to light. Regardless, I'd be much more interested in seeing Spotify's cash flow statement. For startup companies that can be much more indicative of health.
