Thats easy. People don't confess against gangs because its a completely different game. Instead of two prisoners you have one prisoner and an organization that can go after the prisoners family. Oligopolistic competition differs from the prisoners delimma because a lack of communication or the presence of some form of uncertainty as to the other players motives is a necessary precondition. Its notable as well that cartel behavior almost always fails in the long run, due to the first movers advantage in breaking the agreement and stealing the competitors business.
