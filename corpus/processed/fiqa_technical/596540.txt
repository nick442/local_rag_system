Everything is down, when measured in the US Dollar because there was a flight to Dollars recently when everyone got the crap scared out of them with the Euro drama.. Remember, the thing you're measuring against is highly volatile at the moment - to get a better idea measure Amazon against something like a basket of commodities, or metals, or oil, or a currency basket (or better yet, all of these).
