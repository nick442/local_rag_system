"I was responding to ""How do you feel about those English majors in community college?"" Community college English major is not going to open many employment doors. Some with this degree are likely millionaires, but it doesn't mean the degree is the reason for their success. I suspect most successful English majors who utilized their degree graduated from more prestigious institutions than community college."
