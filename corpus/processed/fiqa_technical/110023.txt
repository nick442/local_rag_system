The actual physical act of obtaining the sequence data isn't the cause of the delay. The current estimates of 8 - 10 weeks for tumor genome sequencing are mainly due to the data processing. Pooling data and processing power would actually be a huge advantage in this. After you have all the sequencing data, you need to identify changes in the tumor, and then determine what exactly they mean (the really difficult part). If centers around the world pool their data, and correlate it to clinical information, the data set expands exponentially which helps everyone. Otherwise, each center will have their own data set, which will probably get published eventually, but there will be a huge delay before this information gets to the appropriate people, where it can help. Data pooling of this sort is already done in a lot of other cases, cytogenetic arrays, newborn screening, etc.
