I hadn't heard them called the four horsemen before hah (usually the big four or some variant of that), but I can confirm that not having time to spend what you make is a problem when working at one of them. Which is one of the big reasons I left after a few years, got better pay and far better working conditions. Wouldn't have been able to nab the job though, had I not worked there, so it is a bit of a catch-22.
