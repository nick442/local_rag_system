>Very different. Gas station takes way less time.. I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS. Again - as I have pointed out *three* *times* now - this is a tradeoff I accept, because for 90% of my driving, I can charge at home, which takes NONE of my time. If I add up ALL of my time spent standing around fueling my car, my total time is much LESS than yours, because my car charges while I sleep, I NEVER visit any gas stations, and charge stations are only visited on rare occasions (long trips.) DO YOU GET THIS POINT YET? I absolutely, completely understand you don't want to make the same tradeoff I do. If you don't get this point, or don't care how much total time you spend pumping gas, DON'T BUY AN EV. Now don't tell me AGAIN how much longer it takes to do a fast charge versus a fillup. Respond to what I am actually saying. RE: waiting to charge, this is rare. Superchargers typically have 6-12 stalls, and Tesla is tripling chargers in the next year.
