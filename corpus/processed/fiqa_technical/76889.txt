"One thing I've run into (working for a smaller MSO/Cable Company) is that when we started offering TiVo to our customers directly, we ran into all kinds of restrictions. Some examples - since we carries Starz/Encore, the TiVos we provided customers had to have the Netflix app disabled. More recently, I've seen more apps like Amazon Movies, the music video on-demand service, and more removed due to FCC restrictions on cable operators. Meanwhile, customers who pickup their TiVo from Best Buy or retail get the full experience. Now, one would think ""Yay! It's better for the customer to go buy the unit"". However, when they get it from us, they never have to worry about repairs (I went through two Series 2 units personally years ago - usually was the HDD) and we also take care of the programming guide cost so the customer doesn't have to worry about the monthly charge to TiVo or choosing a lifetime sub that's locked to one unit. It just really frustrates me because I prefer the TiVo over our standard Motorola HD DVRs but these regulations have made them (the ones we provide/rent to the customer) no better than the regular DVRs."
