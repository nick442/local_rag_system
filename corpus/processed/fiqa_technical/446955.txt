Government wasn't efficient during democrat presidencies either. Government has never been efficient. Both parties are responsible so blaming one or the other isn't going to prove or change anything. But that's not the problem here. I'm against both the parties and government in general. Long story short; the government is not, and has never been (Dems & Repbs both) efficient when it comes to infrastructure spending period. Government is slow and always over budget. Let's try something new.
