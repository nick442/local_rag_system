It depends on individual preference. There is no hard and fast rule. In general the recommendation would be not to spend much unless you have a sufficient money for a rainy day. Even after spending 10 K on a good car, the minute you have more money, you would feed tempted to upgrade before you are 25 yrs. So save and buy a cheaper / decent car and put the money away. But then someone would also say, if you can't enjoy when you are young, you may never get this opportunity to enjoy when you are old ..
