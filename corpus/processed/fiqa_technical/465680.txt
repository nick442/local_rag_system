Thanks. It's a continual work in progress but I suppose anything worth doing is. Good to be working on something you are passionate about, because you'll hit many, many, many roadblocks and hurdles along the way and if you aren't committed, the easy route is to fold. So I think starting from a passion and hobby is always good.
