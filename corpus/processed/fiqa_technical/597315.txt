I have never owned cable. I do stream shows or rent dollar DVDs. The only scheduled programming I partake in is sports, and I get that for free and in HD with either an antennae, or from just plugging my coax into the wall. Uncle_Erik is right, to older people this is a crazy way to live, but it is completely normal for the majority of younger people.
