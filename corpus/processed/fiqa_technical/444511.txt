Most banks offer a college card that has low limits so you can start building credit. Another good option is to get a rewards credit card and do your everyday spending on it, then immediately turn around and pay it. I have seen people that just overpay their credit card just to use it like a debit card, all while earning credit and getting rewarded for it. I work for a bank so I see this alot.
