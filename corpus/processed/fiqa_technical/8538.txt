"This report raises even more questions than it answers. From pg. 36 (pt. #176): >Concerns were again raised to Compliance in relation to an instruction to reduce LIBOR submissions given by senior management on 29 October 2008. This instruction was given **following a telephone conversation between a senior individual at Barclays and the Bank of England during which the external perceptions of Barclays LIBOR submissions were discussed.** The Bank of England was potentially involved as well? First I've heard. The report goes on to state ""No instruction for Barclays to lower its LIBOR submissions was given during this telephone conversation."" But they don't say why they rule it out so definitively. Very interesting."
