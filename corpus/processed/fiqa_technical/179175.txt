I just described its function. Tell me what they do other than what I described, and also tell me how much of drug companies' budgets are consumed in this process (preferably the unecessary parts of the process), especially compared to the rest of the drug spending and inordinate profits. Drug companies run ads, they have sales reps (pharma girls), they have tort cases (not a symptom of regulation), they have research, they have HUGE employee and CEO salaries and bonuses, they have distribution costs. Trust me when I say that regulation isn't the driving force here.
