Okay let's try this a different way. Completely forget about what the bond is with. Here is how a bond works: * You get paid interest for holding the bond (5% interest means a coupon of $50 assuming one coupon a year) * At the end of the bond term (maturity) you get paid $1000. In your scenario, you get paid the $50 as an interest payment and the $1000 final payment. If you only had the bond for one year, your total payment will be $1050. Try drawing a timeline to visualise it a bit better
