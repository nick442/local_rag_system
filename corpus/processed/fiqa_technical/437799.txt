Are you serious? Voting for more social services for poor people hurts those with money by either raising their tax burden and/or reducing government expenditures that would have otherwise directly benefited them. By giving blacks the vote, the white population's votes by definition carry less weight. Thus they've hurt their own ability to influence government. I hope you can see the list goes on.
