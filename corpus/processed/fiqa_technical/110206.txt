I'm arguing that proclaiming that everyone in a certain area is part of some collective agreement isn't the same as actually having a collective agreement. Therefore, no person has an obligation to pay for it if he/she does not want to be a part of it. And no, they don't have an obligation to take positive action to reject it.
