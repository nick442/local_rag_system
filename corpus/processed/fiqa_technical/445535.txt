"I think all transportation uses only 1/3 of oil produced at best. That includes many things that won't be electrifed soon, like planes and ships. Don't forget how much oil agriculture uses in both fertilizer, pesticides and the least in running the equipment itself. So while demand may soften over time, it's not like will suddenly glut. Peak Oil (which we reached with ""conventional oil"" vs fracked) kinda says that each subsequent barrel will get more and more expensive to pump out (rather the popular perception we will suddenly run out). That basically has been a truism since over a century, because ERoEI on oil has declined. At peak return, iirc in the 1930s or so, we were getting something like 300 barrels of oil out for every barrel of energy invested on some fields in Saudi Arabia, now the overall average is down to around 10 or less? Point is, oil won't go to $10. Oil industry could not survive on it and they know we don't have alternatives for many oil uses (it's the most easily portable liquid with the highest energy concentration), so why price it as such? If people really wanted to reduce their carbon/oil footprint, they'd stop pining for electric cars and switch to a plantbased diet - which will have a far greater impact for much less investment. On top of all the health benefits they accumulate."
