Before, you just had to make cymbals - now, you have to make cheaper, better cymbals than a 400 year old cymbal manufacturer. Oh, and you now have to get into musical instrument stores (who might have deals already in place allowing the other company to be their sole supplier of cymbals). And, then, when you do find someone willing to sell your small line of cymbals, you have to compete with a company who mass-produces dozens and dozens of different lines (and who can offer the store owner much better discounts and freebies than you can).. Ask Amazon Auctions what it's like to be a second mover..
