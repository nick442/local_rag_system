Thanks for posting that, hopefully someone beside me will read it. I'm entirely aware of the difference between Volvo and Volvo cars, just as SAAB-Scania used to be one company - they still share a very similar emblem. To complicate matters even more, there is still an independent company called SAAB that operates in military high-tech and aeronautics. Unsurprisingly, their competitors have tried to associate this company with the bankrupt SAAB Automobile.
