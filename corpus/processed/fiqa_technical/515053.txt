I didn't see on the website if the previous years model worked. The solution they offered in the end didn't cost you any more. You would be credited for the purchase. At any point in the store when you went back did you talk to a manager? Did you talk to a manager after any of the initial phone calls? The sales people have limited power. I'm sure a manager would have settled this much quicker than blindly emailing the execs.
