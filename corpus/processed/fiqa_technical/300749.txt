"I'm assuming you're operating on the cash basis of accounting, based on your comment ""Cash, I think that's the only way for a sole propriator (sic)"" Consider: There are two distinct but similar-name concepts here: ""paid for"" (in relation to a expense) and ""paid off"" (in relation to a debt). These both occur in the case you describe: Under the cash basis of accounting, when you can deduct an expense is based on when you paid for the expense, not when you eventually pay off any resulting debt arising from paying for the expense. Admittedly, ""cash basis"" isn't a great name because things don't solely revolve around cash. Rather, it's when money has changed hands â€“ whether in the form of cash, check, credit card, etc. Perhaps ""monetary transaction basis"" might have been a better name since it would capture the paid-for concept whether using cash or credit. Unfortunately, we're stuck with the terminology the industry established."
