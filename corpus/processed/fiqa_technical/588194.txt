That depends. Are you willing to accept the traditional meaning or are you insisting that we dilute the word to cover every business and corporation? > An entrepreneur (i/ˌɒntrəprəˈnɜr/) is an owner or manager of a business enterprise who makes money through risk and initiative.[1][note 1] The term was originally a loanword from French and was first defined by the Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon. Entrepreneur in English is a term applied to a person who is willing to help launch a new venture or enterprise and accept full responsibility for the outcome. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur
