"Economist joke: Bill Gates walks into a bar. Suddenly an owlish looking guy with thick glasses starts cheering and orders drinks for everyone. The guy at his right says ""What are you so happy about?"" The owlish guy says ""That's Bill Gates! He's the richest man in the world"" ""So?"" ""The average income in this bar just went up several tens of millions of dollars. We're rich!"""
