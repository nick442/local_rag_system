"One thing to consider is that road wear is largely proportional to vehicle weight to the 4 power. ""Generalized Fourth Power Law"". This leads to a result that an 18 wheeler is roughly the equivalent of 9600 cars. One consequence is that we can tax shipping weight, assuming some of it will go over road. Another option would be vehicle registration fees that are proportional to the weight of the vehicle. Yet another would be a tax on automotive battery packs (comparable to the lifetime energy output if it were gas). Keep in mind that most local road construction is funded by property taxes, not gasoline. Next time you see a cyclist, thank them for paying for the road and doing several hundred times less damage to it than your car. :)"
