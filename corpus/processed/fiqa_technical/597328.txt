I want to know it is taxable any guidelines As per the income tax rules, this is taxable to you. The amount will be treated as gift to you. The limit of this in a year [across all friends] is Rs 50,000. If the limit exceeds, the entire amount is taxable. You would need to declare this as other income and pay taxes as per your tax brackets.
