I believe it. I'm in IT in a company that I've been trying desperately to push to go 100% digital. We're being cockblocked by several board members and one of our accreditation firms is saying it's a no-go. The accreditation firm still makes us respond to letters by filling them in with a typewriter. It's not on special paper or even any sort of letterhead. It doesn't make any sense. Our HR director that was fired several months ago was solely advertising job openings in newspapers. They were hiring people that don't even know how to copy and paste or add two cells in excel. Then they wonder why important billing gets fucked up after these people handle those documents.
