You started with the unsupported statement; I would think you need to justify your position first before attacking theirs. Edit: thanks for updating parent comment. Those are more opinion pieces though, facts to backup how obomacare and Dodd Frank harmed the middle class would make a stronger argument. Edit edit and for those down voting you mistake my position, I'm trying to encourage productive discourse. I think both parties are dirty liars.
