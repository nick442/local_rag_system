I don't know why your comment got downvoted because it's perfectly sensible. My only issue with extending the SOL is what basis to use when determining what the statute should be. I'm sure there is, or at least was, a perfectly logical reason for setting it at 5 years. I don't have the foggiest idea of what the basis was mind you, but I'm sure there was one. That being said, extending the statute for future crimes solely because the prosecutors let it run out this time strikes me as being on shaky footing.
