Here's an idea Microsoft, Take the 10 to 15 thousand dollars that you were going to pay just for the H1-B Visas, and develop a training program where you accept anyone with a Master's Degree in anything (just as proof they can learn), and redevelop your own workforce in a training environment. Make the commitment from the workers 3-5 years and make the pay less than an average starting engineer/whatever you need. After the 3-5 years, they have the option of staying or going and you better make the package more attractive to keep them if you want them to stay. Simple as a pimple, doesn't need foreign workers or politics and actually creates more customers since it's very unlikely any of the citizen workers will be sending money home to foreign families remaining in country.
