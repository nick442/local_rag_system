I've consulted to a few companies before and I have to say the biggest problem I found among them was their inability to understand growth. Now, most companies become ambitious and in a sense want to grow and increase their profits but are completely off in how to do it. This can be seen from a manufacturing/sales/engineering perspective and administrative functions. The idea that always sticks in their minds is they have to add personal if they wish to grow, though that isn't always true. As an external person with no set bias, you should be able to figure out a creative way to their problems (even if they haven't noticed them yet). Another area I've come to see problems in is debt. I've seen successful companies held down by their insistance they run a cash only business to others that took on too much debt. There is no easy solution to this, yet a gradual and conservative approach to this area can help them in the long-run. On the same topic, I often think there are lots of inefficiencies in finances (and the support groups) that can be remedied in an easy manner. Lastly, the biggest problem I've seen with every single small business is customer service. As they grow, the lack of training is apparent and there is no common ground as to how employees should be portraying their company. Good luck!
