Well, OS/2 is a pretty hard target for it by nature. Most of that which are venues for spread in Windows and *NIX are actually not part of the operating system with OS/2. It wasn't built for compatibility with existing standards, but as an all new standard in most regards. Everything there for existing standards like TCP/IP, is basically a plug-in that interacts with programs that would use it. This makes it very hard for something external to actually affect the core system. Even a lot of OS/2's out of the box functions are implemented in this manner.
