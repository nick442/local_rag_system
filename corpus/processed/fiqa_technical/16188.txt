"The problem is, who is going to be left holding the coins when the market is over? That's one of the things that really turns me away from cryptocurrency. The idea of a decentralized currency, I really love. But I can't help but feel they are all basically Ponzi schemes. People invent new types of cryptocurrency (like Ethereum) and the creators have the first chance to mine the coins with zero competition since no one else knows it's a currency yet. After they mine several million coins, they publicize the new currency and a bunch of short term investors buy into it and hoard up the coins because they are into it for short term gains. The price of this sexy new cryptocurrency spikes with all this interest, and then when the price is high the big early investors dump their coins on the ""casuals"" who frequent cryptocurrency forums. These users all proclaim how it's so much safer than the dollar and this particular cryptocurrency is better than the other cryptocurrencies so they buy into it.. and meanwhile some hot new startup just spun up some even newer cryptocurrency and is mining it while investors hype it up.. There are over a dozen cryptocurrencies now, how many were hyped up as the next big thing with news headlines like this? How many tens of millions of dollars of hard earned savings were taken from cryptocurrency supporters who wanted a safe alternative to fiat currencies? It's just sad really, half these currencies are just exploiting people's fear of fiat currency and basically using that fear to scam them."
