No one has considered the tax write off at the end of the year? Will the house be in the parent's name or his, and can one of them take a write off for taxes and interest at the end of each year? On a small salary this may mean he has no tax liability for the four years, and can possibly make up the extra buying costs.. also, look at the comps in the area for the past five years and see if home values have increased and turnover rate for the area will tell you if people are buying in that area..
