"Economics will generally be more respected if it is a Bachelors of Science. The BS will have (in general) more quantitative coursework as compared to a BA. The reason that economics PHDs are often valued is for their quantitative skills, hence why you have heard the Economics BA can be a ""useless major."" This is not entirely true it can be a great start to a law or government career. Personally I paired an economics degree with mathematics to get a strong quant skillset. The truth is economics has little practical application in business and if you are truly interested in business that would be the best major to acquire well rounded skills in that area. While you may learn some strategy and high level finance in an economics program you will know little about marketing, accounting, operations and other more nuanced areas."
