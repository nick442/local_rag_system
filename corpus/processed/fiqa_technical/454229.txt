I would base my decision off of regulatory climate and look primarily into eastern Europe to tackle the higher growth climate; let's say Estonia or Lithuania. Estonia ranks better in surveys tracking hours senior managers spend dealing with regulatory issues. Lithuania seems to have the edge in terms of just getting the business started, land purchased and enforcing contracts and cross border trade. They probably have better demographics in terms of workforce. Links: http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/WorldStats/ESI-senior-management-time-regulation.html
