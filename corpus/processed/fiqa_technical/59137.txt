> Guess what, making money hand over fist who owns walmart? shareholders - people. your neighbors. who benefits from their lower prices - same. > There's this insane idea floating around Republican circles that the only way to really make it in business is to fuck everyone below you as hard and as fast as you can im a libertarian. but why can't people just get jobs elsewhere? and don't say because the economy is shit - the gov't caused that, not free markets. making a company efficient is good. it makes prices lower. it frees up people to do more valuable things. your arguments are the same as those who support trade barriers, tariffs, etc.
