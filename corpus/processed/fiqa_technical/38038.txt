amen to that , too big too fail should have never even been pronounced. But again, some people are at fault, if people went to credit unions instead of banks in drove, banks would be forced to change their way at some point. Even get smaller instead of bigger to better serve the community its in..not so long ago you , you could have a loan at a local bank for your small business, nowadays with no collateral, you get squat. there is no risk to the lenders, and they manage to still fuck up ~!
