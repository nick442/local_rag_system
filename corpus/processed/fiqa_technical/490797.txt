"Agreed. I use to fly cross country every other week and depending on whose price was lower, I could go either VA or AA. VA's seats, in flight entertainment and food options, timeliness, cleanliness and attendant hotness completely blows away AA. AA's coach seats are the same things I sat in flying to Florida when I was 12. They still do in-flight movies on busted-up CRTs over the center aisle. I'd fly Virgin America everywhere if I could. That being said, I *did* have one of my greatest travel experiences ever arise when flying to Turkey on AA and losing my passport en route (while still in the US, fortunately), stranding me in an airport on Christmas night. A couple of AA personnel went above, beyond, over and out of their way to get me to where I needed to be. Seriously, it's one of these stories that's so improbable yet brilliant that any ad exec would instantly set up the ""satisfied customer"" commercial shoot as soon as they heard it. I wrote letters to AMR and every manager from the terminal on up that I could find to talk these guys up, and never heard peep back from their managers. I only hope these guys got *something* out of it besides the satisfaction of saving my dumb ass."
