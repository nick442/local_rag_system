I dunno, I think what Alphabet is doing with their moonshot factory truly could be a game-changing corporate paradigm. Once something like Waymo becomes profitable and begin scaling, it could redefine the way CEO think about corporate goals and visions. Never mind longer shots like Calico. It's basically a homegrown venture capital firm on steroids, but with even more synergies. It's amazing stuff.
