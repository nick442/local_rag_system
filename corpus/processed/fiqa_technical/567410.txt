Since its such a small amount, they may require you to move it. A common cutoff is $5k, but it varies from plan to plan. I would roll it over into an IRA. The problem with withdrawing it is that opportunity to save is gone. Especially for IRAs, which have a low maximum contribution, its hard to make it up in the future.
