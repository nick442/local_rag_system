It might not make sense but sugar most readily goes into our glycogen stores in the muscles and have low efficiency to fat conversion (de novo lipogenesis). Carbs alone do not contribute significantly to body fat: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/74/6/707.full >Most experimental data in humans, however, contradict this view of the function of de novo lipogenesis. Initial studies in which indirect calorimetry was used showed little or no net de novo lipogenesis after short-term carbohydrate overfeeding (1). Subsequent isotopic studies confirmed the absence of quantitatively significant flux through hepatic de novo lipogenesis under most conditions of carbohydrate energy surplus (2,3). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11722954 >CONCLUSION: De novo lipogenesis increases after overfeeding with glucose and sucrose to the same extent in lean and obese women but does not contribute greatly to total fat balance. Now, if you're eating all the time, you will hardly burn off the fat you do have and consume all the time. Also, a potato has 1% of it's calories from fat (and brocolli 8%), and potato chips will have 50%. This is the problem. Natural carbs, therefore, are not the problem. Processed food is.
