I do feel like you do need to be lucky in this hiring environment. When employers can get everybody and their dog to apply for a given job, you need to have that four-leaf clover (or at least a referral, which, lucky me, I don't in almost all cases). Now of course, you can keep applying, yes, and you can keep working hard at it.. but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll eventually get lucky. It just means that you're now competing with different people who get lucky sooner than you do, and new people who get lucky sooner, and so on, and so on. That's the problem with luck - it's never certain, so in theory it may never come through for you. And that terrifies me when I think about it that way. Of course, all I can do is keep applying, as it does me no good to acknowledge the potential futility of it all and give up. I'm just saying that as a mathematician/statistician, I'm very aware of probabilities. I always feel like the probability of getting accepted anywhere is close to 0, and sure, the odds increase the more I apply.. but that doesn't mean they reach 1.
