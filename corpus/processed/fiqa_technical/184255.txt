I don't understand why they've bunkered down and kept this orca show going when they know it can all be over if they just remove that part. Stop the shows, free the orcas, they'll look like heroes, and everyone will flock to SeaWorld because they're good guys now. They listened and changed. People love those stories. But they're destroying themselves with this. If they just got rid of the shows, people would love SeaWorld. They'd have higher attendance and more money to help more animals. The leadership is completely out of their minds.
