Nope. Everyone has a price. You'd probably spend 1-2 years in prison for the right amount of money and a guaranteed multi-year high-paying position waiting for you after you got out. The company's legal team could work to scrub your record. Politicians practically do the same thing.. enter office, take a $175K annual salary for a few years, act as a vote proxy for a major corp, and exit office to a cushy high-paid corporate job.
