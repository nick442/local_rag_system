So, given this number, you need to work at least 25 years in that scenario to break even. Contingencies such as losing your job, being unemployed, or working for lower salary are excluded of course. I'm also highly dubious that everyone with college degree reaches such a differential. 90% of the people will not reach 300-400K more in their lifetime.
