Don't know about your area, but in DFW area, Time Warner encrypts all premium channels. So a QAM tuner can see the signal, but you won't get a picture. I'd need a QAM tuner with a CableCard slot, and there are only 2 tuner cards I know of with a CableCard slot. I don't know of any TV that accepts a CableCard which can also output the signal on the HDMI, DVI, or component outputs where it could be captured by a computer. Doing so would violate the Cable Labs licensing agreement if the stream had any copy restrictions on it.
