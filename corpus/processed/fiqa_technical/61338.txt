Agreed. An easy way to practice selling is by joining a direct sales company. Just make sure they are legitimate and require no money to start. It gives you a product to sell (even if its from a catalog) and many times they have online resources that help train you. Sales is a mental game imo. Getting past personal barriers and facing fears is a major huddle in sales.
