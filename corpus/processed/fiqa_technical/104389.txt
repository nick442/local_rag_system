The purpose of a hedge fund is not to hedge. People do not put their money in a hedge fund because they want to protect against downside. They put their money in a hedge fund to make money. Of course any fund is going to have risk controls, whatever form they take. And the S&P 500 goes belly up way less often than the average hedge fund. Want to protect against the downside? Just don't pull out. All I'm saying is OP's comment is really fucking stupid. It'd be like saying Greenlight Capital can't make leet gains because it shorted Allied Capital while longing the overall stock market.
