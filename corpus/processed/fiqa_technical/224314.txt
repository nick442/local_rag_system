My favorite places to eat are places that do a few things and do them really well. Inventory turnover is important at a place that serves food. I do not go to Chipotle to get chicken fingers or burgers or dim sum or linguine or seafood or pho. I go there to get the one thing they've focused on doing well. You seem to be really hung up about about how their menu is too limited. Chipotle makes burritos. If you don't like burritos maybe you should go somewhere that doesn't make burritos.
