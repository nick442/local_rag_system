"That's true. However, let's say Andy lives on top of a bunch of coal. Charlie and Daniel create a piece of paper that says ""Andy's House Title"", and give it to John, who's pretty buff. He kicks Andy's ass, ties him up, and forces him to mine coal. This is good for Charlie and Daniel, who can get cheap coal. It's good for John, who's king of Andy's house and gets all the profits off the coal. Not so good for Andy. And that's part of why some other nations have a problem with us. We're buying coal for John, sending him guns, and helping him kick their asses when they try to throw him out."
