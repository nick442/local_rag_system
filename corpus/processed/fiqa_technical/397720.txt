Fantasy Land doesn't exist. People who desire the good life, work the hardest. No one who truly understands business would pay great wages for an unskilled worker. If you cannot advance your career where you are, you need to find a new job. If you don't want more responsibility (which comes with more pay), stop your bitching. If your one line, oh so witty, comment is anything like your work ethic, I assume you don't make shit for money.
