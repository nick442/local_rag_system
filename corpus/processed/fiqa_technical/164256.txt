So you operate under the assumption that people aren't already better. To assume people are selfish is to be short sighted. People are selfish in SOME WAYS, but people are selfless in others. To operate without seeing both sides is to cut out at least half of your tool set. The problem isn't how to stop people from being selfish, but how to use each aspect of the person to benefit themselves and society as a whole.
