"The real estate agent industry is a cartel. They seek to keep fees high even as their services are becoming less and less necessary. To that end, traditional seller's agents will laugh at your attempt to negotiate their fee. They can do this quite simply because the industry is designed so the vast majority of people think of buyer's agents as ""free"" even when they are anything but free. That being said, the only way to do what you're trying to do is to find a buyer's agent who will rebate to you a portion of the commission they receive. It is extremely extremely unlikely you'll get a seller's agent to play ball especially once they know you're interested. You can check out redfin which connects people to RE agents that rebate commissions but the buyer's cut isn't that high. Your best bet, IMO, is to contact agents in your area before you go shopping to see what kind of rebate you can negotiate with them. A word of caution, if you look at a house without your own agent, instead asking the seller's agent to show the house they will claim procuring clause and you'll be sunk. In other words, once they claim procuring clause, you can't, later, go back and get a discount broker to get the commission to rebate to you."
