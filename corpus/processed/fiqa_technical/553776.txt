One of the most [unprofessional & corrupt military in the world](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/air-force-chief-says-ready-for-full-spectrum-ops-1758926?pfrom=home-lateststories) Over 35-40% of their Air fleet is not air worthy, they are running around in the world trying to buy fighters. The aircraft they built themselves (Tejas) can barely take off. The Army does not have enough bullets or reliable rifles, or POL supplies to last 48 hours It takes 2 militants to hold up their entire brigade head quarters Their economy bubble is popping so they won't have the resources to pay for all the fancy checks they are signing for hardware Yet in their imagination they are going to fight a two front war, build some fucking toilets and stop drinking cow piss, its pickling your brains.
