Why not all of them? It was greedy people in general. I have little sympathy for the bankers, subprime borrowers, and house flippers. I really wanted to buy a house in the mid 2000s but came to the conclusion that it was a terrible idea. A house is a huge investment, and if you're dropping 400k on something, you should probably do some research.
