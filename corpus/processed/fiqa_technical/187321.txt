Ok smart guy. The point was in NY people who make $112k wouldnt consider themselves affluent and still need help to cover rising costs of higher education. You dont like my janitor example? Look up what a police officer makes at top pay with a little overtime, or a nurse or a fireman. Go see what a foreman in a union labor job makes.
