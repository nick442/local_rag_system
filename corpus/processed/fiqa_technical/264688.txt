Please provide specifics how and when all of these things will help the economy. I just showed you that they're not going to help the economy. You proved to me that that idiot Trump supports them. Says nothing about whether they're going to make a difference (spoiler alert: they won't, at least not a positive one). Go ahead, reply with more vague bologna that proves nothing. It's totally fooling me.
