Could those problems be solvedby simply building in unallocated hours into the system? If I were in charge I would give each person 5 to 10 hours of week for personal time. They could spend it helping other departments, learning new technolgies, fixing their computer, or simply relaxing. Having to account for every second of every day is just too stressful.
