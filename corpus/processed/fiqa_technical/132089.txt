There is no research or scientific data to arrive at how much in Single Fund is good, how much is more risky. Its a question of risk appetite, how much money if you loose you are fine. This is similar to making a decision as to how much diversified should a portfolio be .. i.e. what mix of FD/Mutual Funds/Shares/Gold/Real Estate one should have.
