Industrial grade batteries, which is what you would need for this, are not cheap. Your typical household batteries are super cheap, but not electric car batteries. Also I was speaking more from the substation point of view for the purchasing of the batteries, not the consumers. I could see having to maybe pay a membership fee to that type of station to get access though. Somehow have a way to sign some kind of forms for insurance of return of the batteries.
