But what about when economic interests use their economic muscle to influence politics? Consider: politicians, beholden to special interests, regularly pass laws that direct public funding to private interests. The everglades sugar tax credit is one such example. The credit subsidized sugar producers in the everglades who couldn't compete with corn syrup or cheaper foreign sugar. Thus, economic interests captured political interests and used pubic policy to enrich themselves at the cost of the public. The economic rich therefore harmed everyone by harming the free and open market. They were and are complicit with the politically rich. Money is political.
