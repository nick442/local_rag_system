I'm pretty sure it's easy to tell in hindsight if they were leaving. Just look at the companies who started outsourcing. Not just to Mexico but the world over. It was roughly a 30% tariff that was a barrier. If I made 100K a year off of my manufacturing business, that isn't so bad. But then I notice that the average Mexican in manufacturing today makes slightly over $2 an hour on average. I can pay one American $8 an hour, or I can pay 4 Mexicans $8 an hour combined. Assuming I have the capital (tools) I can go south, quadruple my production, cut my labor cost, and still come out ahead with this tariff. If 1 person makes 10 widgets (sold for $10 each) an hour, I can settle for either 10 widgets with one American for $8 or I can have 40 widgets with 4 Mexicans for $8. By my math, 1 hour of American widgets makes me $100 (minus 8% for the American wage). 1 hour of Mexican widgets makes me $280 (minus 2.9% for Mexicans wage) after tariffs. A 30% tariff is nothing. Anyone that thinks that was standing in the way of anyone leaving is foolish. It is true that it may make people second guess, up until the point they look at how much more profit they will return. And of course it makes it easier for them when there is no tariff, but it is also true you are ultimately better off as a consumer when there are no tariffs.
