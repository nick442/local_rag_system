There are well established recruiting paths into the big bulge bracket banks. They recruit heavily from target schools, both undergrad and MBA. You don't just career switch into a front office role. If you want to become a banker, you would typically enter as an Analyst, with a two or three year stint directly out of undergrad. You would have needed to get top grades from a target school and be successfully chosen from a very, very competitive recruiting pool. If you already graduated, you will need a few years at a top firm, score 700+ on the gmat, get into a top bschool, deal with similar recruiting situations, and then enter as an Associate from your target MBA. Competition is so tight I see CFA on everyone's resume. Lots of MBAs. source: i work at a BB in NYC
