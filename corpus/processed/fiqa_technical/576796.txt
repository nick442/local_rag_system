An increased pool of workers demanding the same quality of life we have, fair labor and wage laws throughout the world (which is how they'd get that), would result in a global middle class, with countries like China, India, etc. no longer desperately outcompeting US workers for cost of production, which means it will be commercially viable to have production occurring in the US again on a large scale. Plus, more people with more money means greater demand for goods. What needs to happen is reigning in the artificial deflation of the value of labor..whether that will happen or not, I'm not particularly optimistic.
