The whole concept of a monster chain restaurant (maybe other than fast food/coffee) is anathema to me. Boutique food made with love, local-ish ingredients, chef/owner and I'm in. Publicly traded, industrial kitchen crap? Who in their right mind would pay actual money for that? It seems to me that's a business plan who's time has passed. Give it annother 5 years and these places will either have adapted or died.
