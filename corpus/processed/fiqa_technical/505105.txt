That's just not relevant. Of course you can't prove they aren't responsible. How is she going to hold Equifax fully legally responsible for what happened to her when there was only a 15% increase in fraud? What's to say she's not in the 85% that would have happened anyway? How are they going to prove in court that Equifax should be forced to make her whole? I mean, look at [this list of breaches.](https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2017-data-breaches) Why isn't one of those guys responsible for paying for her problems?
