">eroding the 40-hour work week Ha. Ha. Ha. I made a Reddit post about the transformation from 9-5 into 9-6 once, and the responses basically indicate that the 40-hour work-week has been thoroughly eroded and mostly eliminated for a while. Nowadays, either you ""get"" 32 hours/week at the low end so your employer can avoid giving you benefits, or you work more than 40 hours/week. We need labor unions back."
