There usually would be a SEC investigation if this kind of behavior is noticed. One thing that bothers me about this article is that, in the midst of all the fear mongering, the author doesn't mention that quote stuffing is designed to screw over *other HFT algorithms* and doesn't have any real impact on investors. Firms doing HFT frequently report this stuff to the SEC; for all we know, Goldman already did.
