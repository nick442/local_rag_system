I don't see why people are up in arms about this. These distributers have been holding consumers over a barrel for so long, from their Hard Back 3 months then soft cover release bull shit to text book rackets and retarded E-book pricing. I'm glad Amazon is sticking it to these fucks, at least some one is standing up for the consumer here (Even if its just because if benefits them). Just like when music went from CD's to Digital and record companies tried to strangle digital music sales to keep their hardware format monopoly alive. These publishers are running e-books into the dirt by price fixing them to same price as physical books which is just as retarded as Magic the Gathering charging full price for packs on their online game. Amazon is tired of pushing their over priced shit (that is only that price because of some paranoid business exec's that are afraid of change worrying about their hard back sales) because it hurts their kindle and frankly they dont need them. For the average consumer books are so easy to pirate we are just skipping all the middle men entirely, but I think a lot of those people would mind spending 4-5$ for a book (At least soft cover prices, paying the Hard cover price for a god damn e-book is extortion).
