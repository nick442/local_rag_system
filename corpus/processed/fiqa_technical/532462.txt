Yep we tried that last year. The only one who was not extortionate could not clear the item through U.S customs, so our Client had to hire a broker to do this, which was a hassle. I have also been in touch with companies who offer freight, warehousing and distribution. Idea was to ship over ten units at a time in a shipping container, store in warehouse and the instruct distribution as the orders came in. After all the calculations it only worked out about $40 cheaper than sending them one by one stright to customers. With each shed costing around $800 to ship! I found that one air fright carrier did have the solution we needed, and good rates, who I am using next week. They have had a change of policy recently though and will not deliver to residential addresses going forward. So now I am back at square one..
