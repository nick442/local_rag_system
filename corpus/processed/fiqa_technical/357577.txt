Why not talk about services? Why should I pay more for services. It's not like more income means I use the roads and bridges more. More income doesn't mean more kids that need public education. More income doesn't mean I use fire services more. If you ask me, I'd rather people just pay for the services they use. Have kids? Then you pay for their school. Drive 60 minutes to work, then you pay more than someone that drives 10 minutes. That's seems fair.
