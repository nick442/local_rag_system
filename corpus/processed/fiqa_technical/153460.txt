"The article misses one thing. The aftermarket automotive parts makers. Small scale car makers indeed did fall to the big players, but customization has existed nearly as long as cars themselves. From sponsored performance specialists like Carroll Shelby to the backyard mechanic making lifters for his Jeep, the ""long tail"" is exactly the same as that of the Lego. Companies like Lego encourage it and digital distribution of specs, standards, and physical merchandise make it much more prevalent, but it's nothing new, and certainly not recent. Making a quality product and insuring that smaller producers down the line *want* to drive sales of your product is just smart."
