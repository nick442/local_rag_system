You can think of a free cash flow as dividends from operations. FCF = cash from operations - investment in operations. The present value of these cash flows into the future is the value of the firm (DCF is very much like the dividend discount model). Now why does a DCF produce enterprise value and not equity value? Because a DCF values the firm's operating assets. To find the equity value, you use the accounting relation: assets = liabilities + equity (or in financial terms net operating assets = net financial obligations + common stockholders equity). This means you take away net debt from the value produced by the DCF to find equity. Now all your excess cash is netted off against your financial obligations (debt) to find the net debt. Cash used for day to day operations is an operating asset and should be treated as such, operating cash should not deducted from value of assets when finding the value of equity. At least that's what they're teaching at university now (i'm a uni student who's just finished my business valuation subject).
