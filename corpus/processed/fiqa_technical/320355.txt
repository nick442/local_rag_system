Secret Service agents are paid according to their worth. It's a difficult job to get, and a difficult job to do. They're basically in charge of protecting a large group of VIP's who are *constantly* under threat of attack. It's not unreasonable that they be paid overtime for working 12+ hour shifts all the time.
