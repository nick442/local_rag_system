Fedex and UPS allow shipping packages with COD (Collect on Delivery) option. You tell them how much to collect, and they will hold the package and attempt to collect it from the receiver and then remit to you. If they cannot collect - they'll return the package to you. In the (post-) Soviet Union republics, the local post offices provide(d) similar services. If you're shipping from/to these areas - check with the postal service if they have it. However, that may be only limited to the postage costs (I believe that's the case with the USPS).
