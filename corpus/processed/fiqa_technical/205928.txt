Yeah, the vehical cloud is the assumed intersection of self driving cars and the direction most businesses are heading: subscription models. No one needs to own a car, you need transportation. Cars are really expensive and for most people, they sit around idle more than 50% of the time. That's where Uber has come in (right now). But once we get self driving cars, companies are likely going to move to a subscription model, whereas you pay $xx.xx per month and you get x number of transportation miles per month..or however they set up billing. But youll request a car when you need one, and much like Uber it will arrive. The question is, who will dominate this space. Uber has already told Tesla they'll buy self driving cars. Google has been working on self driving cars, Apple has been working on self driving cars. They're all trying to get into the space. But someone has to build all these cars. Ford's repositioned themselves as a transportation technology company. They can see this shift happening and trying to participate when it does.
