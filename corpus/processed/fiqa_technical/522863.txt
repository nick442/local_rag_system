That kinda sucks. I just figured out that Kmart has cashback coupons for video games that they don't advertise on new releases if you sign up for their rewards card. I got $30 cashback for Arkham City which I used for Skyrim at 30 bucks back that I used on Ocarina of time that gave me $15 for Marioland 3D which gave me $15 for Mariokart 7 and I am currently sitting on another $15 from that.. They work like store credit only for games. but hell.. The problem is that they often times don't advertise them so it seems hit or miss, but since I started getting games there at release, I have yet to miss.
