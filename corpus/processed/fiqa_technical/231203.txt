People pay for CDs and DVDs before ripping and uploading them too. Also, books have been free online for 15+ years, yet I still buy almost 1000 dollars of books per year. I prefer the paper. I like being able to scribble notes, and then loan the book to a friend, or give them away to people who can use them, or to my local hackerspace.
