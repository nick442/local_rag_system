"It makes far more sense to require that every public employee has a hotel room with a cheaper ""courtyard view"" than require them to fly coach. If someone decides their vacation is okay to waste one day recovering, it still might be necessary to have them fly business so they can actually sleep on the red eye (and shower at the lounge) before their meetings."
