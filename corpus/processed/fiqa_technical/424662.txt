It isn't always bad. There are cases where it works. Unfortunately these are hard to predict. There is no magic formula: if you have X years of experience in profession Y that makes it perfect to go into business Z. Even if Y and Z are the same, unless you have the correct type of experience in Z you can quickly get over your head. Ten years as a waiter doesn't help you to understand the entire restaurant business. In some cases the key to running a successful business is having years of experience running a business. In other cases the knowledge has to be domain specific. The less complete your knowledge, the more landmines and blind spots that will exist in your operation. The weaknesses have to be filled by others in your team. But that exposes you to other problems, they can let you down without you knowing it. The better approach is to say in a few years I want to own a business. What do I need to do to get to that point besides money to buy the business, money to run the business, and money to survive the early years. What knowledge do I need to gain, or team members do I need to recruit.
