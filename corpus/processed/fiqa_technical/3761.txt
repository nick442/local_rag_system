I wish that /r/economy had Submission Statement requirements like /r/TrueReddit so that when someone posts an antagonistic title like this would be forced to at least state their stance on the topic. Of course he also posted this in /r/conspiracy so I'm not sure /u/klmd should be taken terribly seriously to begin with.
