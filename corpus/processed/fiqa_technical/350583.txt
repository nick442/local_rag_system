The ads in the newsfeed are now maxed out, just as FB warned all their advertisers they would be 2 years ago. Twitter has actually been stagnating and struggling to get their users to engage. Most people just use it as a newsfeed. Reddit is a news aggregator and message board. It is not a social media site. Snapchat is a completely different animal and doesn't even bear comparison. Facebook user base is healthy and not going anywhere. As of right now they'd be the last one standing if people decided to abandon social media.
