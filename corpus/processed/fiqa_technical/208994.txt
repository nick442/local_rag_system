"Those are the ""right"" yields. They are historically (but not ""nonsensically"") low. Those yields are reflective of the sluggish U.S. and global economic activity of the past decade. If global growth were higher, the yields would be higher. The period most nearly comparable to the past 10 years in U.S. and world history was the depressed 1930s. (I am the author of this 2004 book that predicted a stock market crash (which occurred in 2008), and the modern 1930s, but I was wrong in my assumption that the modern 1930s would involve another depression rather than 'slow growth.')"
