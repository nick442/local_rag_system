I would imagine (correct me if I'm wrong) that one of the benefits of gold was it was very easy to detect counterfeiting. It had a known weight, easily identified color, and there were many easily accessible ways to verify that it was, in fact, gold. Paper money has been a relatively recent development, monetarily, and it seems like it has matured as methods of preventing false currency have likewise matured. EDIT: Ah, and there it is, in one of your comments further down. Cool.
