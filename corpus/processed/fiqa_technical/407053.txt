**Complete protein** A complete protein (or whole protein) is a source of protein that contains an adequate proportion of all nine of the essential amino acids necessary for the dietary needs of humans or other animals. According to the Food and Nutrition Board of the The National Academy of Medicine (NAM), formerly called the Institute of Medicine (IoM), complete proteins are supplied by meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, yogurt, quinoa, or soybean. Since the amino acid profile of protein in plant food may, except for few cases, be deficient in one or more of the following types, plant proteins are said to be incomplete. Vegetarian meals may supply complete protein by the practice of protein combining which raises the amino acid profile through plant variety. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/business/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24
