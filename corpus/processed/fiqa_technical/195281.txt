">Well, that's nice, but the Port Authority isn't funded by taxes. That's either a lie, or if true, then we're dealing with private security guards instead of cops. When you say that someone is a ""cop"" it is implicit that we're talking about a public servant. >And I doubt you're a tax payer in the state of New York Correct. >so the ""I'm a taxpayer"" bullshit is just empty rhetoric anyway. Wrong. When cops hear about other cops who earn more, it puts the pressure on them to ask for higher salaries. As a result, I will eventually end up paying more for my local cops here where I am. So yes, it does affect me. I don't want cops to feel that they are entitled to overtime that generates 200k compensation per year. Thanks for playing."
