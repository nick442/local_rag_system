Walmart treated its employees like shit for decades, they are just now starting to treat their employees slightly better because its hurting their business. They will piss on their employees just enough to not leave stains that their average customer will notice, and leave no mind to the lingering smell that the more well off customer might notice, but has no interest in shopping there anyways.
