Math undergrad here and I agree with others who suggest it is a good path for any quantitative business or data analysis field. I eventually went back for an MBA focused in finance and now work as a financial analyst. In addition to some of the mathematical advantages others are listing here another one I found is being able to teach myself how to code macros in Excel. I would encourage anyone with an interest in math who enjoys quantitative problem solving to pursue math degrees.
