don't panic yet, you never know what will come out of it. plus it sounds like it's your first interview. Most people don't land a job on their first interview. also get some confidence in yourself, you are already a head of the curve! you have your own business at a young age with a marketable skill set (assuming you actually have the skills). You'll be fine in the long run. success is just the result of learning from a long string of failures.
