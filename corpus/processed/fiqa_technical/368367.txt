You clearly have no understanding of how the corporate tax code works, so I won't waste my time explaining it. Guess what, they do pay taxes..but lobbyists over the years have made it pretty easy for them to pay as little tax as possible. The logic is pretty clear: remove the special interest loopholes and tax corporations at a globally competitive rate (we have the highest corporate rate among developed countries), more companies shift their production back to America and don't store their profits in foreign holding companies with near 0 rates. More money flows back in to country, r&d goes up, more jobs are created, more Americans are employed in meaningful jobs, wages go up, the govt makes up for whatever lost corporate revenue with the increased personal income tax.
