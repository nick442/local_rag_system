Yeah, except I, as a tax payer who earns much less, pay for the salaries of these type of people. And my local taxes on my house and everything up go more than inflation or my salary increase % every year. I'm a trained engineer who worked hard for his degree and I don't even get this cop's normal salary (which is half the $221k). I imagine becoming a bridge policeman is less taxing mentally and less challenging overall. This money to pay public officials doesn't come from thin air.
