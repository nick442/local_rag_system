"When my wife was ripped off by a locksmith (charged $60 initially and then added a $250 ""fish out fee"" after the work was done), we went to the BBB. We tried to talk to the locksmith, but he would hang up everytime he found out it was me on the phone. We had a few exchanges with the locksmith on the BBB website and after some back-and-forth, we went to arbitration. I got the $250 back and never would have even been able to communicate with this jackass if they weren't BBB accredited. I know Reddit hates the BBB, but they are a handy resource when you get screwed over. Even if things don't go your way, it at least gives you an opportunity to communicate when the business is ignoring you."
