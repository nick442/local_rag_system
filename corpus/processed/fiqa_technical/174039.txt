This is mostly an addendum to @fredsbend answer, which appears to list reasonable causes, but ignores the technical cost aspect. The other answer lists the technical cause, but doesn't explain it in detail. Look at the two graphs (from Wikipedia). This is how difficult -- in terms of computing power, meaning hardware costs and electricity costs -- it has been to mine bitcoins over years: This is how many total bitcoins have been made since the start of btc era: As you can see, despite rising difficulty and costs, the bitcoin mining is slowing down. It should be noted that this is by design. If you could use a home computer at start of bitcoin and mine 1 bitcoin a day on it, nowadays, you need to use specialized hardware costing thousands of dollars and pay huge sums in electricity costs in order to mine the same 1 bitcoin in a day. And this happened on the large scale quite recently. Add the fact that there is no visible way to significantly increase bitcoin mining speed regardless of hardware used -- the network self-adapts. The more hardware anyone throws at it, the harder it becomes for him and everyone else -- so extra hardware is used in order to drive out smaller players and keep the general ability to mine, rather than to increase the mining speed. Last year a friend and I were considering buying a couple specialized rigs, running on off-the-shelf powerful computers and using extra (gaming) graphics cards for number crunching. As we didn't get on the train fast enough, the graphic cards were bought up by bitcoin mining organizations en masse.
