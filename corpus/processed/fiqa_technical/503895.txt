If one person cuts them-self it's operator error, if a significant number of people cut themselves it's a design error. I haven't seen the holiday box, but I was on a plane yesterday and when the woman next to me asked for a coke and got a white can we both thought the flight attendant had misheard her. The same thing happened up and down the plane.
