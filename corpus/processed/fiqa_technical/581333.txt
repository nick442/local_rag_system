The whole internet is becoming pathetic. You can't go anywhere without having to fend off Alex-Jones watching, ammo-hording, conspiracy-mongering gold-bugs. It's unbelievably pervasive. People who had no interest in word goings-on are jumping into economic debate. Unfortunately, they're mostly mis-informed. I'll tell you what it *does* mean though: there is a generation of kids who have a united belief (**bankers are evil! down with corporations!**) and they're angry. Rational or not, at some point they'll begin to impose their will on the political system. We will have a generational clash, especially if economic conditions worsen. Bank on it.
