"> they are literally depriving that company of roughly half of it's revenue. No, Hachette is *depriving themselves*. They are welcome to agree to Amazon's terms, or open up their own online storefront elsewhere. Again, it's like walking into a store, not wanting to pay a price for something, then saying you are somehow being 'deprived'! If I want to sell something on eBay, I have to agree to eBay's terms and Paypal's terms. They *do* have a monopoly on online auctions. I know that if I do not want to meet their terms (which relates to very specific things I must do and rules I must follow and costs I must incur) - I can find another venue to conduct my sales. I read the response, and it seems quite silly to me. Hachette is walking on Amazon's ground and they need to recognize that, or open up their own retail space wherever however. They can go over to online competitor Barnes an Noble and sell their stuff there. Amazon does not ""owe"" them anything!"
