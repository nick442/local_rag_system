* I recommend MASSIVE new government deficit spending, * far more regulations on everything business, * increased unilateral power for the unions, * expand vacations to a mandatory 12 weeks fully paid, * work week should be cut to 20 hours, * wages should be at least doubled, * all consumer prices cut in half via government price controls any more problems?
