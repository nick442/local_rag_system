Right, but the world needs an army of burger flippers and low skill level wage earners, how else would the upper echelons profit? Wait, I forgot let's let arbitrary randomness and luck determine who gets a job instead of the one's with a passion for it. And then we can finally let people with passions start up their business because of complete happen-stance, or you know we could make a system in which there are more chances for people to succeed based on previous people's capabilities and successes, but no, this is between you and the universe to determine survival of the fittest, no hand outs! Sarcasms, and such.
