As asked previous in the week, there is a big difference between budgeting and expense tracking. Using software, like GNUCash, allows one to track their spending. A budget is a plan, the tracking is what actually happened. I do not track expenses, although I do budget. For me, hitting financial goals is good enough of a track, without investing the time and energy into tracking every penny. One could easily criticize my method, as how can you have a good plan without continuous feedback? For me it is an example of the 80/20 principle. If I put in 20% effort into making and sticking to a budget, I will obtain 80% of the financial success that a person who devotes 100% effort into budgeting and tracking. A person with the same income and life events, who budgets and tracks, will likely be more successful that I, however, not overwhelmingly so. For me time is better spent on other endeavors. You seem to have this attitude as well, but those that do track have it as part of their path to financial success and probably view us as somewhat foolish. This is another example how personal finance is more about behavior than math.
