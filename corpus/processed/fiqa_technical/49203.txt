I'm gonna drop some knowledge for you. If you buy 3 items for $9.96, the cost of each individual item is: $9.96 / 3 = $3.32 This logic carries through in any situation where you pay an amount for more than one of something. I'm confident you can extrapolate for the 2nd link. On that note, I don't understand how you clicked the links, saw *literally* only the price, and then closed them. You sure are zealous in your battle to defend Best Buy.
