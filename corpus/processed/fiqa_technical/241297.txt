>Could you have transfered millions of dollars worth of tulips around the world in minutes, securely and for pennies on the dollar? The only reason that is more complicated with dollars has to do with our underlying financial infrastructure. It has little to do with any real technological problems. >Authorities don't get say whether Bitcoin is *allowed* to exist or not. Why not? Criminal court cases have already found Bitcoin as something akin to a commodity. There is no reason someone in government can't regulate or outright ban it the way China did. And as the head of a major bank Dimon is in an excellent position to manipulate the value of Bitcoin and destroy it if he chose to do so. >Why would Bitcoin be better for *only* those things? Bitcoin has not done anything other than be a commodity people purchase as an investment. It's ballooned too high on value to be useful for cash transctions for any normal person.
