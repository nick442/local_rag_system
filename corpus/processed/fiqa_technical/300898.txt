Yea i agree with this but I do think that Amazon benefits a lot more from economies of scale than uber. Both are platform models where you get more profits by having more users. However, its a lot more difficult to compete with amazon (because of their warehouses, inventory, delivery speed etc etc) than it is to compete with uber( essentially has no inventory of its own). There is a cap to how much uber can charge on either side before it is profitable to enter the market and compete with uber. Furthermore, Uber has completely lost countries such as china so there is a limit to their top line. Also uber still has to fight its never-ending stream of litigation and that not just adds risk to the buisness but is a huge cost on uber. When it comes down to it, besides from the convenience of booking a ride from your phone, uber saves money by going around the fact that the drivers in uber do not need taxi licences and that directly cuts into government revenue. So far there hasnt been too much resistance but it is hard to say if it will remain the case in the future
