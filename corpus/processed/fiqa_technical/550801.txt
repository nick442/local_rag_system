"> There is nothing stopping you from doing a city/country/state proposition (laws vary). Sure there is. Corporate lobbyists, FOX News, the Tea Party, and many others have demonized the word ""union"" to the point that the Wal-Mart workers will refuse to fight for their own benefit. It's like pushing on rope; there's no concerted effort. I can get all my ""lefty"" friends to agree on this, but if the Wal-Mart workers don't do the heavy lifting themselves, it's a non-starter. > Flailing at Walmart isn't a solution. Pointing out what I perceive to me immoral behavior isn't ""flailing"". But true enough, posting on Reddit won't exactly change things. Neither will what you suggest. Unfortunately, it will take a lot more pain in this country for people to realize the system they support is working against them. Another decade? More? Hard to say."
