"I had a bunch of engineers as classmates in business school, so you'll meet and connect with many like minded folks as yourself. I would also encourage you that after your calculus classes, business school will be pretty academically accessible to you. That being said, I really connected with strategy during my studies and not finance so much..so I would point you toward Michael Porter's essay ""[What is Strategy](http://www.rcmewhu.com/upload/file/20150528/20150528184258_9036.pdf) "" It describes how some corporations (Southwest Airlines and IKEA come to mind) use strategy to operate their business for competitive advantage and thus profits. It may help you discover some things an MBA would be working on in the strategy department of a corporation."
