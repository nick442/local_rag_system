That's all completely irrelevant to the economic point. What we spent the government money on was a political decision. The economic piece absolutely involved marshalling all of the countries resources, *labor being but one of them*, by using the currency to pull along production. We won the war with our economic engine above all other advantages that we had. Now imagine if we cared as much about people having jobs in the US right now as we did about killing Japanese.
