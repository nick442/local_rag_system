"Amazon sellers have themselves to blame for this. Every single time I've had an issue with shipping (2 weeks for a ""2-day delivery), getting the wrong item, getting a broken item, etc. it is from a seller that isn't amazon. Additionally, their ""Prime"" items are often from third-party sellers that don't give a shit. Amazon could do this, or reign in the third party sellers. This seems easier."
