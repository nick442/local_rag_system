As someone who works in the tech industry, this isn't very fair. The CTO is in charge of the technical direction of the company. Yes Uber is fairly mature, from what I've heard, in their technology but continuing to iterate on their technology is what will keep them ahead of the field. Lyft is quickly catching up, especially since this whole fiasco started. They are also an important component of mitigating any potential risk, from security breaches to wide scale outages. Considering how critical the technology is to their business can you imagine the fallout from a wide scale security breach or multi day outage?
