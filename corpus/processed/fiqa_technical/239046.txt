To be fair, it's kind of hard to compete when you have to spend over $100k per vehicle on medallions, but the competition can just buy a car and start driving. Don't get me wrong, the medallion system needs to die in a fire yesterday, but as usual when corruption is weeded out, mostly it's the wrong people who end up footing the bill. The politicians who created this racket are the real crooks, but they're not the ones who end up going bankrupt.
