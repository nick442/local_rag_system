"Travis created a business that does not generate enough value for customers for them to actually pay in excess of the cost for providing that service. In other words, it has god-awful unit economics. With customers only paying 40% of the cost of an average fare, Uber would have to raise prices by 2.5x just to *break even*. When prices are up by just a couple of bucks, everyone already checks Lyft first. If it doubles or triples, they'll be taking the bus again. > He essentially invented the ""sharing economy"" Uber wasn't even his idea, it was one of the co-founders that brought it to Travis. Travis thought it was a stupid idea at first, but eventually came around on it. Spoiler: he was right the first time. > and has the most valuable startup ever The most overvalued startup ever*. FTFY. > how is that a ""shitty CEO"" lol. It's sort of the definition of one."
