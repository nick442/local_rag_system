"I've tried a lot of tablets and the PlayBook is the best one out there and the sale is a fantastic deal. The hardware and OS kick the ass of Android and Apple. Better cameras, better photos, better sound, better multitasking, better form factor. I loved the Torch more than any iPhone. The hardware was great and OS was decent. BBOS 10, if like the PlayBook OS as planned, would be better than the other phones out there. This isn't an error by RIM. It's fashion. Blackberries fell out of fashion. People don't buy based on good planning. They buy on branding and trend, and rationalize on the back end. The evidence for this behaviour is documented over and over and over. All RIM can do is try to become fashionable again. But fashion trends are random walks that require ""tipping points"" or critical mass. You can't really plan one. You just have to recognize them and jump on board. I suspect RIM will get bought out, or become a niche seller again. Wonderful. I'll take their top notch hardware and software at firesale prices while others get trendy but worse systems for more money."
