> But if I have my own iPhone and I volunteer to use it (instead of being out of communication from 5pm - 8am) and they turn around and tell me that a device that I bought and use for personal reasons is limited to whatever they decide to allow me to use, well forget that. If it's your personal device, indeed! If you have *confidential or proprietary company data on it* -- such as internal emails via ActiveSync -- then it becomes very relevant for your employer to secure it.
