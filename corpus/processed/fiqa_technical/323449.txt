You don't have to make the repairs, if they're just cosmetic. The insurance company doesn't care if your house looks good or not. On the other hand, if the repairs are structurally necessary to prevent water damage to the house, not making them may result in the company raising your rate or not renewing the policy due to the increased risk. You can try asking your agent if you can get a ruling on that now, before deciding whether to spend the money. And of course if you don't do it, they may not count this damage toward your deductible for future damage this year.
