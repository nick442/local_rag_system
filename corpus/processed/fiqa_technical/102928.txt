I don't know. Some of it is circuitous. For instance, in the DC area, one of the best venues for rock/metal music is the Filmore in Silver Spring. Why? Because that's the club affiliated with TicketMaster / LiveNation, so they get the best acts. There are plenty of equally good places from a venue standpoint in the area (e.g., the 9:30 Club in the U Street area, or even the State Theater in Falls Church), but the top acts tend to overlook those places because their agents are booking national tours, and they know to go to the Filmore for any show in the DC area. If Amazon came in, attached themselves to one of those other venues, charged less for those BS convenience fees, and attracted the same level of talent as you see with TicketMaster / LiveNation today, they'd be printing money hand over fist.
