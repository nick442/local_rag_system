"I'm not so sure the insider / outsider distinction is the best one, although it does have its uses - for example, if an organization has stagnated, you might not want business as usual, someone stuck in groupthink, and a devotee of the stagnant religion. On the other hand, bringing in an outsider doesn't necessarily mean change - they may be just as much of a devotee of the same religion that made the organization stagnant in the first place. Personally I wouldn't say there was a definitive Ballmer era though. People regularly change their own tactics and approaches, and I think Ballmer ""saw the light"" towards the end of his term with respect to One Microsoft - or at least it was one major conversion among a series of as yet uncompleted ones. I think Satya continued much of that in his own way - much like two restaurants can both be French, but still be quite distinct from one another. But if even early Ballmer can be different from late Ballmer, the important thing is probably more about how much change is happening, and whether it is the right change.."
