If you really care about security you need to use the minimum amount of technology required to accomplish your task. Systems can be mathematically proven correct but it requires exponential cost as complexity increases. This is why NASA pays about $1,000 per line of code whereas the industry average is $18. You could certainly build a system out of off the shelf parts, and it would probably work. But there is no way to prove that a backdoor wasn't inserted at the factory in China or by a malicious developer paid off by some foreign government. That $4 USB key you have was not designed with nuclear security in mind. Even if you got the source code proven correctness would cost more than developing it yourself from scratch. Yet you claim that somehow this unproven system is superior to a proven system in place for decades. Why because it is flashy? What extra functionality could it possibly offer?
