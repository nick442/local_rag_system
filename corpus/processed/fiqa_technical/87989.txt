"I used to run a telecommunications construction company and left to go back to school so that I could find a job in a ""white collar"" industry. Trade work is great when the money flows, but it's so cyclical that the downturns can rip your company/bank account apart. My sister that stayed in it is making 85k a year and I'm about to start a 45k a year job out of college. I guess I'll know in 5 years if I made the right choice, but I at least have a lot more job mobility than she does."
