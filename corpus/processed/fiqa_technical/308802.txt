Is this just appealing to potential sellers' need for instant gratification, or am I missing something here? Timing matters for some people. If you are moving cross country, it's important to be able to sell your house quickly if you want to sell. This can also matter if the seller is interested in buying another home. If their existing home takes three months to sell and they have already picked a home they want, it can make the timing of funds transfers quite inconvenient - often people need to sell their existing home in order to make a down payment on a future home.
