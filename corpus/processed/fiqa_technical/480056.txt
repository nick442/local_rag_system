QE was started by Ben Bernanke's FED who was appointed by GWB. The FED is a separate entity from politics regardless of all the attempts to gain control. No politician came up with QE and most didn't support it. Why would Dems or the GOP run on a program that an independent and privately run central bank created? Do you even understand what the FED is or how monetary policy is set?
