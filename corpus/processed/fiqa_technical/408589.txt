The right way to develop confidence is to get educated. Confidence can come from many sources, but the right source of confidence is an understanding of how markets work. Markets react (and overreact) to news. I think the biggest factor to trading successfully is to not allow emotion to drive you. You should determine how much you are comfortable gaining and losing and set those in limit and stop orders rather than just using market orders all of the time. As I've grown in my understanding of the market, I find it much more rare that I feel confident enough to make a specific bet. Most of my money is allocated in index funds, and I only buy and sell small amounts to reset the percentages according to a preset allocation plan. I still keep some cash available for speculative trades in the account where those trades will add the most value.
