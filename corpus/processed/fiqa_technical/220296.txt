You use Amazon if you use the internet. Amazon AWS controls 50% of the cloud provider market, which provides the back end and holds data for many websites, apps, and services. There's simply no avoiding feeding Amazon since they control the backend. There's also no way to totally avoid Google/Facebook internet advertising since they rake in a combined 75% of online ad spend and display ads on a plethora of services. So you're not using Android, Chrome, Google search, Gmail, Google Photos, Youtube, Whats app, Instagram, FireTV/Chromecast, or Android Auto correct? Those all feed massive amounts of user data into the aforementioned data behemoths. I find it hard to believe you don't use Youtube since it has a near monopoly on user created video, and the alternatives to Google search are pretty inferior unfortunately.
