Exactly what kind of regulations are you talking about here? Regulation in the form of licensing for doctors and lawyers is one thing, but what are you implying in regulation stopping competition for other types of business? As for the profit, I would say there are a lot of contributing factors, Globalization being a big one. Edit: No need to downvote, just asking for clarification..
