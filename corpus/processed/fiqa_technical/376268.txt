The banks and the Fed inflated the housing bubble. There was too much money floating around and it went into housing and loans for housing. The banks are highly responsible for this crisis because the failed to investigation into who was receiving the loans (due diligence). In turn, many of these same banks sold these crap and uninvestigated loans as CDOs and the like (made triple A by the ratings agencies, paid by the banks) to other investors, bringing in more cash that was quickly loaned out to keep the whole process going. All the while they were filing and registering these mortgage records with MERS to avoid paying various jurisdictions the fees and taxes owed (this is many 10s of billions of dollars). The easy money created artificial and inflated demand and completely distorted the housing market. Other than those large points, the banks are utterly blameless.
