All this talk about the post office is pissing me off. What killed the post office? Just look in your box this week. Right there is the answer. JUNK MAIL! Everyone gets pounded with the stuff every day. Why? Because it is too cheap to send all the CRAP! How many Victoria's Secret Catalogs did you get this week? Me? 4. That is the clearest signal that the postage for junk mail is too cheap. Another example is S&S Worldwide. They will send me three identical catalogs at the exact same time that all arrive on the exact same day. In other words, junk mail prices are so cheap it is more cost effective to just send more than to check their database. And I could go on. The key to fixing the post office is simple. Increase the cost of all the junk crap we get! This will either increase the revenue to pay for it being delivered or make businesses reduce the amount they send and reduce the need for as much sorting, etc.
