No matter what kind of contract you create for your partnership it will cost money to enforce it. Breaking the law is, well, against the law to begin with. You don't need to get a signed contract promising that they won't break the law. You could possibly get them to sign something that states if the contract is breached or laws are broken by one party, they forfeit their shares in the venture, but again you'll have to prove it and lawyers cost money. if the venture is paying you both then he/she will have the same capitol for legal defense. In some cases you can propose a trial period in partnerships. You can try doing business as separate entities for 1-2 years after which you can merge. After two years working together there should be some trust built up. If not, you shouldn't do business with this person anyway. Just my two cents. To be clear, I'm not a lawyer. You should probably ask a lawyer about this, actually.
