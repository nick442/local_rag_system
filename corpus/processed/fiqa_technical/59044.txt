Wow, why so defensive? I'm a bit confused as to what you are arguing exactly. In the first part of your post it seems like you are saying ideas can't have intrinsic value, only physical things. I disagree. Your second argument seems to be that Bitcoin isn't special. It's just one of many possible implementations of the blockchain idea. You do seem to believe that a blockchain can be valuable though, correct?
