On the contrary, you have no evidence that these kids are bitter and grumbling. I'm not saying they have a good job/life, also change is not a privilege. You and anyone can do it, first you have to know you can (sadly the kids in Indonesia probably don't know this), second you have to do it. Yes it takes will and determination, but luck is only a small part of it (of course it helps). Skill is only involved in what it might be trying to accomplish. If you don't have the will and determination to change your situation, having the skill wont help and you don't have any business being bitter or grumbling. Pack up the family, move across the country, try a different place. Move to a different country. Yes it takes effort, it can be hard if you don't have funds. I know of many cases of people doing this, it only fails if you let it. Stop blaming others, take some responsibility and do what needs doing. If you work in something that's so specialized you can't do anything else, then you need to learn some new things. I have employees that are this way. Talk about wanting to go to collage, but can't afford it. Its frustrating talking to them. I know how much you earned over 4 months of summer work. Your now going to live off that earnings for the next 8 months and come back in the spring and do it again. (my employees are seasonal and we can't work in winter) Instead of buying that new 4wheeler, go to fucking collage, you keep talking about how much you want to, don't brag about the $5k fish house you bought and the $7K snowmobile to go with it then bitch about being unable to go to collage and being trapped at work. Go do what needs to be done. The people that I see bitching the most, are the ones least likely to do anything about it. Of course I don't interact with children in Indonesia or people who are slaves. If you enter into the agreement to work, you are agreeing to is, be ok with the agreement or don't do it. Saying no is a skill many people are not good at.
