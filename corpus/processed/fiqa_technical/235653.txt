You are looking for r/personalfinance. But it'd probably be best to put your excess monies in a savings account, not worrying about 401k/retirement contributions until you get a full time job, post college. Don't listen to the pussies that will tell you to invest it in a vagaurd account or your 401k. The money is more important to you as an emergency fund you can access immediately. At most you'll see a 4-5% return on your meager savings, amounting to less than $100/year.
