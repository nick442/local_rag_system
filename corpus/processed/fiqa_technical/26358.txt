Single person salary on 7.25 is about $1200 a month, before taxes. Rent in a slum is $500, then you have health and car insurance in the most optimistic situation, electric, water, phone that employer requires you to have, food and care products. This assuming no car note and never buying clothes. It's insane to me that people think that it's okay to subsidize their lifestyle by starving someone, and pretending that is possible.
