I think it's important to be clear what is being studied here. It's the effect of a more dramatic increase in the min wage than we've seen before. There are many studies which show no negative effect at all on employment in situations where gradual increases in the min wage happen. Just like there are several well known studies that compare similar cities with different minimum wages that show no negative affect on employment in the city with the higher wage. But in none of those situations was the wage ever increased quite like it was in Seattle, so that's the new thing to study here. So again, the study is clearly *not* trying to say that raising the minimum wage has a negative effect on employment. Rather it's looking at just this particular significant increase. For me, this really is an indictment on the unwillingness of congress to gradually raise the minimum wage over time using some sort of sensible inflationary benchmark. Had they been gradually inflating the wage over time to coincide with normal inflation, we could see a $12 min wage already that had no appreciable effect on employment. So is the solution a sudden correction to get to the wage up to a liveable standard in one, perhaps slightly painful to employment swoop? Or is it to go more gradually, meaning that you'll still remain decades behind inflation growth?
