You're speaking as a private individual. If you owe money to a friend or family member, IOW if it's a *personal* loan from someone you *personally* know, then yes, there is an absolute moral obligation to pay it back if at all possible. But the big banks are not 'people you know'. They treat you like a set of numbers- no more and no less. You are an opportunity for them to make money. They will take from you all they can legally get (or less than legally if they can get away with it). They have no reciprocating feeling of 'personal resposibility'. Banks are not humans even if humans work for them. They follow the coldly rational, impersonally merciless path of greatest profit in the most immediate term, without the slightest concern for *your* humanity or needs.
