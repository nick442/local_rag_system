"[Union membership is way down in the US.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Union_membership_in_us_1930-2010.png) ""Plenty"" is a relative and relatively meaningless term. The real question is, do unions have any power to counterbalance that of corporations and politicians, and I think in the US the answer is that they have minimal power."
