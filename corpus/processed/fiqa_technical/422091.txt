Don't panic this happens all the time. I looked online for a form that can be used to redeposit funds back into the HSA. This form can be used to redeposit funds withdrawn in error and cannot be used to correct an Excess Contribution Return. Funds will be posted as a correction and not as a contribution. The deposit will be entered for the year the distribution occurred. It allows you to specify the year the incorrect distribution occurred. I authorize Optum Bank to make the withdrawal correction indicated above. I have enclosed a check made payable to Optum Bank for the amount Iâ€™d like redeposited to my account. I understand that this can result in a possible corrected 1099-SA for the tax year indicated above. Of course you need to get the forms for your account.
