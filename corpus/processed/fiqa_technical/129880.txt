Uh, yeah, it's all good because.. I'm the consumer. My role is to pay for and receive a product or service I've deemed worth my dollar. Where in this are you confused? I'm not chief of Sharia morality police for corporate officers, I'm a guy going to the airport. And if United has the best flight to get me where I'm going I'll take that plane, too. I'm about getting the best product or service for the money spent, not trying to start a VC firm with no ROI by propping up businesses that don't offer what I want. Should I go slap a hundo down at the farmers market, too, and walk away without any food just because I like their business practices even though it's 15 miles out of my way compared to my grocery store across the street? People get so up in arms about corporate operations now that instant data transfer allows you to become an alleged expert in a company's internal operations mere moments after a story breaks. The beauty of the market is I get to spend my dollar where I want to and you get to spend yours where you want to. If you don't like it, I hear North Korea is nice this time of year.
