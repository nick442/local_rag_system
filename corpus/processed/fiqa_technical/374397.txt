"You aren't playing devils advocate, you aren't thinking at all. If it's skilled or not is not isn't relevant to the discussion at all. Walmart makes more than enough money to pay their employees a living wage. The fact is that every single walmart exists today beause their employees can be subsidized by the state and federal government which means your tax dollars that you work for every single day literally is being used to pad the profit margins of walmart executives and their shareholders. Do you understand that? Your tax dollars are paying for the benefits of Walmarts workers, Walmart is NOT paying the benefits of their employees out of the profit they make. What's the argument here, that because it's ""unskilled labor"" these people don't deserve to be paid enough to not be on state aid? is that really the argument here? If ""unskilled labor"" is so worthless how is Walmart generating some of the largest profits of any company around when most of their work force is ""unskilled labor?"""
