I would agree this is probably a battery factory. Tesla gets much of its battery components from the Congo where women and children work in mines for pennies a day. They develop iron lung because thereâ€™s no ventilation. Then the minerals are processed in China. By doing so, Tesla is abstracted from any of the unethical practices going on in the Congo and pretends they know nothing about the hellish conditions. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/01/Child-labour-behind-smart-phone-and-electric-car-batteries/
