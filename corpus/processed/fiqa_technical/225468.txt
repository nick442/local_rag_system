Not necessarily, I doubt that will happen, most franchises are worth $250k - $1m, so as long as their liability doesn't exceed that McDs can just revoke franchise licenses and resell them in the event of a substantial labor dispute. Further, I suspect they would pickup an insurance policy to cover anything above that.
