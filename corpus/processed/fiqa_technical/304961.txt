I get the idea behind it but certainly you would agree that it can be seen as a selfish mindset. Say I'm working on a project with this guy and we have a deadline at the end of the week. If he is not willing to stay an extra hour or two on Thursday afternoon to make sure we meet the deadline because he feels he needs to be compensated to put in a little extra effort then that is not a person I would enjoy working with. That's also an attitude that I don't think will get you very far (however fair that may be) Routinely putting in 60+ hours when you are paid for 40 is different. I wouldn't have anything against a person unwilling to do that but I'm sure most people would prefer working with somebody that is willing to go the extra mile when needed rather than the guy clocks out at 5:01 every day.
