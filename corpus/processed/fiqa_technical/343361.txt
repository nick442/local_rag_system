"I'm honestly with you in the first two.. but we need to start getting over number three. It was completely legal and is a done deal. The idea that he should ""make it right"" by gaming the system even further would only exacerbate the politicization of the court. Now that fact that it *was* legal is shitty as hell, but the right place to address that sort of thing would be as a part of broader Senatorial reform that I don't think anybody has the stomach for, unfortunately. Besides that, it's completely extraneous to the topic at hand.. what's missing in Washington is not ""advantage by the left over the right"", it's actual discussion and compromise. They need to try to do that on this one thing and make a fresh start. If we keep relitigating the past, this shit goes all the way back to Bork and earlier."
