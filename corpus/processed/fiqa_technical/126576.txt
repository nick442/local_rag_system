"Perhaps mysterious in the sense that any dubious story involving a powerful and influential firm will not have their name actually mentioned? I've often found when American media runs a story like this, with no details, I can go look at London's Financial Times and they will name-names. For example CNBC or CNN might run a story ""top wall street firms fined"" and not name the actual firms. You have to look at non-American media to get actual names."
