"Your entire post is incorrect. From your understanding of the processes, to random sampling, to what stastical models represent, to facts in and of themselves. It's crazy to me how much ignorance and misunderstanding is the baseline for these conversations. It's almost as if being ignorant and disregarding facts (as my above post is) as political propaganda is a badge of honor among so many. Every time it's ""hey, look at all these facts, well researched figures, and data that gets someone to this conclusion"" And the response is always along the lines of ""fake news"" with your head in the air as if being anti intellectual is something to be proud of. We're off topic now, but the descent into the literal definition of idiocy and ignorance has become baffling. But QED about the above education point, I guess."
