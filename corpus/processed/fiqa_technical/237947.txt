"One of the places I've worked at held a mandatory meeting every week, and I telecommuted. I clocked something like 6 hours a month sitting around with muted phone watching movies or playing games, because it was all pointless recapping or the partners droning buzzwords and saying shit that was patently obvious or totally irrelevant to anything I did on any real level. I literally logged in, then unmuted myself to say some bullshit ""Good meeting, thanks for the update"" or ""Yeah, I think this is going to help break new ground, thanks!"" at the end just so they knew I was still on the line."
