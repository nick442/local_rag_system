"Per your comment that your landlord is a large property management firm, I think your credit is definitely in jeopardy. Assuming that your name is on the lease, there's no distinction of ""fair share"", you're all responsible.

Alternatively, you might be able to find new roommates who would be able to pay their share(s)."
