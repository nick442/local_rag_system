Like 90% of them pride themselves in making slightly positive returns at times of turmoil. They never mention their returns on up years (8 our of every 10, at a minimum). At times like this when markets are booming they underperform and it's what have you done for me lately time. They'll slightly rebound next downturn, but still terrible investments because of the fees. Even when you take into account the diversification effect of their negative betas.
