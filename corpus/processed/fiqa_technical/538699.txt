"It is the presupposition that makes this a rather ridiculous question. Makes me curious, would this be a civil or criminal crime? If you are convinced that this presupposition of illegality is a thing, talk to a lawyer. Yes, there may be consequences of doing any variety of actions while you owe the IRS, and while you do not owe the IRS. As an unincorporated business the IRS does not stop you from gaining an additional source of income to pay them with. Perhaps lenders might not help you with capital. As an incorporated business no state is going to ask you if you ""owe back taxes"" before they allow you to pay them to register your business in their state. This isn't legal advice, I'm just assuming there is no legal advice to give based on your presupposition, to your original question, I'm going to go with no."
