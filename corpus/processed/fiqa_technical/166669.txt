At least these people are looking for extra money by putting something into the system instead of just begging for dollars by the side of the road. These situations make me sad because we don't want people who can't work to starve and we do need disability payments. On the other hand, we seem to have found a way to discourage people from doing even what they can do and this can't be the right way to handle things.
