> cough cough blockbuster Blockbuster was ten thousand little independent franchise companies that rented videos to individuals at the strip mall. The franchises paid dues to Blockbuster Corporate for advertising and marketing. Essentially, Corporate was the franchise Union. If your Union/Corporate was going to cut all the employees/franchises out of all the revenue and business (streaming like Netflix) then there would be problems. The only choice was for Blockbuster to go out business, otherwise, they would have had to buy back all the franchises at full retail value and pay future profits. It was cheaper to close them down, have the execs take their bonuses and wave at Netflix.
