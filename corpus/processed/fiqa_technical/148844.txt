Minimum wage has only went up $2 in twenty years while housing, gas and education has tripled. Also, the US is the only developed country where people go bankrupt trying to pay medical bills - I know, I am Portuguese finishing my studies here. I never paid more than $100 in anything relating to healthcare. Anything. My first month here, I got sick and stayed at the hospital for about a week. $50k in medical bills. The fact that we have people defending this greedy and vile society in which people work their entire lives to afford so little, be so miserable, fat and depressed is troubling. I would pick twenty other countries before I picked the US to live in. I had no idea you were so backward thinking, so mean and cynical to each other. Like that one Icelandic woman on Michael Moore's documentary said, you have serious problems of compassion. You don't care if your neighbor succeeds or not. That's a sick society in decline. You're just not aware of it. If you work full time, I don't care what the job is, you should be able to live a life with dignity.
