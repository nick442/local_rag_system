"NN doesn't have to do with what your describing. But let's follow your thought scenario: Why should ISPs be allowed to charge twice for the same service? The ""free delivery"" you listed isn't free. I as a consumer already pay for it. And I choose who gets my traffic. Why should ISPs be allowed to then also charge companies? Why should they be allowed to choose whose content I want to have use the service I pay for? If you don't like Amazon don't pay Amazon with your traffic. Or Google. They ""rely"" on your desire to use them via the service you pay for."
