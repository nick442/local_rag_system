The millionaires I know, all got rich because they got lucky. And when I had a million, I got that mostly by luck as well. I had to take some risks, and people said I was absolutely mad, but I stuck to my guns. Most millionaires are rich because of luck. But very few of them will admit it. Preferring to think that skill, effort and business acumen got them there. Nope. It was luck.
