The good thing is that as luck would have it, the Jews don't control the military, because the Jews don't like an enemy that can fight back and like to kill unarmed civilians in Palestine. So, it seems that while the Government and the economy have all fallen into the hands of Israeli agents, we can still look to our military to save us.
