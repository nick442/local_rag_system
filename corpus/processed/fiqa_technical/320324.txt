It's worth noting that there have been several studies with differing results for minimum wage in general (https://i.imgur.com/0uITqbR.jpg), and now specifically for Seattle. It's unwise to take any single one as the canonical study, best to look at them all in context. I think the broad consensus is that there's an elasticity of somewhere between -0.05 and -0.2. So a minimum wage increase of 10% will lead to a decrease in employment of somewhere between 0.5% and 2%. http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/03/faith-and-econometrics-minimum-wage-edition It just comes down to how you value the tradeoff between higher wages for the working and fewer hours worked and where you place that elasticity. I think there'd be pretty broad support if you could double the minimum wage and only see a 5% decline in hours worked.
