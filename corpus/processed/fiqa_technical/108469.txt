Well, China *will* slow at some point. Even if it's still growing briskly (4-5%) that drop will shrink global demand for resources. But $30-40/bbl? I don't know about that. I think there's an implied floor to prices now, thanks to some of the places we're getting oil from. It's simply too expensive. I know that the oil sands here in Canada are uneconomical below ~$60/bbl. Such low prices, then, would squeeze supply. I could see us riding $70-90/bbl for a few years though.
