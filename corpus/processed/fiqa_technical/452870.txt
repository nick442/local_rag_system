"The IRA contribution limit is a limit on the total amount you can contribute to all of your Roth and traditional IRAs. It's not a per-account limit. (See here and here.) Once you've hit the contribution limit on one account, you've hit it on all of them. Even so, supposing you had a reason with try to take money out of one of the accounts, the answer to your question is ""sort of"". The limit is a limit on your gross contributions, not your net contributions. It is possible to withdraw Roth contributions if you do so before the tax filing deadline for that year, but you must also withdraw (and pay taxes on) any earnings accured during the time the money was in the Roth (see here). In addition, doing this may not be as simple as just taking the money out of your account; you should probably ask your bank about it and let them know you're ""undoing"" the contribution, since they may otherwise still record the amount as a real contribution and the withdrawal as unqualified early withdrawal (subject to penalties, etc.)."
