The best advice I can give to anyone who doesn't know a subject is to just start reading. At first you won't understand fuckall, but after a few months things will start to snap together in your head. I know it's hard considering most of us have this idea that to learn a subject we need to start at some sort of beginning but in reality there's no beginning or end of any subject. So just dive in and keep reading until it makes sense.
