>> only indicate interests > Yet you said you would not hire based on the undergrad. You really try to NOT understand what I said and even fail in common sense, that I have. I said that given a choice between a Music major and an IT major for entry level position, no experience needed, I would definitely not hire Music majors. I would only hire IT majors. Would you do differently? Yes or no? And if you insist on remembering the wrong things, I also said the for more advanced positions, what counts is the experience and knowledge, regardless of original degrees. Did I say that? Yes or no? I also said that someone who studied 7 years Music for a BA and a Master is very unlikely to be an IT expert. Their real interests are not IT. So I would extremely suspicious if they become CHIEF Information Security Officer. Susan is the proof of all that: failure in her music career, failure in her IT security career, total corrupt corporate hiring process, and she's responsible for the biggest breach of personal data in history. P/S: You know that she was fired from Equifax! Any ideas why, if she's such a qualified person? Maybe it's not her fault at all and some idiot IT expert working for her caused all the issues? Do you know why I asked this last question, that maybe it's an IT expert working for her who caused the issue? Guess!
