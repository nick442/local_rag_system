> that there isn't anything No one has said that. In Lewis' example of sitting next to the big shot's wife: He was invited only that night, and the husband & wife had very likely purchased tickets long before. How did he give himself that advantage? Being ready to spring on such an opportunity doesn't do you any good if it doesn't coalesce. You're concentrating on the results of these nexus, when Lewis' point is that they come about. Positively taking advantage of them is presumed.
