All I need to clear the CC debt I’m in is 6k. I couldn’t work when my baby was post-op and I can’t catch up no matter how I try and I swear to God I’m gonna steal it if I can’t figure out wtf to do soon. I work 50+ hours a week and pick up OT on sundays, and I want to be with my son otherwise but I know if I have to get a second job I could pay this off quicker but I will never see him. I know I failed using the CCs when I had to be home w him but there was no money, that was it. The cards were all zero balance and hadn’t been used in over two years but I didn’t know what else to do when he was sick. It kept us afloat. I’m back at work, we live modestly - are there people in the world who just meet people and realize they’re decent human beings and just give them money to be nice and help them out? No strings attached?
