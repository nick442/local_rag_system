My firm has more than five thousand employees globally, and this is how we pay people, except for the very top directors. We were one of glassdoor's top firms to work for last year, and have scored extremely highly on lots of other rankings for being a top place to work. So clearly it works well, and trust me we have no problem recruiting.
