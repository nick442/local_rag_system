"There you go: *Since 2008.* Lots of crap has been predicted ""since 2008."" Soaring interest rates. A collapse of the dollar. The Yuan as the world's reserve currency. A collapse in ""the stock market bubble,"" which is ""clearly fueled by Federal Reserve policies,"" Etc. People like yourself continue to believe that these things will occur, despite annual evidence that it will not. Rather than adjust your views, you are holding on to them tighter. It reminds me of people who deny climate change - more evidence simply hardens their views against the phenomenon."
