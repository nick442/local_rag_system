I hope that Susan Mouldin, Chief Information Security Officer at Equifax, will totally retire, and not, god forbid, use her talents at Music Composition which she studied for her bachelor and master's degrees. Obviously she was no good in composing music, so she has to get another career in Information Security at Equifax.
