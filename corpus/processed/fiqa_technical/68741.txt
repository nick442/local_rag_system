They made a huge gamble staking the future of their company on an OS with a 3% market share and so far it's not paid off. I absolutely agree that the advertising for Windows Phone has been awful. That Nokia commercial embedded in the article is snotty and arrogant. The Microsoft commercials for the OS are just as bad [Example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9evyGr57hs). Basically, their strategy is to say that their entire target demographic (smart phone users) are idiots. Why would they think that would go well?
