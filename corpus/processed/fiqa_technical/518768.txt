So I don't like zoning laws and I think they're both archaic and stupid. I'm just going to build my house wherever the fuck I want because that's my opinion. If you criticize me for doing that, I'm going to say that I had an obligation to because regulation was bad so following it would be irresponsible. This isn't the civil rights movement we're talking about. They're unregulated taxis that intentionally and maliciously skirted regulation until they had enough customers to apply pressure to regulations. That's it.
