You seem to have it all figured out. It will be a rude awakening when you right wingers erode all the safety nets only to find that you are out of a job in a few years due to automation. You think you're responsible and hard working now but there will come a point when an algorithm replaces you. Deny it all you want but that is where we are heading. It would be more proactive to open a dialogue with that in mind, but you'll keep blaming immigrants because they are an easy political scapegoat
