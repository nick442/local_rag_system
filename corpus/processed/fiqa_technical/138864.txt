My statement doesn't need a source. CEOs are literally people that are in charge of entire companies. Not everyone can do that. You, on the other hand, provided a statement with out any information to back it up. When you try to refute an argument with facts you need to give a source. I'm not going to try to prove you're right. If you're going to contradict someone, give them sources.
