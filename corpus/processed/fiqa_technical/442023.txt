Yes, you may do this at any time before signing - but to make a change like this after the official loan documents have been drawn up will cost you extra fees. The typical redraw fee is around $200 in CA. Does it make sense to do so? No, it does not. If you have an extra 1%, it would probably be better to use that money to purchase a lower interest rate. Here's an example: Let's say you're buying a $200,000 house and your offered interest rate is 4.75% (just an example). With 10% down you'd have a loan amount of $180,000 and a p&i payment of $938.97 per month. With 11% down you'd have a loan amount of $178,000 and a p&i payment of $928.53 per month. Now let's pretend you buy your interest rate down to 4.375%. With 10% down you'd still have a loan amount of $180,000 but your p&i payment would be $898.71 per month. Even though the last option gives you the best payment, if I were in your shoes I'd stick with the 10% down and save that extra cash in the bank for a rainy day. Buying a home comes with a lot of new expenses and many are unexpected. Good luck!
