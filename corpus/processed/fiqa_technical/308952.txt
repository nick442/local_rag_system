Groundwater contamination is far more an issue than just the water used during fracking. By it's very nature fracking cannot ever be done in a way that doesn't harm groundwater supplies. Breaking rock to release gas also breaks the rock that contains groundwater. Fracking will be banned, it's just a matter of when.
