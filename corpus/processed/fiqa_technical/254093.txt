"And what evidence do you have for that statement? History tells us to expect a very different outcome. When factory jobs were initially outsourced to Asia where costs were a fraction of domestic production, the ""savings"" went directly into the pockets of CEOs.

I highly doubt that anyone is thinking about lowering burger prices as a result of this innovation."
