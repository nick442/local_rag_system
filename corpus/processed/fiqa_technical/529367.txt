That's a bullshit strawman. Making unsafe products is never in the manufacturers interests. In fact it lets manufacturers off the hook. Because if a product does turn out to be unsafe you can't sue them because they followed the arbitrary guidelines set forth by a bunch of idiot politicians, so they can't be held at fault.
