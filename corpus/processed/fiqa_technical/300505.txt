From where I'm sitting right now, there are 8 Enterprise Rent-A-Cars within 10 miles of my location. On their website, they claim that their 5500 locations are within 15 miles of most consumers. They currently offer a ride share program for the commute to work that is interesting. I'm not 100% sure on the details, though.
