"You would be surprised just how many places aside from McD are unhealthy. It's not just fast food. Plenty of regular restaurants are just as bad and often worse. Studies show that people are more satisfied if they get a giant plate of average food than a smaller plate of good food, and since a lot of glutenous ingredients are cheap, restaurants just pile it on. For example, go to your local Italian restaurant and you will find plenty of meals that are approaching or crossing a ridiculous 2000 calorie mark - just for one meal. That is worse than your McD burger meals. I've seen different variations of McD ""cafes"" and many of them are nothing special. But some of them are down right snazzy. They are mimicking Starbucks experience. Very pleasant to hang out."
