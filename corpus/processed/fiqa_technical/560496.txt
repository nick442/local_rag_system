I think it looks like a mixed bag and I can't tell which way it's going to go. I can't see company implants universally taking off. As messy as the world is today, and I must say personally it's the most concerned I've been, there's a lot of good stuff going on too. Cancer break throughs, life & health extension, the growth of renewable energy are all pretty positive. Things like AI are definitely a mixed bag but I'm looking forward to when a human doctor is working alongside AI to diagnose any issues I may have in the future. On the other hand, skynet could happen and that would suck. So I work hard to try and make things not so bleak.
