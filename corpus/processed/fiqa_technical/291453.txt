"The recording industry has a long and storied history of knee-jerk, ignorant Ludditism. If they'd had their way we would have no home recording devices of any kind, among other things. Cable TV might not even exist. The reason is easy to grasp: their business model is based around an artificial scarcity created by a temporary technological limitation, namely the fact that it once cost a lot of money to record media. Instead of looking for newer business models, they've repeatedly dug their heels in and yelled ""get off my lawn!"" Why do Apple and Amazon own digital music and not Sony or BMG? The answer is obvious."
