ArcelorMittal is the parent company in Luxembourg; ArcelorMittal USA is the LLC subsidiary that operates in north america. Since the subsidiary is a private company, I can't tell you what their financials actually look like, but from the parent company earnings conference comments; business is down in north america. The profit-sharing agreement is quite likely with the USA subsidiary and not directly to the parent company.
