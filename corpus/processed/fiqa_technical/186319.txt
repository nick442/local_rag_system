Nothing at [their investor relations site](http://investor.physiciansformula.com/), nothing in [Yahoo! Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=face&ql=1), nothing in [Google Finance](http://www.google.com/finance?q=face), nothing listed by my broker, no new or changed analyst coverage, and only [one regular news item](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hba-global-announces-finalists-for-the-beauty-industrys-2012-international-package-design-awards-ipda-2012-05-15) about being a finalist in a packaging design competition.. not exactly material. Any other places I should be looking?
