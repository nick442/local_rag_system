Completely agree. Wal-Mart has both the capital and the wherewithal to readjust incredibly quickly as they deem it necessary to do so. Couple those with the clout they have with manufacturers and it's fairly easy to see that a threat to Wal-Mart such as to see them 'losing all' to Amazon is more than a bit overly optimistic on an Amazon fanatic's part. I like Amazon, and shop there regularly, arguably more than Wal-Mart. .but, I shop at both. There are certain things that Wal-Mart is just 'better' for. .for now. Things change, but Wal-Mart can easily afford to change with it if it feels so inclined. They aren't IBM vs Microsoft; stuck in a mindset and incapable of imagining a reality outside of that. Even with that analogy, IBM is still around.
