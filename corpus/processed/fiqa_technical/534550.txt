You're torn between believing in him actually having the intellect to be a VC and the fact that he has actually funded money into a company suggesting he is a VC. I mean, technically he is one by definition standards but he just isn't a VC when there is somebody else forcing his hand. That's my view anyway, feel free to poke at it :)
