How do you know people want jobs? People get jobs because they want money, not because they want a job. I think when a lot of people say they like their job they are lying to you and themselves because that job is the only viable option or all they know. Nobody wants to admit they are not getting everything out of life they want. This system of economics intimidates people into financial slavery with threats of starvation and homelessness. I have never been opposed to hard work, but the restraints of full time jobs always sucked. I think a lot of people enjoy rewarding work, not shitty go nowhere, uninteresting, unfulfilling, unrewarding jobs that suck all their energy serving others at their own personal expense. Knowing how much money sloshes around in this country and how little is allocated for ninety percent of us is depressing.
