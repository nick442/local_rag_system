">But there's no proof that it's a distinguishing factor or dispositive. Correlation doesn't equal causation, etc. Where absolute proof is not possible, rational people make determinations on the basis of where the preponderant weight of evidence falls. In this case, while there is no ""proof,"" the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that given similar intelligence and drive, two otherwise virtually identical people will almost always end up in entirely different circumstances based on a set of random variables that can best be described as luck. Was one born the son of a factory worker while the other was born the son of a corporate CEO? If so, that's a matter of luck, and you cannot deny for an instant that one's father has a huge influence on what one becomes later in life. Your entire premise is based on a flawed understanding of the matters under consideration."
