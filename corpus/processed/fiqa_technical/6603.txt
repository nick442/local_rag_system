So much bullshit in this article: >In fact, libertarian writer Charles Murray once estimated that providing all unincarcerated Americans over the age of 21 with a **monthly check for $13,000** ($3,000 of which would fund their healthcare) would not only be sufficient enough to provide for their basic needs and help raise the poorest among them above the poverty line, but would also be less expensive than our current welfare state, which includes agricultural and corporate subsidies. There are 325 million americans. 73% are over 21, so that leaves 237 million. About 1% of adults are incarcerated, so were left with about 235 million. If you gave each one $13,000 that would cost $3 trillion. Or basically the entire federal budget. But wait, that's a *per month* figure. Per annum, that would cost $36 trillion. Please quit shit posting this UBI and do your fucking math homework.
