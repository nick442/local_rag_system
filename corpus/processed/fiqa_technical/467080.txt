"There is no doubt that this is a scam (you ask a British solicitor for help with this sort of problem, not an American friend) but it's not as obvious as some answers seem to assume. Inheritance taxes always have to be paid before legacies can be received, and the funds are part of the estate not ""in the hands of the government"". There are certainly ways round the problem (which vary by country), but if the facts were as the asker sets out, this would be a reasonable request. You can bet they aren't and it isn't."
