"How many of these loans have been rehypothecated and/or chained to synthetic derivatives? That was the ""force multiplier"" in 07-08. Agreed that the impact will be a lot less since it is a much smaller market, but it might be bigger than many assume if these factors are present. (And if it is bigger you get the risk of a chain reaction beyond that, though I think the Fed & Co. are much more on-guard about that now.)"
