Sure, I understand compassion, and I have compassion for things that matter. Such as an abused child or an elderly adult. However, why waste the time and energy on having compassion for an animal that we are simply going to eat in 3 months. What does it accomplish? Does it make the food taste better? No, it only raises the cost of the food.
