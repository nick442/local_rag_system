I know you were partly joking, but still: > movies Bring an iPad, most modern planes have WiFi, you can watch Netflix and relax without paying for Buisness Class. >elaborate meals Buy a meal at the terminal before you fly. You can even indulge and treat yourself at the nicer sit down restaurants in the airport. Even if you pay $100 for the meal, that's only 10% the cost of upgraded to Buisiness Class just for the food on board. >priority boarding You can pay a token fee, like $20, for priority boarding. Hardly need a $1000 ticket for that. >power Power is standard on most newer planes, even in coach. I flew Spirit, the budget airline in my region, and despite paying $80 for my economy ticket I had a powered USB outlet *and* an AC outlet I could use. >storage, recline chairs, & cocaine Well, you got me there.
