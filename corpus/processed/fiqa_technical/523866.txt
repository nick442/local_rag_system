> Facebook is a company with no real way to profit from its technology. While I think your reply was pretty spot on and also think Facebook was way overpriced (and probably still is), I definitely disagree with this statement. Facebook is making pretty good money selling advertising. First news papers, then radio, and then television made an awful lot of money just selling advertising. Unfortunately for those medias, the Internet has taken over the advertising space - and Facebook is in a great position to take advantage of this. One of their biggest problems right now is figuring out how to make their mobile platform profitable (as well as building a semi-decent app).
