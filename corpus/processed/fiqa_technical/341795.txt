The reason why we have lots of idle capacity is because we have over capitalized. Fed res has kept rates far too low for far too long and it incorrectly encouraged producers to over build. If rates where not manipulated so much to the low side than producers would not have built so much capacity and utilization wouldn't be a issue. The low rates also encouraged consumers to take out loans and to also not save so that they could buy excess supply. But all it did was made everyone go into debt to unsustained levels and eventually bankruptcy. Over the last few decades gov and fed reserve have been stimulating, printing, lowering rates to prevent the vicious cycle from crashing.. But eventually it crashed under its own weight. Unfortunatly we haven't seen the end yet because we need to go down more before we can start gong back up.
