"I don't understand the part about him ""letting"" you hire a second office person. Is he your boss or are you his boss? If you are his boss, and you think you need a second office person, hire one. Frankly, I think the real problem you have is that you have this one guy who controls everything in his area. Forget about the stealing part -- what happens if he gets hit by a bus tomorrow or quits and finds another job? Is there anyone who can step in and fill in for him immediately? I would strongly suggest not letting that become an issue. Make sure that he is cross training others on his roles and responsibilities. Not only will it relax your fears about theft. It's also good business practice to have multiple people at least familiar with an area in case someone leaves or takes a vacation."
