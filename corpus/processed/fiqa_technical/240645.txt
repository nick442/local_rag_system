I think your underestimating what a 50k single influx of workers can do for an area long term. More people to a well developed city is good for the city. Detroit for example is structured to handled 1.5 million, even though it only has 750k now. 50k employees means 400k new local jobs supporting those main ones. 400k new people would finally allow the city to once again be a proper city and metro area. Aka wealth concentration in the city, less concentration on the exterior. In the detroit metro area it gets wealthier as you go further from the city. I dont see how this is in line with Brazil's corrupt class structure at all. Some of these cities need a golden ticket to fix the suburban flight that happened post ww2 and especially after the interstate system.
