"As a Brit, I try to avoid just saying ""no"" outright at work. Rather, I would question why they needed something if I didn't see the need for it (it may well be that I'm just not seeing something that they are, because they have more experience). I also try to phrase questions in a way that is respectful and doesn't back my superiors into a corner. Of course ultimately it just comes down to social skills which you'd use in daily life outside work anyway."
