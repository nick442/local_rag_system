"Not in the case of Steve Jobs! He failed with Lisa, Macintosh, Newton, Next, almost brought Apple to bankruptcy, loss control of his company, and a terrible personality. His ""success"" was the work of many gray people whom he took advantage of. Apple II was all Steve Wozniak idea and creation. Also the iPod and iPhone are other people ideas and creations. Steve, was very good in marketing. Excellent in that area. That's it."
