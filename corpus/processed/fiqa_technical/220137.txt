Turn around strategy: Provide coverage of the major European soccer leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A) the same way CBS/NBC do for NFL and College football. Soccer is the fastest growing sport in the U.S, and that is not just because of the influx of Latinos - the sport is really becoming popular amongst whites, blacks ect. Within ten years it will be bigger than baseball, potentially also basketball if the NBA keeps up its absurd predictability.
