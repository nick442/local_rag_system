TBH I been with Wells Fargo since I was 17. It was my very first account and I still use it till this day. It's one of my only checking account. I never had a single problems with them. No fees or anything. It just sucks to hear a lot of people are having problems with WF. I guess I am lucky one who never had a problem with them.
