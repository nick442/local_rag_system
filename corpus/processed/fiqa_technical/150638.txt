"Oh, so you were sarcastic. > And when Iran goes nuclear, Saudi Arabia will be quick to follow, and then Jordan and Turkey . . Actually, the truth, all Arab/Muslim countries in the area (except Turkey recently) know that Israel have nuclear weapons, don't worry about it at all, and always relied on Israel to save them if they get attacked by nuclear weapons. So, if Iran get nuclear weapons, which they will, then Israel will have ""treaty"" with all the Arab countries to protect them against Iran. We will have peace in the middle east between Israel and all Arab countries (except the ""Palestinians""), as we will all be united against Iran."
