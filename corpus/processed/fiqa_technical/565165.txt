I think a big issue with Sears and Kmart is that they have no image. They have become so diluted nobody even knows why they would shop there. Ask anybody what they think about the image of Target, Meijer, Wal-mart, or other successful chains and you will likely get an accurate description across the board. Do the same with K-mart and Sears and you will get looks of confusion.
