"> I've been working with blockchain implementation since before you became an armchair investor. Really what implementation? Let's see it! You have anything to show for the bullshit you're babbling? I've been involved with Bitcoin since 2011.What bitcoin implementation do you program from? >bitcoin's incentive is the mother of all pyrimid schemes Yet another person that doesn't even understand what a pyramid scheme is. Google a pyramid scheme. > The security comes from the immutability of the chain that is generated which is what everyone subscribed to the chain gains And you're proposing that this security is to be handled by some host of nodes on an internal network? Kinda like ... a database with rolling backups ? lets walk through your example.. >a company has several partners who it coordinates exchange rates with exchange rates for what? currency? They set the value and they want to share that with their partners? So like they're in a trading group and they're agreeing to sell shares at a specific rate? I don't really get this thus far. Your partners trust each other not to trade at differing values right? > no amount of hacking a centralized system could change the confirmed blocks, Unless he hacked the central node which other nodes subscribe to and surreptitiously modified future values > in the fact that bitcoin HAD no value except as a currency before people started hacking contracts and the like into it. I LOVE how you use the term ""fact"" for something that is provably incorrect. Bitcoin had already hit a value of ~$250 before ""people started hacking contracts and the like into it"".. They're not even the same protocol. can you give me an **ACTUAL** example of a functional permissioned/private ledger that *needs* a blockchain?"
