So would it be more sensible to park the money in 3 separate fixed deposits created each month or to invest this money as usual in debt and mutual funds and instead just liquidate the recurring deposit and use it to pay my taxes in July? Most taxes would already have been paid by March 31. So what you are talking here is less than Rs 10,000/- of taxes. The optimization you are looking at is very small and you are better of choosing one that is more convenient.
