Genetics and the environment you were raised in are entirely determined by luck. Developed from both of these are all of your traits, preferences, psychology, and personal philosophy through nurturing acceptance, enlightened exposure or rebellion. Taking responsibility for your actions and in-actions is what you did. You have preferences to be sociable, convincing, hard-working, and good at whatever it is you do (broker?). All of these things are marketable and in line with a good strategy for our western/nepotistic/capitalist culture and the modern state of human nature. All of these things build up your sense of self and have you feel empowered and guess what: having confidence is also a desirable trait! So lets say we take one of these traits away. Through the result of your upbringing and your genetics you are no longer sociable. Examples: genetics, child abuse, constant verbally abusive/belittling parents, etc. Luck of the draw. I wouldn't say that is the child's fault for being in that situation would you? So, now you are not sociable and you cannot network effectively. There goes your career. How unlucky.
