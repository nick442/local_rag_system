First of all Congrats- a- fucking- lation! I’ve been to Cambodia two years ago. I bought the two day pass at AngorWat but it was my hotel, who set it up. My best advice is to make partnerships with local hostels, hotels, and Airbnb’s to take their guest as part of a tour. Have maps handy and describe the tour and what they are going to see. After a point in my tour it seemed like I was seeing the same thing over and over again and didn’t return for the second day. So try to make an exciting tour, and a sunset tour should cost more though. Also maybe include the “happy” pizza spot as part of the tour. Edit: I think it was a three day pass I bought I’m not sure. I just know it was more than one day. Also don’t charge extra to take pictures for customers.
