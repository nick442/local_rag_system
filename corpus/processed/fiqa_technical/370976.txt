Everything in life is a combination of luck and skill. Startups are no different. The risks are higher and most sensible people know and understand that. You know why we worship the successes? Because against all odds, those startups stood up to your salaried buddies who work for faceless large corporations and have tons of people and kicked their asses. At some point, they deserve it. You see startups as gambling, others see it as betting on yourself. Especially founding or joining an early stage startup. It's also taking on huge responsibility. In a mega-corp your failures and shortcomings will be covered and almost certainly won't tank the company. Your creativity probably won't flourish and their is an incentive to do just well enough. Why should you work your ass off for a company that you're not invested in other than a paycheck? Startups aren't for everyone. Hell, startups probably aren't for most people. But there are some people, those select few, who simply can't imagine not working for themselves, creating things, tinkering, trying to change the world. It's not even gambling to them, it's a way of life.
