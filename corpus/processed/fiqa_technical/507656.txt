A payment of $224 at 7.2% interest will pay off a $33000 mortgage in 30 years. Unfortunately, I'm on cold medicine so guessing was the only way I got to the answer, but I guessed right on the first try :). However, if you like algebra: The following formula is used to calculate the fixed monthly payment (P) required to fully amortize a loan of L dollars over a term of n months at a monthly interest rate of c. [If the quoted rate is 6%, for example, c is .06/12 or .005]. P = L[c(1 + c)n]/[(1 + c)n - 1]
