"Lol you finance guys are so hilarious. You don't understand cryptocurrencies or ""decentralized ledger technology"" at all. The ONLY way it works is if people have some **incentive** to actually secure and verify the Merkle Chain.. If I'm not getting something out of it **Why the fuck would I run a program to do that? Just to watch the computer get hot?** The block reward (aka the amount of bitcoins) I get are the underpinning incentive to do so! Get it? No bitcoins = nobody wants to secure your ledger! Therefore these ""permissioned ledgers"" are not going to be as secure or as trustworthy. There will likely be some cool shit that comes out of permissioned ledgers and intrablockchain stuff, but you are completely missing the ball if you think the actual bitcoins are dumb... I know its complicated, it takes a while to **actually** understand, but it's partially engineering and you actually have to understand it all before you get to call it stupidity. The ""non-speculative value"" or utility of bitcoin as a currency seems to work just fine for online drug markets and has done quite a bit of business. It's got fantastic utility for buying retail shit online without having to give up personal information as well. It's got great utility for remittance. It's got divisibility. It is indeed a bonafide currency.. **TLDR; So how do you think that the recordkeeping gets done? Do you think people will do this for free? What function do you think the ""cryptocurrencies"" themselves currently serve? How do you think permissioned ledgers will be secure (i.e. tamperproof) if not done by public record? Don't you think that if they simply wanted to prevent tamperproof records they only need to use an airgapped computer and pen and paper?***"
