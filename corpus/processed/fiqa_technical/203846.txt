Current S&P 500 Shiller PE is higher than it was on Black Tuesday in 1929, Black Monday in 1987, and 2008 before the market went off the cliff. I'm a firm believer in what comes up having to go down eventually, I just can't put my finger on how soon it'll be or the magnitude. I don't think we'll see a dot com blowup, since this current bull market isn't based on fiction, but there will be a drawdown as the Fed unwinds their balance sheet and interest rates return back to normal. The only question is how much further it'll fall at that point.
