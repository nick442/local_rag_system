"@pyb is right - you should put an hourly dollar value on your time. Calculate a realistic number and keep it in the back of your mind. Then when you're looking for a discount or a saving, estimate the maximum amount that you'd be able to save. This should be a realistic proportion of the value of the item. From those figures you can get the maximum amount of time that you should spend on looking for that discount. Spend any more than that amount of time and you lose money even if you get the discount. So then you can end up with a few rules-of-thumb like ""don't spend more than x minutes of time per dollar of possible savings"". Then you can spend the spare time you've created on looking for savings on big-ticket items where the time is more efficiently used.. or on studying to upgrade your earning potential.. or on taking some time out to enjoy the world and sniff the flowers. :)"
