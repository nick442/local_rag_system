Sure. Here it is in its deadly simplicity: Bank of Too Big 123 Fake St City State Zip Date To whom it may concern: Please let this letter serve as formal instruction for Bank of Too Big to close the following accounts held under my name, [your name], [your social security number], listed below Checking: 00000000 Savings 00000000 Please remit the remaining balances in the form of an official check made payable to me and mail that check for deposit to my account at: Your Awesome New Bank c/o the new manager Address Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. If you wish to reach me, you may do so at [telephone number] *pro tip: they **never** call you.* Sincerely, Newly empowered consumer, you. **Here are the important parts:** 1. You HAVE to get this notarized. It will not work otherwise. But guess where there are always notaries - banks - especially your new one. 2. Make sure all your automatic payments and things attached to that old account have been switched or cancelled first. 3. Don't leave too much money in there or there is a slim chance they might call you, and you'll have to deal with that nonsense. Just leave a nominal amount like $10 and they'll just do it to get it over with. 4. Keep a copy. Just in case. I have been using this letter for my entire career in banking (a little over 10 years) and it has worked EVERY SINGLE TIME. Enjoy!
