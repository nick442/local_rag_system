"Aside from the fact that everyone - absolutely everyone, from the level of the individual to the government as a whole - treats ""free"" money frivolously, wastes it, misappropriates it, etc.. I do see one benefit to something like this. The whole idea of the stock market isn't millisecond trading to game the casino that is Wall Street. Optimistically, you purchase stocks as a long-term investment in companies to enable their continued growth and stability, they make profits, they pass along these profits to you, and everyone benefits. Suppressing this sort of roulette wheel speculation, constant changing of hands, fractional gains and the like seems like it would stabilize markets, improve growth, stop the damn CEO's and their golden parachute tactics in killing companies, and all that jazz. Joe Shmoe isn't going to care about a tax like this - he buys into whatever he wants and usually hangs on to it for the long term. I'm a layman, and admittedly a damned rusty one at economics, so give me a little slack if I'm wrong or just misguided altogether."
