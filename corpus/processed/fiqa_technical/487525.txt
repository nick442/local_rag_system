The companies give jack shit about what the taxpayers have to pay. They only lower their own expenses. Without collective bargaining power, and forcing competing companies to have the same expenses, the employees will quite simply be screwed. Systems setup by the government on the other hand supply both. Also, what about those without earned income.. What do people deserve if they do not (currently or ever) contribute to the economy? In part it depends on what kind of society one wants to live in, I guess, and whether the people are willing to keep the government functioning for the common good.
