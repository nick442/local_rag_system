We should do away with the concept of insurance for health, period. You don't have safety insurance that covers police services. You don't have national defense insurance. You don't have fire services insurance. Why? Because they are essential services that are commonly needed and serve as a public good. *Every single human being* suffers from the common ailment known as *humanity.* Thus, every single human being needs health care. Health *care,* not health insurance.
