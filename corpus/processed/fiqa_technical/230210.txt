"actually, the labor theory of value is based on the ""socially necessary labor time"", a sort of societal average of the amount of labor necessary to produce something (including the labor already included in raw materials, etc.) So if someone produces some commodity more or less quickly than their competitors, the goods still have the same value, (unless/until that average changes,) and that producer's costs will simply be above or below the average, leading to increased/decreased profits compared to their competitors. So your criticism is not only rather uninformed, its actually pretty central to how Marxists explain the drive for increased production efficiency (through capital investment, new management techniques, etc.)"
