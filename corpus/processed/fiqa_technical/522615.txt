Anderson Consulting was spun off and IPO'd in 2001 to get cash for consulting and non-consulting partners. (KPMG also spun off its consulting group in 2001 and E&Y spun off in 2000, PWC sold off its consulting in 2002). At the time is was a cash grab, within a few years every of the Big5 had formed new consulting groups.
