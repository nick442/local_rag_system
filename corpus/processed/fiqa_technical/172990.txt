"The article states that Boise is trying to build a tech ecosystem and is making it harder to leave to keep that human capital at the firms they're currently with. The logic behind this: smarter people will produce higher revenues for companies thus higher revenues for the state. Firms are lobbying for this. They're essentially keeping people at their jobs, to help the firms keep a competitive industry, while ignoring the other impacts it may have such as lower wages because workers can't leave. Trickle down economics can refer to other benefits besides gains and breaks. The human capital not being able to leave is the benefit, and firms are attempting to justify it for the betterment of Boise's future ""tech eco system"" aka passing it off as benefit to be enjoyed by many later on. Alex Labeau, president of Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry trade, a group that represents many of the states biggest employers countered: ""This is about companies protecting their assets in a competitive market place"" How is it not trickle down economics when firms are receiving a benefit (that negatively impacts citizens) under the guise that it will keep Idaho's tech hub relevant, thus economically benefitting everyone?"
