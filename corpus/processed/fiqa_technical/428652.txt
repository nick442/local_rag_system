"I think the issue here is the rules say that ""relevant current events in finance"" are acceptable when (I think) that wording is too loose. ""Current events in finance"" is just very, very general, and anything related to central banking, monetary or fiscal policy, global austerity, analysis of index movements, sovereign defaults (and speculation thereof) qualifies a ""current events in finance"" - so technically, the rules aren't being broken. I think that having the language tightened a bit would help set the subreddit tone a little more accurately."
