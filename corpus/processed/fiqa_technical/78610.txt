> Example abound of rich kids who don't pan out and poor kids who make it. This is not really very true. Social mobility is not so common - if you're born in the poorest or riches 1% or 10% of the population, the chances are you'll spend your whole life in that demographic. Figures are not so easy to come by on these particular margins, but it's easy to find studies that show 42 percent of American men raised in the bottom fifth of incomes stay there as adults, whilst just 8 percent rise to the top fifth. [[cite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_mobility_in_the_United_States)] Yet it's really the poorest 1% and 10% we should be thinking about, and comparing them to the richest 1% and 10%, when we ask how fair our society is. They are surely less socially mobile. Meanwhile, [UK statistics](http://www.lonegunman.co.uk/2009/12/11/statistics-on-social-mobility-and-belief-systems/): * Pri­vately edu­cated can­di­dates account for 7 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, but occupy more than half of the top pro­fes­sional jobs. * 75 per cent of judges, 45 per cent of senior civil ser­vants, and a third of MPs are pri­vately educated. * More than 4 in 10 places and Oxford and Cam­bridge go to pri­vately edu­cated candidates. * 30 per cent of chil­dren on free school meals do not get good GCSEs. * Of stu­dents get­ting 3 As at A-Level, just 0.5 per cent were eli­gi­ble for free school meals.
