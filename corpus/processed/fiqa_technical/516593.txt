"What bothers be is that Juicero received so much funding to begin with. I'll water most people here people here know the nuances particulars but I'll list a few points. 1. The juicer was an over engineered press. 2. It had WiFi which made it better, some how. 3. It had over priced juice packets. 4. And lets not forget that you could simply squeeze the hand packets yourself. I like to think I'm a smart guy. VC's, I would imagine, are very smart people. How is it that a juicing company convinced so many allegedly very smart people to give them money? What happened to due diligence, investigation, or just asking basic questions like ""couldn't I just squeeze the packets myself""? It's one thing if some guy makes a stupid invention. That happens. It quite another when he successfully convinces other people to give him a literal fortune to make more. This story leaves me genuinely angry."
