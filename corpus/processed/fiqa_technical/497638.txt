"Does the bank need to use image based CTS in my case? Will it fall under ""cheques cleared under physical exchange of instruments""? No. In this case it is used as a withdrawal slip. It doesn't go anywhere. My bank manager told me that correction in CTS cheque is not allowed but I think they don't need to clear the cheque by taking an image, so it should be valid under RBI guidelines. The Manager maybe going over board or being cautious .. You have to decide whether its worth the battle in forcing Bank to accept corrected cheque. Or simple use a new one."
