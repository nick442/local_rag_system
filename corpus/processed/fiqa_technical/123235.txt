If I were a fan of Tim Hortons, I'd be concerned that BK's ownership (namely the private equity firm 3G which has a 51 per cent stake) runs Timmy's like it ran BK. A succession of private equity firms have sucked every penny of capital they could out of BK, enriching themselves and gutting BK in the process. [Fortune Magazine](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2012%2F04%2F13%2Fburger-king-is-too-big-to-fix%2F&ei=hsj6U8D9MI7noATZkYLYBA&usg=AFQjCNG1accTGUmKkrd2puXwOwh2wC742w&sig2=z7oJ7iLyTacDwO7wjMlN0g&bvm=bv.73612305,d.cGU) describes what they did: >Our view is that the overriding motivation of several owners throughout the years, and now 3G Capital, has been to starve the brand of capital in order to pay parent shareholders nice and quickly.. By our reckoning, the last two private equity firms that have taken ownership of the company have deprived it of $1 billion or more in capital that could have been used to improve the companyâ€™s relative standing versus its competitors, many of whom Burger King now struggles to keep up with. [Bloomberg Businessweek](http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-04-09/burger-king-wheres-the-beef) describes how they did it: >.. this past February [2006], Burger King borrowed an additional $350 million so its owners could pay themselves and its two partners a special $367 million dividend. The private equity owners weren't content to raid BK's bank account for everything in it. They borrowed hundreds of millions of additional dollars, piling debt onto a struggling burger chain just to give that money to themselves. Burger King is a shitty, uncompetitive burger chain with an outdated menu, dilapidated stores, and invisible marketing. Tim Hortons may be just the next victim for these private equity vampires to suck dry after wringing out all the capital and debt they could out of BK.
