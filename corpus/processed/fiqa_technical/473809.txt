"It depends on the role you take. If you go into front office investment banking, there's no avoiding horrible hours as an analyst (slightly less terrible as associate, less terrible still as VP, etc.). If you're doing corporate finance for for a F500 or otherwise large company, it doesn't have to be terrible -- from what I understand, you'll get busy periodically but for the most part your schedule is consistent and you have agency over your weekends. ""Finance"" is a broad term that encompasses many different roles at many different institutions. In general, the closer to the ""client"" you are, the less hours you can expect in general (simply because even large corporations' M&A departments do far fewer transactions per month / year than do investment banking groups). But no, you don't have to expect 80-100 hour weeks by virtue of going into ""finance""."
