"Great response, thanks! I'll do my best to answer your questions. 1. I'm a genuine believer that everything, from calculus to charisma, can be taught to *most* people. Some people don't have the intelligence to ever learn calculus, for example, and some people will only ever be average at it. But most people can at least improve in most areas through education. The messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach. Some of the things I listed I implicitly learned in grad school (e.g., when doing research, I learned how to filter out inaccurate information; when writing research papers, I learned how to organize information). I learned theories of motivation because I was in an org psych program, but I never learned how to apply them, especially in a classroom setting. I had to figure that out myself. But, yes, I do believe it's something that can be learned. 2. I think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job, as you mentioned. There are some generic skills students learn in college that can be applied to their work, however. I'm thinking of communication and social skills (although I'm probably biased, since those are the two topics I teach). College, it seems to me, is more about learning how to follow directions, figure things out for yourself, and work effectively in groups than any particular subject matter. And I think those skills do transfer well to the workplace. 3. I 100% agree with this. We're pressured to pass students and inflate grades. Character issues, including being disorganized, being dishonest, or just being rude, are diagnosed as psychological disorders and we have to ""accommodate"" students with these ""disabilities"" (to be clear, I 100% believe in psychological disorders, and I 100% support accommodating students with these disorders- I just think they are over-/ misdiagnosed these days). Totally agree with your last paragraph."
