"Y'know, I see these articles from ""experts"", day after day, month after month, year after year.. Hell, we're going on 8 years since the introduction of Bitcoin.. And despite **every** expert being wildly negative about cryptocurrencies (despite some big players - as in, BoA and JP Morgan, among others - desperately trying to convince investors to use their own version of it).. Cryptocurrencies keep growing *hundreds* of times faster than the US market as a whole. So I've become somewhat jaded by the skeptics. I'm not going to sink my retirement into Bitcoin, but.. C'mon guys, give it a rest. There's a demand for this *because* it makes your traditional financial institutions useless, and we *hate* those traditional financial institutions *sooo* much. Adapt or expire. Preferably the latter."
