Economics is the study of the distribution of goods and services, it is not theology, the study of devinity and the after life, perfect worlds where evil is punished and good is satiated with boundless plenty. Capitalism is imperfect because humans are imperfect. The best you can do in an imperfect world is reward people for contributing. The worst you can do is hand out free brownie points based on how closely you align with one interest groups arbitrary definition of need. But then again, I can say this to you until I'm blue in the face. You are stubbornly attached to a false moralistic approach to goods distribution.
