> Even with a Pell Grant to attend school, it can be very hard to get a job that will accommodate a class schedule and also pay enough for basic living expenses. And many people around here were not encouraged to pursue education, because of the expense. And because, until 10-15 years ago, there were always factories hired and it was expected to start at 18 and stay until retirement. Yeah but I know plenty of poor people that got grants and other free money and lived off campus and were able to survive. Maybe they didn't live like I did or spend like I did, but they could get by with that and maybe a part time job. I worked all throughout college. > If you do too well at work, they don't want to give you the time off to move forward (problem I had at a law office where I was working way more hours than hired for, then told I couldn't cut back to our original agreement when the next semester required more seated classes). If you don't excel, it's not worth their trouble to accommodate you because there are plenty of others begging for a job that can work whenever they're told. I hope you're not trying to become a lawyer. That field is way over saturated.
