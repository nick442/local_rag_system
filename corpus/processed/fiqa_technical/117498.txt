This is no bullshit.. at a sales conference in Paris she didn't want to be bothered with having to mingle with the regular folks. Her solution.. she setup a helicopter to ferry her from the conference center/hotel to where she was really staying (*some other fancy ass hotel*) just so she didn't have to interact with the commoners. It's shit like this which has led to so many die hard HP people (*myself included*) leaving the company in the past decade. Today the culture and management is nothing like Bill and Dave wanted.
