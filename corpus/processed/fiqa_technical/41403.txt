You'd think I would remember this, having also bought a house in 2008, but I recall that earnest money was different from the nonrefundable deposit. Earnest money was typically some small amount - $500 or something - that was put on the table when you made the offer. After the offer was accepted, but before closing, the 1%-ish amount was put into escrow as part of the negiotiation process. Maybe this is just a Massachusetts thing, though.
