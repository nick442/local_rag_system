> This is only for their own products. Amazon is not the only player in the world not even close. The shear amount of packages Fed ex alone ships is insane not to mention their network. That is what you are responding to. You didn't address the claim. Before AWS there was nothing like it, and they didn't have a serious competitor for years, Bezos once told Buffett how weird it is that everyone knows he has good ideas, knows about AWS and yet he didn't have a real competitor for 6 years. Because his claim is that fedex has huge infrastructure operating a scale that is far greater than Amazons as Amazon is the last player, and becuase you are comparing the case of shipping to the case of AWS where amazon was the first player in and the first to have serious infrastructure the analogy fails to obtain. The two cases aren't similar in the salient way. That is, the case of AWS not only fails to address the claim, it is one of the worst possible analogies given that the saleint feature is being the first player and already having the infrastructure to meet all current demands on a larger scale than anyone else. In the fedex example fedex has that property, in the AWS case AWS had it.
