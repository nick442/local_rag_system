"**He's not claiming any particular business is worth $3.7 trillion you fucking dimwit.** Like when someone says ""the soft drink business is worth an estimated Xbillion"" they don't mean any particular business in the soft drink game is worth Xbillion. If it makes it easier for your fat head to understand, what he's saying is the muni bond market is worth $3.7 trillion..just as the sources fucking pointed out. Maybe next time you want to critique someone's article you should make sure you know how to actually comprehend what you're looking at. You really haven't got a fucking clue."
