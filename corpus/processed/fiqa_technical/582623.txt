Hi! This is just a friendly reminder letting you know that you should type it as `¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯` to format it correctly. A backslash on reddit is used as an escape character, meaning that it can be used to make special characters, such as underscores and other backslashes ignore the formatting that they do to other characters on Reddit, and instead display them literally. --- *^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^If ^I ^have ^done ^something ^wrong, ^please ^message ^my ^owner, ^[John_Yuki](https://www.reddit.com/user/John_Yuki/).*
