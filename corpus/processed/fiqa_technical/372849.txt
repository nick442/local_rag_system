I would never recommend only using one platform, and if anyone is dependent on a single platform, even if that 'platform' is email, failure will happen. The only issue I have with email lists is that they become out of date very quickly and open rates are exceptionally low. Back in 1997 open rated were well above 85%, but now you'll be doing exceptionally well to get anywhere near 10%.. it's just not when the consumers attention is. Marketers ruin everything lol
