"Do you work in this field or something? You sound like a very passionate apologist. >why shouldn't traders be able to decide (as a group) what the companies are worth? Because often they purposefully distort value so they can either a) buy low and profit or b) sell high and profit. Why are you so anti-government? I'd rather have people I elected and who are accountable to me determining things instead of private and highly selfish interests who represent only themselves. > do you really think that intraday (or even intraweek) prices are really representative of what ""the market"" thinks a company is valued at? If not, why bother with the charade in the first place? What is the point of wild price fluctuations even throughout a single day, if they, as you admit, do not represent value? The whole concept of short term profiting off of these pointless (and often engineered) market movements is silly, and adds nothing to society whatsoever (the original point of the stock market). Further, that money needs to come from somewhere, and that typically is long term investors who want a pension at some point and don't feel like trading at microsecond timeframes because they do something useful instead. Its disgusting. >compared to the effect of long term buy and holders changing their mind about a company, the effect of any HFT people on the valuation of a stock is practically nothing - like I said, there's just about no evidence of speculators causing significant mispricing over any significant period. So you're saying just because the aggregate effect is small(ish), no one should worry about it? That is the absolute stupidest thing I have ever heard! If I steel a car every other week, who cares right? Millions of cars are made every year, the effect of me stealing 20 or 30 wont change car markets in any noticeable way.. Further, speculation in commodities (mainly food) has indeed caused enormous mispricing and incaculabe human suffering in the developing world."
