"In ""steady state"", the refrigerator only has to pump out the heat that has leaked in from outside. The amount of heat leaked is related to the difference between interior and exterior temperatures, and the overall insulation quality. Thus, a refrigerator full of cold food uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator full of cold air. In practice, people open the door, take cold food out, put ""warm"" food in, and the unit may also make ice, dispense cold water, and defrost itself. Aside from tweaking those uses, (e.g. minimizing time with the door open), a useful trick is to use empty milk cartons or similar containers to fill up unused space. This helps by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes when the door is opened, and the air in the cartons has low thermal mass, so it cools down rapidly. When you need the space, you can remove the cartons and set them aside. Similarly, water-filled cartons may be used as a sort of thermal ballast--leveling out the temperature fluctuations within the refrigerator, particularly if the electric utilities are erratic. However, they increase the cost of refrigeration when cooling the water in the first place, and when you eventually dump out the water, the expense of cooling it goes down the drain."
