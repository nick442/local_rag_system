"If the country went to a sustainable minimum wage like 15 dollars an hour we would benefit more. Anyone who thinks the walmart strikes are stupid and they should be fired clearly doesnt understand how the economy should work. Oh? You do know that all basic goods and services would increase in price, right? Raising the minimum wage will not raise minimum value. ""If you are pro for under 15 dollars an hour, you are pro slavery."" Haha. Slaves are forced. You aren't forced to work for minimum wage. It's a result of many poor life decisions that led you there. The fact that I'm not working a minimum wage job is because I worked my ass off to learn the skills I needed to make a good living. ""The only people making these facts up are the ones who own the businesses because their wealth will go down and be spread among employees more."" Not really. As a business owner, I would just increase the costs of my goods or services. Most retail businesses have slim profit margins (restaurants are even worse). They would not be able to survive long if their workforce cost suddenly doubled and their revenue stayed the same. You don't know much about business. I'm glad people like you aren't making decision in government."
