> more people should die if it means companies can operate more efficiently. I don't care about companies operating efficiently. I care about individuals operating effectively. Small business owners do it everyday, even using simple technology platforms to propel their business. They follow government safety guidelines, interact directly with their customers in a professional way, and no one dies. Placing all the liability on companies is ineffective and a sign of government doing too much.
