I had a situation like that happen at work. A girl in H.R. did that and milked maternity leave until her six months were up. Then called in and said she was resigning. My boss was talking about her to some of the staff saying she'd probably not going to come back and that the H.R. Director should be looking to replace her position. He was right, her husband had a high paying tech job and she didn't need the income so why would she stick around a dysfunctional company? The other maternity leave was a girl in my department who got pregnant by a dude a few cubicles away. She had to go on disability 3 months before her maternity leave officially kicked in. She had my boss over a barrel and convinced him to pay the difference between disability and her salary for the entire period she was out. It appears she threatened to quit unless she got a raise and another promotion because she came back with a better title and her pay check got larger from then on. She basically held a bunch of incomplete work over his head as ransom for months. As of July when I left she just got around to doing it..so basically it took her a year to complete a project that should have taken about a week or so.
