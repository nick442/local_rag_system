I completely agree (I'm also fully on board with the principles of OWASP). I think what makes this case interesting is that the data Equifax collects is deeply personal but also deeply relevant to their business model. So many other businesses collect much more personal data than required for their business. However in this case, Equifax is required to collect some of the most personal data in existence and failed at protecting it. My point in the previous post was that the centralization of collected data is a systemic risk which ends in a compromise (and ultimately catastrophic failure) of the entire system. Suppose Equifax, instead of storing all 143 million records in one database, had 143 *different* databases in 143 different locations, completely compartmentalized from each other. The risk of compromise would mean a million people's data would be exposed and not 143 million.
