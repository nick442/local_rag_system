Yea, good that you have a list of MDs/VPs. You should reach out to them pretty early on, think like early october. To do so too early would be overzealous, and there's no way you can expect someone to identify with you if you've spent only a few weeks at their school. At least get past their full time senior recruiting season in September before talking to HR or any higher up alumni. Then just go full force and contact as many people as you can. As far as recent grads go, only reach out to those class of 2013 or earlier. 2014s don't have any pull at all. You could list your CC GPA next to your CC resume line, or you could omit it entirely from the resume. I don't know that it would be much of a net impact either way though, as nobody is really going to look at that GPA number very closely.
