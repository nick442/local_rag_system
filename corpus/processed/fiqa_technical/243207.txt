> TK didnt lose investor tens of billions of dollars. Uber has spent close to $13B. > Also, for the past several years the whole market rewards growth over earnings, so that helped guys like Musk and Kalanick quite a lot and to a lessor degree, Bezos and Reddings. Growth of a model with positive unit economics. It's one thing to have positive unit economics and use your margins to 1) accelerate customer acquisition or 2) build infrastructure that reduces your costs. It's another entirely to have negative unit economics and require subsidy just to continue providing your service at all. > For all assets, investor profits come from either earnings or valuation growth and Kalanick provided quite a bit of the latter. Sure, investors may have the opportunity sell their stock before it crashes, just as some home sellers made a killing right before the housing bubble popped. That's why TK was forced from the company, his investors are trying to get Uber into IPO-able shape so they can ditch their stock before people realize how worthless it is.
