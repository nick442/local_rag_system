One could wish that. If you speak to Chinese in China even they don't trust Chinese businessses and don't want Chinese goods. Hiring top European and American design and engineering firms for large projects doesn't help if the guy putting the base down decides not to follow the specifications or the subcontractor doing the concrete tries to save a few bucks and does a shoddy job. As far as coming up with new ideas? Do you know why so many Chinese firms and the government hack and steal information? Group think is a way of life and no one wants to stick out.
