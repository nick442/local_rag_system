"If Lewis made any misrepresentations, painting the HFT firms in a bad light, he would be getting his ass sued off right now. So again, what part did he get wrong? And why are all these firms not suing him over this ""hatchet job""? I know all the greedy HFT fuckheads are upset for being exposed as greedy HFT fuckheads, but I don't see how their hurt feelings changes the fact that they're greedy HFT fuckheads."
