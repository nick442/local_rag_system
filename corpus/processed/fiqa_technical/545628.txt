Greece is a unique case. These are still individual states led by very different people. You have countries that are just doing fine, despite being poor in natural resources and I would put Portugal, Spain, Italy, etc in this category. Then you have countries that are doing really well because they have natural resources and thriving industries like Germany, UK and France. Then you have countries that are struggling like Ireland, Greece, etc (Portugal has been here before). And then, you have heaven like countries like Finland, Denmark, etc where all just goes smoothly and everything works. Super high quality education, teenagers speak 3 languages by the time they are 16, etc. One thing I can guarantee you, in none of these countries you'd pay $200k for cancer treatment or higher education. Don't generalize.
