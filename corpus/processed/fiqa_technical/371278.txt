Outsider to this, but it's pretty rich to imply HellaSober kicked off the rudeness when you responded to their comment with 'Did you read the article?' In your comment earlier in the chain, you put shudder quotes on their use of 'overcorrection' and 'some employees' which is also rude. Assuming your goal is to have civil conversations in the future, try some self reflection.
