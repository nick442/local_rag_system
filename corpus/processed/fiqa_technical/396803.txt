Where do you live that an apartment costs $1000 but the minimum wage is still the federal minimum? For example NYC is expensive, but they have a $11.50 minimum wage to compensate. San Francisco's minimum wage is $10.24. You'd have to be living in a big city for that kind of rent, but big cities have higher minimum wages. As for childcare, $1000 also seems very high. A reasonable childcare center in most parts of the country should cost arond $400 or so. http://childcare.about.com/od/costofchildcare/qt/daycarecost.htm
