Somebody is getting really addicted to Dow highs and needs another hit. Damn it is going to hurt them when the Dow corrects like a motherfucker. Invest in the value of a company, invest for the long haul. Don't chase a magical index value. The Dow can actually tank and smart investors can win *at the same time*.
