Education is totally depending on the skills and mindset of the student. Many many students can be self taught and/or are motivated to learn. They don't need teachers. Then there are those who want to learn, but have difficulties. They need teachers, but probably one-on-one. The rest are mostly in school just because they have to. So, yes, we will need schools and teachers mostly for the later - students who, given a chance, will not learn anything.
