The basic idea is that if you start buying prenatal vitamins and pregnancy tests, it's kind of weird if target sends you a coupon booklet that is 99% baby stuff. Idea being post pre-natal vitamin and pregnancy test purchase, you send a circular with some baby ads, and some stuff like, toilet paper and shampoo. So the consumer doesn't realize that they have been pegged as obviously pregnant/trying by their local target shopping patterns.
