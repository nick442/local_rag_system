Well, you're taking two companies who are overhauling their networks in a similar way (LTE) and combining resources.. Combining Sprint's and Softbank's orders for phones and LTE equipment reduces overall cost per unit which allows both companies to offer better service and better devices for less. There is also the added advantage of capturing customers that travel between the US and Japan.. Make it easier and cheaper to use one device in both countries. That's what they're aiming for.
