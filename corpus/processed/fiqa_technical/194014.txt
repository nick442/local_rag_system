It's still is a problem because its illegal. Furthermore it has resulted in the decline of local businesses reliant on locals and not tourists. Long term renters in areas that are not tourist dependent actually help the local area economically. It's actually vital. No one is ripping off the landlord, the landlord gets a renter to host an illegal AirBNB location by subdividing a building or room well over capacity. This causes fire issues, clogs up elevators, behavior problems, etc etc. In my building they had to put up 7 notices on behavior, including partying, throwing trash out the window, smoking rules, pool abuse, making it actually a worser place to live. It's also negatively affecting the other people who own the apartment units they live in. A building isn't a suitable hotel or BNB especially in big cities. I don't care if someone AirBNB's their spare room occasionally, but we're talking about AirBNB hosts who mass rent and then stuff 6 people into an apartment designed for 2 and then do it for many of the units in an apartment building. All of a sudden an apartment complex with 200 units designed for up to 500 people is suddenly host to 600+.
