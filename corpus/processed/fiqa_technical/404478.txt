People forget companies constantly cheat regulations anyway.. look at last years car emissions BS, dumping in rivers, improper storage of chemicals, cars with bad ignitions that can turn it off or cause it to accelerate rapidly and ends up killing everyone in the car, etc. And that’s *with* regulations against those sorts of things. Regulations are really a base line of expectation of behavior. Sure, “the free market” will let people choose other cars that don’t kill them because the right ignition would have cost a car manufacturer another $2 in profit per car, but that don’t mean shit when it was your family that slammed into a stantion at 80mph.
