See, the reason why this is still not good is this: the companies that determine the “use by” date are the same companies that profit by you throwing it away and buying more, sooner than is necessary. To me, that’s a direct conflict of interest. What we actually need is a requirement to have an independent company determine the literal “use by” dates. This is a good step forward in terms of understanding something, but still ignores a glaring conflict of interest.
