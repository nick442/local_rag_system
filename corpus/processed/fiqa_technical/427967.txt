If anything LEGO is as much as the good guy in toy business as Reddit perceived Valve the good guy (customer oriented) in games. Asking for pieces through their customer support surprised me they actually recommends a third party (Bricklink) as an alternative should they failed to replace my pieces. They actually replaced your missing Lego bricks for free! I simply couldn't recommend them enough. This might be questionable, but the there was a Lego representative who did an AMA on 4chan's /toy/ board a few years ago.
