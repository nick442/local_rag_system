No ulterior motives? You do seem to submit a lot of links to sites like io9, forbes, torrentfreak, theverge, etc. and submit the same article to multiple reddits. Your links to, for example, theverge also began at the same time that I began seeing them submitted by other users, so I have always been suspicious of your posts.
