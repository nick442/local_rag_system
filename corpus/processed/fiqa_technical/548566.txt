"Good save, love how you're walking back toward the positions I've taken previously, but you said you would not consider someone with a music or communications undergrad degree for a security position, full stop. Diversity hire? Nice person? Stop putting words in my mouth because I said no such thing. And stop putting words in my mouth about what I think of HR; their role is to hire the best talent and protect the company, not to protect employees, and if you read back, you'll see I already said that. ""Not long in the corporate world"" lol okay believe what you like."
