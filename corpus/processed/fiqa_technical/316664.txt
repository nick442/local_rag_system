> 5. Beware of the Internet The Internet creates unique challenges for employers, especially with the advent of smartphones and tablet. Too many employees spend too much time: Redditing? :-) I've certainly seen how all of these things can happen, sometimes without poor intention on the part of the employee. Frankly, if I have a higher level employee that has time to waste in the first place, I think the blame goes on me for not managing well. Sure, there's more to the story, but I try not to walk around with the mentality that my employees are trying to find any way they can to blow their time. That thought makes me sad..
