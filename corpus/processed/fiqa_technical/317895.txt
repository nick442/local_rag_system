Your strategy is well thought out. Others use it same as you, to fund an IRA in the prior tax year with that year's refund. Gotcha? Forgetting to send in the money on time. Or not correctly identifying the tax year for the deposit. I know st**f happens, but I'd try to not get such a large refund in the future, better the money be in your pocket/account than Uncle Sam's. But your question implied an unusual event, so this advice may be moot. Per Brick's comment below - be sure your MAGI isn't above the level where you can deduct the IRA deposit. That would create an odd situation, but since you are doing the return first, it's a matter of just confirming this on the return.
