I think it really works for some people. They got a couple days off work, some meals at a fancy hotel, free booze, free shit. Most are probably the kind of people who don't really care about the company or their job. Then, the people who are in charge of doing this kind of junk go on about how successful it was, etc. That gets reported in the meeting. What the higher ups don't see are the people hanging out in someone else's office shooting the shit about how stupid things are. Then there's this question as to why company morale is so low, and no one can figure it out for the BS they've been shoveled. Too much middle management and layers of corporate BS (overstuffed 'communications' departments, HR people, meetings upon meetings filled with people trying to make themselves look good whatever the cost, etc) and everyone thinks everything is golden. So many worthless people involved, making themselves look valuable by spending money.
