I'm in both markets and there are a lot of factors. Distribution costs in NY are ridiculously high. Different states have different generation mixes, access to fuel, different regulatory costs, different taxes, different availability of green/renewable energy as well as different mandates, different types of restructuring (TX is fully restructured; NY was only partially restructured and the market has been a total mess -- they're thinking about going back to a fully-regulated model). For business customers, my biggest pieces of advice are: 1. Energy Audits and, if applicable, reviews of your processes/equipment/whatever to ensure you're not using unnecessary energy or causing unnecessary peaks in demand; 2. Do not sign exclusivity/letter of authorization/power of attorney with a broker -- see what prices they can get you, and then shop around yourself, and if you go through a broker, make sure they tell you as part of the contract how much the supplier is paying them per kWh/therm; 3. Review your usage history (including demand) for at least the past 12 months and then compare to the utility tariff you're being served under -- do anything possible to avoid demand charges and make damn sure you're utility hasn't put you/left you in a demand charge-carrying class if you don't actually qualify for it. I'll be happy to share more if anyone is interested.
