2 SaaSes: http://letsfreckle.com and http://charmhq.com 2 training courses for js, one live, one recorded workshop: http://jsmasterclass.com http://html5mobilepro.com 1 ebook/software package for JavaScript performance: http://jsrocks.com And, lastly, I do a training course twice a year to show other designers, developers & trainer types how to make & sell their own products like mine: http://unicornfree.com/30x500 This is all on my about page, btw, except for the new Charm app because we haven't opened the doors to the public yet. We are slowly inviting the 3000 people on the waiting list because we want to ensure our architecture scales. The fun thing is that our first products helped us fund the development of our later products. We owe nothing to nobody, and own 100% of everything we do.
