"> Exactly by how much will this reduce radioactive waste? A modern fuel cycle should get rid of almost all (99%+) of long-half-life radioactive byproducts. Instead, you end up with about 5% the volume of stuff that stays radioactive for a couple hundred years. You still have a radioactive waste storage problem, but it can be solved with a concrete building with doors that lock and ""danger, hazardous material"" signs rather than some Yucca Mountain nonsense."
