"I'd agree with maybe a concept of ""situational value"" being negative while accepting ""intrinsic value"" means ""what use a person can expect to get out of it"", but again, both ultimately are subjective. That said, there can be benefits from drawing a distinction between the two. Going back to Bitcoin, it does have an ""intrinsic value"", because the value of Bitcoin itself is that it can be divided up easily, transferred easily, and etc, all the things that make a currency valuable. Traditionally, we value things as money if they meet many of the following criteria: 1. Medium of exchange 2. Unit of account 3. Store of value 4. Standard of deferred payment 5. Measure of Value Gold meets some of these better than others, dollars meet some of these better than others, and so on, but Bitcoin meets all of these very well, which means (at least to me) that Bitcoin has intrinsic value in that it meets the definition of what we value the most in a *currency*. So maybe as long as we agree that there is a difference between subjective value and intrinsic value, and agree that subjective value can, in fact, be negative, there may be something to go on here."
