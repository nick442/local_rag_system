> But perhaps most encouragingly, American businesses are responding to the climate challenge, and for a simple reason: it cuts costs. A recent analysis of Fortune 500 companies revealed half have a goal in place to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, while 190 companies reported savings of $3.7bn a year as a result of their climate action. The yearly emission reductions from these corporate efforts are equivalent to closing 45 coal-fired power plants. Given this, where do rightwing whackjobs get the idea it will cost $3 trillion to adhere to Obama's climate pledge for the Paris agreement?
