I mean, Amazon currently interviews and pays for people to move from all over the country to Seattle. So I don't really think they'd only be looking to hire people from Michigan. They'll easily be able to recruit from the midwest and mid-atlantic. Also, they're not going to have 50,000 openings over night. It'll take a while to get to that level. I really think, geographically, Detroit is perfect for Amazon.
