You can thank hedge funds for that. Was looking to buy a rental and the home sold for more than asking. This happened 3 times. Realtor told me that they are buying all the single family homes sight unseen. As soon as a home under 250k goes up for sale, it's sold in my city. Since 2011 the average home buyer has had to out offer them significantly in order to get them.
