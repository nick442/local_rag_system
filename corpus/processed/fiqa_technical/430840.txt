>woo hoo massive theft Ahh I see. Better to worry about how he used the number for total bond market than about the fraud itself because it only millions of dollars. Of course. How could i have been so stupid! You're right, the most important thing to get out of the story is that the total amount of new muni bonds isn't as big a number as he uses for the overall bond market. Keep up the good fight!
