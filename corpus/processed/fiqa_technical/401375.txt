I can't find the video, but Mark Cuban was on one of the late shows, and the host asked him this question. His first response was I have no idea, then he took a wild guess of about $175K, or so. I am a tax accountant that works on a couple of very very weathly people. I very seriously doubt they keep up with knowing how much is in their checking account. They are given a card, and accountants handle the rest. Then their advisor gives them a run down every month or so.
