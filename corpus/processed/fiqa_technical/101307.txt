So we build the malls and obsolete them for the internet (Amazon) then Amazon buys the malls and uses them as brick and mortal distribution centers? There is something wrong with this picture. I no longer get to try on the winter coat before I buy it. Same local distribution but no customer access to the product to try it out. This sucks.
