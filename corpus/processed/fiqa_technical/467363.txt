If it weren't for the anti-government sentiment preventing it, you could get the same effect simply by having the government hire a LOT more people at the low-end of the socioeconomic scale - people like teachers, policemen, firefighters, rangers, etc., especially if that hiring included proper training for people who didn't already have it. This would create a defacto minimum wage, since private industry would have to compete for workers, without requiring them by law to adhere to some predefined compensation packages. This would have a been a MUCH better way to use the hundreds of billions that the Fed has used to provide stimulus to the economy, instead giving it to the big banks & letting them play securities games with it. Of course, with the anti-government sentiment (and the lack of ability to control how the big bucks get handed out to political donor industries), fat chance of a straightforward solution like this ever being implemented.
