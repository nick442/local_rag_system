A lot of these firms consist of ex-McKinsey consulting people that know how to evaluate operations, efficiency, etc. Like any company, operating plans are presented by mgmt to the board and implemented by management. The PE firm works with management to design the operating strategy, and that may be done in-house (PE firm) and/or with outside consults in the industry. Operational performance is important, but unfortunately a lot of PE firms really only engage in financial engineering. The more industry/sector specific the PE the firm, the more value they likely add (as a generalization).
