THIS! While the GDP may have fallen, the average joe felt more prosperous after WWII because wage and price controls were lifted and production turned back to consumer goods instead of bombs which are useless for civilians in peacetime. In other words, you can have more prosperity even if your gross output falls, provided you start making shit people actually want to use to improve their lives, like cars and TVs and medicine.
