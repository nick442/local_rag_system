When people voice or express racist discriminatory views for public consumption they are signifying to the world that they have lost all sense of the concept of socialization, and that they wish to be alone and isolated from civilized educated people. Politics is knowing when to leave the world stage, and racism is not knowing you are just about to, Mr. Faber. Have fun counting your money you anal sadistic antisocial buffoon knuckledragger piece of sociopathic shit. Bon Voyagee'..
