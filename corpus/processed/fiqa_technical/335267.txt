Brb, going to gather up some data for you that displays the various drug discoveries, new drugs, etc. by country/companies in those countries. I’m not saying that the system isn’t fucked, or that drug prices aren’t absurdly high, or that there aren’t corporations out there not trying to give back to the world..but $$$ is will ALWAYS be the foundation of any business. To churn a profit. How do you do that? You develop a good product, sell the good product, and make your money back and then some for doing all the work. Yes, there are some holes that need to be plugged, i.e. generic drugs still being absurdly priced, gouging between insurance companies and the drug companies..but how can you throw shit in the face of ONE pharmaceutical company when it’s an industry-wide problem with so many different variables at play. You build a pharmaceutical company, raise the billions of necessary funds to run trials (99% of which will never amount to an actual product the company can sell) WITHOUT relying on public offerings (selling stock.. = shareholders), come across some more billions (still without selling stock to raise money) to market and produce your drugs from your 1/99 successful clinical trials all costing unfathomable amounts of $$$, and let me know how you’re doin. Shit is expensive. The people who bitch about the broken system offer up no realistic, economically sound means of fixing that system. There’s no such thing as a free lunch. What makes sense morally does not always translate to making sense economically, as fucked up as that is. There are tons of problems in this world, and I’m not saying I have answers to any of them, but you need to be able to see the opposing view of an argument as well to fix a problem.
