The broker may be purchasing the CDs through a CDARS participant financial institution. You can bypass your broker and go to a CDARS participant FI yourself. CDARS is a network of financial institutions that spread your deposit across multiple FIs, guaranteeing your FDIC coverage. The advantage is you have a single point of contact - your chosen financial institution. You do not have to have any contact with the other FIs where your deposit may be spread. In fact, on your statements or online banking it will appear as if your large CD is all with your chosen FI. The spreading will happen behind the scenes. A local participating institution can help explain this program to you.
