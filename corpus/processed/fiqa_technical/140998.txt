"This is proof that the people running the world are all insane. They are interested only in their personal gain and they are throwing the entire planet full of people under the proverbial bus in the effort to increase their bank accounts during their short lives. The practice of banks ""inventing"" money by lending more than they actually have in their vaults should be stopped, or at the very least reigned in. During the housing collapse it was revealed that CHASE was lending money at a 50:1 ratio. That's madness. CHASE should have gone bankrupt as a result, but they received massive bailouts. A company which operates like that is literally poison in the bloodstream. Everyone knows that financial health is the result of making rational decisions. So it leads one to wonder how it is that all of the richest people get that way by being as irrational as possible. It's no surprise that most of them lose their fortunes in disastrous catastrophes which serve as entertainment for the masses. When it comes to building wealth I think the story of the Tortoise and the Hare offers the most wisdom of any anecdotes."
