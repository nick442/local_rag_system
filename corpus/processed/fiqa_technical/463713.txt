Most programming for financial engineering will be in C++, Python, R, or MATLAB; some books written by Mark Joshi or Daniel Duffy may be a good place to look for how C++ is used in FE (Duffy also has an online C++ course that's quite good). If you have a physics/math background then you likely have 90% of the required maths, such as calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics. I would recommend taking a course/reading a book on advanced probability, real analysis, and stochastic calculus, but these are not trivial subjects. If you are more interested in learning specifically about how math is applied to FE you can take a look at a book such as [a primer for the mathematics of FE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0979757622/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_2KumzbMN6ZPE5). Also, check out online forums that discuss this such as [quantent](quantnet.com).
