I think you hit the point of the book. People need to stop taking every word in the book literally. Sure it has some bad advice but overall the big picture is that the book is supposed to change the way you think. Its supposed to open your mind to how a rich person should be thinking and get out of what he calls the rat race. His ideas in the book are great and it really has inspired me to be my own employee and achieve my own financial freedom.
