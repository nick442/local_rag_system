Not everyone must absolutely have the cheapest price. I'll pay more if I can walk into Best Buy and have a nice experience. If the employees are helpful and trained to be professional. If they offer white glove service that will beat me home from the store. If they offer included extended warranty support. Etc. I'd pay more. Gladly. I won't pay more for a warehouse experience where I'm treated like a head of cattle.
