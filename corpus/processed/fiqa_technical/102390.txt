Thank you for this post! I found it informative, interesting, and insightful. Personally, I have always been curious how American companies, even smaller mom and pop stores, outsourced to China despite all the cultural and language barriers. Have you found any problems arise from the clashing of cultures, i.e. differences in expectations or processes, that add to the difficulty in communicating with Chinese manufacturers?
