Walmart is still an awful place to buy groceries, and is rated as such in just about every national survey. The prices aren't that great, the shelves are a mess, and items are poorly restocked based on my observations at several stores. I can spend about the same amount of money buying groceries at Wegmans vs. Walmart (although I do most of my shopping at Aldi, which has also switched to so-called 'Angus' bef. I honestly don't notice a difference, just more marketing buzzwords).
