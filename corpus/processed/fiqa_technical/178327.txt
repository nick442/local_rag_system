There's this thing called google. It's amazing how it's developed in the last 13 years. Some say it has indexed all publicly available information on the internet, and even some books too. It has absolutely decimated it's competition in the search engine market making sites like excite.com and webcrawler.com a thing of the past. TL;DR do your own fucking research
