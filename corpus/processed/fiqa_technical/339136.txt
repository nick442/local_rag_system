">> So, for every trading partner, you need a unique EDI process. > You don't have EDI operators in US? Trust me: those ""EDI operators"" (called ""EDI Service Bureaus"" in the US) have a unique EDI map for each trading partner, because, as I said, each trading partner sends the EDI data in a completely different way. And EDI service Bureaus charge $$$ per message.. so a lot of businesses who are heavy into EDI (like my company) find it more cost effective to have in-house EDI operation. Also, once the custom EDI map is done, it will probably be used with no changes for the next 10 years.. at least.. > In our process we ideally have PO number.. Even if you have a PO number, each supplier sends the EDI invoice in a totally different format. In any case, freight invoices have to be matched to warehouse freight records, goods-receipt invoices have to be verified against receiving in the warehouse, office supplies invoices have to be reviewed to make sure allowed items were ordered, charges for temporary labor have to be approved by hiring managers, invoices for legal work have to be matched Matter cases, etc. Shortly, invoices from suppliers are for many different types of services handled by many different departments."
