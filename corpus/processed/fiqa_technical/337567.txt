I brought my car in to sears auto because the oil light came on after they had put in a new oil pressure sensor a month earlier. I assumed it was faulty so I brought it up. They checked it out after taking their sweet time about it and gave me a bullshit diagnosis. Ultimately I had to tell them exactly what to do to fix it, which they had to bring in a manager to give them the okay for, and I was right. Also, it took 6 hours when it should have taken 1 or 2 for the part to come in and install (not a busy day by any means either). I stood by them to make sure they did it properly because they had two 16 or 18 year old kids working on it. Another time I went in to buy an impact driver and a few other tools. No one came up to ask if I needed help, and when I brought everything to the register, there was a line of 10 people and 1 cashier. It was a saturday afternoon, so traditionally a busy day. Sears is a disappointment and I wouldn't mind if they close the one by me.
