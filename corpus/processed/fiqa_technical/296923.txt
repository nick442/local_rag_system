If you live in a country that taxes interest, and if this is a significant amount of money in a high interest account then the tax forms will serve as a reminder. Even though the advice is to forget about the money, so that you don't dip into it for trivial things; you do need to look at it every so often to make sure it is still in a high interest account. The info about the account also needs to be kept in a place where somebody else can track it down if a spouse or dependent has to use the money in the emergency.
