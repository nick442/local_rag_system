"Just like foreclosing is less than optimal for the banks, a tax sale has drawbacks for the county. At a minimum, there the manpower needed to process the foreclosure and sale, and in many cases the value for which the property can be sold is probably less than the taxes due. The problem is this flies in the face of the ""personal responsibility"" talking point that many bankers have been spreading since the beginning of the financial crisis. It's a moral failing for a homeowner to walk away from an upside-down mortgage, but when the bank does the same thing for a tax bill it's a simple business decision."
