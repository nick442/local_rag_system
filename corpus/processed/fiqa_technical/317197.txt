"The answer is simple -- your new job pays more than your old one. As such, you're in a higher tax withholding bracket, even with the same number of deductions as before. Your withholding is computed based on how much you make each pay period, and the number of pay periods in the year. So, if you were being paid weekly before then it was based on the assumption you made the same amount for every pay period in the calendar year. This is why tax varies from week to week for hourly employees and people being paid overtime. In your new job, you're being paid ""semi-monthly"", which makes for 24 pay periods rather than the 52 pay periods when you were paid weekly, so the amount of withholding (in dollar terms) is going to be much greater than when you were being paid weekly. Add in the fact you're making $2,000 more (a month, I presume?), so that's $24,000 a year more. It's definitely going to bump you into a different earning bracket for taxes, so even with the same number of deductions, you're going to pay more now. This isn't to say you won't be able to recoup some of that at the end of the year when you file your taxes, since your current withholding rate may have you over-paying. As such, you'll see a nice refund. One final note -- You always have the option of changing your withholding if you like. Many people will do that, claiming minimal deductions for the first few months of the year to let the maximum withholding take place, then they'll adjust their withholding deductions in the second half of the year to capture more in each paycheck. If done right, it makes no difference in the total amount withheld, but it does allow the checks at the latter part of the year to be bigger than if withholding deductions were kept the same throughout."
