"I am in NYC so my views on costs are certainly skewed, but you're also comparing apples and oranges here. You are comparing a bowl of stew or a personal pizza/bowl of pasta to a burger meal, that's a bit disingenuous. I am not arguing that five guys is the BEST value out there, I'm just saying the costs are justifiable in comparison to other burger options. Their product is at a much higher standard than ""traditional"" fast food joints."
