Your point is that 20k is very common as bonus *at what level*? With ~6 or more years experience at Accenture it's also a common bonus, just not at entry-level. The data on glassdoor.com for Accenture partners is all over the place, see: http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Accenture-Salaries-E4138.htm?sort.sortType=BP&sort.ascending=false No way in hell any partner is getting paid 60k or even 160k, for example. The top figure looks sort of accurate but there are so few data points, collected in no verifiable way, with such huge variance, that I can't consider it reliable.
