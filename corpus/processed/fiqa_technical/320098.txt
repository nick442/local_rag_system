>government free utopia You are fallaciously asserting that I think elimination of government would result in a utopia. I do not believe that *anything* will result in a utopia. However, eliminating government *will* create a general improvement in conditions for mankind. >Somalia is one. Somalia is an example of a ***FAILED*** government, but there *has always been, and continues to be* a central government *as well as* an ad-hoc government of warlords etc. To suggest Somalia is lacking a government is ignorant at best, and intentionally duplicitous at worst. >The countries with the weakest governments are some of the worst places in the world to live. Which is a demonstration that the people who live there are *so uncooperative* that they can't have a peaceful or wealthy society *even with* a violent, oppressive government attempting to maintain order, and the governments are *failed*, not intentionally and purposefully *dismantled and removed*. What I'm explaining to you is that we need to structure our interactions as *so cooperative* that we *intentionally and purposefully* dismantle and remove the government as an unnecessary hindrance to further cooperation and wealth building. I do note that you didn't make the slightest effort to refute any of my prior comments, and merely engaged in a set of rather pathetic fallacies, so I'll take this as your acknowledgement that you lack any useful counter-arguments and as such, I can presume that my position is correct and you have accepted it as correct.
