Agreed about the Zune. I got the very first gen for free which is why I gave it a chance, but had it broken I would have gladly purchased another. I used that thing daily for years and the only reason it retired is because my smartphone took over. It's in a box in the closet and looks as new as the day that I got it even after heavy use. One of many Microsoft products that people made fun of without ever giving it a shot.
