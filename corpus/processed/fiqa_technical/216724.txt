"people these days believe income is a human right or something. im sorry, but if you spent 12 years of your life staying up late, studying your ass off while working in the service industry to support yourself so you can eventually become a doctor, you will probably make more than if you just went home after work those 12 years, ate cheetohs in front of the tv and watch cartoons. if you are not happy with the amount of income you currently make, stop using the internet to bitch about it and use it to better and add value to yourself. there are many opportunities all over the place, online education, scholarships, internships. The idea of ""a fair share of income"" teeters on communism, if you ask me."
