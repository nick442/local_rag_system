I think a lot of people in this thread seem to be conflating worker/workplace rights with union membership. If your employers are chaining the fire exits shut they'd arrested. While once it was requisite to have a union to protect against employers violating basic worker safety requirements I think that is no longer the purpose of unionizing. I think my primary counterargument is why should a union be a requirement of a living wage and healthcare? If I work for a small business where unionizing would be MUCH more difficult should I not also have those things? Most of the worker protections people are discussing either have been, or should be, codified into law NOT provided by unions.
