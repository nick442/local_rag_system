I think you need a lesson on Banking 101. > I mean siphoning funds assuming that you're going to be running a HFT shop or prop trading or using models to predict when something is most profitable, which is beneficial to your wallet but not really to society. I am confused, maybe your logic will clarify this concept for me. Say, I have invested in a mutual fund which has done really well and I have made returns of over 120% in 15yrs. Is this considered stealing as well?? According to you it would be. Maybe others were more patriotic and invested their savings in Treasury bonds which probably earned them say 28% in the past 12 years. How is this different from someone working as prop shop trader (You should generalize it as a trader not just quants). Sometimes they take losses other times they make profits. Most just manage to make a living. If not they find another career (Which I think a cynical man like you ought to be doing too). If you truly understand the industry structure and believe in it, you will realize it's just another profession. If you're truly disgusted by this profession, maybe ask yourself why does society tolerate over priced attorneys, over priced doctors, high end real estate, expensive designer clothing stores. many other examples to cite here. To bring things closer to your life in perspective, the $10 t-shirt you're wearing was probably prepared by people like my cousins in India who work for wages of $110 a month. Should I call you a thief for stealing from her?
