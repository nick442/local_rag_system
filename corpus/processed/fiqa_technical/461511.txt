It's going to be truly heart breaking when CEO's are able to read their own email on a computer without the aid of paper. It will be a loss to mankind when those in control of the media and IT infrastructure actually understand how to use the tools that they rely on. Civilization will crumble as generations move closer to their work place and demand more flexible schedules. The utter horror society will face as a new generation of diverse racial, sexual and subcultural backgrounds collaborate to solve daily problems.
