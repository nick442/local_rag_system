Why do people always seem to forget that plenty of people went and studied all sorts of wacky topics in university during the 1960s and 1970s .. and paid no more for tuition / housing / food / etc than a minimum wage job could support in up front cash? The problem isn't going to study 4 years of interpretive dance. The problem is the government-induced tuition inflation that will give someone $50k in government-backed loans to go study 4 years of interpretive dance. Get the freaking government out of the tuition inflation business already! And let people go study 4 years of interpretive dance for $1k/year if they so desire. If you don't believe that nearly 100% of tuition inflation is caused by government-backed loans. Then ask yourself - what kind of investor in their right mind would freely lend $50k in unsecured funds to someone to study 4 years of interpretive dance?
