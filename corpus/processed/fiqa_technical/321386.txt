I understand the aggression because the logic permeates into individual income taxes and can really negatively affect lives. I mean I really essentially at some point am being forced to chose between sane financial stability or a feeling of identity of the country I am from. I hate that I'm in that position and I hate the politicians and the people that enable them even more. FATCA passed the Senate with 80 votes. It was part of a jobs bill, so GOP went against it in the House, but they still supported that position. They only changed their tune about that one just last year after allowing both parties to trample all over citizens living abroad. But there's only a few million of us and it's distributed across states, so our votes just don't matter.
