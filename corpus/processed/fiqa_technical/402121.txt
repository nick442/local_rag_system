I think this has to do with the fact that the interest is charged to your balance and grows everyday. As a result, the computer broke it down so that it can capitalize on that remaining balance. If your regular student loan payment was $500 a month at 5% interest, but your balance became $499, spreading out the $499, they can make more money off you. It might not be a lot, or in your case essentially 0, but it could be better than nothing.
