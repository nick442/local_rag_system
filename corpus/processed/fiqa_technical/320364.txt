It is how sales people's salaries are structured in a lot of industries. It is structured this way to try to motivate or offer incentive for good sales people. It is difficult to compare two completely different jobs based on salary alone, however, I would just say the market rate for their job is higher than your job. Which is why they get paid more than you even before bonuses. I look at it a different way. You get paid your rate no matter what, for them to achieve what they should be making, they need to be successful at their job. They don't have it easier, they have it harder.
