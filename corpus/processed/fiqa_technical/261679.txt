"Once upon a time I ran my own micro hedge fund for a very short time. I can't recall the term commonly used in the industry for such info, but a few individuals, including the prime brokerage firm's founder, offered information of questionable character. I refused to trade on any of it, not only because of the borderline illegality, but also because I didn't trust any of it.. seemed to be more rumor mill type nonsense than anything else. Moreover, if they already have that info, then it's already up/down.. so it then goes the reverse direction as they take profits. As is commonly said even in normal investor circles: ""buy the rumor, sell the news."""
