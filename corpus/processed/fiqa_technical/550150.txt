"> ""vegetarian foods were added to the traditional mix two years ago to address the rise in youth obesity"" There's so much misinformation about vegetarian food. Veggie burgers are often made with a lot of vegetable oil and can have the same number of calories as a burger. And if they had fries, potato chips, potato salad, etc., any of those things would contribute more to the added (mostly empty) calories of the meal than the burger. Too often people go vegetarian for ""health reasons"", and then fail to take any of the supplements they need to to make up for the nutrients they aren't getting naturally from meat. And they end up eating a bunch of carbs and food high in vegetable oil. A healthy diet, including moderate portions of meat, is more healthy than just no longer eating meat and thinking that will make you healthier."
