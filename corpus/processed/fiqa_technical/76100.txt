">> Did President Trump..then come out saying he now opposed Medicare doing so? > Yes. So he said that. Great, I wasn't sure we could find agreement there. > Did he ACT to make it so? Maybe, as usual, he's playing business chess.. That argument cuts both ways. Maybe this is part of his master plan to get Medicare Part-D to negotiate drug prices, but maybe this is part of his master plan to maximize pharmaceutical company profit. At the end of the day you have to judge a person on what he says and what he appears to do. >> Has President Trump..prepare for the upcoming problems caused by global warming? > Absolutely not! Absolutely not! I agree. > President Trump is not against any method or measure to reduce pollution or emission. [Global warming is a serious risk to this country](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/climate-security/). Given that it is President Trump's job to protect the country, a position of bring ""not against emission reductions"" doesn't cut it. Thanks for answering my questions. From your earlier replies I wasn't sure you understood how someone might see my issues as reflective of a president who is not working in the best interests of his people. Of course you can disagree but you're not going to change my mind by dismissing what I see as tests of character and asking me to provide another. > I am not happy with everything he said or do before and after the elections. That's great. Like and dislike him for your own reasons and challenge both perspectives."
