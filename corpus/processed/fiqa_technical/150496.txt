EDIT: I think it's a fairly straightforward cause & effect. You tax the transactions, it lowers the incentive to do frequent trading. So yes, I do think it would limit it effectively. I'm under no illusion that speculating will end. But I think we need to dial it back a bit so that investment is the primary driver in the market, not gambling. I'm not anti speed, but the markets serve a real purpose: They allow for liquidity & for useful capital allocation. And liquidity is nothing if all the machines are set to sell, sell, sell. This is what caused some of the crashes. Also, we had liquidity prior to all this High Frequency trading. I'm unsure that the added liquidity makes up for the cons of turning an investment engine into a gambling engine. You dont' even have to believe me. There are a few big time investors that say they are out of the market because it is no longer governed by reason.
