I recommend a Capital One 360 account. Personal experience, I'm a current undergraduate and while Capital One ATMs are everywhere and while account fees do not exist while I work, my normal Capital One bank account would be shut down, every time, over the summer. Why? Because I didn't work over the summer and I couldn't keep the minimum balance in my account. With a 360 account, I don't have to worry about paper working being mailed home when I need it at my dorm (or vice versa) and I don't have to worry about minimum balance fees closing my account (it doesn't screw my credit when that happens, but I have to open up a NEW account; frustrating). The advantages of a 360 account is that it's all online, there are no minimum balance requirements, and that I can easily access it online and even deposit checks with the Capital One app.
