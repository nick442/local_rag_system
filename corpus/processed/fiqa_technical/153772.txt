Current state of Chicago prop shops. How bad is it really? I know El Dorado closed up, Chopper got sold, and it looks like a few are on thin ice (i won't name names) but are the big boys like Jump, DRW, or Citadel doing ok? Volatility just been shit lately, hell there was more volatility in the '90s when I was a floor broker on the NYMEX.
