> creating goods and services people are willing to pay for. Let's get real here: you are using terms like 'economic rich' and 'political rich' so that you can ascribe to them whatever meaning you like. They are both perfectly cromulent phrases, but I don't see how 'value investing' == 'creating goods and services people will pay for'. I think you just like to imagine these big, strong entrepreneurs who make a buck while making the world better, and over *there* are these leeches that suck at the government teat. Things aren't that simple, and yes, the overlap is significant. Essentially, the policy-makers in America work for the rich. All this decrying of regulation? Totally misguided, which lobbyists do you think asked for that, and in some cases actually wrote the legislation for the lawmakers? It wasn't my lobbyist, and it wasn't yours, it was the lobbyist employed by the economic elites. Every regulation serves as a barrier to entry for smaller, newer competitors. For whatever historical reason, that's the case today in the USA. If we want it changed, we gotta strip political power from all economic elites. Build a wall between the two worlds that is so broad, so firm, that nobody tries to breach it.
