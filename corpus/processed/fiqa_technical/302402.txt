> You are willing to participate in an unethical act just because it is convenient to a powerful few? Wow, such a limited definition. Where do you live? I have lived in dense inner cities where eminent domain was used in extreme cases. I have seen houses ready to fall down, in which the tenants were living with black mold, but refused to move or fix it. Eminent domain was declared, and the house was levelled. The owners were paid (more than many would argue) a fair share for the house, and the neighbors no longer had a hazard living next door.
