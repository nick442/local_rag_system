Let's say Tommy has a really awesome Mom. She packs Oreos with Tommy's lunch, and every. Single. Day. You're on the school meal plan, and get that boring old doughnut or jelly from the cafeteria daily as part of your lunch plan. You would really rather have Oreos. For some reason, Tommy hates Oreos, but has a real hankering for the cafeteria dessert of the day. You seek out a mutual friend, and Alice, and tell her that you wished your mom was as awesome as Tommy's mom. Alice knows about Tommy's opposite predicament. So Alice says, why dont you pass me your cafeteria dessert every day, and ill pass you a packet of Oreos in return. Never one to turn down a sweet (pardon the pun) deal, you and Alice shake on it. Before the day is out, Alice finds Tommy and makes a similar deal with him. Ive just described a swap transaction. Two corporates, you and Tommy, seek out a swap dealer (usually a bank or broker) who makes two back to back transactions that offsets the position on the dealer's books. They collect a fee, in terms of the bid/ask spread that they quote to the corporations. If you would like to know more about the details, feel free to drop a reply. I work on swap pricing daily as part of my job and would be happy to answer.
