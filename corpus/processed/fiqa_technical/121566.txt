It doesn't hurt to pencil out the details starting with a sales projection. Doing anything without a plan increases the odds of failure. Putting it in writing creates a sharable vision. I've put together multi-page business plans (40-50 pages - very pretty). The best one I have is one page, hand written and I keep it with me practically all the time, tweeking it.
