"Your kind of missing the point of an e-ink ereader. The prices for them are getting under $100. They're cheap, specialized, portable, lightweight devices mostly made for reading reams of text without any eye strain. The pictures are going to be simple diagrams at best. Because most of the devices are those, the ebooks are going to be designed for those interfaces. E-ink readers are too low resolution and slow for anything else. I bought a nook simple touch, much better than my kindle keyboard for $80 recently for example, and they're just going to get cheaper. In a few years, I wouldn't be surprised if they were $50-$30, the e-reading equivalent of a pocket calculator. What your talking about is what is being done on the iPad. Go fiddle with one, download a few magazine/newsstand apps and see the future of books and magazines there. People are not going to want to be chained to a desk using an non-consumer priced 30"" monitor. The next step is an iPad, Kindle Fire, etc with a retina display. Publishers, or at least the companies that will replace them, are embracing it, but it takes time to develop."
