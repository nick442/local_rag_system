">he believes that Facebook’s IPO is a clear sign that capital markets are rigged against ordinary “mom and pop” retail investors. Should mom and pop be investing in IPOs in the first place? And if they are then shouldn't they be expected to read all the SEC filings just like any sophisticated market participant? I think the FB IPO sucked really badly and damaged capital markets but NOT because ""mom and pop"" didn't read all the filings."
