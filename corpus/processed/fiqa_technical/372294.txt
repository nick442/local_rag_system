>No, it's not. The bank can't just jack up prices when they've got competitors, after all. Yeah, you don't understand how this stuff works.

It took a *massive* national campaign to switch to Credit Unions and *still* only 250K people did. >Again, if the bank has even one competitor who didn't suffer as much or any damage, customers aren't just going to suck it up. Again, wrong. >I'm not remotely an anarchist No wonder you seem to be somewhat more reasonable than most of them I've spoken to. >Brute force supports the existing regime. That's basically it. And the *image* that this is legitimate is what allows them to wield force without retribution.
