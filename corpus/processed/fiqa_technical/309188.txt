Nice comment. Of course, Oracle must be blamed the most because they are professionals of those projects. It is difficult for us to know more concrete details so I would like to ask you which, at this project, poor management skill of Oracle staffs or plan of Oregon are worse to be accused. Or do you think that plan was made mainly by Oracle?
