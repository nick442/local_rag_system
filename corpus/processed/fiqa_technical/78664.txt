It's a big dance. Share price will go up or down based on a number of factors, many that have nothing to do with the company operations. If a CEO fixates on quarterly returns, that will cause long-term investors to want that CEO replaced, or to sell their shares. Unless a CEO is weak and can't explain the business to shareholders he shouldn't need to focus on quarterlies. If he does then shareholders short and long will take advantage of the bump in price to exit, thus depressing the valuation. Then new money comes in after CEO is replaced.
