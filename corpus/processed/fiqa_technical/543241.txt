"I'm interning at a boutique firm that doesn't have an established or structured program. Frankly it often seems like they don't knows what to do with me. It feels like traders have lot to do, but they don't want to hand any of it off to the intern eager to do their menial stuff. I don't even know what their menial stuff is. It's a Catch-22: Can't learn without doing, can't do without being taught. What should I be doing? How often should I be going around asking ""What do you need me to do?"" without it getting annoying?"
