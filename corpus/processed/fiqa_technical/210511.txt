No, to follow up on your example First Direct won't care (and I suspect won't even know) how long you held the account you are switching to them so if you don't want to switch your main current account to them you can just open a new one and switch that. To get the bonus you just need to make sure you meet the requirements imposed which in First Direct's case seem to simply be: have not held a First Direct account before pay in at least Â£1000 within 3 months of opening the account Once the First Direct bonus is paid, which they say should be within 28 days of you meeting the criteria, it is yours to keep. You are then free to close the First Direct account or transfer it on to another bank (and potentially claim another switching bonus).
