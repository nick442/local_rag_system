YES I have been there as a kid on field trips. I still have nostalgia just thinking of all the good times I had back in the 90s at Sea World. Shamu was my favorite animal, me and my mom got wet from the show and its one of the best memories I have as a kid. I still have the souvenirs somewhere in my garage.
