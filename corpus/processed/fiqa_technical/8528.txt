I used to do the opposite when I needed to rent a car locally. I would request the bottom of the line and tell them that I will pick up at one of our expensive resorts. They never had any Kia Sorentos, but they had nice Lincolns and other high end vehicles for Kia prices. I'm sorry, we don't have the Ford Escort you reserved, so I'll give you a Towncar for the Escort price.
