"> Haha, aside from the fact that consensually choosing which career path you would like to go down is not at all akin to slavery and severely diminishes what actual slaves went (and in some places still go) through, even if your premise was right, your supposition is still wrong. When you only other choice is OR DIE, it's pretty much slavery. Getting to choose your master, oh I'm sorry, ""career path"" is just mincing words. You have no choice but to work for somebody to sustain yourself. You can't leave society and go your own way; All land is owned in some form or another and to do so is illegal. ergo, you have no real choices and you are beholden to a system with the *illusion* of freedom. But you are anything but free. Look up the term wage slavery. Honestly, old time slaves may have actually had it better than what we have today. At least the master was obligated to take care of his slaves and provide food, shelter, and medical care as his slaves were his investment in labor. Today, the slaves have to fend for themselves. They need to purchase housing, education (modern day slaves have to secure their own training before they can become adequate servants), and healthcare. The masters sure have it good these days, they don't even have to put forth any of the effort their predecessors did. And the best part? They can just dump them whenever they see fit. Let the servants worry about their own upkeep! After all, there is always a nice surplus of fresh up and coming laborers! >People on the corner begging for money make a pretty decent amount of money with no employer. Certainly more than I make. *citation Needed*"
