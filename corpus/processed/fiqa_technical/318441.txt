Can't be true. I read r/economy and I know **real** inflation is 15%, **real** unemployment is 25%, we're in a double-dip recession, a second tsunami of mortgage foreclosure is coming, hundreds of cities are going to default on their bonds, and .. And we're all going to die on the side of the road. Alone. In the rain. Edit: [See](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/2dm13e/job_surge_suggests_higher_wages_are_coming/cjr00wh)? And this guy is an optimist.
