"Take your idiotic treating all crimes as eqivalent and cram it :) You seem to think everyone here must either 100% buy Taibbi style bulshit or they must think crimes are not crime. Your black and white view of the situation where you make strawmen of others nuanced views makes you look like a childish idiot, and I suspect you do not really want to look that way. It is very important to accurately measure crimes, to avoid wasting scarce resources when fighting crime. Promoting poor reporting as ""it's all ok because it was similar to reality"" is intellectually dishonest and poor policy."
