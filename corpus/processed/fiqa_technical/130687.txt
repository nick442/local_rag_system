His 'brand' is exactly the point of my original post, not so much his career as a cyclist. His name is tarnished, but to what extent? Consequently, for marketing purposes, I think a discussion of exactly how much does it matter? Yes he has been defamed, but he is still recognizable. How much is his 'brand' worth. For Example, back in '08, it was very clear that many large banks were involved from the top down in screwing millions of Americans out of billions of dollars in assets, and equity. These banks gained a bad reputation because of this, but very very few of the large ones have gone away. Yes the value of their brand has diminished, but clearly not disappeared.
