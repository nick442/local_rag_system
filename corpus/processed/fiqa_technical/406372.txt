Sooner or later though, don't you think Janet Yellen will decide to raise the rates? I think its becoming a bit too ridiculous at this stage. If we keep the rates as low as they currently are, don't you think we're putting ourselves at risk for another recession, assuming that a large proportion of home buyers today are buying with mortgages (not paying full amounts), and using borrowed money? After all, folks who use borrowed money to put down a mortgage are very likely to default.
