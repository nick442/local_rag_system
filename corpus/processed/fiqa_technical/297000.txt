You've admitted to taking entertainment and comedy as legitimate sources of information in a presidential election, dude. Whatever your choice is during an election, its a serious one with real consequences. You complained earlier about not liking the choices in the election, well where was your ass during the primary?!?! I'll tell you where mine was -- in a fucking voting booth, voting for Ted Cruz.
