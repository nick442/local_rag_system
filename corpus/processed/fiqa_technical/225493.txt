Yes, I grew up about 20 minutes away and visit often - I know. Bankrupt casinos are a pretty normal thing for AC. This isn't 1980, when AC was one of VERY few gambling options east of Vegas. Now they have New Yorkers going to Connecticut for Mohegan or Foxwood, Sugarhouse or Delaware Park for people in Philly.. and flights to Vegas are faster, easier and cheaper than ever. Yes, I know AC is hurting. The problem is those NYC-area and Philly-area casinos which steal away customers. AC just needs to scale back the casino focus, a nice 3-4 on the boardwalk could survive easily - I think Revel will be one of them. But Showboat and Plaza are closing at the end of summer.. and more of the older ones are sure to follow. Once those are closed and demolished, replaced by some nice beach condos.. I think AC can turn it around. It's just going to take time. Revel can survive, but the big money / big casino era for AC is over.
