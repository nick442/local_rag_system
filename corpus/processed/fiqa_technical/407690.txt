In Canada, internships aren't as popular. We have co-op work terms during alternating semesters. When I was a coop student, I got about $15-20 per hour, and that was 2005-2007. Coop students at my current job make about $20-30 depending on their degree and year. That aside, I had a bad sales experience in one of my work terms. Basically exactly the same, cold calls all day, and if I got a lead, I would go to their office and present the plan. I hated it. I slugged it out, got a mediocre review, but my next work term I did really well and thus began my slightly different career in supply chain mgmt. I still miss finance, and i build family members and friends their investment portfolios. One day I'll start my own consulting business, maybe do it on the side.
