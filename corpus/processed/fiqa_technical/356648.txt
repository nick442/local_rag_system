"I strongly suspect avoutthere meant physically overweight. It's a very common belief that poor people are more likely to be overweight. And while that claim is heavily disputed statistically, the inverse claim (that the poor are *less* likely to be overweight) does not seem to have any support. So if you'd accept the claim ""Americans are fat"", you'd also have to accept the claim ""American poor people are fat"", even if they're not *more* likely to be obese."
