"I dunno, I had a similar experience when I bought my iPad. I used it for a couple hours (first use bliss), then when I went back to my iPhone I was like, ""*Is this a joke??*"" The screen looked so pathetically small. But now, a week in, I appreciate both screen sizes. They're for different purposes, and the sleek compactness of my iPhone is just as important as the flexibility of a big screen on my iPad."
