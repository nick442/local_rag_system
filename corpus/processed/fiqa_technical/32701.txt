Ive been that guy a few times. was this close to launching their computer across the room. they said vehicle B was equivalent to vehicle A and yet they also said that vehicle C which was made by the same company as B was somehow also equivalent as if Toyota or whoever made more than one vehicle in a given class. Equivalent my ass! I went on another trip with a large group of friends and they all took the rental place in the airport. The wife and I took the shuttle to one off campus because I was thinking about buying a mustang and they had them so I wanted to drive it around for the week to see how I fit. Thats the only reason I went to that place. I motherfucked the hell out of that asshole and the other cunt and still got nowhere. Hopefully those motherfuckers crashed their cars into a goddamn bridge on the way home. I hate the fucking lying.
