That makes no sense. Such a person would realistically only need catastrophic health insurance, which one could buy in the 70's for about the cost daily of a pack of cigarettes. Today that'd be about maybe what, $120/month? That sounds about right for the risk involved. Something doesn't add up here then, why can't insurance companies offer such a plan anymore? *Not sure why I'm being down voted? I even provided a link below? Did I offend someone's sensibilities?
