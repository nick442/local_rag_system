I think you're doing the right thing. One of the benefits of tax-deferred account, aside of it being tax-deferred, is that it keeps the money locked from you. Some people think it's a bad thing, I think it's a good thing. The amount of money locked is not that significant relatively to your income (10% in your case, which is a lot relatively to others of your age, and shows that you think ahead and plan for your future), but it builds up a cushion to fall to when you're old. Many people don't think of the time they're old, or think they'll be the same or better (income-wise) as they're now. That is not so. Although during the period of your life your marginal tax will indeed grow, in the end it goes back down again for most of the people, and that is because your income goes down. It is then that you need the money you're putting aside now, and the more you put aside, and the earlier you put it aside - the more you will have then. The fact that it's locked promises that you will have it then, not before when you want to buy a house you can't afford or impress a girl with a car you can't pay for. In my mind that's the best benefit, and the fact that the earlier you start putting the money there, the more gains it will acquire until you actually need it. So keep up the good work, and save for your future, lock out that 10%, and invest the rest in other channels which may be more risky and with more potential gains.
