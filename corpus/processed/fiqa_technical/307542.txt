Nah, what you're seeing is pretty representative of subreddit. And I agree with you that it's a shame. I think about business ethics a lot to the point where I got my MBA in Sustainable Business and I firmly believe that the only way to understand how to bring about positive change is to understand the goals and strategies of an organization, and the barriers or reasons they may not want or even can't change to be more of a positive part of society. Most people are satisfied imagining businesses as a sentient evil, mustache twirling villain because understanding businesses as a complex organization is too abstract to bother participating in. Take supply chains for example. Many users would rather believe that a CEO is giving his thumbs up to employ child-slave labor so he can pay for a bigger yacht than understand the reality that supply chains are incredibly deep and complex networks that is hard to really track. All people really care about is farming karma repeating whatever John Oliver says on TV and then congratulating themselves for participating in the improvement of society because they got mad about something. It's painfully sophomoric and I don't even bother posting my thoughts anymore because 9 times out of 10, playing devil's advocate devolves into someone accusing me of being a corporate shill. I actually do a much better job reaching out to people in larger subreddits like AskReddit, because people on there aren't automatically anti-business like here. Also, I don't follow it closely, but there do seem to be more supportive subreddits out there for small business ownership and management.
