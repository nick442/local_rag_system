"Nothing can be done? Well, in the past the courts were the mechanism by which something was done and that something was called ""consent decree"" where the court would simply order the monopolistic practices to stop immediately or the offenders could instead pay for instance a million dollar per day fine until they came into compliance. Xerox, for instance, only opened the specs of what we now call the PC under a court ordered consent decree. This nationwide system of trust busting was dismantled under Reagan with the creation of the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit (CAFC) which was created out of nothing in order to strengthen so-called intellectual property rights. The term ""intellectual property"" in turn had been crafted by a group of patent lawyers decades earlier in order to promote monopolistic practices. Things could go back to the way they were with a major shakeup of the court system but as in the 30s it will probably take a sustained economic depression and complete collapse of the stock market to make that happen. With mechanisms like the 401K which also emerged in the Reagan era that becomes more and more difficult to achieve without enormous suffering and loss of wealth by typical households."
