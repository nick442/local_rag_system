I think living in a city where you can't take care of yourself. Has led many people to become unable of ever taking care of themselves. I personally would be happy with a few acres of land a house and some solar. But what makes me happy doesn't make other's happy. So I wont even try to force my opinion of what is good in life on them. The only thing stopping me from living my dream and being left alone is you and your taxes. Which no matter how self sufficient I am and how little I need or want the rest of society. I will always be a slave to paying those taxes so your life can be easier and my life can be harder. Take from those who want to share your dream and leave the rest of us alone. You don't think about that, though, do you? Edit..[What do you want?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGHfaYY_1jk)
