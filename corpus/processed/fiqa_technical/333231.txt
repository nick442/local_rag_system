I don't think that it's a given that Facebook can't continue to make money. I rarely quick at ads on Reddit either, but I do assume that they make some kind of money. The income from Zynga etc. probably aren't sustainable either, but that doen't mean that it will disappear completely. But neither is it unimaginable that the attempt to become sufficiently profitable to sustain the current shareprice will backfire and kill the company.
