"I don't have disdain for startups, I have disdain for charlatans. And I feel sad for people who believe that they really have a chance with their social network for dogs / ideal roommate to-do app / tip calculator / new marketplace to revolutionize how x and y find each other / etc -- a belief fostered by the totally dysfunctional startup tabloid media. And I'm pissed watching people who piss away years of their life on ""great ideas"" which could never in a million years be a self-sustaining business, and then shrug it away as if that ""failure"" couldn't have been spotted ahead of time, a mile and years away. They wouldn't have thought that would ever be more than a fun hobby or a nice little daydream if it weren't for the tabloids. As for something ""more likely"" it's quite simple -- people need to decide if they want to ""grow big or go home,"" or if they want to create a business. A business creates value and charges for things. That is what I mean by ""more likely."" The suits in the boardroom at Wal-Mart don't sit around wringing their hands wondering what their business model is, wondering how they can ""monetize."""
