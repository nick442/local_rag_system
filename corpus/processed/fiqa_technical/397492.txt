It sort of depends on what happens in the future. If the economy eventually comes back and the old norm returns, then it will certainly be Gen X who lost out the most, because as Badwolf stated, this is the time Gen X'ers should be taking the period the Millenials are in right now, and using it to maximize their wealth. That's a 10-20 year period, and so far from 2008-2012 it's been vaporized. That's up to 1/4 of their maximization period gone, and they can never really get that back. Millenials still have time. On the flip side, if the economy DOESN'T return, then Millenials will be in a lot of trouble, what with the college debt they've incurred and no means of ever really finding a career. However, if that ends up being the case, I think we're going to all be in a lot of trouble anyway, so probably the Millenials' problems will end up paling in comparison to whatever else presents itself.
