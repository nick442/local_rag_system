How is Bitcoin silly at all? I don't understand. Not all cryptocurrency supporters are against regulation. I want regulated cryptocurrencies. The people who are going to lose here are the ones who invested in 'bad' ICOs. This isn't the first time ICOs have contributed to the fall of the crypto market. Months ago the crowds were screaming the end of crypto with the crash in June. Looking at it now it seems very small. Even with 20% loss the last few days we are still above our previous crash. And what do you mean the west? We are not the only people developing, contributing, investing, and using crypto. Let's not forget Estonia, Mauritius, Denmark, South Korea.. and there's more.
