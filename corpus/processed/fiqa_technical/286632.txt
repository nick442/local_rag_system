Yes. Borrowing more against your home means you will pay more interest for your home. Specifically: Does this increase the amount of interest on my home loan by $144.56 per month to start with? Yes, that is exactly what it means. As to whether or not that is a good use of the money, I can't say. You're making various assumptions here.. They could be accurate or, if this is your first rental home, they could be wildly optimistic (100% occupancy rate? that won't last). Additionally, houses are physical goods which depreciate. Put another way, they fall apart, and you (as the owner) are responsible for fixing it. You have the basic idea right, I just think you should plan for a worst-case scenario, and it looks like you're planning for the best.
