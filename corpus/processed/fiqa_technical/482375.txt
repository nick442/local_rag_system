"You make a good point and then abandon it. I agree, everything is ultimately attributable to random events or one's genetics and upbringing. E.g. The worse baker 'deserves' to fail because they are worse at baking. However, did they 'deserve' to be born and raised and grow into circumstances that caused them to be a worse baker? Very hard to argue that. Very hard. I also don't think it's suitable to ignore the ""infinite"" (in most cases you don't need to trace a person's history beyond their parentage to explain something, so 'infinite' is hardly the word) regression you mention. A person's decisions are the result of their life story up until that point, and a person's life story always begins with circumstances completely beyond their control."
