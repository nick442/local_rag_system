"I agree. Presidents (and Congress) have very little control over the economy. And the economy plays a much larger role in year-over-year deficit changes than does appropriations. People should stop talking about whose in office when such a thing happens and relate it to the event itself. OP should have ended the headline with ""a 70 percent decline from the height of the Great Recession"" instead of attributing to the current President."
