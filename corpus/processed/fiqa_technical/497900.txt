"Oh please, don't be one of those hipsters pining for the good old days. Great games get released all the time, even in this ""modern era."" It's just that at this point in the year there are no high-quality popular games being released, and we are also caught in a transition point between consoles. Developers are getting used to new game engines (or building their own) which takes time. The first year of a console's lifespan is usually just a few half-decent launch games and a bunch of ports from the previous gen; nothing that really takes advantage of the capabilities of more modern hardware. And as mentioned below, this doesn't take into account digital distribution, which is becoming more popular every year."
