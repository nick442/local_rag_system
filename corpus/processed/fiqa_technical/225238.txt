I'm not sure if English is your first language or not, but I can't even understand what the hell you are trying to say. If it's not, I'm not trying to be an ass, but can you try to rephrase your point? If it is, Jesus Christ learn some grammar. It doesn't have to be perfect but at least make your point clear.
