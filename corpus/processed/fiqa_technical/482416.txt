"This is ridiculous. Baltimore has dangerous fringes, but even there the ""danger"" is highly inflated. The reality is that huge parts of central Baltimore are incredibly safe, prosperous, and cosmopolitan. Mount Vernon, Fells Point, Canton, Federal Hill, Inner Harbor, etc. are all wonderful places to live and work. Baltimore also has numerous beautiful suburbs that are no more dangerous than the safest parts of Boston or any other city. Politicians and the media love to play up The Wire version of Baltimore, but the reality is just as much a fiction as the television show."
