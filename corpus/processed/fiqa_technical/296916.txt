Holy fuck how do you not understand that the government is responsible for the tax code, and all the changes to the tax code, and therefore wholly responsible for incorporating any changes that corporations ask for? Goddamn you have to be retarded to try to exonerate the government and blame corporations for something corporations have no power over.
