"For those on a budget, check if your local library has access to / or a copy of the ""Standard & Poor's Daily Stock Price Record"". Access to that or a similar service may be available as part of your library patronage. If not available it may be available at your metropolitan central library. Comprehensive stock pricing data which provides adjustments for splits, mergers, capital distributions and other relevant events is still a premium product.
