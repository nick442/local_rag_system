"I'm not racist immediately followed by ""all Muslims do this"". It's not even true! Just like it's not true that all Christians follow the Bible to the T. In fact, almost NO Christians stone gays and beat their wives. What's the difference? One of those groups looks like you, and the other does not. You're a racist. You may not have bad intent with it, but the words you're saying ABSOLUTELY ARE racist. The fact that you can't even understand how it could be taken as racist is telling. The part I don't get is why you think 0.001% of a population represents the remaining 99.999%. If you could explain that disconnect to me, then maybe I would understand your backwards views a little more. Until then, kindly stop spouting your ignorant garbage. Thanks."
