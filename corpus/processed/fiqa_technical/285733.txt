I think you're right. In fact, I think we could plot such a chart in a matter of minutes. Now then, how about some more nuanced variables? major/ concentration, finished vs not finished degree, etc. I'm sure we agree that education is great on the whole. Just saying, if the government is going to tax and borrow to pay for someone's education, which is where I think you get this notion of 'cheap' or 'free' education, I want it to have utility and not leave us with a class of debtors with obsolete, saturated, or just plain useless job skills.
