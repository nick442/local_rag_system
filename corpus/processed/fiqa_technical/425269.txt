">You call me ""naïve"" for being concerned for my fellow man? How is that ""naïve""? Being concerned for people isn't naive, it is naive to think slightly above minimum wage retail employees ever had a fighting chance. Unskilled/uneducated workers are always the first to go. >It simply makes me sad that all these humans will suffer. But honestly, retail employees are at the lowest rungs of these issues and obviously the most at risk and always have been. McDonalds would be hurting too if not for fast food being cheaper than whole food and America's addictiong to cheap fast food in large quantities. >That doesn't make me naïve - that makes me a decent human being. You are naive to think these people ever had a chance to begin with. Their jobs depend on retail profitability which has been steady and now quickly declining. What do you suggest? Welfare? Unemployment doles? Will that make society better off? >The fact that you are willing to call me names simply because I express concern for these people speaks for itself. The fact that I've been downvoted heavily for saying it speaks badly of the compassion of the people reading this subreddit. Naive isnt a particularly nasty name, but perhaps I should call you gullible. It isnt about compassion as much as ignorance to the facts of life. America used to be about limitless profit so bad business models survive. But when your business model is based on zero sum profitability in an evolving retail world where Sears has NOT been an innovator and has instead lost marketshare to more innovative companies. It is naive and gullible to think the Sears' employees ever had a chance. The good news is a $9/hr job is easier to find than a $100,000/year job. These Sears employees can go work at Khols or Panera Bread for very little loss in income."
