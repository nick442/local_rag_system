"> The main reason you see so many people in first class is because they earn miles for themselves Yup. My private company allows us to use our own milage accounts when booking company travel, so we earn the miles. I also make heavy use of my Chase sapphire card, that has a 1:1 transfer between card-miles and most airline programs' miles. While I don't travel _often_ for my job, I'm usually on a plane every couple months, at least, and most of the time, I can upgrade to first/business, or at least the ""special cattle"" rows of coach on my own dime (or miles)."
