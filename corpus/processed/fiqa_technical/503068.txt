IMO ebooks really only seem to work in the simplest of cases. I have made several attempts to read several non-fiction e-books and in each case have failed miserably. I think the problem is design related more than anything. An ebook try to copy the form of a book w/o adequately copying the form of the book. So either (1) design ebooks in terms of what they will be read with or (2) design eReaders to be more like books. For example, foot notes that appear on the bottom of the page are always a mess on any eReader. Solution (1) means making a footnote be more like a pop-up. Method (2) means making a format the can accurately (and logically) display footnotes.
