Eh that's what I thought. Makes sense given how much mail they probably receive and how busy they are. Just looking for new ways to network with people at that level, considering I knew emails were filtered. Someone high up at an investment bank I know said he gets a lot of emails that get unread/deleted, but he opens all his own mail so it's a good way to get someone's attention. Wasn't sure if it was applicable at this level, guess not. That's quite a bit of walls to get through to reach someone haha. What would you recommend to reach these types for business networking?
