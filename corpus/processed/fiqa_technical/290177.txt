Always fun to revisit old comments. I do not reside on the right and have never voted for a Republican candidate. Your idea is monumentally stupid. It rewards those who willfully disregarded America's legal system and subsequently punishes those that respected it. America should not reward the immoral, regardless of the color they may happen to be. Non-citizens who see themselves as above the law should be punished and sent home. The polite thing to do next would be to allow them to wait in line like everyone else. The harsh thing would be to make a note of their hubris and ban them from ever applying.
