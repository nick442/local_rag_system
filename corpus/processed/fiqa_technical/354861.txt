Didnt I just say I am not going to cite? Not all of us get paid to astroturf on the intertubes during the day ;) EDIT: discussions usually contain links to studies. Or petitions signed by over 100 of scientists. Including Nobel-caliber ones. Hold on to your opinion until you run into undeniable scientific facts. They come up so frequently that you will run into them eventually. And I will save my valuable time.
