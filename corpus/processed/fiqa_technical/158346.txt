WIX does allow for image alt text. I have a few. Pretty sure you're right it doesn't allow for HTTPs, especially when I try to add widgets. It never works. I'm not sure what robots.txt or canonicals are. I'll have to look that up. I'm using WIX's SEO tools and have listed my website on around 10 directories, as well as Google Adwords which I'm setting up right now (but I'd like to not have to pay for ads and base mostly off SEO, which was kind of the starting issue here.) My main products are chokers.
