Oh, thank god. They can just print their way out! That will solve all their economic problems! Oh wait. That would just cause basic food and energy costs to skyrocket while destroying savings even more. Sure, maybe exporters would get a boon, but Japan kind of has to import a lot too. All printing money would do is make 5% of the people richer while making 95% of them poorer.
