High ROI and high barriers to entry are rare to find existing together at the same time in the same market. More commonly, you have high margins/ROI in early markets, but high barriers to entry are more common in mature markets. The most common places to find high ROI and barriers to entry is when there is something *proprietary* involved. This is why the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields are so valuable. Industries related to these fields have an edge because they are the most likely fields to create something proprietary. When something proprietary is also in high demand, you have a barrier to entry and also a potential to create high margins (which in turn will be high ROI). Some people have mentioned medical devices, which are an excellent example. There are only a handful of companies that have went to the lengths of development to create the Swan Ganz catheter, for example (an essential tool used in cardiac surgeries). With little competition and high demand, companies that manufacture Swan Ganz catheters can put healthy margins on the product without worry. TL;DR: The best way to find something high ROI that also has barriers to entry is to specialize towards something proprietary that cannot be imitated or replaced, but is also in high demand.
