> I think you know it is not really that simple. Does the police force teach civilians to ignore lawbreakers? Yes it does. >Does public education cause people to only learn what is taught in schools? For the vast majority of people, they do not learn anything outside the classroom. >Do people not learn CPR because 911 exists? I wonder how many people learn CPR of their own volition. I learned it in high school gym class, but not on my own. > If people don't have the skills to manage their lives and hold down a job, wouldn't forcing them into a job guarantee failure? You are confusing Unemployment Insurance with Welfare. >Would you agree they would need to first learn these skills and that probably wouldn't happen in an unstable environment? I agree.
