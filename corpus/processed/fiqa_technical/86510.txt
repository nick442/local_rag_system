Thanks for the input. My background is pretty unconventional. Worked for a bank for 6 years then got a BBA Finance about 3 years ago. Just walked into my current boss' office one day, introduced myself and said I was looking for a job. He's an independent advisor with about 30 high-net-worth clients and +/- $90M in AUM. Made me partner with a 5% annual stake in the firm. Most of our clients are 65-70 so it'd be in my best interest to sign 'younger' clients. Our minimum account size is $250k as it wouldn't make economic sense to our clients to open an account with less (since we charge a minimum quarterly amount of $2,500). The guy at Merrill said that he just paid a one-time fee for basically a list of prospects. Categorized by their occupation and reported annual salary. Really appreciate any help/direction you may have.
