> A service provider that prevents competition by making it illegal to compete. I don't know what you mean. There is a lot of competition. * At least every two years you can replace a majority of the decision makers. * You are perfectly free to get services from another provider like private roads or charter schools. * you are free to move to another city/county/state which has enacted laws you like. * you are also free to immigrate outside the US if the Federal Government is the issue. > Every other insurance program allows you to opt out. You can opt-out any time you like! I think your objection is that you have to forgo the product that is America to opt-out of the American government service provider. Do you know of any company that will give you services for free and not exploit you?
