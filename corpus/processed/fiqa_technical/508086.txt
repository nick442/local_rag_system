"They're not necessarily *assigning the risk* outright, because it's just an option. If a company makes a certain product there's often some forethought put in to spare parts from the outset. It's not exactly a huge risk for a company to order knobs in a lot of 15,000 and keep 500 as spares. What *is* way cooler is the possibility of a company not having to make a physical product at *all*, but simply providing designs to the customers once a certain limit of buyers has been reached, somewhat like a kickstarter campaign. The article talked about this briefly, but I think that's where the real revolution will happen. Neal Stephenson touches on this in ""The Diamond Age"", I believe, in which 3D printers are vending-machine-type boxes in every street-corner 7-11. You purchase a product that's made on the spot, no matter what it is."
