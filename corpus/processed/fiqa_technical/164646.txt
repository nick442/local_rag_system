So what you're saying is if the janitor got a degree in a lesser paying field, he should be entitled to that 100k as a janitor. Ok. Just because you went to college doesn't mean your job takes more skill, or is harder. My ex also has a brother who didn't go to college and got a bomb ass job at EA games as a programmer. I guess he deserves minimum wage.
