Got it, thanks, just a few more quick questions What's the appropriate color for an interview suit? Is a black suit a no-go? I had another interview a few days ago and wore a black suit with black chinos (maybe this is a no-go) but saw everyone else had gray suits on. How much to spend for a suit? 300-400?
