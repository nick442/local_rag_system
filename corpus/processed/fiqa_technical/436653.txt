"The quant score is definitely one of the major factors, and you are correct it is more important if you don't have a math background. I don't think it's a non starter if you apply to some of the lower level or mid-major programs though (read : below top 50/75 ish). That's why part of my advice entails doing the masters and taking as many auxiliary math courses as possible, to boost your ""math background"". It worked for me anyway."
