It looks like your Solo 401K loan will need to repaid in 5 years. If you borrow too much in order to pay back in this time you run into the typical 401K loan risks, that it is considered a distribution. Don't borrow more then can be repaid in that time. When you borrow money from your 401K, it is no longer invested in the market. Lets assume that you are borrowing at 6% or so, and your LOC is at 3.5%, and the mutual funds you are invested in are returning 9%. You would be better off with the LOC. As you are paying 3.5% but earning 9%. Keep in mind with a LOC that is variable you have interest rate risk, where you don't really have that with the 401K loan. I think the 401K loan is riskier then you are allowing. If you do not pay it back within the allotted time, you get nailed for 40% of the unpaid balance. That is quite high. With the HELOC, you can weather quite a few negative credit events without your home ever being in jeopardy.
