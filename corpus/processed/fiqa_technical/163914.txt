Hardly. Minimum wage is designed so people are not slaves. Rent for a 3 bedroom around my area went from $900 to $1250 in the past 3 years.. minimum wage went up a few cents. Your unskilled labor isn't worth less than being able to afford a home. Medical billing pays $19 an hour.. hardly skilled practice there. pretty sure a cashier being able to ring you out in a timely fashion and help bring Walmart 400b in revenue a year is worth more than living in a tent or 15 people in your home.
