>Now introduce chance by randomly assigning each participant a “luck” score. That score, however, can play only a tiny role in the ultimate outcome, just 2 percent compared with 98 percent allotted to skill. This minor role for chance is enough to tilt the contest away from the top-skilled people. In a simulation with 1,000 participants, the person with the top skill score prevailed only 22 percent of the time. The more competition there is, the hardest it is for skill alone to win out. With 100,000 participants, the most skilled person wins just 6 percent of the time. http://www.bloomberg.om/news/articles/2016-09-01/why-luck-plays-a-big-role-in-making-you-rich https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2006/04/26/1917/understanding-mobility-in-america/ >Children from low-income families have only a 1 percent chance of reaching the top 5 percent of the income distribution, versus children of the rich who have about a 22 percent chance. -- Children born to the middle quintile of parental family income ($42,000 to $54,300) had about the same chance of ending up in a lower quintile than their parents (39.5 percent) as they did of moving to a higher quintile (36.5 percent). Their chances of attaining the top five percentiles of the income distribution were just 1.8 percent. Further, children born into the bottom quintile of income have a 42% chance of remaining there and only a 6% chance of making it to the top quintile. For those born in the top quintile it's exactly the opposite: 42 percent remain in the top quintile as adults, and only 6 percent fall down to the lowest income bracket.
