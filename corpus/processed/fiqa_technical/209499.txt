Ten year auto loans. Think about that for a moment. I paid off my house in 13 years and people are having problems paying off a car in 6, 8 or 10 years. I never buy new and then drive them until they fall apart. My sister buys new every four years. In the past twenty years, she has paid at least $100,000 in autos. I know it is actually a lot more since one of her SUVs cost $35k, but I was going for the easy math for illustrative purposes. I bought two used vehicles for a total of $14,000. People ask how I was able to pay off my house and buy rental properties.
