Look I agree with you in theory. In practice, it is quite different. The fact that there is way more educated people than is even remotely necessary. The extreme vast majority of jobs out there DO NOT even require actual ability to get a diploma, let alone a degree. Think about your daily life: with whom do you actually deal with that requires much of an education? Few people are going to pay more to their barista, retail sales or car detailer because they have an advanced degree. Everybody having a college degree drives the value down for everybody..which is exactly what is happening. Things need to be turned on their head. I propose that Colleges need to receive their income as a percentage of the first 10-15 years of income from their students. It will cut down on bogus baloney degrees, concentrate on valuable students (even those with questionable academics like Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison) and concentrate on degrees with high future value. However, when you get 2500 applications for a lower-end job, I would immediately take it down to those with a degree because it's easy and nobody will second guess you.
