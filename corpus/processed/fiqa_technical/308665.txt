"You can wire the money to the university. If your friend is a registered student, then they will have an account at the school. Contact the school directly and ask for the ""bursar's office"" (assuming it is an English speaking school). The bursar will tell you how to wire the money so that it reaches the proper account. Normally, you will wire to a general university account at a bank and the memo on the wire will include the student's account number. Your friend can wire money to your account at your bank. Go to your bank and ask them for the procedure. By the way, there is a 90% chance your ""friend"" will not pay you back."
