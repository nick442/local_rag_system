"Two things that will help..keep in mind it takes a long time to build up a client base but things will help..a LOT! First, join the local property management professional groups and make friends with all the regional property managers in your area. They are usually the deciders when it comes to hiring vendors. Second, get a bunch of water-proof stickers and magnets made with your contact info..when you repair a plumbing stack, clear a drain, install a water heater, slap on of these bad boys on it. Have it say something like, ""Installed with pride by XXXXXXX, if you need any other work done, please let us know."" When the heater fails or the line is clogged most home owners will look at it (the water heater) and then wonder who to call for a repair..and you just gave them the answer before they had to break out the proverbial phone book."
