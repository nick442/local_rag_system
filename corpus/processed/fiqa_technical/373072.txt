Get a lawyer. I've incorporated in Alberta without one which was fine because I'm the only employee and it's pretty simple. If you're hiring someone and especially since you have a business partner, spend the money and get a lawyer. They can help with proper contracts and stuff too. Also, consider an accountant as well. Lots of papers to keep organized and taxes aren't always simple. Best of luck!!
