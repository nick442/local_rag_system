"Right here is a huge difference between Obama being IMO a great president and Trump being a ineffectual. The ACA took a year to pass. Obama personally was involved in details, he had a printed copy he took around made notes on various passages. Talked to senators and worked out compromises. He got it passed though hard work and attention to detail. This was his achievement much more that ""congress"". Under bill Clinton the same effort failed. Trump sits in his ivory tower and basically said he would sign ANYTHING put in front of him. Just let that sink in. This president didn't care what was in the bill. He wasn't in the details. He didn't help get it through congress. He didn't lead in any way."
