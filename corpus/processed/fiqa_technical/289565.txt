Sorry.. I'm a software engineer not an academic. My assumption is that you can measure things like average throughput on a checkout line, or number of widgets assembled on an assembly line (and possibly the defect rate of those widgets), or pounds of fries dumped in the trash because they got cold before being served relative to fries served. Is this not the case? In my field we measure things like the change in average time to launch, or the revenue impact of features, or the change in performance metrics, etc. They're all proxy measurements though. Poor performers are generally much easier to spot than high performers. Mediocre performers can generally get through things, but may not earn promotions etc.
