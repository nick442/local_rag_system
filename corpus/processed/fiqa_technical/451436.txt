It pretty much comes down to where you interview and what you are trying to do. Finance is something that you learn. While yes, you can major in it (I did), it is really about how clever you are. You need to be creative in the way you perceive the problems that come at you. Since you seem to be quantitative in nature, you should be fine. When a hiring manager reads your resume he/she will see that. They are probably tired of hearing interviewees drone on about how they would buy this vanilla stock because of a PE ratio or a solid balance sheet. Everyone is the same. If you can stand out, you can probably get a job wherever you want to within the realm of finance (with some minor exceptions). Odds are if you work at BB I-bank you will be trained in any sort of finance they deem necessary for you to be aware of. Know some basic stuff. If you major in mathematics or stats or what-have you, you must be intelligent. Buy a few novels. The Quants, FIASCO, The Big Short, Liars Poker, Black Swan, Boomerang, A Random Walk Down Wall Street. These will expose you to the ethos of a typical wall streeter. You will also learn a few things about major events of the past and what is going on in the present. Over all: Math is key. Know some programming (R, python, maybe perl). VBA is whack. Know your Excel (no mouse!) Programming is a huge skill set that will set you apart from kids who were involved in random clubs. If you have a skill you are more valuable to a company compared to someone with a supposed knowledge of a subject matter. When I came out of school I knew my academics, but never had applied any of it to a real world problem. Your resume is not about what you have learned in the past, it is all about demonstrating what you are capable of learning. If you can show that you are intelligent and a go-getter from your resume, you will do fine no matter what you studied. Best of luck!
