IMO it's evident that these Uber investors just want Kalanick to go away. IDK if all of the investors feel the same way . if I were an investor, I would want Kalanick to continue to assist the company with strategic direction (so long as he can stay in his lane and avoid being a source of court intrigue). The concept of using a mobile app to request car service seems obvious in hind sight. It's easy to forget how rapidly Uber devoured an entire industry in < 5 years . and that was largely based on Kalanick's vision.
