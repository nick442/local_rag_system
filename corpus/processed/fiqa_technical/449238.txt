Exactly. This is ridiculous for him to blame his poor management on a man that has very little to do with his taxes. He should be blaming Congress, if anyone. That being said, it's all just bullshit anyways. Just like if Romney is elected, the Universal Health Care Act won't disappear, etc etc. It's all pandering; if elected, they'll both stay as center as possible to keep polls positive.
