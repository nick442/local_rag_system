"#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; [**Gini coefficient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini%20coefficient): [](#sfw) --- >The __Gini coefficient__ (also known as the __Gini index__ or __Gini ratio__) (/dʒini/) is a [measure of statistical dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion#Measures_of_statistical_dispersion) intended to represent the income distribution of a nation's residents. This is the most commonly used measure of inequality. The coefficient varies between 0, which reflects complete equality and 100 (or 1), which indicates complete inequality (one person has all the income or consumption, all others have none). It was developed by the [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_people) [statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) and [sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology) [Corrado Gini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrado_Gini) and published in his 1912 paper ""Variability and Mutability"" ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language): *Variabilità e mutabilità*). >==== >[**Image from article**](https://i.imgur.com/MegIoFt.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg) --- ^Interesting: [^List ^of ^countries ^by ^income ^equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality) ^| [^List ^of ^U.S. ^states ^by ^Gini ^coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_Gini_coefficient) ^| [^Income ^inequality ^metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics) ^| [^Economic ^inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjecrpk) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjecrpk)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)"
