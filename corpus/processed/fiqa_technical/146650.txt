So much fail and misinformation in this thread. China has REDUCED it's Treasury holdings in 2012. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/business/economy/as-the-us-borrows-who-lends.html?_r=0 Also, FTFA, The FEDERAL RESERVE is the largest holder of US Govt Debt, at 1.65 Trillion. Japan is the largest FOREIGN purchaser of US Govt Debt. This is because China has actively been selling US Debt. Why you may ask? Because the United States manipulates the interest rates on it's debt. Google 'Operation Twist'
