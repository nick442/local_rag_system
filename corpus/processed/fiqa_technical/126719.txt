You pointed out that HFT does not create ipods are mine minerals. Neither does human trading. HFT is a proxy for human trading. Although the computer is executing trades automatically based on an algorithm, it is still using money from a human being's account so the trading is still being done with someone's money. Fast execution of trades is desirable in exchanges. Imagine two exchanges: One only executes trades once a month, the other executes trades once a week. Which exchange would be more desirable? The exchange that trades once a week. Why? Because if I'm holding a stock that I would like to sell, I want to sell it now - not a month from now. Same reason for buying. This concept works all the way down to seconds and fractions of seconds. The issue with HFT, however, is there are cases where the market goes against the HFT algorithm and the algorithm continues to execute trades driving prices up or down by large amounts in the matter of minutes or even seconds. The exchange frequently cancels these trades which only encourages more aggressive HFT trading since HFT traders can have their losses cancelled. This is a privilege that LFTs (low frequency traders) do not receive. This is a valid criticism of HFTs.
