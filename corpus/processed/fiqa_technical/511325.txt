In all fairness, some of the benefits packages enjoyed by GM workers should never have been allowed. To give you an idea of the kind of deals they used to have, my wife's uncle (so my uncle-in-law?) worked for GM. He spent the last ten years sitting in a room doing nothing 40 hours a week for 80% pay. The plant he was working at was shut down. They couldn't fire him, and there were geographic restrictions on transfer so that he couldn't be forced to choose between resigning or moving to where there was another plant. They didn't have any work for him to do where he was located, so they stuck him and a bunch of other people in a room hoping that they'd get bored enough to quit.
