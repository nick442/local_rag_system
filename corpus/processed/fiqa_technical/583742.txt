I agree. There are numerous sources for homework help on the rest of the interwebs. BUT I do enjoy when people post their homework problems. They are fun to solve. Keeps me on my toes. Albeit, this sub shouldn't be relied upon in this manner. Perhaps we could get some sort of Financial Problem subreddit or something along those lines?
