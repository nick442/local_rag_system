Text of the whole entire article that got upvoted out the wazoo because it has Tesla in it: >Tesla has extended the warranty on the drive unit for the most popular version of its Model S sedan to eight years or infinite miles (whichever comes first). The policy, which previously started at four years or 50,000 miles, applies retroactively to earlier buyers of the 85 kWh electric vehicle. The warranty for the 60 kWh version is eight years or 125,000 miles. In a blog post, Chief Executive Elon Musk said the change will have a “moderately negative effective” on earnings. “However, by doing the right thing for Tesla vehicle owners at this early stage of our company, I am confident that it will work out well in the long term.”
