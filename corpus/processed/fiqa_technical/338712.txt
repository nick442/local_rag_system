"What do you mean ""Not Coming Back""? It seems to be coming back to 1990 prices, but not fast enough. I'd love to see it come back to 1970 prices. I don't understand it when people say that ""Housing"" is not improving, when prices go lower. When gas is cheaper, as far as my budget is concerned, it's improving! When food is cheaper, it's also improving! Of course, this is assuming it's really cheaper and not some artifact of unhealthy bioengineering, war, or simply costing ""fewer US dollars"" due to fiscal manipulation. Housing improves when prices go down, because it improves my chances of being able to afford one. If lower prices are caused by demographics, student debt, and no jobs - I say, it can't come soon enough. I want it!"
