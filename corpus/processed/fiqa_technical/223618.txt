"Do you realize that the board understood Yahoo was a sinking ship? Her primary objective was enabling enough scaffolding to get Yahoo acquired and not reach complete bankruptcy. In terms of the shareholders, she stood by them and did a fantastic job with what little she had. As for Yahoo's ""survival""? She dug that shit its grave but it was already a fossilized species. No ex-Google Exec would've changed that."
