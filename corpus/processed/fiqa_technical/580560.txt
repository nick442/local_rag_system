"Under the assumption you're not looking for a particular credit union/bank (since that'll make this question off topic), you can apply for a secure credit card. That's where you essentially put up a sum of money as collateral. That would be the safe way for someone with ""little or no credit history"" and wants to build credit. Any big bank (Wells Fargo, Chase, etc.) should be able to do that for you. You can also do that online provided you have the means to transfer money into the account."
