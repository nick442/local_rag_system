Seriously, you will buy a bicycle for your child on-line? And if the child said it's not what they wanted or does not fit, you will disassemble it and put in the box and return it to try another bicycle? Same with ride-in electric car? Playground? Sand for the sandbox? Base on what you are saying, you never ever go to a store to buy anything. You will even order milk on-line.
