"If they really won't stop calling you, just waste their time. Usually the best thing I do to telemarketers (the ones that constantly call even through I've told them to stop) is to say ""oh yes, I'm interested I'll just get a pen"" - put them on hold and keep them on hold. Do it every time they call and soon they'll get the idea that you're a waste of time."
