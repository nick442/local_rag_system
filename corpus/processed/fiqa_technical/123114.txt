"According to the article, the IRS issued a ""stop-work Order"" for the contract with Equifax while it undertakes an investigation. I have to assume that the contract laid out termination provisions, so it's likely that the IRS is making sure that they don't do anything which appears to be a breach of contract and gives fuel to Equifax to sue (frustrating, I know). What I really like is the statement released by Equifax following the decision by the IRS: â€œWe remain confident that we are the best party to perform the services required in this contract."" How delusional do you have to be to make a bold statement like that after what happened?"
