Are you going back so you can find a higher paying job? What type of job are you currently working? Going back to school is not a waste of time. I did the same thing. At 22 I went back and earned a BBA with a finance concentration from a non-target. I graduated in December and started a new job in January. Granted, the job I got was an entry level position in an accounting department, but the pay was great compared to my previous job (server), and I was finally able to enjoy weekends! I went on to get a M.S. in Finance (50% paid for by the job I got out of undergrad!) and I now work as an analyst for a f500 company. I say go for it!
