We all have a concept of costs. We have all said F that I am not paying $2.00 for a candy bar, but I'll pay that for that ice cream bar, only because we are used to paying $2.00 for an ice cream, but not $1.50 for a candy bar. Business owners are the same. I'll throw in my very limited knowledge of roofing. Looked into doing it myself. Could have had my roofing supplies delivered to my roof for about $1800, but didn't have the insurance so I got four bids to do my roof. $6200, $6400, $9100 and $17,000. Four guys showed up to my house and it was done in a day. Now I am a business owner. I get that there is insurance, advertising, trucks, accounting, bookkeeping, etc. But if you are talking about roofers. 4 guys x 8 hours= 32 man hours. If you increase wages by $5.00 an hour that is $160.00. Gotta think that being able to get a $6000 job even if it costs $160 more, is an acceptable cost. Even an additional $10 an hour is acceptable.
