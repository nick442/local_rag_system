As for point c if you believe that it is a requirement for companies to pay above welfare levels then campaign for that to become law. Companies are required to act in shareholder interests which is what they do. Your point a is about sales/profitability, unless you believe that employees working happier/better will have no effect on either. Also note that sales/profitability is generally measured as [productivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity). If employees were more productive then Walmart would actually need fewer of them to maintain the same sales/profits. Do you seriously believe Walmart management is so stupid that they haven't worked out how to improve productivity? It is also worth reading about what it is like to work at Walmart: [one](http://boingboing.net/2009/02/01/life-at-walmart.html) [two](http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2011/01/27/what-its-like-to-work-at-walmart/) [three](http://ask.metafilter.com/62133/Whats-it-like-to-work-at-WalMart) I agree with you about trickle down economics, but I don't see why Walmart is somehow required to make it work, or any other companies for that matter. Solve it at the political level.
