Well as you can guess economic growth has a positive effect on the economy as a whole and tends to be measured in the change of a countries GDP ([Gross Domestic Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)) [Unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment) is the rate of people unemployed who should be working currently. High unemployment is bad as it shows there are people who could be making money (who would then spend it thus boosting GDP and inflation) and adding to a countries economy. [Inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) is an increase in the price of goods and is measured by a standardized 'basket' of goods. As people spend more and the economy heats up prices rise. You want a low but positive level of inflation, target rate in most developed countries is about 2% per year. At this level demand for goods is high and people are spending but too much higher and prices will pass the level people are willing to pay for the goods and the economy could overheat and have a downturn. Read the wikipedia articles I linked, they'll help a lot. Feel free to ask any more questions you have!
