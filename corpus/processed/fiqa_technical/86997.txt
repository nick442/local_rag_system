"I started typing out a really lengthy response. I think the better idea is to turn you towards this article at [Yale which discusses the use of fast breeder reactors.](http://e360.yale.edu/features/are_fast-breeder_reactors_a_nuclear_power_panacea) In short, FBRs (several designs exist today) can consume most of the fuel put into them. Further, they can consume a lot of the waste that already exists. In effect, we can use existing stockpiles of ""waste"" as fuel. I put ""waste"" in quotes because it becomes fuel and has value. The economic and ecological value of this should be exciting! Next-gen MSRs can potentially be even more effective. Like current breeder reactors, they have the potential to be safer, operate at more desirable temperatures for thermal efficiency, and consume some of the products of existing reactors."
