Just to be clear, private *student* loans fall in the same category. The only meaningful difference is that they do not qualify for the federal forgiveness program (described above) and usually don't have subsidized interest rates which generally makes them even worse. They similarly follow you for life. There is no way out. If you're referring to *regular, private loans*, then that's kind of a non-sequitur since the topic is student loans. Not trying to be pedantic, just want to make sure anyone hoping to learn more understands how horrible student loans are if you can't pay them back.
