Well, there are an army of analysts who build excel spreadsheets and call them models. No real stats involved, no error estimates or anything like that. Just arithmetic. Then there are the quants who do real math. Either can get you work. The more stats BS you can talk the better your odds on a job interview for an analyst. But if you really want to be a hotshot stats guy you'll need to be very very good at very advanced math.
