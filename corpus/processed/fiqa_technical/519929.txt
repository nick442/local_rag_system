"Sure it is. I plug it in when I park it, I go do whatever other things I was going to do anyway, and when I use the car it's got the charge I need to get where I need to be. How is that functionally different from it taking 5 seconds to charge? I have spent less time charging in the years I've owned an EV than I spent in gas stations over the same amount of years owning a gas car. Therefore, the EV takes less of my time to charge. And I'm telling you this because I've actually experienced both. And EV owners who have actually experienced both can tell you that the EV is generally more convenient to use. You don't have to go out of your way and spend your time and money at a gross gas station, the car just gets charged in the same place it's parked all the time anyway. Cars spend 95% of their time parked, might as well make that time productive. If you're that concerned, make your next car a PHEV with enough range to cover your daily driving (so a Volt, maybe Clarity PHEV, or i3 with ""range extender"" option) and then you'll experience how much more convenient it is to charge and how you'd much rather do that than go to gas stations."
