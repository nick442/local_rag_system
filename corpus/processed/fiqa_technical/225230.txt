Everyone has to be honest as hell. I worked next to an office for a group called Universal Life Church in the 1980s. They set up a deal where anyone could be a pastor, and this guy in the ofice would send out checks in the name of a church with a few tandy computers and a program he wrote. Checks for house payments, utilities etc. He called himself a Bishop. Then one weekend someone took the money and he had to skip town.
