"No, investing in gold is a bad idea. Gold at these prices is completely useless. There are many other precious metals that are far more useful. It seems highly unlikely you will make a large return and the downside is huge. If the world economy is stabilised gold will halve very quickly, perhaps more. A great piece of advice I have had while investing is ""if the shoe shine boy tells you to buy; sell"", i.e. when the general public think it is a good idea to invest in a certain product you have already missed the boat. You have missed the gold boat. Unfortunately most safe heavens are exhausted: chf, jpy, gold, etc. At the moment there aren't any safe places. NOK is probably your best bet but beware of intervention (see EURCHF around sep last year)."
