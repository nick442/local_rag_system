"> For instance, one of his sage-like pieces of advice is to put a clause in your contract saying ""subject to the approval of all business partners"". Then if you feel like backing out, you claim that your cat is your business partner and he didn't like the deal. I am not making this up. I'm no contract lawyer, but shouldn't the signature on the contract mean a binding approval of its terms for the signer and everyone they implicitly represent? I mean, otherwise, what power does the signature hold for the other party, if the signee can just claim later that their unspecified business partner doesn't like your face?"
