I dunno, the problem with a great depression taking place today is that we're all interconnected.. Despite the massive debt burdens & imf knocking on doors, things are not as tough as they could be. Most of us will not starve to death and have a roof over our heads.We'll be looked after when sick and can afford basics which were once considered luxuries i.e. TV, internet, microwave etc.. Yet that's the kind of picture you paint when you mention the great depression - walking around barefoot, worrying about where the next meal will come from.. it's scaremongering at best and it allows the people with cash to demand higher interest / payback, so it's in their best interests to keep hyping the shit out of doom & gloom news. It's all getting a bit see-through imo and people are beginning to question whether 'the markets' and 'bondholders' are real people or whether they're some make-believe, unquestionable god.
