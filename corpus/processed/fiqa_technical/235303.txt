"> Sports are generally dominated by African Americans here in the states. *Some* sports. NBA? Sure. NFL? Sure. NHL? No. Soccer? No. MLB? No. NASCAR? No. IndyCar? No. Gymnastics? No. Figure skating? No. The myth of black athletic dominance is right up there with the myth of black sexual prowess (i.e. that black men have huge dicks). It's one of those urban legends. But let's go down this rabbit hole a little more. If your argument is that ""sports are dominated by African Americans,"" and that you attribute this to genetic reasons, then you must believe that different races are inherently better/worse in other ways - i.e. *intelligence.* Perhaps temperament. Or the propensity to lie. Or to commit crimes. Etc."
