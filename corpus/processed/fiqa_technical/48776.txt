Thanks to the lack of the KeystoneXL pipeline, the WTI price has been artificially depressed. However world prices of refined product haven't - they are set relative to the global price of oil. Thus someone can make a tidy profit by refining, then shipping product. It's no surprise that there have been shortages of distillate in places like North Dakota - the product goes where the money is. BTW, in essence it means if US customers won't pay world prices, they won't get the product - putting a floor under the prices you'll pay.
