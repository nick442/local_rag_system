Mt Gox was an exchange that went belly up because of financial and strategic mismanagement. It was also a valuable lesson for many people: if you don't control your private key, you don't control your bitcoin. Scams running bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) are vastly underrepresented in the grand scheme of things concerning money. US Dollars, Euros, Yen, World of Warcraft Gold - it is all being used to manipulate people into spending tokens of worth for worthless tokens. This is not inherent to bitcoin, and you are misrepresenting it if you think it is. Cryptocurrencies are in their infancy still, and many of the current adopters are being scammed by so called ICO's. This is, however, a natural process, and will even out again as ICO's get a bad rep, and only those with a good business case get valued. We saw the same thing during the dot com bubble.
