"Well, really, we decided that we wanted a basic level of care, but ONLY if you're REALLY poor or old. If you're working an okay job, then your employer must give you healthcare, unless they're too small, or really don't want to and make you work a few less hours so you get two part-time jobs. The role of government in the markets is to manipulate incentives towards ""good""(e.g. employing people) activities and away from ""bad""(e.g. polluting) activities. You really can't get that mad at companies for leveraging those incentives. I've got a puppy right now. If she misbehaves, it doesn't help me to punish her other than to make me feel better. What fixes things, is to change my behavior so that she is rewarded for doing what I think is ""good""(e.g. chewing her toy) not what I think is ""bad""(chewing my shoes). Sure, we can say, ""Bad Wal-Mart! Bad Company!"" but that's not going to do anything except make us feel better."
