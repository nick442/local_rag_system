> Paternity leave. The situation now allows managers to hire a man over a woman because he can't take off when he has a child. Requiring that he be offered the same or similar option reduces or eliminates that incentive for hiring a man instead of a woman. This is a good idea. Of course, with every upside there is a downside. The downside is that it will become an age-discrimination thing, and all people under 40 will have a harder time getting jobs. **edit: took the wrong quote**
