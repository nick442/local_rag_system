"I'm in total agreement on this. I get the sense that lyft is more of a social experience but sometimes I just want to get where I'm going and not be chatty. Also I recall when lyft required you to signup with your Facebook account. Additionally they encouraged users to ride up front with the driver to encourage the social aspect. These things may have changed now, but it soured my initial experience. Also let's not forget the huge pink mustaches that used to be on the cars. Those were ridiculous. It's not likely true; but Uber feels more ""professional"" and lyft is more a like a carpool service amongst colleagues."
