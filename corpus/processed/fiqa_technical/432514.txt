It is. My grocery store removed our self check-out because of the significant increase in theft. It wasn't even bottom of the cart stuff. You just load what you want to steal on non-weighing side, pay, and then load all of it into bags. The cashier is usually busy dealing with someone at another kiosk so no one is actually watching you. In the end, the theft, constant break downs, and problems customers always had trying to use them made them too much trouble to keep. We put up a few more check stands and the theft dropped.
