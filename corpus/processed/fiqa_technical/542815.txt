fair enough, and thanks for typing that out! The leaky ship idea, well that does make sense. I still like to cling on to Ayn Rand's idea that there are primary innovative people, and second hand people preying on these geniuses. I like to think Walt Disney himself would have drawn some new comic figures instead of trying to stretch the copyright for decades and decades on an old idea.
