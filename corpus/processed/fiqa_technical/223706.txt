"I received my offer to join one of GS/MS/JPM the fall of my senior year through On-Campus Recruiting. I submitted my resume for the Investment Banking Analyst position, passed the first round on-campus interview, was sent to a ""superday"" at NYC headquarters about a week later, and walked out with an offer at the end of the superday. I should probably note that I was an engineering major, so most of my interviews were focused on ""why finance."" You *really* need to be sharp on explaining your story (by walking someone through your resume clearly and concisely)."
