I disagree. It ruined Kevin Smith, most recent stoner comedies are lazy and forgettable, and my stoner classmates from high school are pretty much all stuck in dead-end jobs or out of work entirely. The only successful people I know who smoke pot are the ones who started when they were adults, after they finished their degrees and had years of employment.
