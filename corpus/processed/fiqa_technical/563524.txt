"No. I have nearly a million miles in the air and I do not ""despise"" flying. The TSA intrusions today are only slightly more obnoxious than they were, say, 10 years ago. The purpose of airport security is to get rid of the ""low hanging fruit"" threats. Without it, every knucklehead with an agenda would be a problem. With it, only the hardcore threats are a concern. The real problem with air travel today is the amateurs that travel once a year and have some very weird behaviors: - They show up late, unprepared, and clueless and then get annoyed that the word doesn't stop rotating to accommodate them. - They show up massively overweight and blame the airline for the ""small"" seats. Yeah, that's the problem. The seats are too small to accommodate your buffalo-like thighs. - They try to bring aboard steamer trunks that won't fit in the back of an SUV let alone in the overhead compartment. - They think a $49 ticket entitles you to preferrential treatment and a luxury experience. - They drink like frat boys and become about equally obnoxious. - They bring their children along (that's fine) but then ignore them so that the rest of us have to put up with the whining, howling, and screaming that comes from children that are hungry, overtired, or need a diaper change. In short, the TSA doesn't bother me anywhere near as much as a good many of my fellow passengers. ProTip #1: When traveling, travel light and be 10% more courteous and 10% more patient than you would be, say, at home. It will make the entire experience better for all involved. ProTip #2: The single biggest element of travel stress in my experience is NOISE. Go to your local gun shop and buy a pair of the compressible foam shooters earplugs. Wear them from the time you walk into the airport until you walk out at the other end. You will see your stress levels go down significantly. ProTip #3: The most dangerous thing in the airport isn't terrorists. It's the food."
