Exactly. Stock is a liquid asset and is almost like cash. By that reasoning, a Democratic Governor could threaten to permanently close down Trump properties due to labour, health and safety, and food safety laws and that is all OK because it does matter until the property is actually sold off when the lost is actualised. Trump came into office as supposedly pro-business but this is third world style abuse. Trump does not give one damn about protecting consumers from a supposed monopoly. This is purely a political move.
