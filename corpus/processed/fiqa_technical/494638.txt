> I said IQ has cultural bias. [citation needed] Yes, in direct comparisons between large average IQ scores of black and white ethnicities, the black ethnicities typically score lower. But that's a very superficial context-stripped soundbite, since there's far more genetic variation across individuals (including intelligence scores) than there is across ethnicities. Ethnicity just pertains to phenotypes, and while large-scale IQ variant tests show intelligence has a significant heritable component that is passed down through ancestry, there's still more variance between individuals of the same ethnicity than there is between averages of ethnicities. If you wanna reduce that to saying black people are stupid so badly then knock yourself out, but that's your own ignorant oversimplification not mine.
