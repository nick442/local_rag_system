I took some time off actually.. I was working a lot and pretty angry, and picked up some habits I wanted to wane myself off of. I basically took a mental health break. That was 4 months ago. I am moving next month and will start looking. Probably will also look bad not to be working, but I have some hobby projects that are public and active but probably would not change anything (I just finished reading the linked article). I was planning on leaving a glass door review and reporting then after finding a new job. Actually still in touch with some old co workers from that job that also wanted to report them but apparently hadn't. The limitation on back pay is 7 years -- I wised up and did my best not to do OT, but there were others that worked 80 hour weeks and did not get paid for them and it made me livid. That article had some practical points at the beginning but ultimately the negotiation tactics made me feel uncomfortable. I can understand that quality breeds quality but psychological tricks are dishonest.. I suppose if I get jaded enough I might eventually change my tune. Also I do suffer from social anxiety, so saying I want to talk more instead of talk pay and escape is a peculiar type of torture.. But thankyou and I'll probably explore more of this guy's stuff and who he linked out of curiosity.
