"Some of the other answers have commented on this, but I particularly want to comment on the ""Your expenses go down at retirement, stay the same, or go up?"" assumption people often make. We assume we'll spend less in retirement, but as David Chilton points out in ""The Wealthy Barber"", ""it's a myth that present-day retired people spend much less money than their working counterparts."" He cites that reduced expenses like paid-off mortgages and children leaving the home usually happen several years before retirement, so ""the last few years at work are characterized by good income levels and significatnly reduced expenses. In all likelihood, disposable income is at its highest point ever."" Furthermore, some expenses go up, e.g. golfing, hobbies, traveling, all of which cost money. Healthcare costs often increase as well, and Chilton goes on to discuss ""a retiree's number one enemy"" - Inflation. So in my mind, the answer to that question/assumption would be ""costs [will probably] go up,"" and 60-80% of retirment income won't cut it."
