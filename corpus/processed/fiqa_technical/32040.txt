Firstly it is completely legal for a company to buy its own shares, I don't believe it would be legal to do so secretly. It would also be very difficult to do that secretly. So hypothetically we have a company Johnbbob Inc. It doesn't have any assets other than $100 in a bank account and there are 100 shares each owned by a different person. Each share would be worth $1. So the company decides to buy one share. Now there is $99 in the account and 99 shares, each share is still worth $1. So the company continues to buy shares until there is only one share left and $1 in the account. If the company buys that last share it will no longer have any assets and will cease to exist, effectively dissolving the company. TL:DR it is called dissolving the company or dissolution and it happens fairly often with limited liability corporations.
