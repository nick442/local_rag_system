"I don't want to hate on those other comments but as a college student having a 4.0 and going to a ""target"" school are not realistic goals for everyone. The best advice I would give you is to be passionate about the field. It sounds dumb on its face but being involved in student investment clubs/funds or competing in investment competitions are great ways to get exposure and meet people in the field while building your resume. Internships are incredibly important because that's where you prove to yourself and others that you are a capable person. You also have a lot of options ahead of you. You can do research, client facing roles (CFP), and even corporate finance. I wasn't a finance major but I spent 3 years in college working in our student managed investment fund and it absolutely paid off (now doing corporate finance). You have to want to learn and grow. It's not realistic for a college student with limited resources to get your CFA level 1 or series exams, especially if it doesn't suit your field. Be open to different types of jobs and build relationships with your professors who are well connected. It does help to have stellar grades and it helps to be at a top school but our state school has put kids on the Street. You just have to be hungry and realistic about your talents and passion. Good luck to you."
