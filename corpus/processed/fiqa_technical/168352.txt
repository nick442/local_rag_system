What's the point of commenting on a down voted thread anyway? There is no agreed upon cut-off for Gen X. You could make an argument that anyone over 40 and under 60 is Gen X. The point is that Gen X is not some hapless victim in this crisis. Many of the mid-level executives and managers responsible for mortgage fraud, derivatives fraud and all levels of financial abuse are members of Generation X. What generation is the London Whale? How about Blythe Masters? You Gen X'ers really got a sore spot, huh? Couldn't have had anything to do with you. Just hapless victims of generational warfare. Don't worry. You get first dibs at taking the helm of the sinking ship. Just have to pry the Boomers cold dead hands off the wheel first.
