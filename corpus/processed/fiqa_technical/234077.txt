Actually, it would be freaking awesome! (1) People would stop arguing about earth being 10000 years old. That dispute has been settled decades ago in most of the civilized world. (2) Funding of science and medical research would go through the roof. Funding of idiotic wars would go down. You are not going to die from a terrorist attack, you are going to die from cancer. If we were to spend as much $$ on science as we do on miliary, that problem would have been long gone. (3) Government would be done based on hard numbers rather than BS statements by former exterminators who somehow made their way to congress. (4) We would be on the way to solving global warming problem. (5) My local bookstore would have had a bigger science section than religion section. That same story would not have Bible audiobook in non-fiction section. What's sad, I am not living in Deep South. I live in Seattle. I could go on and on and on and on..
