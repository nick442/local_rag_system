I'm sorry to hear that. I mourn every time an LBS closes its doors. There's no real way to tell if Specialized is to blame, but it certainly wouldn't surprise me. There is a local bike shop out here on the West Coast called Mike's bikes. They pretty much exclusively sell specialized. They do sell other brands, but only in a very small quantity. I cannot in good conscience give them business. They know who they are in bed with, and I suppose they need to drink their own Kool-Aid.
