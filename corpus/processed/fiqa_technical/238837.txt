It depends on the firm. I was interviewing with a few PE firms a few months ago, and the structure can vary. Some were definitely just LBO shops where the bulk of the staff were focused just on the deal. I remember a couple, however, that placed a lot of emphasis on getting in-house after the deal and performing what ultimately amounted to long term management consulting. These firms tended to hold companies for like 10+ years iirc. It sounds like there might be options out there in line with your passions, you just need to be pretty picky with the firm you join. I only remember one firm's name off the top of my head, but I'd be happy to pm it to you if you want to do some more research yourself.
