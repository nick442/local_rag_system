Actually, I think the survey was conducted in the city. So the point is that those who live outside the city, in country side perhaps, earn a salary lower than $1.1K. Let's say they don't spend much on transportation, then maybe their minimum wage is just equal to those who work in the city. Those who drives to the city from outside, whether they don't have a car or not, spends more money for transpo.
