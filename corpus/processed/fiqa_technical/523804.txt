Ok but amazon is actually pricing everything as it should be. Retailers charged too much and Amazon took that surplus by offering better service and prices via extensive supply chain expertise. That's on retailers for pricing poorly and doing a shitty job at supply chain efficiency, not Amazon. Trump can fuck right on off. Want retailers to make a comeback? Start spurring wage growth. No one fucking cares how many service jobs were added - get wage growth and career jobs up.
