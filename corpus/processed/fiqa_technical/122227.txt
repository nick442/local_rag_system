Sure these groups suck ass but Paypal should act as a utility. Otherwise where do you draw the line? Do all businesses become politically driven entities? Do lobbyists start drilling for dirt and reasons to pull services form their competitors, or even make it up? I get **this** is good, and usually I'm not a fan of the slippery slope style arguement, though in this situation for what is largely an essential service it seems valid.
