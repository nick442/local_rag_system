"Share value is not always an indication of true value. Citi was proactive in trying to find bidders for their business segments which posed the most risk to their traditional banking business. They have expanded into many emerging markets during Pandit and ""slimmed down"" their operations. They also just got rid of Smith Barney.. which I think is a great move. I think Citi has a brighter future than say, BoA."
