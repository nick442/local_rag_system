No I don't want that, but not only was I implying that the comment-poster would find it despicable (I could be wrong), but also that the majority of society would find it so. While I don't argue that majority opinion should always be codified as law, I do believe it does strongly influences morality and law, and rightfully so. All this leads me to the conclusion that this is not a frivolous lawsuit. And I should also point out that I didn't say it should be illegal, only that it is worth exploring further in a lawsuit.
