"When I need to come up with a name I would load up thesaurus.com and namecheap.com and start mashing up words and seeing what is available. EG. Since it's something to do with drones then I'd look into synonyms for drones or birds and mash it up with other words like robotics and come up with something like ""electroWing"" and if namecheap.com tells me there's availability then I know I'm on the right path."
