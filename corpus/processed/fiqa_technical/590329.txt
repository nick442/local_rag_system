If they specifically ask you this, don't try to make something up. If you know something about the company that actually interests you, you can start with that. You can ask questions on what kinds of benefits/incentives they receive, their culture, or how they do things differently at their company. IMO you can try to redirect this to how you think the fintech industry and position are right for you- that you want to do challenging work, solve difficult problems, work with incredibly smart people, and improve your skills and gain experience, and how you have read/heard that the company a big player in the industry, is well known for all of the above and is the right place for you to achieve your goals. (Why did you apply in the first place?)
