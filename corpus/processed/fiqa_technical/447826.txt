>Is my laptop that I use to work and create my income my possession, or my property? Well you *use* it on an every-day basis, right? So that's a possession. Possession comes from *usage*. Private property is legal title to something you don't use, that you only use for trade, or that you only partially use and primarily command/employ others to use. Many anarchists will say that, for example, a loaf of bread you made yourself, no matter how many you've got and how little you need and your intention to trade the bread, is still a possession, because you made the entire batch by your own hands. But legal ownership over the Entenmann's baking company, *that's* private property. It's legal title without physical possession or usage, carried out, thus, only through a system of force and coercion that makes other people use resources they built and they work with for your benefit.
