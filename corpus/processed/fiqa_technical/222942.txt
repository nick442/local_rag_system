That is but ONE liability out of a dozen possibly affected. Which liabilities going up for some businesses is irrelevant. What is relevant is the cost analysis every company must do when setting up it's future plans and forecasts. If government uses a carrot or a stick to incentivize or deincentize certain behavior, guess what companies do? So if there is a liability above say 5,000 people and they've got 6,500 currently and if they shrank it to 4,999 to avoid paying xyz increase in this or that. Guess what they'll do? You can say, oh they're not paying their fair share, or think about the 99% but the bottomline is that some companies will go into survival mode if they get anymore squeezed. If this was a good business envionment, fine, but it's not. (and if it was fine they wouldn't need to pull increased taxes to hit revenue). Here's a great example of how increased burdens can lead to withdrawl of investment: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-11/hollande-robbed-of-growth-driver-as-companies-curb-investments.html There is also a direct correlation where taxes go up beyond a certain point and revenues go DOWN: http://i.imgur.com/BPUAi.jpg Fairness is all well and good, but more taxes and liabilities do not automatically mean more revenue. It is a disincentive to produce more when there are more burdens on you. You go into survival mode, you go into hibernation mode.
