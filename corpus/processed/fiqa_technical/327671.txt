Can confirm. I have no capability to take the hundreds of jobs in my area because they are terrible pay, and I am very over qualified for them. I can barely find 3-4 jobs a week I can apply for that would hire me. I saw something recently that said a college degree over qualifies us for a job, yet under qualifies us for a career.
