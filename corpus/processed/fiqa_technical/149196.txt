That's a serious thing. After Orlando, wasn't there a thing about a rise in gun sales to LGBT customers? A lot of people really fear Trump / Republicans / Religious Right / Gasoline / Beef, so they might want to arm up a little more than they did under Obama. (I've been to enough gun ranges to know that they are bi-partisan.)
