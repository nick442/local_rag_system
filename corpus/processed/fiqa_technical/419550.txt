"I doubt it would ever make it to court. ""They printed a curse word on clothes, we did it first, we don't own a trademark on 'fuck you' but they can't do that!"" Their cease and desist had the desired effect, they took a site down with $0 court fees on their part. They win. My point is to not necessarily be scared by cease and desists, especially in situations like these. Anyone can send them. There are no laws broken or intellectual property infringements here."
