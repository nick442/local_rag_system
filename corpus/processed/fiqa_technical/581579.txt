"For any large company, there's a lot of activity, and if you sell at ""market"" your buy or sell will execute in seconds within a penny or two of the real-time ""market"" price. I often sell at ""limit"" a few cents above market, and those sell within 20 minutes usually. For much smaller companies, obviously you are beholden to a buyer also wanting that stock, but those are not on major exchanges. You never see whose buy order you're selling into, that all happens behind the curtain so to speak."
