Not at all. From personal experience, talking about work culture is a safe bet. A smart question to ask is _what backgrounds do the people working in (position) have_. Shows you're interested and willing to to fit into the role. Plus it gives you an idea of what you need to work towards to get the position. You can also talk about the job description and how it matches your background / skills / interests (i.e: I'm interested in financial modelling because I took XXX class / read up about it through YYY book). Don't expect them to answer very industry-specific questions because in most cases they won't be able to. You can also ask them about rotational / full-time programs.
