This is not shocking news actually. Nothing happened to these banks that made them lose their ratings. Rather, it's the rating agencies that have set up more strict rules, especially when it comes to triple A status. Specifically, it's no longer possible that banks or similar institutions can have a triple A status.This effectively means that only the richer countries can be triple A.
