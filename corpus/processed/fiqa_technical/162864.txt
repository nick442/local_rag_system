Look, honestly, I don't care how much they make. Its a tough job and they're working a lot of hours. I'm glad they make this much money, that means they're having a good life. The fact that they are earning this money does not invalidate the fact that a lot of teachers and military personnel do not live as well. That is the problem. We don't have to take from these guys to give to another. We need to take from the people that are hoarding the wealth in this country. This is obviously a story, I don't want to say planted, but most certainly encouraged by special interest to once again stir up anti-union outrage and make us 99%s fight amongst ourselves over the few crumbs that the 1% let drop down to us. The problems in this country are not because a few transit cops figured out a way to gets some extra money, it's because we allow 400 people to have all the money when everyone else gets none.
