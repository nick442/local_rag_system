No, you were not the stupid one. Yes many of these mortgage companies will only work with you if you are behind. . . no idea why, but I will say that yes I have seen it. You do not have to deal with the stress. . . . working with mortgage companies is not a fun proposition, they don't know what they are doing half the time. You can leave and move whenever you want. . . even if their payments are better now who knows how long till they can actually see the place for enough to move. I work in bankruptcy I have seen the stresses this causes. . . it is not fun, even if they are doing better now, try not to envy them, it is not fun.
