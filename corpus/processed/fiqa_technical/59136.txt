Gah, I feel a little bad for commenting on this, but every time I refresh the page it's here, so: Republicans are *mislead by* or maybe *under the thrall of* a discredited economic ideology. It's all the rest of us who are victimized by it. We have to live with it even if we disagree with it. Republican voters are giving their tacit permission for it to continue. Even if they are damaged by the effects of it, they are the only ones who can put an end to the policy, and thus fat they've shown nothing but support for its continuation by placing it's biggest boosters (people like Trump, Bush, Cheney, Cantor and Ryan, the Tea Party wing of the party, etc) in positions of authority and power.
