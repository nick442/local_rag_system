First, I suggest that the route gives you the discount. You work the block with goldman and they say that if you work 20 blocks with them you get 50bps back, regardless of the issue. Also, as a hedge fund you have a very different model than an ETF or MF. That said, how exactly would that this be disclosed to the investor? Is there a standard in place for that?
