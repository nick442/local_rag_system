I have USAA and the home loan process was a nightmare. My account was also compromised but I caught it immediately because they sent me an alert of a large sum of money being transferred to my checking account, so there is that. I just found out that Navy Federal finally accepts Army veterans (it hadn't up until a couple of years ago) so I have an account with them just so I can get different loan options and credit card rates. Navy Federal has minimums for getting ATM refunds while USAA doesn't, so for now I just have a savings account with them.
