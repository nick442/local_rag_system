> will get hit with a 10% penalty plus income tax. Can I confirm this with you? I am aware of 20% withholding, but the 10% penalty, in my memory, was only with regards to *in-service* withdrawals, or things like an unpaid loan being deemed a distribution. If an employee terminated from the company, there was no 10% penalty on withdrawal. I've kept up a little bit, but it's been 15 years since I was administering pensions day-to-day!
