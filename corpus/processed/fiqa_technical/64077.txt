"I typed out a long-ish answer, but I'm just going to direct you to [this study](http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/irwin/archive/papers/Farmers%20use%20of%20forward%20contracts.pdf) instead, which seems to summarize the available contracts quite well. The biggest problem I see is infrastructure and credit risk. Say you have somebody with arable land who wants to start up a farming operation, as the financial institution how do you know this person can actually deliver the goods to a distributor? How do you know they won't just default on their payments? The lack of creditworthiness is a big problem in developing countries, and morseso many countries lack the proper legal institutions to enforce the contracts, further complicating the problem. I think your idea is good, but I think widespread retail financing operations in developing countries need a lot of ""boots on the ground"", as it were, to ensure you know who you're lending to. Other alternatives are to just require a huge amount of collateral, but impoverished farmers by their definition probably won't be able to meet this requirement."
