"I have some equity research (sell-side) interviews (for 1st year analyst) positions coming up with some top-tier banks. I have recently completed the GMAT and scored and overall score of 710 (91st percentile). I have a further breakdown of my score which shows that my overall score was brought done by a 47th percentiles score in the ""sentence correction"" section, whilst the rest of my scores are >90th for the other verbal sections. 1. Should I tell them my GMAT score? 2. Should I tell them the breakdown, and argue that it demonstrates that I am exceptionally strong in the sections for reading comprehension and critical reasoning, and that the sentence correction score is an anomalous result. Or would telling them this likely bring up concerns over my written communication skills?"
