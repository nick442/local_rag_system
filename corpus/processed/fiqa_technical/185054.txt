The headline is totally misleading. Construction costs have risen by 30% according to the statistic. This is not construction wage growth by 30%. They don't address how much construction wage growth has actually occurred. This increase in cost will be pushed onto the consumer. Increase in cost by 30% means people will have to get used to paying 30% more for construction services.
