If you're reasonably sure that the client isn't acting in good faith and you have no intention of doing business with them again, you can still make back some of the money. Sell the debt to a collections agency if you don't want to go through the hassle of suing. Make sure they're actually ignoring you though. A friendly, non-confrontational phone call might jiggle something loose. Especially if you give them the option to set up some sort of payment plan.
