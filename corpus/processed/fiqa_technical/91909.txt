"Status alone shouldn't be a problem. A fellow blogger publishes a blogger list at Rock Star Finance where he lists nearly 1000 personal finance bloggers web sites. You can see that many of them publicly offer their numbers. What you need to consider is whether you are anonymous, or if friends and family will know it's you. ""Hey Tev, you have no debt and already saved XXX francs? Can you lend me ZZ francs to buy..?"" That is the greater risk. The potential larger risk for the higher worth people is that of targeted theft. (Interesting you couldn't find this via search, the PF blogging community is large, mature, and continuing to grow.)"
