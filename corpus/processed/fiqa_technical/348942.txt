$500k a year might be overkill. But you can certainly find TONS of smart people who simply lack the training for the specific skill set MS is looking for. Colleges in the US generally teach someone how to think and how to program, not how to program in a specific language. Colleges in India generally teach how to program in a specific in demand language. Also there are more people in India so you have a better percent chance of finding that specific taught skill set. Instead of investing in the local person who can do the job but simply needs some additional training, they are constantly looking for the person who can do the job right now, but may lack the general ability to help solve other problems. Its very short sighted.
