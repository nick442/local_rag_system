You're not paranoid. But rationality isn't insurance against crashes either. Rational people caused the crash. If you've got yield-hungry clients and nothing that will give them that yield, then all the exotic instruments that were dreamed up make perfect sense to you, especially given the slap-on-the-wrist enforcement (and near-total absence of clawbacks) that prevailed before and after the crisis. And if you can get all that stuff AAA-rated? Double-bonus. Come to think of it, I wish the article had gone into what kind of ratings if any these loan bundles were getting. I'm sure someone on here will know something about it..
