I don't see how anything you said contradicted anything I said. Those countries are still highly social-democratic, no? They are hardly as deregulated as the US, their governments provide things like universal health care, free or near-free post-secondary education, and they have regulations providing more vacation and other time off, they follow the precautionary principle wrt pollution, and so on. None of these things are being eliminated or in danger of such.
