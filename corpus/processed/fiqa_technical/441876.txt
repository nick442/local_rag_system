A few years back JetBlue offered discounted flights across the States. Reddit pooled money together and bought a guy tickets to destinations selected by Reddit. The guy met up with local Reddit users who showed him around town. His trip ended in jersey where he ended up in jail on murder charges. Apparently he couch surfed at dome guy's house and this guy tried to drug him and sexually assaulted him. He woke up pissed off and killed the dude.
