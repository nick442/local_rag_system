Haha the work conditions in NYC sound kind of fun actually, I like all nighters. I work better under stress. ADD is a contributing factor to that, but that's a story for another day folks! But I'm wondering.. Does it matter if I get my diploma from Canada and not the US if I go to WS? Will WS HR people look down on a UofT degree? Not everyone has 100k in their bank account! I'm wondering also what's the HEC Montreal's reputation when it comes to their MFE? Any opinions on that? We here very good things about them in Montreal, but does the reputation transfer elsewhere?
