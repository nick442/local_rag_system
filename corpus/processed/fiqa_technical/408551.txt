I don't know if Uber will ever have a profitable business but their growth is pretty substantial too. $500M increase in net revenue from Q4 2016 to Q1 2017. I combined a few sources of public data and threw them on a chart; https://i.imgur.com/MnVrStN.png If they're still growing at 20+% per quarter, that's incredible. Startups like to talk in terms of revenue run rate, given their quarterly data, they went from a $4b/year company to a $14b/year company in 12 months!
