Other people lie to the companies about how many miles they drive, so they can't take the mileage figures literally. You aren't specifying whether you want liability only, or more-comprehensive insurance. Stuff happens when you aren't driving. Cars get stolen. Other drivers hit parked cars and leave. Trees fall on parked cars. Move to Virginia where insurance is not required. Just pay $500 a year for not having insurance, and be careful.
