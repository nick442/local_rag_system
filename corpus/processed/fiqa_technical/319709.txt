As far as I know. Ford didn't take bailout money. Ford sells so many more trucks because they consolidate all their sales under one brand. GM has Chevy and GM trucks - they're identical except for the branding, so they are tracked differently. On the other hand I think even the aggregated sales of GM and Chevy is smaller than the sales of ford trucks. They're just good trucks, reliable and well trusted. Like the Camry is for a car.
