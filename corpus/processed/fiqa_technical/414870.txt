You're definitely looking in the wrong place. I work at Starbucks in Dallas and I make $9.00 an hour. Federal work study programs pay $9.88 an hour. Job opportunities are countless in Texas, especially for technology which is what I'm going to study in the fall (MIS). A job for $8.25? Give me a break. You could find a technical support position that pays $12 an hour with just an A+ certification.
