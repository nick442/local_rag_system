It's also a function of location. Let's use an example of where I live in Eastern Tennessee and a skilled HVAC Tech with two years of tech school certifications. The starting pay locally to me is roughly $15/hr but if you move 100-200 miles away you find starting pay jumps to $22/hr. With minor cost of living increases. Certainly not $7/hr worth of CoL. Companies locally are simply preying upon a small skilled labor force they hope cannot afford to move.
