Slightly off topic, I wondered what inflation has been like since 1850. The Fed says the current dollar is worth 28 times less than the 1850 dollar. This seems low. The 1850 dollar contained 1/20th of an ounce of gold, which sells at $65 today. So the current dollar is actually worth 65 times less. Another way of looking at this is by salaries. Most jobs have changed too much, but a grunt in the US Army is essentially the same. A private in 1850 made $158/year and in 2017 it's $19200/year, so a dollar is worth 121 times less today. I have a hard time believing the Fed's figure when it seems like inflation is two to four times more.
