"Word salad specialist concealing communist beliefs by replacing commissars with computers. He doesn't understand that the free market is a supercomputer where each node updates its wants and needs every day, buying or selling based on dynamic changes. He pretends its without a designer. No, it has 7 billion designers. He admits we don't have a free market, THEN BLAMES THE ""FREE MARKET"". The parts of the market that are fucked up are precisely because of socialist redistribution which has rendered $Trillions of illegitimate transactions (i.e. welfare recipients are not legitimate customers.. their money was stolen). Our culture has been driven largely by this faction, who didn't exist before the 1960s.. the direct cause of cultural decline. Without government theft (taxation), engineers, scientists and any type of *realists* would grow in power. Instead of people like Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos, etc. losing $Billions to politicians, they'd grow in wealth and ability to fund the future along high-tech lines. I just don't get his view. The idealistic future IS possible, just when we get rid of taxation and make all service providers have voluntary customers. Those who provide the most value will then gain control over the future, and these people will inevitably be the most scientific, as long as coercive taxation and monopoly law no longer exists. I cannot believe he calls the FDA - the undeniably ANTI-free-market agency - a market cartel creation. What a fucking liar. Just straight up liar. The FDA prevents competition by raising the cost of bringing a drug to market to over $1Billion on average. The guy is too smart to be this dumb. That means he's intentionally ruining the reputation of the non-existent, restrained free-market, and blaming ""free market"" for everything that the LACK of a free market causes."
