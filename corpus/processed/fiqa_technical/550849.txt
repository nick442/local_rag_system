Grew up in the 90's for my teen years. Spent every weekend at the Mall (think Fast Times at Ridgemont High). My teen kids have no clue where the mall is..and no desire to go. We live near the first indoor mall in the US - Cherry Hill Mall in NJ. Still very well stocked with all of the major retailers and well maintained.
