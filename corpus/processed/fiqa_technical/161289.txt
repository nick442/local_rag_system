"It might not be fair, but we can't sort the fuckers out. So good ones, bad ones, it really doesn't fucking matter to us. You don't see us banning fucking buddhists or christians or whatever other hocus pocus religions there are out there. No, just the ones that are FUCKING PEOPLE UP DAILY. Look, since you are infatuated with racists, maybe you will understand this. How about if the KKK started lynching blacks like a motherfucker today.. it was in the papers everywhere left and right, every day. They're killing them all over the place. So we say, ""ok, fucking kkk members, we're coming after you."" It's a fucking war, and it would be justified. If one guy happened to be a nice KKKer and didn't actually lynch blacks, it doesn't fucking matter, it's a fucking war. He's a KKKer, and in this war against them, he's the enemy. Get it?"
