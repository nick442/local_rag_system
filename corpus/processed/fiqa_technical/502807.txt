Yes . .unfortunately this is related to our economy. You see, Israel is basically a Jewish state and has spent the last 50 years, killing unarmed women and children in Palestine and building illegal settlements. They as a part of government policy deny their own Arab citizens rights, and as such are not a democracy, they are an Apartheid state. Now Jews, are Jews first and then any thing else, like for instance American citizens, they are Jews first and will always put Jewry first. Well thats all fine but, Jews also control the US economy and exert a great deal of control on the US politics via their control of the purse strings. But America is supposed to be the defender of Democracy and Human Rights and is forced to publicly support Israel which is now known to the world as an Apartheid State and a sower of discord and strife and the root cause of terrorism, and therefor by aligning with the Israeli's and giving them weapons and military aid, America shows it self as a hypocritical liar and a shallow state and grow in its isolation. All the while Israel keeps harping about war and Iran and Syria and now Russia and forcing America to its own destruction while siphoning off all the fat from the US economy into Jewish pockets. That Bedouin village is the Death of the US economy
