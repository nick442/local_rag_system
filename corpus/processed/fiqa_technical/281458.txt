Interesting. The real surprise here is preference. It seems not only do people but in person, they actually seem to mostly prefer it that way. Most spending being offline isn't too surprising, especially if you count corporate purchasing. The average consumer spend most of their money on things like gas and food, two products not normally available online. Also, big purchases like cats and houses aren't online either. But companies also often don't ship online. Think about a building contractor. He goes to the contractor store in the morning before going to the job site. Or about the heavy manufacturer. A lot of steel manufacturers require the customer to speak to a sales rep or even to meet in person, depending on the size of the deal.
