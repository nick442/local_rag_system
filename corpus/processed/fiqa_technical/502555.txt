"It's a quote from the article, hence the passage being put in quotations. It's already a ghetto, ""Today its population is closer to 10,000, about 90 percent of whom are black. The per capita income of its residents is roughly $10,000; about 60 percent of its population is on some form of public assistance. "" That's another quote from the article. You should really read the article, there's some real WTF stuff in there. If the exact same article had been published in the Washington Times instead of the New York Times, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson would be leading a protest claiming it was racist."
