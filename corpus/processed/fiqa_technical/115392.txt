I think the problem with AC is: It's junky - The entire city seems rundown and poor. The beach isn't very nice (compared to OC Md, Rehoboth, VA Beach, etc..). It's expensive - It seems like a room that would cost $200/night in Las Vegas always costs like $350 a night in Atlantic City. I live in Maryland. I vacation in Ocean City MD every year. AC is 30 minutes closer to me. If AC had Las Vegas hotel room prices and a nice beach I would go there every year.
