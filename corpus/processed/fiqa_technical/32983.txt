"No they aren't, they either can't afford fast food burgers anymore or they are willing to pay a little extra because they are ashamed of eating at Mcdonald's. All fast food is roughly equivalent, the differences are just perception and marketing. We probably all share the same concept of what Taco Bell and Chipotle represent: Taco Bell's are dirty and filled with stoners while Chipotle's are for younger hipper people who enjoy ""fresh"" food that won't make you shit yourself. They both sell fake Mexican food with ingredients that come from god knows where and are hastily assembled by surly teenagers. Is one better than the other? That's entirely subjective. Is one more likely to make your sick? Probably not, both companies probably have roughly equivalent quality control procedures. Does one have a better atmosphere? Personally, I think that can be chalked up to confirmation bias. You see Taco Bell's at gas stations and highway rest stops, in poorer neighborhoods, and Taco Bell has also been around for almost 40 years longer than Chipotle so of course some of the stores are a bit more run down. Americans aren't over fast food at all there is just more competition and the competition has great marketing."
