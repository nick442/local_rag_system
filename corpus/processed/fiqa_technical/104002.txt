I too was a former Applebuddy (barf). Still got that gold name tag somewhere. Some of the basic stuff was fine. Basically anything out of the frier. Boneless wings in BBQ sauce are pretty much just chicken nuggets at 95% of places anyway. Mexi-Ranch was the shit though. The steaks were fucking horrible though. So much salt it was ridiculous. The shrimp parmasean shit you could get on top made it sort of tolerable, but even then it was just a grilled salt brick.
