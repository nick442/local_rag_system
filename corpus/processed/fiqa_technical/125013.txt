The only thing dawning on me is that you claim to think critically and then literally minutes later do EXACTLY the thing I've been saying you do. You're putting all of terrorism on an entire group of people, and even worse, you're putting it on a group of people that statistics show ARE NOT the threat to worry about. But by all means, keep thinking critically about Fox News and all of the websites that you frequent. It's going great for you so far.
