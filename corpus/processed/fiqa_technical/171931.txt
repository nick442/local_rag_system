What to do when institutions stop lending you money, or lend at high rates? Live within your means! Your friend has shown financial behavior that indicates he's a bad credit risk. If he cleans up his act, banks will lend to him at reasonable rates again. Not a whole lot he can do except build his credit again. He didn't lose it overnight, and he won't get it back overnight either.
