My favorite story of a strategic default is from my friend who way overpaid for a house in the Bay Area. After the housing market fell, he bought a second home (with a separate mortgage), and THEN defaulted on the first house. The lender on the first house knew that he bought a 2nd home recently, but they couldn't go after it because it was securing a mortgage to a different bank. His credit score was ruined, but it didn't matter to him because you only really need credit for a new mortgage and he already bought a new house.
