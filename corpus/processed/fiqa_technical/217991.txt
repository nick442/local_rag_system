At the end of each period, add the interest, in this case an easy 1%, and then subtract the payment. With less than 4 months to payoff, the interest here is about $21. Instead of trying to find credit card calculators, just use the more common mortgage calculator. The math is the same until the final month, when the credit card may handle accrued interest slightly differently. Edit - A finance calculator indicates 3.407 payments, or total payment of $1022.12, $22.12 is interest. (from my initial guess of $21 above)
