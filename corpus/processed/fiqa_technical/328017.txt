Few companies are on such small margins that a tiny flip would cause profitable to unprofitable. But say overhead mandatory costs like insurances and other liabilities already eat up 60% of your gross profits then you're faced with another 5-15% increase in these costs. Would you continue working for only 25% of your gross profits? If you're already rich, why not retire? That's exactly what this guy is talking about. The guy obviously worked hard and sacraficed to get where he is, but at a certain point you receive less and less benefit from your efforts.
