I love when my professors would shit on greedy bankers during the housing market crash. One time, I made analogy of greedy banks to greedy education and the next bubble to pop which will crash the economy will be because of education costs and my professor flipped out! He told me college was a great investment and when I told him people said the same about homes he threw me out of class..never did get a refund either!
