> radio may find itself in dire straights as well. Although i agree for the time being it is better protected than TV. What are you talking about? Radio is mostly dead at this point. Most stations are owned by very few companies because most stations failed already. These big conglomerates bought them up and run mostly robo-DJs and syndicated content where there's no real local radio station, just a retransmitter that sends out programming created in a what is effectively a radio content factory. Radio has been in dire straits for the better part of decade and far worse off than TV.
