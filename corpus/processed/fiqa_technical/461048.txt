Just like they are cracking down gold and other stores of value? I'm unsure how you think that Bitcoin falls outside of regulations that apply to all wealth and stores of value. It's not like you are allowed to buy drugs or not pay taxes as long as you don't use US dollars. The fact that Bitcoin and all other crypto currency are not controlled by any single entity, government, or business that can control the rules at thier will is a pretty big deal. I would think the obvious freedom from a single corruptable entity seems pretty useful to me. Obviously the volitility and high transaction fees makes it a pretty questionable store of value - for now - considering the newness of Bitcoin - it's not really that surprising. At least those fees are based on the market and not just the whim of Visa.
