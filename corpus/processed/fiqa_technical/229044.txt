I'm a little confused -- you stated you're an accountant and that they are given a card, but in your reply, you are guessing and referring to other accountants instead of talking about your experience. Have you had any clients with the JPM Palladium, Centurion, Stratus, Coutts or First Royale cards? I know for a fact that 1% doesn't max out on Centurion (an individual purchased $170 million art at an auction and paid with his Centurion, earning him 170 million miles -- a lifetime of free travel)
