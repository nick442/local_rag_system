Get rid of the idea that monopolies are required. Arbiters and dispute resolution firms can replace courts, and actually already do for many large companies, since courts are absurdly slow and inconsistent. Police spend half of their money policing drug use and possession, despite the majority of people not wanting them even illegal. End the monopoly of police by government and we'll directly fund firms who enforce rules of each property. If your rules are absurd, nobody will go on your property. Businesses would have very reasonable rules and simple such as prohibition against violence and theft. Your complaints against insurance are dwarfed by government's waste. They routinely fail their customers and then make us pay for the mistake. Consider the failure of 9/11. We pay $Trillions for a national defense more costly than the next 25+ countries combined, and then when they fail and allow hijackers to ruin several buildings, WE and our kids and grandkids pay for it in higher taxes. They double down. Insurance companies lose customers when they have bad policy and consumer advocacy groups draw attention to it. Government just says FUCK YOU and their bureaucracy and social momentum (govt schools ensure very high support for govt as an unquestioned monopoly) allow them to continue without much opposition.
