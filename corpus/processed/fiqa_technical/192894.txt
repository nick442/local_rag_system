This isn't new. In the mid 80s rules were established by the IRS to differentiate life insurance from Modified Endowment Contracts, placing upper limits on how much money could be placed in life insurance accounts relative to the coverage provided and how quickly (fastest a policy can become paid-in-full is 7 years). None of this closes the fundamental loophole, but it exists for a reason, taxation of life insurance is probably unwise and would result in less people using life insurance as a risk mitigation technique, despite the fact that it's very appropriate for that in some situations. The problem here is that once you get out of everyday-people numbers and into very large sums the vehicle can be clearly abused to avoid taxes on investment gains while living, and possibly avoid them altogether depending on how the estate is structured, and this is bad for the average person who'd like the megarich to pay their percent towards the public needs the same way the average guy does.
