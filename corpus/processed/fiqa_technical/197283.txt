"> 26 It’s about synergies/1 + 1 = 3 = I don’t get the math either, but it sounds like more and more is better, right? This isn't correct. Synergies multiply, rather than add. That's where the increase comes from. You can see this with a cheap gradualistic combination lock, ie a lock that gives ""tells"" at each correctly guessed number. In that case, X + X + X tries are required to get the lock open, where X equals the numbers of characters on the dial, presuming a 3 numbered combination. If the lock is of high quality and doesn't give tells, the number of tries becomes X * X * X, which is much harder. This is a synergy. I'm assuming that you had to try ever number on the dial, which probably wouldn't be the case, but you get the idea. This is essentially how Turing defeated the German Enigma secret code machine in WWII. Also, evolution is like a gradualistic combination lock, because the environment gives ""tells"", ie positive feedback to an organism that mutates in a way that favors survival. Dawkings shows this in one of his Christmas Lectures."
