"If the strike price closest to the underlying has high open interest, the options expiration is a bigger event. For instance: stock is at $20 w/ average volume of 100,000 shares per day. 20 strike has 1000 open interest. In this example the stock will ""most likely"" pin at 20 if we were expiring tomorrow. As u prob know, long calls at 19.90 close, turn into stock..long puts at 20.10 turn into short stock. Option pros (high % of volume) dont want to be short or long after expiration. Long call holders will sell above 20 to hedge, and long put holders will buy below 20. 1000 open interest is equivalent to 100,000 shares. That's the same amount as the average volume. Stock can't really move until after expiration. If I am long 10 $20 calls, and short 1000 shares I am flat going into expiration...unless the stock gets smoked and now I am synthetically long a put..Short stock + long call= Long Put Then watch out cause it was artificially locked down."
