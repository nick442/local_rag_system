redethmoid, excellent questions and I appreciate that. The fact is that we do need employees in the workforce in all sectors, blue collar/white collar. The problem is the shift in the economy and how companies are responding to it. The corp execs only look at the bottom line especially when they are a public company(they have to impress wall street as their first priority). So what happens when profits and growth dip? They immediately start looking for ways to cut the budget and it's usually by firing/lay offs and/or offshore outsourcing. It's happening daily unfortunately. If you live in the U.S., there's no reason to be living in poverty. People are dying to get in this country because of the freedom and opportunities we have. It's all about mindset and how you view the world. Here's my advice. I don't know you or your background but I can feel the frustration and where your mindset is. First, remove the negative self talk from your language. Saying that you're broke and have no money will force the universe to leave you in that state. Start reading books on how to improve yourself first. Change starts with us, not outside forces. This is real shit my friend, not just some hype talk. Next, if you need a rat race job to make ends meet, then do it even if you have a college degree. Drop the ego and do what you gotta do. Find something that inspires you and you love to do and figure out how to make cash doing it. There are so many options out there, you just have to be willing to find them and open up your mind. I'll leave you with that for now. If you'd like to connect on social media and learn more about this topic, let me know and I'll give you my details. Have an awesome day! William
