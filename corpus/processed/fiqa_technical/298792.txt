Hang on. Lawyer here. Regarding the promised twelve loddars: why would the promise to pay the loddars be destroyed by the fire - unless the promise is eg conditional on the existence of apples at the relevant time (a more risky promise)? If it IS contingent on something in that way then surely it can't be said to be equivalent to loddars (money)?
