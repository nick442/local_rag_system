Since I haven't seen it in any of the comments so far, there's another reason - automation or obsoletion. How soon will we no longer need humans to work as machinists? I have no experience with the trade, so I certainly couldn't say. It's natural for labor needs to shift over time, but if they are shifting more quickly, and while shifting are also dwindling, one would imagine that it's more a difficult for a worker to stomach going to another trade school to pick up another trade that won't pay as well and for which the demand may evaporate, since they are less familiar with the prospects of its automation.
