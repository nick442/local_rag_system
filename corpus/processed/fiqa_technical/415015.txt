The tablet is great as well. It's the right size/weight, doesn't need a separate SIM card for Internet while away from wifi, and generally feels solid and polished. It's hard to believe from using it, that it was made by a company on the brink. I have an ipad3 to compare with, and while I really like the screen and Skype, it feels buggy and slow, and generally unfinished. I think the PlayBook is the better overall tablet (games, music, ssh, and email)
