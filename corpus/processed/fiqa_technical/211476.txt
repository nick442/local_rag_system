A look at the utility bills should give you an idea of the actual number of tenants. Some places- like I once read of Carmel, California- may require you prove you have enough water to support more rental cabins. You may find the nearby community is anti-growth. If a profitable expansion were possible, I'm wondering why the current owner didn't do it. Since a fire or flood could destroy all, you'll want to know what full replacement-value insurance and riders will cost. Can emergency vehicles travel the current roads, or is the new owner going to be liable for any costs to widen, cut back brush, and otherwise bring up to code? We did this on the access to our property, then the County graded it. If the location is so remote that a storm could cut you off, you'll want to mentally and physically prepare for this. I've lived in remote areas and it can be heavenly-until someone needs an emergency MediVac. Ensure you've got good antenna for CB or HAM-don't rely on cell alone.
