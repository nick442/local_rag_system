The tight lending standards such as elimination of low-documentation and sub-prime mortgages and requirements for lower loan to value, contribute to keeping all but those with pristine credit and cash reserves out of the market. Some might consider this good for long term stability in the market. I just went through doing a 20% down mortgage plus had to have one year extra liquidity in reserve.
