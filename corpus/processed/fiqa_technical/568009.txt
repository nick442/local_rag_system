We don't pay interest, we have credit ratings of 800+. I wouldn't be surprised at a drop from selling your house as you now have no installment debt and thus your debt mix doesn't look at good as it did. (This assumes you don't have something like a car loan but from what you say I don't think you do.) I am very surprised at the size of the drop, though. Is it possible that something went wrong and you ended up with some sort of ding from the sale or related events? Have you checked your report for anything that could have caused it?
