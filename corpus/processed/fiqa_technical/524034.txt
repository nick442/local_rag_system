If it were me, I would get a new checking account at potentially a new bank, but certainly with a new account number. As Nathan said, there is no need for you to cross her name off the check, but potentially, she could use those checks, or have new checks printed to use. Having her name on the check makes it seem like she is a legitimate signer on the account. In the end you can fight and possibly win with your bank that they should not have accepted a check signed by her as payment, but why bother? Also you will potentially alienate any merchant that accepts a check by her. It is a total mess that can be relatively easily solved with very little money ($25-$40 for check reprinting) proactively. Close the account, shred any existing checks, and move on. Heck you can actually make money by doing this and receiving a bonus. Check Nerd Wallet for current bank promotions.
