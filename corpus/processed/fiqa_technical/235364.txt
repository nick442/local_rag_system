Measures like GDP, unemployment, and wages are designed to measure the health of the economy. Those are the right measures to look at. When the economy is doing well, stock prices usually do well also, but not always. The stock market went up 23% in 2009, and the economy was in the shitter. And it shouldnt matter which newspaper published the numbers. If the numbers are right, the numbers are right. You dont need to hear GDP numbers on fox news to believe them.
