"In the words of David Einhorn, Flash Boys was ""based on a true story."" The way Lewis tells the story is extremely misleading, and you seem to have been suckered in. HFT has reduced spreads to a small fraction of what they were 20 years ago, they are awesome for average people, who are retail traders. Lewis uses ""ordinary investors"" to mean guys like Einhorn, who do suffer from HFT because they make it hard to buy large blocks of stock without moving the price. But it is not a God-given right to buy stock without moving the price against yourself, and guys like Einhorn now understand how to trade given the current market structure."
