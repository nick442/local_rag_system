"Haha listen to this guy. It was 20k respondent. And youre trying to draw conclusions that arent there. Oh no white people voted for someone! Better light my hair on fire. And no, dummy, they aren't significantly different methodologies from the prediction polls. The models are the same, collect a representative sample and try to infer wider trends. This was only a 20k sample size, by the way. Obviously something's up, they were way wrong all over the place. Your comment on margin of error is horseshit. 538 had her at 92 percent based on clearly skewed swing state data. They all jumped toward reality in the last week, then threw up their hands and said whew we are close, see see, not full of shit. ""All models are wrong, some models are useful"" Just some food for thought next time you try to thinly veil your political bias in snark and a undergrad understanding of stats."
