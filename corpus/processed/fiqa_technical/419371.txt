> Bernie Fucking Sanders. Elizabeth Warren? Ron Paul? Dennis Kucinich? .. you're obviously a corporate apologist. You assume a lot about me. I was involved in the Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul campaign in Austin and Dallas. Neither candidate made Texas ballot. You probably already know I didn't vote in those elections. Fun fact, Ron Paul was two days past deadline for petition to ballot access, Texas rejected and took him off the ballot. Obama was 20+ days past the deadline -- yet he was on the ballot anyway.
