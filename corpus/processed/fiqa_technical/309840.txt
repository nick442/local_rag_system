"I don't know about the technicalities of retirement accounts, but I would advise you to please please please do not use retirement money to buy a home. The reason for not ever wanting to spend your retirement is. when can you make it up? When you retire, you are by definition no longer earning money, so all your expenses can only come from the money you have saved. If you are willing to borrow from your retirement, it is not hard to imagine you are willing are willing to get a new car, or a new barbecue, or a new fishing boat before you repay yourself. So the question to ask yourself is, ""can I deal with renting for a few years knowing that I can retire comfortably, or am I willing to risk retirement to have a house now."" Part of the will power it takes to pay yourself first is not taking from your own savings. You cannot count on anybody but yourself to take care of you when you are old. It is just opinion, but risking a comfortable retirement for a home now is not a risk anybody should take."
