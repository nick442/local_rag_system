"OK, since you aren't a ""hoarder of wealth"" you wont have a problem with a progressive capital gains tax would you? Say 15% on the first $50,000 of gains, 30% up to $200,000 50% up to $500,000 and 90% on $1,000,000 and up. Keep in mind this is only on the gains from your capital. There are a lot of programs we could fund and people we could help with that tax money."
