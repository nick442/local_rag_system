Speaking as someone who manages their own HR for their small office business and has been through this before and knows full well the additional work involved from everyone, you'd be a proper dick if you let that influence your decisions. Yes I know it's difficult, but these are valued members of the team, human beings to boot, and I'll happily do the extra work. It's all part of being human. I know I could make it easy on myself and just hire men, but from a moral standpoint that's repugnant and I'd never bring myself to do that. Plus, prior planning for these eventualities makes it smoother. Not seamless, but not a massive shock either.
