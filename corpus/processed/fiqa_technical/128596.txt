I haven’t looked at their financials but the fact that everyone is getting into the SmartTV box space means they have very stiff competition. I personally have an AppleTV, FireTV, and a Roku. I love my Roku (headphone jack in the remote FTW) however one of my most used apps recently rolled out a major update and Roku was the last of the 3 (I believe chromecast got it earlier too) to receive the update, about 3+ months after my first device got it. If developers begin seeing Roku as a platform to develop for “when we get to it” then I see them suffering the same fate as, Windows, BlackBerry, and Amazon phones.
