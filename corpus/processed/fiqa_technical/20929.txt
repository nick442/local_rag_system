I wrote a simple monopoly simulation a few years back. The simulation handicapped one player for a set number of turns and then released the handicap eventually. Long story short, the initially handicapped player almost never recovered except when I handocapped the other players, bonussed the initially handicapped player and they had lucky turns. I ran this simulation tens of thousands of times. The reality is that there is a strong deterministic element to social and economic structures from generation to generation which require exceptional policy interventions or extraordinary players/people to overcome.
