"As the article states, traditionally, it's a majority percentage of teens and immigrants. Makes sense. My wife and I regularly volunteer with immigrants, some documented and some not, to assist in finding jobs and housing, so that still holds true. But, add to that the newer college grads who struggle to find ANY job. I don't have a perfect solution. I think most people pretend their agenda is the perfect solution. So if the research shows--and it does--that mandated minimum wage raise eliminates jobs, the solution lies elsewhere. As far as ""livable wage"" goes, that is partly determined by situation and partly by individual. Obviously, the individual has to be responsible for their share (frugality, minimizing debt, work ethic, etc). But what's not in their control could be helped on a situation to situation basis. What I mean is ""disadvantaged people"" needs to be defined before you can help them. If ""disadvantage people"" means ""recently graduated students"", then minimize their biggest financial burden of school loan interest rates. If it's lower-skilled workers like teens and SOME immigrants, get rid of the minimum wage and allow them to work those lower paying jobs while gaining experience. So on and so forth. As a business owner who makes around $30/hour, I can tell you I CAN'T afford to hire help at $19/hour to do simple tasks that would make me more productive. That killed a job right there. And it prevented me from freeing up my time to focus MORE on income-generating work, so I'm poorer for it too. As someone who volunteers with immigrants, I can't tell you how happy the people I've worked with would be to have more job opportunities."
