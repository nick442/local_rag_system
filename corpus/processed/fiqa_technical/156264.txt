"I think Amazon wants to compete with Walmart the same way Target competes with Walmart. California Walmarts are depressing. Target offers a somewhat better store with a little better products. My personal experience at Grossmont Center in La Mesa, where a target and a Walmart are anchor stores at either end of a mall, the difference is striking. I assume (not having shopped at Whole Foods) that Whole Foods has a lot of products that people love. I also assume they are spending a ton on stocking a lot of pricey items that don't move. They might also have whole sections that loose money that may be more trouble than they are worth - the former owners may have thought they drove foot traffic, but Amazon may think otherwise. In retail, the opportunity cost of having shelves full of crap no one buys is huge. The idea that shelf space is precious cannot be overstated. Amazon wants to use that badly-used shelf space for other stuff they know moves. Products they sell online already. Products their online stats says people who buy similar Whole Foods goods also buy. This means ""cheaper retail products"" - but I don't think it means expired yellow cake mix and a 30lb bucket of lard."
