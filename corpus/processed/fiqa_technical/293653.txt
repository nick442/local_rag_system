After transferring, do we need to file any forms to IRS regarding money transfer? Not immediately. Do we need to file any forms in US as part of tax returns for this transfer? In case the recipient and the sender are not the same person, the recipient must attach form 3520A to his/her tax return. If you are transferring between your own accounts - you're good to go. However, this NRE account must have been reported on your FBAR and form 8938 attached to your tax return. Do we need to inform my local bank in USA regarding the transfer in advance? You probably want to confirm the transfer instructions with them (SWIFT instructions, routing info, etc).
