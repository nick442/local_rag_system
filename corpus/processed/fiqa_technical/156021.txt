"Give a poorest person money and they will be pretty much guaranteed to spend it. This creates demand. Give a rich person money and what? It will be preferably used to generate some sort of rent -- that is it will give the rich person more money and give us less; because the price of something we need has gone up. *edit -- I slogged through every page of ""Wealth of Nations."" Adam Smith spends about half the book talking about the problem of rents. It seems even truer now."
