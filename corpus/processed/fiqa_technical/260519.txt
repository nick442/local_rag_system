Is all data in the company equally sensitive? Does everyone in the company have equal access to this type of sensitive information that would cost a company 'billions of dollars in fines' or is your argument that any work product of any employee in the company could result in such fines? Can you provide an example of any company ever paying a fine of such magnitude? If not what is the basis for your estimation of that number? Ok I'll take the stealth edit to mean you pulled it out of your ass which I already knew.
