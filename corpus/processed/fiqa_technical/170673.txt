Most countries tax income, but not a transfer of already taxed money, so you have nothing to worry about. You need to be prepared - if asked - to proof that the money was legally earned, and that you paid taxes for the income when you originally got it. Chances are small that anyone asks though, if you are not being investigated for other reasons already.
