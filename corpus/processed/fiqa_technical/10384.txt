Gas prices mysteriously drop every Autumn, and many people claim it's because of politics. Usually, for the past major elections, some Republicans in some form were up for election or re-election. Oil companies and economists claim gas prices always drop in the Autumn due to lower demand, production cycle, etc. This is the first time in 16 years a Democrat president is up for re-election (one particularly hated by the right-wing), and the gas prices *mysteriously* are rising in the Autumn (drastically, I might add) rather than falling like they usually do. Coincidence?
