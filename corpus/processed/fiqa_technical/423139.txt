.. or, I could just buy it from Walmart for the same price, and not have to lie. This is why I many people simply don't buy certain things on Amazon. Walmart does have a big edge here, there is no doubt about it. Amazon COULD close this gap if they started allowing automated fee-free returns at Whole Foods and Amazon Lockers (imagine you start a return, go to an Amazon locker, scan the code and drop it in the box.. box weighs item and prints receipt)
