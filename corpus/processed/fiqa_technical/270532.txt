Sorry to call you out on this, but your numbers are definitely off. If someone takes you seriously you'll be misleading them and I'd like to avoid that. Maybe you had this conversation with your friends many years ago when salaries were lower? The big consulting firms all have set base salary and signing bonus for all entry level positions in the US. Everyone in the starting class out of undergrand has the same starting salary (across all geographic regions). Depending on the firm and your performance, you then receive a year end bonus (or no bonus at all). For MBB, you can expect close to a 6 figure salary in your first year. With an MBA, you're closer to $200k with bonus.
