Anyone dissing America needs to realize how many people would kill for citizenship here. We have our flaws, like any other place on earth, but we are and always will be the land of the free and the home of the brave. As a woman, I've dealt with the last strands of sexism in this country and as a young adult I've dealt with the shitty hand my generation was dealt as far as housing and education but I wouldn't give my birthright up for anything. All I have to say is, we still run the world and however fucked our government is right now, we will ALWAYS learn and grow and prosper. If you don't appreciate all that America is , GET OUT!
