Maybe a bit under the radar for the average/amateur investor, but I love 'em. Started trading them in college. I love the variety of strategies one can employ, and risk management is easier (to me) than going long or short the underlying in many cases. Pick up Hull's text on Futures, Options and Derivatives for your starter reading, then pick an economic sector that makes the most sense to you and learn it. For me, it was ag crops - corn, wheat and soybeans. Keep learning the mechanics of trading this asset class and paper trade for as long as you can.
