ITT: people who don't understand how batteries work. When your phone charge goes to zero, it's not actually zero. It just stops at that point to preserve the battery life. You can use more energy from the battery at the expense of the longevity of the battery. Tesla just made an update to give out the extra battery juice now despite threatening the overall battery health in the long run.
