[Here's the link to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's first-ever survey of financial well-being.](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201709_cfpb_financial-well-being-in-America.pdf) The conclusion on pg. 68 is where the relevant bits are summarized. It opens with: >This report provides a first-of-its-kind view into the state of financial well-being in America. Overall, we find that the financial well-being of U.S. adults varies widely, and that a large percentage of people are financially fragile. **At the average U.S. financial well-being score, roughly one-third of individuals have difficulty making ends meet and approximately one out of five sometimes have difficulty paying for basic needs like food, housing, and medical care.** At the same time, the results show numerous potential opportunities to improve the financial well- being of significant portions of the U.S. adult population.
