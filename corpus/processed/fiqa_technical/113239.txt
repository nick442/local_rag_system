You'll get a range of answers, but with microLearning, you present a short block of content – less than three minutes – your learner can quickly master and immediately put to use. My 'rules' for each microLearning object are: * Should take a learner 3 minutes or less to master. * Is complete and presents a single learning objective. * Is one in a sequence that progress a learner toward a larger learning objective. * Delivers helpful content that is of value to the learner. * Is easily accessible to learners as part of their daily routine. Each object should provide: * The content * The context for the content (where it fits in the larger training picture) * Why the content is of value (WIIFM) * A call to action * Guidance for reflective practice https://learningstream.ie/microlearning-your-time-has-come/
