Happened to my girlfriend at a non-profit that had really generous maternity leave. She had been in a manager-esque position there for something like 5 years at that point and had been far too generous with her commitment for being an hourly employee. She really wasn't a manager but she picked up the slack for other people and was generally considered second-in-command. Boss leaves for another opportunity, recommends her for his job - she thinks she is set. Instead, they hire someone outside on who only has slightly more experience. The day the new girl starts, she tells them she is pregnant. She works for literally a week before going on maternity leave for six months. Meanwhile, my gf has already been taking over all management duties as an hourly employee with no pay improvement for the six months to fill the position and now has to do the same work for six more months, no increased compensation, no salary. I told her to straight up quit and leave them in a bind.
