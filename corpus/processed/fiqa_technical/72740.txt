The guy is your boss/super? I still don't understand why his lawyer would need *your* credentials. It definitely still does sound sketchy, and in the future I'd ask more questions. Personally I'd tell anyone not HR asking for something like that to piss off. You aren't a client of that guy's lawyer, if he needs anything specifically from you, he can contact you and explain it. But what's done is done, if anything malicious happens it's definitely on him.
