Hmm, but pretty much all the smart money was on the stock not doing so hot in the first place. Leading up to the IPO there seemed to be more evidence just browsing sites like Fortune, Forbes, Reuters and the like against buying FB than there was to buy it. A lot of people probably just got suckered into the hype.
