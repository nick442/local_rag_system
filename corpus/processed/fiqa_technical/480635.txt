>American politics is pretty utterly fucked isn't it? Haha, I think that's the one thing most sides can agree on. >That's interesting, and I've heard it before. Is something like this writer outlines what you are thinking? Essentially remove corporate taxes, and then tax dividends and capital gains as normal income? Yeah I like the idea for a few reasons. Incentivizes investments in America (capital is far more mobile than labor or even capital owners), gets rid of malinvestment of tax avoidance, sticks taxation exactly where we want it (in this case capital owners instead of random incidence among labor/capital/consumers), and cuts other deadweight losses inherent in a corporate income tax. It's really hard for me to understand why almost anyone would be against this. It's a progressive, pro-growth, anti-crony idea.
