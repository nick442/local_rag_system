How many are PDF's? Is it enough that you must have an OCR tool? Word and HTML should be trivial to search through. You could get an IT guy or software engineer to sift through it using [catdoc](http://linux.die.net/man/1/catdoc) to convert the Word files to plain text and use [grep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) to search for keywords. You could do it yourself if you're familiar with using linux command-line.
