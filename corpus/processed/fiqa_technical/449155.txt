I don't think there could be a better response, thank you. This example is actually quite close to my own. After lots of crappy jobs and bad experiences finding jobs, I knew there was a better way to find a job you really fit into, but having no business experience outside of freelancing, starting it as a hobby seemed like a good idea. I actually work in IT by trade. This is something I'm very passionate about, and I hope I can use it to make a difference in someone's life. Your site looks amazing. It's look great and I'm happy for you.
