"Unless you have a good handle on what niches the startups of yesteryear were entering I think it is hard to get a handle on why there is a decline. Is this a decline in the number of restaurants being started or is this a decline in the number of internet startups. The reasons will depend on the character of the startups. One trend I think is pretty common is the decline of the local market. The internet and free shipping makes the internet the growth area for specialized commerce. So many commerce niches are threatened it would take a real optimist to consider a start-up in a niche that is essentially being the local distributor for something people can get more cheaply on-line. Then there is the idea that, ""local"" doesn't mean the same thing as it did even 30 years ago as people drive further to get the essentials at big box stores. A declining main street of a small town, or a declining mall in the suburbs isn't an attractive place to be an entrepreneur. On the other hand competing in the big box strip on the edge of town has its own challenge: people are shopping at 80km/hr and you need a huge storefront and/or a huge advertising budget even to get noticed. If the decline is in the number of restaurant startups, it might be that this is related to a decline in middleclass disposable income. If it is a decline in internet startups, perhaps it is just showing a maturing of the industry from a fast growth phase where all sorts of unfilled niches were open for the quick entrepreneur to a more mature market where the internet is consolidating with a few behemoths taking up all the oxygen."
