I do, however, there was consternation in this thread of overblown criticisms of the TSA. One of them that is not overblown is that many people have been told they cannot opt-out of the screening, even though they can. That's one of the least problems that has arisen from people having to go through TSA security checkpoints. The counter-argument in this thread seems to be that, well other countries are even worse so it's not really that bad. I see no reason why the US airport transit should suck, when there are lots of countries that get it right.
