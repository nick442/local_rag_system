Okay, keep apologizing for the brutal and savage economic system we have. Guess things must be working out okay for you. Hope it keeps going that way for you but most have already been thrown to the wolves. We aren't even making an effort to try the ideas of socialism any more. The attempts that have been made are the building blocks to a better economy. Learn from the mistakes and stop sabotaging any country trying.
