They are not? McKesson basically holds independent pharmacies who do business with them at gun point. Contracts are structured in such a way which states a pharmacy must spend 90 - 95% of their monthly drug expenses on McKesson. Meaning, they are free to inflate the prices as much as they want and the pharmacies can't do anything about it as they are contractually obligated to buy from them. Furthermore, the savings incentives they offer independent pharmacies are through rebate spend, and they introduce really convoluted rebates. Further masking their actual price for cost of goods and also discouraging spending outside their website. Often the pharmacist does not have the time to keep track of what is on rebate and shopping around may put them in serious risk of loosing out on money or fines. You may wonder why pharmacies sign such unfavorable contracts. The answer is there aren't many players in the industry who can provide all the drugs required to run a pharmacy. The much cheaper alternate suppliers do not have the inventory and drug selection. A pharmacy can shop around, and there are some that do, but the vast majority do not have the manpower to do so. I will state, I am no pharmacist, but being around pharmacy owners, they blame the wholesalers for how corrupt the system is.
