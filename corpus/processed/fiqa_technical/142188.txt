1. It doesn't have an almost perfect negative correlation - its value decays very fast because of time. In fact, something like 80% of options expire worthless. They typically have a lifespan of 30-90 days and unless you're using them as a way to earn excess return, you'll likely just throw away your premium. 2. You're also making some assumptions about correlation and risk/reward. You won't become wealthy by distributing risk, all you can hope for is less volatility - maybe that's what you're looking for - but you can also expect your return to be less than the market over almost any period of time. 3. Options aren't really for diversifying. Furthermore, why diversify? It's a myth that it adds any value. There's around a 90% correlation for all asset classes since around 2000, so you're being sold some blue sky if someone tells you otherwise. 4. Look up prices of put options. 1-2% of your portfolio might buy you a handful of options, but again, there's a high probability you'll lose that 1-2% entirely every 30-90 days.
