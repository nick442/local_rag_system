Well this was an interesting read, but sadly no one has given me anything I asked for. I'm not complaining, as I didn't expect a complete stranger to actually tell me how much they make, but I figured it'd be worth a try. Anyway, I'm gonna assume that you work in NY? If so, what were your starting hours like (approx) and also, do you work as a quant, cause it seems (correct me if I'm wrong) that you're describing an I-Banking job. Also, if you feel comfortable, a starting salary would be helpful as well. I'm trying to get real figures here cause everyone that I ask tells me something different. Finally, I haven't completely taken NY off the table as an option, I would just prefer Toronto if it's possible.
