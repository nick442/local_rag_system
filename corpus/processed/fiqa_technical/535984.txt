Considering that Roku isn't even profitable I'm going to say that any increase in short term price is going to be a result of investor speculation because these rich dudes who have accounts at big wealth management divisions want to get in quick because they think it's another amazing tech company that's going to bring in billions and everyone knows that technology is always going to improve. I said the same thing about the Blue Apron IPO. They're not even profitable! Businesses exist to make a profit lol I don't get it. There's better things to actually invest in this current bull market, these tech IPOs seem to excite everyone's investor emotions. That's just my opinion though I mean I'm just a kid lol Edit: I should also mention my household completely got rid of cable a few months ago and picked up a few of the Roku devices. They work great so far and are cheaper than cable. It's not a terrible product in my opinion.
