"The government forced JPM to buy Bear Stearns (essentially acquire its assets) otherwise the bank's liquidity would have faltered, which would have threatened the entire system (basically Bear Stearns couldn't service its own loans or leverage so it had to be bought otherwise those loans and leverage would appear as a default). Consequently the US government gave them the money to do it and forced them to do so, without regard to what JPM wanted to do. The government, the Treasury and the Fed then proceeded to attack JPM for being ""too big to fail,"" something that the government literally forced it to become. I'm not a banking apologist or a crazy libertarian (I would vote democrat if I lived in the US) but this is NOT accurate. The purchase of Bear Stearns was forced. It would've made more sense for JPM to just let Bear Stearns fail. Following your analogy, it's actually more like you already having a million dollar house, while the government forces you to take money to purchase the derelict house across the street, while leaving you with the bill for amalgamating your properties into one huge estate. Then, the government tells you your property is too big, that you are a threat to the neighbourhood and have to subdivide all over again."
