"> I agree with the culture leading to the lack of creativity, but that has nothing to do with the language. Before the current iteration of the Chinese government, the Chinese were some of the most inventive people in the world, the first to discover a ridiculously large number of technologies far before the Western world would even come close to that level of scientific advancement. In addition, I personally believe that the poetry from the more classical eras of Chinese history is mind-blowingly beautiful, in all regards equal to any Western literature you compare it to. Yes but how literate was the populace as a whole in this era? I've seen some of the most creative, inventive things come from uneducated people. There's something to be said for the creativity of idle hands. edit: I wasn't limiting my comment to Chinese culture only. Other ""asian"" cultures have come to the US and succeeded. But indeed the written Chinese language, and the learning of it, tends to apply well to mathematical skills. And western people who spend time learning Chinese and the written language, as a side effect, tend to improve in their mathematical skills as well. We live in a weird world."
