Hot dogs - counts as part of the food basket. Hardly one-off. Cars - maybe could be included. On average, people buy cars every 5 years, so 12 cars for an 80 year old. Gas - that one could well be warranted, the problem is the high volatility and the fact that fluctuations are not due to inflation, but rather commodity price fluctuations. All the other stuff (phones, tvâ€™s, Appliances, etc) is stuff that needs to be replaced several times throughout a persons life, so not one-off purchases. House prices can and should address d through other mechanisms that have nothing to do with inflation. Either through better planning codes or macro prudential measures, but certainly not through manipulating interest rates.
