You assume a high IQ will be a requisite of having a value-add position in the future economy when there is absolutely nothing to show that will be the case. You understand that Amazon employs PLENTY of people in positions requiring little to no specialized skills, correct? Along with a myriad of other companies which are coming into the economic sphere. Police will still be a thing, firefighters will still be a thing, plumbers will still be a thing, electricians will still be a thing, carpenters will still be a thing, construction workers will still be a thing. Everything you're saying now was espoused during the industrial revolution, and little of it ever came to fruition.
