"What? No, not at all. Not even a little bit. The argument rajan made in his book is that political elites were looking for easy fixes to stagnant wages at the bottom, which were caused by large scale forces like globalization and information tech, but those problems are hard to deal with, so insteas they ""let them eat credit."" They lowered home loan standards and gave them govt guarantees in order to give them higher standards of living, and of course it collapsed. I think his views are different than krugman, who i would guess would actually be supportive of such an absurd idea. Least do a cursory search before making a cynical self-congratulatory comment"
