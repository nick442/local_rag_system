I wouldn't even say it's amazing at UX. Once upon a time it was, but these days it has lost a ton of ground. Take a look at iTunes. With every iteration it has someone managed to get worse and less user friendly. Honestly Apple's strength is it's brand perception. Like you said, a huge amount of its fan base is convinced that the slightest changes are must have features and that their products are superior simply by virtue of being an Apple product.
