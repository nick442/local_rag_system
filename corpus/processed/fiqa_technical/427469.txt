If significant amounts are involved, that would be a good time to consult a tax professional (EA/CPA licensed in your state). Generally, sale of a business is an ordinary income and you can only deduct tangible expenses, as Joe said. That would be laptops, bills, expenses per receipt, of course they must all be directly attributable to the business. You will need to be able to show that the laptops has only been used in business, recapture depreciation, etc. Same with all the rest of the expenses. If you're incorporated (i.e.: you hold this software under an S-Corp), then you're selling stocks, not business, and the tax treatment may be different, but I'm guessing this is not the case for you.
