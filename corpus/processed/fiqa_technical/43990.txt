CD's are not compressed. Later specifications added surround sound encoding, higher sampling rates and bit depths. Compression, especially lossy compression, is a different animal and some later formats may use some form of compression but the CD version of PCM encoding is not considered compression. The spec was designed to exceed the range of normal human hearing and if properly implemented it's suitable for that purpose. There are a lot variations in terms of recording, mastering and playback in terms of the quality of the gear involved and the techniques used which is probably what the sentence you quoted meant (I.e. CD Recorded on a cheap setup using default settings and playing it back on a budget consumer player might not sound as good as a vinyl record mastered by a pro and played back on a high quality pickup connected to an audiophile grade amplifier and speakers; and vice versa)
