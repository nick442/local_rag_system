Just look at what happened in California. They don't get tipped any less but the problem is that there then becomes this huge gap where people aren't incentivized to work any other mildly skilled to skilled job where tips are less often and/or not as high to non-existent such as becoming a nurse or a hairstylist or plumber or electrician. So for instance where I live theres a huge shortage of people in a lot of jobs with low to mid skills and a gigantic surplus of waiters making minimum wage + tips (where CA forces restaurant minimum wage plus tips). Not to mention CA has stepped process to make the minimum wage $15/hr and anything worked over 8 hours becomes OT. This makes working as a server lucrative as hell compared to many other positions.
