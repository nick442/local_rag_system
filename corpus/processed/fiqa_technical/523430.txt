> See where? The grain farming regions. At least that's the kind of farming I consider enjoyable. Maybe some would rather pick apples, I guess. > Most likely they are shit at advertising their job openings I see the jobs posted in the same places as you would expect to find other jobs. I don't see anything unique about that. However, I think you bring up a good point: People tend to search for job by area. These are not areas people tend to look in. > the potential market has transportation issues and can't get to a job not near a bus route. I think it is simpler than that: Nobody wants to live in rural areas. People are choosing to live in cities and then are restricting their job search to the jobs that can be done in the city they have found themselves in. Some amount of money can change minds, but I'm not convinced $35/hr. is it.
