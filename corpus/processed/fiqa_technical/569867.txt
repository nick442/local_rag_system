I agree with your post 100% on this question: > What is it that allows some people to break out of rigid patterns of thought, i.e. routines? It seems to be simply the belief that one, first off, should and second that they actually have the ability too. I believe a lot of that probably comes from culture/environment. This is why left leaning people sometimes annoy me. With all of their good intentions and aspirations of social justice, they don't realize how much they are fucking over and disempowering young black kids by telling them that the system is stacked against them.
