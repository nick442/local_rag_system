It's unmanaged resources you have to be an idiot to put your private corporate dateaup there even if it is locally encrypted. I work for a large company that deals with a lot of high end tech patents and we just had a huge security issue come up because our engineers were using Dropbox with internal items. We have now setup Mobilecho for a corporate Dropbox and will be deploying that across the board on top of our mobileiron mdm solution.
