Why are we pretending Mexico is some boiling cauldron these people are being thrown into? There are some areas to avoid for sure but if you aren't into illegal things and take skills you should have learned here and apply them there you'll be a big success in Mexico and you can visit US because Mexicans already get preference. And if you learn a skill you can come here on a work visa. I'm guessing people who act like this is a huge deal don't get out of the country much.
