I don't know what the fee is, I just made up $5 as an example. It doesn't surprise me at all that Comcast is charging $20. I don't really mind that I don't have on demand, it doesn't bother me. But after the disaster that CableCards were, there was no chance that tru2way was going to work if the industry had any say in it. They forced the failure of CableCards, and none of their reasons for opposing them went away.
