Well, I am no expert but I have been holding the stock since it was sub-4 and when it was 18 I thought it could still go to 30. Ford has increased sales while increasing prices. the 2013 fusion/modeo looks to be killer and the hybrid competes with prius, 47 mpg highway from a mid-size sedan (the current leader toyota camry hybrid released this year only gets 43). (aggresively?) Ramping up production in developing markets. The small cars are huge hits and once myfordtouch catches on with the general public and gets it's kinks worked out it will be a game changer. If you look at what customers are saying it is a reason to buy a Ford. Also it is good with the long run because the f-150 is the most sold vehicle and one of the most profitable. TL;DR I will hold this stock until Mullally(CEO) leaves
