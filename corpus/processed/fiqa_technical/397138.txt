What I'm asking is, what's bitcoins cup of coffee? I understand it works now, it's value makes sense and nothing your saying is wrong but that's not what I'm saying. Pork bellies will still make bacon even if no single person in the world wants to buy a pork belly. This isn't the case for bitcoin, or any fiat currency for that matter. BUT other fiat currencies have a much more established place in the market when compared to bitcoin. That's all I'm saying. It's a volatile value and the price fluctuation alone proves that.
