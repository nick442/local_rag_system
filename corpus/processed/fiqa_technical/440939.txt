I read GoDaddy's explanation on SOFA on their site. Let me say, it's terrible and any undergrad could have written that. The person who wrote that throws everything she has at the issue -- hoping one of the explanation will convince you. I mean -- since when does GoDaddy care about old ladies being scammed on pharmaceutical drugs? Seems fishy. Also, the woman brags about how Go Daddy is influential in several bills on the Hill, and SOPA is one of them. She is clearly a attention seeking lawyer. Disgusting.
