Tesla is a horrible model in terms of sustainability. It's just the electric version of a penis car* like a Ferrari. It's battery is equivalent to over a 1000+ laptop batteries? Where would we strip mine all that material if most people got one? And his solar panel assembly must be either huge ass expensive or he doesn't drive much or use much electricity. I always thought a series hybrid like Aptera would have been the way to go in this world toward sustainability. *Family Guy.
