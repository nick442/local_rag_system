I'm aware of how credit cards work, in fact I basically said the same thing in my original comment. >because you get this nifty smartphone pluggable credit card swiper, you end up paying more than the alternate options. Granted I am in no way knowledgeable of the alternates (as in, mobile credit card machines?), but I assume they aren't as easy to set up. -Square costs more -Other options aren't easy I guess my inquiry should be more targeted towards how regular credit card transactions are processed in the mobile space. Honestly I have no idea, and I assume that's why Square is popular. I still see some places at the farmers market with the carbon copy slider thing, but then I also see some rocking what seems to be a regular credit card swiping gizmo. Making 0% on a nonsale vs 90% on a square sale obviously makes sense, but I'm wondering if there's a less convenient, although more profitable sale (regular 97% Visa/MC) that people simply aren't aware of.
