>Gate agents earn $25,000 to $50,000 a year in wages and benefits, Please remember this next time you travel, folks. In my old position, I would travel once a month (I realize this is nothing for many biz travelers) and I would always hate seeing the entitled FlyerTalk-types or the ignorant adults on personal travel bickering with one gate attendant in a busy place like ATL. Big pet peeve of mine. Also, if you're nice, it can pay off. I've gotten bumped (on purpose) for far more than the initial offer because I was nice, calm and patient. The second airport pet peeve of mine is everyone bumrushing the gate when your zone **isn't** called. I understand when your row is called, but to try and cheat the system slows everyone down. These machines would be able to determine zones, I gather.
