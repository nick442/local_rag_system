"Why ""lab meat"" is ""terrible""? Do you know that cows, sheep, farm pigs, goats, chicken, etc are artificial animals that not one of them exist in nature? They are all genetically modified from some original 10,000 years ago (except the Turkey, discovered when America was discovered, and in less than 200 years, a farm-Turkey does not even resemble a wild Turkey.) Do you prefer pregnancy, birth, labor intensive, antibiotics, diseases, feeding, slaughtering, butchering, etc involved in raising a cow until it becomes a hamburger on your plate? Once people thought that Coca Cola, Cigarettes, etc are the best for them.. because of Marketing. With proper and simple truthful marketing, people would prefer lab meat compared to farm meat."
