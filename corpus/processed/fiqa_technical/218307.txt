"Many years ago you used to be able to purchase ""currency packs"" that were combined bundles of currencies from western Europe based on the number of days you would be spending in each country. The exchange rates on these were very favorable and they had minimal surcharges. With the rise of the euro I doubt these bundles are still available as I haven't seen them myself in about 10 years."
