"Natural seasonings is annoying. Note that it's often mandated too, as in you can't put what it actually is, and must say ""natural seasonings."" There are other issues too. Lots of processing aids may be omitted if they have no nutritional impact, and that seems very wrong to me. But the ""made with 100% chicken"" thing still seems fair. My biggest complaint is the ""no added nitrites (except for the nitrites we added)"" but that's mostly because it's the one I encounter the most."
