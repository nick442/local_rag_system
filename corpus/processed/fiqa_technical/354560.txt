I've had loans from B of A and Wells Fargo, and both have always been quick to correct any mistakes and work with me on any problems. I think it may be partly due to the fact that I understand the problem, can clearly tell them what I expect, and I treat them like an equal that would want to help fix the problem. Some people seen to always have problems, and others seem to never have them. I believe there is a reason for that.
