Not true. When men are given the option to share mat leave with their partner, the woman takes the maximum she can in the majority of cases. It's due partly, I'm sure, to stereotypically stronger maternal instinct but, mainly, men tend to be better paid than their spouses and losing 20% of his salary hurts the family more than losing 20% of hers.
