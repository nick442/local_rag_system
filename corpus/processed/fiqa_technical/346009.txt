The bond will rank below depositors, so it's riskier than the savings account. The savings account is very safe if you have less than Â£75,000 in accounts with the bank, as then it would be covered by the deposit guarantee Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Also note that bonds tend to have a fixed maturity whereas savings accounts usually let you get your money out at any time, perhaps with some notice.
