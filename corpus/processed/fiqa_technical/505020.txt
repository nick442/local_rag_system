"I find it funny that people complain when the electorate votes for things contrary to their own self interest. Yet in most other contexts it's admirable to do so. Imagine saying ""OMG all these white people voting for civil rights for blacks. What the hell are they thinking?"" ""OMG all these well-to-do suburbanites voting for food stamp policy. What the hell are they thinking?"" ""OMG this guy is voting to legalize drugs but he's never done drugs himself!"" The list goes on and on. Stop trying to train voters to be more selfish. It's unhealthy. We should be training people to vote for what they think is right. Period. If people are able to rise above their own self-interests and vote for what they think is right (see above examples) they should be commended not condescended to."
