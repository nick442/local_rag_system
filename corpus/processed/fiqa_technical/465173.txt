You can't automate a Subway. It's already 1 worker there. Making Sandwiches, running the cashier etc. All it would do is eat into the franchisee's profit margin. And if it can't compete paying high wages, who cares? That's what the market is all about. We don't want industries that don't pay living wages. Let them expire. Just like we don't want industries that rely on filling our rivers with poison chemicals. Let them expire so that new industries can take their place in the market.
