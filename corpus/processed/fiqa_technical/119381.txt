> Ever considered that I'm not even American? So basing my arguments on your constitution wouldn't make sense to me. Okay, my bad. My assumption was wrong. But now you are left with no support to your claims about what a social contract can be. > Capitalism is barter. You don't neither need government enforcement nor centralized currencies.. If that is true, how do you explain that capitalism didn't start until the 16th century, after private property and currencies were already established? > Capitalism does not require maintenance.. I never said it did. I said when someone can work because of government services it makes sense part of that person's income should go to maintain/improve those services. > Are you seriously going to base your arguments on a game.. My argument was that a capitalist system without wealth redistribution is unstable. Monopoly is a simple illustration as to why. I consider my argument unchallenged if your only criticism is my choice of example.
