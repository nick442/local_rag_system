"How is this anticompetitive? You're welcome to buy goods from someone other than Amazon, Amazon isnt colluding with other vendors to do the same, or sell at the same price.. If Amazon decided tomorrow ""I dont want to carry this Disney shit"" I dont see how thats anti-competitive. Amazon has a strong negotiating position however."
