The big news houses have struggled to grasp the crypto space. Most articles by Bloomberg etc are riddled with errors, but in time, the quality and depth of analysis will improve. Though many are quick to call bubble, one can argue that the crypto space had its bubble before it crashed, largely before there was any improvement or development in the tech. Today, there is heavy investment and development, including many Fortune 500 companies who have joined EEA. The winners and losers will shake out, and only then will large institutional investors begin to consider this as an investable space (largely as hedges against adverse affects in other currencies and asset classes).
