Walmart now accelerating roll-out of fully automated warehouse and distribution centre technology; materials handling events to go down by seventy percent post-deployment. That's probably what the announcement's going to be about. And seventy percent less product-related work to be done in a warehouse means seventy percent fewer floor workers, meaning that all those employees striking today will have their positions restructured by the end of the year. And yes, their HR department is staffed by dementors, but damn their supply chain is like a curvy set of tits to those who've studied it; you can't help but want to play with it. A lot. Good stuff.
