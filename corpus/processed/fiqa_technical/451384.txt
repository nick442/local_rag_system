You missed the point of my post entirely. I don't have an issue with Walmarts tax rate, I'm stating that if all their employee's unionized and demanded livable wages that the corporation could pay them without even losing 20% of their net profits. At that point, perhaps the U.S. govt wouldn't have to pay the est 3 billion in assistance payments these employee's currently get. Comes down to making a company pay it's work force. Don't even imply that it would hurt their bottom line. It wouldn't.
