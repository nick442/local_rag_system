Phones set to automatically pick the carrier/network will go bounce around a lot internationally (probably due to signal strength). The phones probably saw the other networks providing stronger signal and so they switched. Manually picking the network should prevent this from happening, unless the network has towers on both sides of the border, then there's something fishy going on. I'm not sure if Verizon does it, but AT&T messages you when you go somewhere not in your plan and tells you how much it will cost to use data and call. That could have alerted these people to the issue before they were charged hundreds of dollars.
