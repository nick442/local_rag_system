"If it were the case that people magically had a heart attack when enough people clicked a ""I hate this person"" button on hatebook.com or whatever, then yes, because that goes beyond hate and into actual harm. However, that is not the case. Hate speech does not actually harm anything or anyone. Here in the real world, saying ""X doesn't belong here"" or ""I hate X"" or ""I wish X didn't exist"" or ""the world would be a better place without X"" doesn't hurt anyone (unless it's targeted bullying and harassment, but that's not what we're talking about here). If they're threatening or calling to violence (e.g. ""I encourage everyone to punch every X you come across""), they have gone beyond hate speech. If they're incessantly harassing a particular person or organization, they have gone beyond hate speech. Having a forum at wehateXgroup.com where everybody talks about how much they hate X doesn't hurt anybody, and anyone who is bothered by that website can just not go there."
