"It's a shame that a guy like Krugman has to start an article with the title ""This isn't just political spin:.."" The guy has used up his credibility. I remember watching some sort of show during the last election cycle where someone said something to the effect of , ""major economsts say XYZ"" and the farmer he was talking to said ""which ones?"" ""Paul Krugman"" Whereupon the farmer gives a dismissive wave. He could be 100% right. But he's burned it all up."
