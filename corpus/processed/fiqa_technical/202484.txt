Alternatives like free-market capitalism? I'm not convinced that the Chinese model is superior to any alternatives, especially capitalism. The Western world was built on free-market capitalism and China was left in the dust for decades under the Maoist regime. China's strange mix of communism and capitalism has definitely benefited their economy, but it wasn't the communism part that did it, it was opening their economy that did it. I can't see how the bureaucracy and control of the state has benefited their economy beyond keeping everyone in the dark about the actual solidity of their economy. It seems like government planned expansion and development is just a scheme to pump money into their economy to keep it afloat. I think it's a bubble and it's bound to pop at some point, with potentially catastrophic consequences. I'm not normally some doom-sayer, but the Chinese economy looks like a house of cards from the outside without further critical analysis.
