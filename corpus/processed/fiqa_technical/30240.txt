I think part of it is because we put our information on LinkedIn with intent that LinkedIn use it for a single purpose that is beneficial to us. And then LinkedIn - this is going to be shocking, brace yourself - uses it for that purpose, and both us and LinkedIn benefit. I mean, call me nuts, but if LinkedIn uses my information to get me a new job that pays 20% more, and they make a few thousand bucks in the process, I'm not exactly going to begrudge it to them. Meanwhile, Facebook sells my personal information to advertisers and tries to get me to spam my friends.
