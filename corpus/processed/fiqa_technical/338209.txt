That’s not a mirage. That’s tilting the odds in investors’ favor. > -Morningstar It's as if the CEO hasn't read the article at all. A stark contrast with: >For funds that had an overall five-star rating at any point, the Journal found that their average Morningstar rating for the following five years was three stars—in other words, halfway between the top and the bottom. >...Of those that merited the five-star badge, a mere 10% earned five stars for their performance over the following three years. Only 7% merited five stars for the following five years, and 6% did for 10 years. >-WSJ Another excerpt.. >When funds picked up a fifth star for the first time during the period included in the Journal’s analysis, half of them held on to it for just three months before their performance and rating weakened. >For all of the measured periods—three, five and 10 years—five-star domestic equity funds were more likely to turn in a one-star performance than a top one. >That means a five-star rating for the equity funds was no more an omen of success than it was one of failure. >-WSJ
