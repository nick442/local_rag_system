I found this number pretty interesting: > Over the past 12 months, according to the JOLTS survey, there were 62.9 million hires while separations totaled 60.7 million, resulting in a net job gain of 2.2 million for the period ending April 30. If true, that means that about 50% of the 126 million households in the US experienced a job loss in the past 12 months. Does that seem realistic?
