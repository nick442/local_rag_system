As the article says, selling warranties & one on one tutorials is a benchmark for individual sales ability. I don't know about Prada, but yes - many upscale department stores do still offer commission. And just about *every* store has something to upsell you on. I don't mean to debate the merits of a commission-based sales system; I'm just pointing out that the competition (Sprint/Verizon) use one. And pay better as a result.
