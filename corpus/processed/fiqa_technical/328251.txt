It depends on the people. I once worked in corporate finance in a fairly large (now very large) oil company. In our unit we were entirely motivated by career, money, bonuses, etc. I had a staff of middle-aged females working for me and at first I couldn't figure out how to motivate them. I realized after a few months that they just wanted things like a pizza party once a month and the little crap like that.
