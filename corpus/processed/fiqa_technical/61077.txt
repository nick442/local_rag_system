Thank you this response introduced me to a lot of new information to research. I find this a lot more rational than a lot of the replies on here, purely because I don't believe there's a large enough intrinsic difference between people of different races that it would make or break entire countries. I know plenty of unsuccessful white people and plenty of successful black people, I just don't think racism is rational IMO. Following the money like this is really illustrative of what is truly plaguing these countries. As someone else said and I now believe to be true after reading a little, I think there's a huge huge grown potential in these countries if the governments can get their shit together.
