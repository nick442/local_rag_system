Although, I really want to side with Jon Stewart, and I do for many of the points he made, I think the crux of this debate rests on the point of motivation. The point about Steve Jobs, some guys in a basement with passion-filled hearts, being the true drivers of innovation, is a comforting one, but unfortunately, incomplete. For any dynamic enterprise, there's the innovator, and the investor who's money makes it real. The latter isn't fueled by the same passion as the former. The other key point by JS, was that two things rouse the appetite for risk: potential rewards and stability. That was bang on.
