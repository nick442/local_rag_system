For an investment to appreciate in value, one of two things needs to happen: 1) Demand for that particular item needs to increase. 2) The supply of that item needs to decrease. Houses are good because everyone needs a place to live, but there is a finite amount of land. No matter how much you invest in Manhatten real estate, Manhatten ain't growin'. The trick there is to find an area that people are going to want to live in when you're ready to sell. Specific vintages of wines and spirits are another good example, because it's literally impossible to create more of that vintage. Cars, and most consumer goods, usually don't appreciate because they don't last long enough. Most cars are resold within three to five years after the initial purchase. This is also why jewelry is a good investment; properly cared for, it can last centuries without wearing out. So, look for something durable that has a limited supply.
