Actually it is because of trade tariffs/import tax which the US charges on automobiles. The big auto manufacturers in the US have lobbied extensively to help increase the cost of vehicles manufactured overseas and imported into the US. So as a work around, international auto manufacturers set up plants within the US so as to avoid paying some of the import tariffs.
