"If she was in a position where flying with dogs would cause her to be ""deathly allergic"" but could not provide them the documentation required to administer medication to prevent this, shes a flight risk. If she starts dying on the plane, GG. But, Here's the truth: this woman is a professor of woman and Islamic studies. She's Muslim. Muslims find dogs unclean hence, that's why she wanted the dogs removed, and couldn't provide any proof to her bullshit ""allergy"" claim. https://wsrp.hds.harvard.edu/people/anila-daulatzai"
