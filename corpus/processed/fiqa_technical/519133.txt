Routing number (RTN - Routing Transit Number) you're talking about is the Federal Reserve routing number. It is based on, but not equivalent to ABA numbers. The specific routing number may also be based on ABA numbers of institutions merged into BoA, which are now defunct. From wiki: The RTN number is derived from the bank's transit number originated by the American Bankers Association, which designed it in 1910.
