I live in an area where there are large distribution centers for a number of retailers fairly near each other. Wal-mart's hires a lot of young kids and completely inexperienced people. As soon as they get a little experience, they usually get to work trying to get on with one of the other DC's because they all pay more and offer better benefits. The thing is, there is always some young, inexperienced kid out there willing to work their tush off for a pitance and no benefits because the management is making sure they never get enough hours to 'earn' them. There's no impetus on Wal-Mart to make any effort to do better by their workers.
