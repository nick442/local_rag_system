Brit here, don't confuse me with an Australian again, I had enough of that when I went to Disneyworld. Anyhow, I'm an avid and long-term redditor who knows the ins and outs of reddit. I haven't had much experience moderating but I'd give it a grand old go. 2300EST - 0700EST is roughly lunch to early morning here in the UK, or as I call it, my primary redditing period. So I'm pretty much always online. I'd love you help you guys out and maybe help the subreddit grow.
