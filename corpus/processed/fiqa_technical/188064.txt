Humans are like a parasite to the planet. Our Corporatocracy promotes growth because it makes them more money. People follow suit because they were told it is good. Those who promote capitalism are the ones who enjoy all the benefits of society. The rich get socialism and the rest get financial slavery. Very short sighted and lacking critical thinking. Man without vision shall perish.
