Vinyl is to hipsters as ceramic figurines are to old women. I played vinyl when I was a kid, since that's all there was back then. I got back into it several years ago, when you could still find good used records for under $1. Those are all gone now. You're paying $30-$40 for poorly pressed new records. It's not worth it. A few years ago I started buying used CDs. They're selling for 25Â¢ to $1 these days. CDs are - objectively and scientifically - better than records. Look here if you don't believe me: http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Myths_(Vinyl) I rip CDs to my server and select music using my tablet as a remote control. It's pretty wonderful. Oh yeah, I'm putting all those CDs into deep storage. When the hipsters start going wild over vintage CDs about ten years from now, I'm going to sell them all and buy a nice new car.
