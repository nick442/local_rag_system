But its not spare capacity. Lots of AirBNB owners are renting tons of properties, making scarcity worse. Case in point, it can cost $50-$100 per person to AirBNB a bed for a night. That means anywhere less than $1,500 is good for profit making. It's even better when they rent out beds, which means they'll stack a room in a large house with 3 beds each. I've been to AirBNB locations where 14 people were individually renting. AirBNB person rented a dozen properties and spent all day and night cleaning. Pulled in six figures.
