This is more an /r/personalfinance question, but I'll give my 2 cents. No matter what, the fund you invest in is going to be subject to risk, so you could end up losing money. It would definitely be a gamble. If you have other debt at higher APR than the loan, it could be beneficial to pay that off using extra loan proceeds.
