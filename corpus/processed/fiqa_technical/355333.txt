Why do people act as if the minimum wage was created for high school students who are working part time? There's no real way to debate the fact that the minimum wage was created as a requirement for employers to pay a livable wage to employees. It wasn't created as some kind of skill building wage for teenagers. “No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country..By living wages, I mean more than a bare subsistence level — I mean the wages of a decent living.” - FDR
