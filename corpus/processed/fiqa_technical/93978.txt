The barrier to entry is extremely high in the ISP world. You either have to piggyback on an existing ISP and their lines, or you lay your own. Obviously Google is going with the latter, which is a huge undertaking that not only involves the work to actually lay the fiber, but also get regulatory approval and the funds to do so. They have the resources to do this, but only when the cities cooperate and work with them. Then there's the work involved with setting up all of the networking infrastructure to actually route customer traffic, set up peering agreements, etc. Basically, there are two kinds of entities that can do all this: existing ISPs (who obviously want to maintain the status quo), and companies with lots of influence and money and technical resources. You won't find a startup doing what Google is doing, at least not without some big players backing them.
