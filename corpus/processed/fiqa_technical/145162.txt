Tbonds are on nobody's books when they are bought back. Feds or Treasury department credits your account plus any interests when you sell the bonds back to them. The Tbonds are then destroyed. The govt is forever solvent when paying Tbonds. They just click a few buttons and bam!! A check is written to you or your checking account is increased for turning in the matured bonds.
