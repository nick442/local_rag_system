I like the produce at Whole Foods, prices are comparable to other markets in my area and the quality is much better. I don't subscribe to prime, I tried it and it is not worth it to me the $99 a year price, many products are not on prime and I can still get free shipping if I am willing to wait a week or so. What I am trying to say, I hope Amazon doesn't mess with Whole Food's quality and selection just to show better prices, I can go to plenty other stores for that.
