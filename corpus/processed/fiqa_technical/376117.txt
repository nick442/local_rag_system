The issue with ownership for digital media is highly contested, and definitively more complicated then the author of this rather underwhelming article suggests. Plus: She seems to assume that US copyright and consumer protection law is universal and pllaies in Norway as well. I have no idea about the legal situation there, but I would be very surprised if it is much different from the EU situation. Just a couple of weeks ago the European Court of Justice said that private customers do have property rights over digital media, not matter what the EULA says.
