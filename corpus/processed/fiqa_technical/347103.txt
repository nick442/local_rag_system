I'd say scuttle the company so the guy can't keep his evil master plan going. Get all of the stores to mark everything $1, clear the inventory, and then walk away. Let Sears die, rather than this life support torture scenario this guy is pulling. Maybe then he'll sell the name to somebody who wants to make something out of it.
