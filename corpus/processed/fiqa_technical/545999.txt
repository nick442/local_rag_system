">What if everyone in college studied for a physics degree. How worthwhile would they be then? You assume that everyone COULD obtain a physics degree. (Hint: there is a *reason* why the panoply of degrees has expanded along with the percentage of people obtaining them.) >Sure, a single individual can benefit from getting a difficult or niche degree, but I'm not sure that the system as a whole could benefit. Yes, there is a supply/demand part of the equation as far as the degrees obtained. But boss-hoss is just pointing out a current exception to the linked article's conclusion, he is not stating that everyone should obtain a physics degree (so you are arguing with a straw-man of your own construct). And yet it is a valid point -- but likewise there is a fundamental supply/demand equation that drives college tuition costs: If ""everyone"" is enabled to attend college, and at no upfront preparation/sacrifice (in terms of saving money) but rather an unlimited fund of ""loan money"" is created to facilitate it, then ""price is no longer an object"" and the colleges will have no reason to constrain costs; competitive pressures having essentially been artificially eliminated."
