Just wait. I tried putting something on live tv (over the air since I don’t have cable) for my 4 year old and she was so pissed at the commercials that were interrupting her show she made me turn it off - I hadn’t realized it but up to this point she was only watching ad free shows on hulu and Netflix. An entire generation of kids is likely not being exposed to at least tv advertising like we did growing up.
