Obama got bad press too - and I actively sought out news that wasn't hypercritical. Imagine my surprise when CNN became Fox and Fox became.. well its still Fox, but it's less bitchy The knee jerk assault on his policies actually made me research more of his policies and other conservative view points.. dems negativity backfired and they lost me as a voter for a long long time
