Yes, the choice of some of the base stats to use is pretty interesting. I'm not an expert in using FRED, but I think there are better numbers for a lot of those. Mostly it's about things like the origin of the graph though - look how many of the graphs on that page start in the mid fifties, not zero, thus magnifying things drastically. Also graphing numbers that aren't calculated the same way on the same graph - FRED does not fix your poor assumptions.
