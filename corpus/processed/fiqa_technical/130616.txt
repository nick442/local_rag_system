"> I do not reside on the right and have never voted for a Republican candidate. I don't believe you. The words you're using are pretty much verbatim from the ""crush-the-immigrants"" right-wing spin machine. Such as: > It rewards those who willfully disregarded America's legal system and subsequently punishes those that respected it. > >America should not reward the immoral, regardless of the color they may happen to be. > > Non-citizens who see themselves as above the law should be punished and sent home. Why focus on non-citizens? If you want to be consistent, you should be in favor of destroying the lives of U.S. citizen jaywalkers, litterers, vandals, etc. too. Because that's the level of punishment that you're proposing to be applied. Gotta be consistent on levels of punishment if you don't want to be called out as a hypocrite after all. I think Wisconsin dairy farmers are already getting a taste of what life is going to be like if they follow your solution, and they're already unhappy about how much harder it is to do business. I guess you hate American farmers as well, eh? If your big beef is people committing crimes & not getting punished, then I'll modify my solution a little for you: Illegal immigrant that hasn't done anything violent? $100 fine, then they can apply for legal immigrant status - voila! criminal punished, and illegal immigration problem solved!"
