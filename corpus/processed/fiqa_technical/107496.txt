Lets talk about price gouging. Laws intended to protect victims in a disaster, that actually serve to make it more difficult to service the needy. Allowing producers to charge a higher price for items that are in high demand (Water, gas etc) sends signals to other producers that profits are available. This in turn gives them incentive to make extraordinary efforts to service victims. No one is going to drive 200 miles to sell water if the price is limited by law, there will be less water available for all. If huge profits are available to those entrepreneurs who take the risk to help people, then more people will engage in the helping, and more resources will be available for all. The prices will eventually come down as supply is restored and as more competitors enter the area. TL;DR - I would rather have expensive water in an emergency, than no water.
