I think you wrong about this. There are two problems I see with your example. * When you created something which costs $150 you have increased the amount of money in the world from $200 to $450 because money is the storage of value. * After the first transaction you have said that you have $250, which presumably means the money in the bank. However, at a later point when you go to the bank demanding $500 you only consider physical notes to be money. The bank at this point could give you a check book and if you wanted to spend it would simple credit the other person $500 and remove that amount from your account. In addition, the bank could always repossess the items you have sold to the other person and give them to you in lieu of physical money.
