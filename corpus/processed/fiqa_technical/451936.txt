This just shows how rediculous a one size fits all requirement on wages is.. 15 an hour is enough to get you a 2-bed apartment in most states (well above minimum in my opinion).. While other states you're nowhere close.. Why should the cost of living in Seattle hold merit to the wages in Bumfukt Kentucky?
