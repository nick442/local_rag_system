The Transfer of funds outside of Bangladesh is restricted. Any transfers required the permission of Bangladesh Bank [Central Bank]. So the only legal option is to apply for the permission and see if its granted. Western Union is a Money Transfer and typically is good for getting funds into Bangladesh, most expats in Bangladesh would use the service. It can unfortunately not be used other way round.
