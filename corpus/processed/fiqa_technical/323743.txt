The city's leaders operated on the assumption that the housing boom would continue in perpetuity and committed too much of the city's coffers to employee benefits. Median home prices in Stockton fell from nearly $400,000 in 2006 to roughly to $110,000 in 2009, which decimated property tax receipts. The city has the 2nd highest rate of foreclosures in the country. They've been running perennial budget deficits and have burned through all their emergency rainy day funds. Public safety represents 80% of the city's $200 million budget, and city employees receive a guaranteed salary increase from 2.5-7% each year. Employee healthcare costs have seen a meteoric rise, growing at 10% per year over the past decade. Other post-employment benefits (OPEB), including pensions, are have also skyrocketed. Stockton is on the hook for more than $800 million in unfunded liabilities for pensions and OPEB. So, basically, public employees are draining the resources of a city that has been devastated by the housing collapse.
