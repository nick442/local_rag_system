Not really an answer, but too long for a comment: Since anyone can create their own cryptocurrency (see http://www.bitclone.net/) the value of new cryptocurrencies is very small. According to https://bleutrade.com/exchange/MINT/USD for example, 100,000 mintcoins is worth less than $1. Even if they give you 20% interest, that interest is on mintcoins, not dollars. If the mintcoin rates falls by more than 20%, you would've been better off withdrawing your mintcoins immediately. Check to see how much they pay for various tasks and compare it to the current exchange rate. Realize the exchange rate may go down as more mintcoins are created.
