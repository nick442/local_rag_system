".. what does any broker encourage? The ability to buy or sell at the market. How do they encourage that? By allowing people to do it at a lower cost. So, whatever others ""encourage"" people to do, Robinhood does the same, just for less money. Do people always do what's best or most successful? No, some people like taking in lots of risk for the opportunity for a greater reward, do they understand what they're doing? If they don't, they will as soon as they start losing all their money. Robinhood is no different than other brokers, just allows for cheaper opportunity."
