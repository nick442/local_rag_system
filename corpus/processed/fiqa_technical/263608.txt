"I can say that this is accurate for me personally. I rarely watch ""broadcast"" TV - I watch one sporting event per week and that is it. Everything else is via XBMC or online. But I listen to the radio for probably 10 hours a week because it's a pretty accessible format. Just turn it on in the car or on the train and listen. You get music, news or whatever else you want."
