"> Some scientists already consider owning an Iphone as being enhanced cyber beings, when is the last time you remembered a phone number for instance. Remembered someone's birthday lately or did FB or your calendar on your pc remind you, this means you are already enhanced! I've been referring to my computer as ""my offboard brain"" for years now. I keep everything here. The downside is that my memory is absolutely terrible."
