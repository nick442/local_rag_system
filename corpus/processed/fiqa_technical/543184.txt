Yes, it is traditional to tip slaves. Which is what Uber drivers are; retarded slaves, who have not yet worked out that the true income of driving for Uber is never higher than 6 cents per mile. For many vehicles, the true rate will be negative. Uber is really a way to steal money from yourself, that you have to pay back later - while giving money to Uber, and fucking up your car with massive miles. If you get in the back seat of an Uber car, you know the person at the wheel is one of two things; 1) retarded 2) Dirt poor Probably both. Because if you understand maths, and Total Cost Of Ownership, then you would never ever sign up for Uber.
