I'm in the same boat as you. 2.2 highschool GPA. Took the sat and scored and 1100, atleast I won't have to take placement classes and waste money. A 3.8 GPA is solid man you should be fine as long as you can do well In an interview. Most top schools don't even take SAT scores except for Harvard, Columbia ect. I'm hoping to pull at least a 3.8 as as well.
