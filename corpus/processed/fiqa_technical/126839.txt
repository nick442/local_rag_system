>Your arguments aren't your own, and that's what proves you don't know what you're talking about. I took up to International Macroeconomics and Finance at the Sam Walton School of Business. >Did you know that in the Middle East for example, they do not have this banking system? Oh, right. The banking system in Dubai, for instance, is the hot zone of International Money laundering by criminal syndicates ranging from the Russian Mafia to Dawood's Syndicate in India. This is because it isn't regulated and nobody gives a fuck where the money comes from. >Why? Because you're gullible, and anything that seems establishment or widely accepted, that's what you go along with. Blow me you smug, ignorant motherfucker. I'm done giving you an Econ 101 lesson. Maybe when you grow up you'll be ready to learn something. >Also, we did not abandon the gold standard at Bretton Woods. SERIOUSLY WTF. Your reading comprehension sucks ass. Nobody said that.
