I go there and all I see is an overhyped get rich quick conference that you sold tickets in groups to artificially inflate demand. I see no substance. Are you connected to grasshopper labs, where (and I quote) : > the first organization devoted to empowering entrepreneurs through technological innovation and real-world expertise Really? Youre the first? See, hype. Also, youre trying to sell internet phone for $10 a month? You must depend on some pretty NON-tech-savvy customers. I bet youre a people person. Youre probably even nice. But you present yourself as very naive, and your 'goods' dont pass the smell test. Pro tip 1 : dont brag about income. Its non-pro.
