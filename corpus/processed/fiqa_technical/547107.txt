"> in fact, I reject the notion that bitcoin is anywhere as revolutionary as ""the internet"" Bitcoin itself is rather simple; it's just a ledger that requires a proof-of-work hash to make entries and be rewarded for making those entries. Yet the tech behind bitcoin (the blockchain) is where the incredible innovation is. You say that you acknowledge the technical aspects which is what I assume your referring to and absolutely agree. >(which itself, as a construct, is far older than most people let on). So is the problem that Satoshi Nakamoto solved. The [Two Generals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals'_Problem) problem has been discussed on crypto boards since the late 70s, early 80s and did not have a good solution until 2009. Since then there has been an explosion of new creations. Solutions like [decentralized asset exchanges](https://www.counterparty.co/), [decentrazlied social media](http://twister.net.co/) without central servers or censorship, decentralized [reputation based markets like ebay](http://openbazaar.org/), decentralized and provable [notaries](http://coloredcoins.org/), [decentralized crowdfunding like kickstarter](http://www.coindesk.com/mike-hearn-wins-40000-bounty-bitcoin-core-crowdfunding/), [decentralized cloud storage](http://storj.io/), etc. All these technologies are able to exist because of the blockchain protocol model and can be scaled across the world without censorship or seizure. Plus anyone can take these technologies to learn how they work and remix/edit/improve wherever they wish because everything is open. Regardless what happens to the price of bitcoin, developments in this scene over the past 5 years have been beyond engaging. This past year alone has been so much fun following something that constantly evolves so quickly. In this regard I definitely consider the technology behind bitcoin just as revolutionary and gamechanging as the internet was. **most. fun. experiment. ever.**"
