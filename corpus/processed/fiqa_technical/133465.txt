lol do a !remindme and I will do as well so i can laugh at you Snap chat hit 15 dollars this month up for sub 12 after a good earnings call. They are making above the right moves and will end up over taking instagram AND facebook in the next 5-10 years. Walmart is going to show they are walmart and GoPro is also doing everything right to enter the next 10+ years to max out and then be bought out. I have already made over 3 grand in the last month just playing Snapchat and GoPros stocks on a day trade and I am only playing with less than 10k and I would of made far more if I really went all in like I should of.Shit I made over a grand on SHLD because the stock plunged before earnings call and I knew it would rise roughly 10% which it actually did by 12% before it fell again after the earnings call. Hell Snapchat will hit 20 a share by end of spring if it takes that long. Go Pro will be over 15 by X Mas. If you are going to talk shit add something to it because all you are doing is blah blah blah about something you don't know about and have done no research on and if you have I feel bad for your investments.
