My entrepreneurship prof said that in most cases if you really believe in your product/idea and it is differentiated from what exists already, you can afford to have someone steal your idea and try to make a go of it because you should still be able to do a much better job of it than they can, and their heart isnt in it the way yours is. I think ultimately it really depends on the product though. You definitely don't want to try going 2nd to market against someone with superior resources unless you can 100% beat their version of the product by a good margin (either on price or quality and hopefully both) and you can scale up quickly
