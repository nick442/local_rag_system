Interesting recent in depth article on sears hldg. http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20111228/FREE/111229931 I wonder how sears is supposed to compete with everyone from walmart to home depot. For its size, it is insanely cheap(shld = $3.5B, wmrt = $205B). But who needs more mediocre retail space? I suppose it could be acquired for a bunch of reasons: assets, elimination as a competitor, threaten another major player, etc.
