I don't think it's fair to attribute Target's recent numbers to people preferring to shop online. The card information fiasco was still going on in the first quarter, and they had already been struggling from putting too many resources into Canada growth while seeing little results. While I agree that the big-box store is probably a bit on the decline, until an online retailer can compete with price, convenience, and delivery time, there will still be a huge place in the market for the Wal-Marts of the world.
