You mean that new $800 Millennium Falcon didn't get you excited. The basic price points keep creeping higher and higher. Also, Lego's designers fell in love with complex and expensive models. Unless you buy block buckets, there are very few sets with a large number of the bigger blocks I grew up with. It is horrible for teaching younger kids to build free style.
