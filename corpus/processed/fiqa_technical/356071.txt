That is completely wrong. Governments care about this, because the economy, their power, is built on growth. If all your citizen can do is work, watch TV and sleep then they are not spending money, the economy is not growing, and the governments power is not growing. QE stopped a deflationary death spiral by plugging a hole in the banks in financial institutions, unfortunately it did not change the underlying reasons the US economy was on the verge of that deflationary death spiral.
