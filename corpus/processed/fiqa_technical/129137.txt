So wrong, on so many levels. You trust content from WP? Full of IC operatives and presstitutes. The little restrictions we have on imported steel do nothing to slow the market inundation of poor-quality (read: Chinese) steel. Since when does the Pentagon have the USA's economic interests in mind? Lastly, Buy-American/Sell-American is guaranteed to reinvigorate the country's economy. The money is reinvested in OUR country. And the surplus can be exported. We make quality goods, not mass production goods of lesser quality like Xi Ping's knock-off steel. #MAGA
