I dont see anything dystopian about this? Half the article is about new millionaires being created by 2021. That is a good thing isnt it? I know reddit is all about forcing millionaires to sell their stocks and real estate so Starbucks baristas and people folding shirts at the mall can make $50/hr and drive Mercedes though. How dare rich people own stock when the stock market doubles! The audacity of them to manage their money wisely and work hard to build their wealth.
