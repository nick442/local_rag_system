"Why shouldn't they pay for schools. After all why is that so many students and parents in underachieving public schools take no great interest in ensuring they get the best education tax payer dollars can offer? Probably because they have no great stake in the game and the view the service as being always ""FREE"" of cost to them. In other words they fail to understand or don't care about the indirect costs because it has no immediate direct out of pocket cost to them."
