"Just a thought exercise - finance is so heavily dependent on rule of law and political stability that there is a possibility that none of the ME countries will be the largest Islamic financial centers in the long run. If I was a HNW investor or institution, I'd be very worried about the risk inherent in any number of regional developments - Saudi Arabia budget deficits, ongoing Syria conflict, Qatar-SA conflict, potential civil unrest or civil war, oil prices, capital controls, etc. Perhaps Dubai may be competitive, but would be severely affected by regional unrest, and like the quote, ""bull markets are ridden up in escalators, bear markets are ridden down in elevators"", instability could manifest very quickly causing capital to flee. Nothing motivates action like the risk of losing 100% of your capital. European banking centers will likely start providing more and more Islamic finance services, especially given the rapidly changing demographics of many EU countries. Other possibilities for growth include offshore centers such as Mauritius (closer to ME and huge Muslim populations in India and Pakistan) and Singapore, which is at the center of the very large and growing Southeast Asia Muslim region (growing population and incomes). Specific to finance, Malaysia and Indonesia have their own issues with capital mobility, currency stability, political outlook, etc., they just have not proven to be very good places to store capital over any long period of time in recent history. Malaysia has an onshore ""offshore"" center that is meant to build a financial industry, but I'd be worried about the overall situation there, (the 1MDB scandal is just another example of serious governance issues). Edit: one possible area for growth - Brunei. The government there knows that they will run out of oil in XX years, they've been looking to build domestic industries, financial services is probably one of their only options (small Muslim country, small population, high concentration of wealth, etc)"
