>triple full time class load You had me up until this bullshit. Is that like double secret probabtion? Any credible university simply will not allow you to take more than one extra course. Also, references help, but they don't get noticed until the interview stage. GPA is also pretty meaningless unless you're in a technical field. I say this as a guy who got lucky and unlucky. In my mind, merit really only comes into play in the interview stage. Getting the interview is either through luck or nepotism.
