> They do have trouble finding people that can afford to get out there because who is doing to give up a decent pay job for only 3 months of work? Well, yeah, that was kind of a given in the discussion. Apple picker is a couple of months job at best. It's still not clear to me what the extra $5 per hour brings to the table. The fact is that the offers are already nearly up in the range the OP said would sufficiently attract people, but it isn't attracting people. I am highly skeptical that the extra $5 is going to magically change the situation. Maybe there is some price that would get the people needed, but I'm not convinced it is anywhere near $35, as originally proposed.
