It depends on your bank and your mortgage contract details if they are willing to handle it that way, but you are correct in your assumption that you should be able to save the interest for the twenty days, which accumulates to significant savings. A rough estimate for the overall saving is 20 years x 3% x 20/30 of the days = (one time) 40% of your monthly payment.
