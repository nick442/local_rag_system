I can go on a rant about how much I know, try to shamelessly prove to you how smart I am by throwing out a bunch of shit that I've learned, but none of that means anything. Of course I know how to approach it from a business perspective. Legally, I have friends who can advise me in my immediate area. But experience, wisdom, people who have been in similar positions with some sage advice, isn't something you can learn in an MBA classroom. I don't think there's anything wrong with using Reddit, as a resource, to gain some further insights. Regardless, I appreciate you and your time.
