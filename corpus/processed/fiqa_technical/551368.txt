I'm not a financial guy. That being said, I think you can make a couple of common sense points here: The reason this site exists is because in some of these countries there just isn't an established way to create credit history. Partly because the infrastructure is risky to build. It may also be due to the corruption within a country. The really cool part about Kiva and these other lending tools might be that they can be an end run around those governments and are a 21st century approach to building the infrastructure for credit worthiness. That being said, you probably already realize, in this situation - you're the bank - and you really ought to be acting somewhat like a bank: I'm also curious whether or not the good loans and opportunities are snatched up so quickly that all you are left with is the really high risk stuff. Anyway that's my non-expert 0.02.
