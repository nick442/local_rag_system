I'd say the point 5 touched on a subject that was quite relevant. Large corporations used to kick off massive ERP implementations every 5 or so years. Huge beasts like SAP, EBS, Seibel, etc.. required a massive team of resources to implement. The consulting organisation needed to provide everything from executive managers and PMO offices to infrastructure engineers. Small consulting firms simply could not play in that market. Those massive on premise systems are dead. Companies are only buying SaaS and PaaS solutions with open APIs that can be implemented in much smaller bites and in a modular rollout. Niche firms are very well suited to this changing systems market. I wouldn't say the big firms are dead but I would expect their revenues and market share to fall.
