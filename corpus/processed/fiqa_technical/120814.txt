"I don't think the article is totally useless. As a Westerner, I hear virtually nothing about companies bribing government officials. So the concept alone is interesting. Also, they give hard numbers: - ""Bribery offered an average return of 10-11 times the value of the bung paid out to win a contract."" - ""heads of state securing up to 4.7% of the contract value"" Since you know it all, why don't you write an article for us?"
