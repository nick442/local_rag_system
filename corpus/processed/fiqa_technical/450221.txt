As a longtime customer of Scottrade I want to say that I'm very happy with it. Now, to answer your question: they do give you a nominal cash interest rate but it is VERY low -- this past month it was 0.01% APYR. The interest that I earned in my Scottrade account in August (31 days) on average credit cash balance of $729.36 was $0.01. I don't know if or where they publish the rate, but you would get a much better rate from an average savings account. However, you can purchase CDs/bonds/tbills through Scottrade if you want cash/safe investments.
