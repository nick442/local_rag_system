"That's the reality of what sometimes people don't grasp. ""The banking elites will never let bitcoin succeed."" Although this is probably true at a certain level, the reality is that when bitcoin poses as a threat, it is also an opportunity at the same time. Bank are all in competition with one another. There are plenty who will take the plunge and get involved if there is money to be made. If they don't do it, another bank will. It's the prisoners dilemma in action, in that banks benefit from defecting and not colluding together. This is also the case when it comes to how Nation States will eventually interact with it. Japan is at a huge advantage by moving first into acceptance. Should be the first domino that keeps every country on the offensive to at least not outright banning it. If it succeeds, large countries are at huge risks of missing out big time."
