I'm assuming you don't see the fundamental problem with your position. Tech is dominated by white men. To argue that the cause is that women, blacks, hispanics, and others are biologically inferior is part of the conditions that contributes to that imbalance. This is about racism, misogyny, and how they can be used to justify harm to significant proportions of the earth's population. That's not ok.
