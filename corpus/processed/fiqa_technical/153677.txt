My wife has subscribed for trips or whatever so she could preload stuff for offline play. Total shit show. Wasn't clear when stuff was actually downloaded. Seemingly downloaded stuff wouldn't play. We're going for a long trip in a couple months and would like to subscribe again to pre-load stuff, not sure it is worth it. We've only used it on Android and it is definitely far from stable. Crashes are _very_ common. Having to kill the app and restart it is almost a daily occurrence. Crashing like the one I screenshot isn't surprising or unusual. It really is a garbage app. If possible I'll often use youtube instead if the content is there too, even though that means my screen needs to stay on to keep playing. We have Google Nexus phones from right before they switched to the Pixel name. So they're about as vanilla standard Android as phones can get.
