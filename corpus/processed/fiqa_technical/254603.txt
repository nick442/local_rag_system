"> and abusing your majority marketshare This is so laughable it's beyond pale. Somebody conducting their business as they see fit is 'abusing'? Amazon does not have a monopoly on anything they sell. Book publishers (or customers) can go anywhere else on the internet or in the world to sell or buy the things that Amazon sells at any price they want. Amazon has worked very hard to get the customer base it has. It clearly has superior customer service and unique products that they, themselves have financed and brought to market. And that also goes for their ""instant"" video streaming platform. As customers, we do not have to walk into a store and be forced to buy something at a price we do not want to pay. The same could be said for retailers of content also. Netflix stopped offering a comprehensive catalog of films when it did not want to meet the price that content owners were demanding, so they stopped carrying those (and other) films. Nobody raised eyebrows' as this article laments when Netflix did the same. Traditional book publishers/copyright owners have decades of historical case law that has developed from their actions. The notion of 'first sale' doctrine is a result that came about because publishers/copyright holders sought *more* rights than were available to them under the law. Which is an example of the continual theme with them. And, they have essentially got what they have wanted (especially Disney) from an all too willing congress with truly endless copyright extensions and draconian copy protections. So, you'll have to forgive me if I don't cry these guys the river they want! Edit: After writing this, [I just found this letter from Amazon](http://www.readersunited.com/). I think I'm gonna go throw more money at them today."
