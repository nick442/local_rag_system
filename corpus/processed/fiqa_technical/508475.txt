"Realtor.com gives the following list of ""best renovations for the money"" and they include ROI numbers: You can see that people generally get ~80-85% of their money back on home improvement projects. If the housing market is just red hot in your area, and you bought a house with some severe issues that caused the sale price to be significantly undervalued per square foot, then you're more likely to get more than average returns on your investment. If you manage to save a lot of money on the renovations (ie, inexpensive materials or you DIY and save on labor) then your costs will be lower and your ROI higher. You can see from the list above that the most profitable improvements tend to be kitchen, bath, windows, and adding additional living space. However, it only takes a few hours of watching HGTV to conclude that renovations often cost more than homeowners expect. This is often due to unexpected issues or costs that were not apparent before the work started."
