I had no idea that 3 sentences could possibly last as long as you made them. Here is a slightly better and shortened version for you: >You know I'm right. I'm right because people know what I know. Therefore I'm right. You ask dumb questions because you are dumb. Using tautologies and circular reasoning isn't the best case for your argument. I'm sure that you can offer a better case. Finally, downvoting is best in cases where the individual does not add to the argument, not if they simply disagree with you. Or at least in theory.
