It makes sense that a credit score is a history of how you have handled monetary commitments. It allows the employer another method of evaluating you. Whether it provides useful information to the employer is another question. It may give them an idea of if you make risky decisions, take on too much at one time, or if you are able to repay on time. From my recent job search as a recent college graduate, this was not normal. As far as I'm aware it is legal, but you do have to give consent.
