In China, a lot of the manufacturing they're doing by hand could be done by robots. It's just that the cheap labor is more cost-effective than the development and upkeep of manufacturing robots. If manufacturing does come back to the US, I imagine it will be in heavily automated factories with fewer employees to take care of the processes that would be too expensive to automate.
