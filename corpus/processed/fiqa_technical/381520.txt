>$40,000 student loan she took out in the 90s has exploded to over $300,000, due to her inability to pay the high-interest rates and fees. This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Student loans should be no more than the paper rate plus whatever processing fees and a small percentage of that fee and nothing more. Banks are borrowing money from the Fed for essentially free or close to it and then turning around and loan sharking it to kids. Universities receiving even a penny of government funding should have salaries heavily scrutinized. There are professors at UCLA making > $200K. That's patently absurd.
