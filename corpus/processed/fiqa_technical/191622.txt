He is also going to make sure Uber provides 1099s right? Also report values under $600 to the IRS? He is also going to make sure all of his drivers have insurance that cover their taxi service right (standard automotive insurance won't cover you for this)? Uber, Lyft, airbnb, taskrabbit gigwalk, etc are like pyramid schemes. They tell you how to make money, convince you to make transactions, which they take a percentage of. However, they conveniently don't tell you about the correct regulations, taxes, laws, etc that end up netting you very little at the end of the year.
