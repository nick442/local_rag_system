Whoever pays gets the say Union Reps' salaries/flights comes from dues paid by union members. They're the ones paying for those flights, not the general public. Union members should have the final say if the Reps fly first, business, coach or whatever. Public employees should fly what is cheapest and pay for an upgrade out-of-pocket if so desired because we the taxpayers pay their tickets/salaries
