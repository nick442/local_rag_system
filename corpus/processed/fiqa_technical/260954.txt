">They can't work forever, despite some of these folks ideas to the contrary. Eventually their health will make it prohibitive to positively contribute to the work environment and companies won't want to deal with these higher risk employees. The fact that many companies are ""top heavy"" with an inordinate number of older ""Boomer"" people is also one of the factors that has been driving the cost of health care insurance up. The older people get, the more it costs to take care of their health (especially boomers, who as a generation ""indulged"" far more than the generation before them -- indulged in (i.e. used & abused) everything from organ destroying booze & drugs, to body-destroying ""exercise"" {knees, hips & ankles do NOT like jogging, and ""replacement"" joints are $50k to $100k EACH, so a quarter of a million [at least] will go into replacing knees & hips of the typical Boomer-Jogger}, to infection laden promiscuous sex {which we do not yet know all of the implications of, but we DO know is pretty scarey -- more and more cancers are being tagged as being caused by ""infectious agents"", aka STD's}). And of course, the Boomers as a generation have ALWAYS been a bunch of whiners & complainers and because of the ""size"" of their demographic, they have typically been catered to. So, basically, we ain't seen nuthin yet as far as health costs, OR the politics surrounding it all. Watch as the Boomers make (political) DEMANDS that THEY be taken care of (and they will endorse cutting off anything & everything for their kids/grandkids generations)."
