For video games the S&P home entertainment software index will probably work. For airlines there's the S&P airlines index but that may not work well for private jets. You should browse different S&P indicies based on GICS classifications or any other indicies you may find and then download their returns for the past few years and run a regression analysis on excel. Find the correlation between the indicies and the stock you're looking at then select the index with the highest correlation.
