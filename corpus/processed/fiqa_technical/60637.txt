I think that was the initial theme of the thread in the other comments. If they are losing the game on pricing which they are to online retailers. They need to excel where they can which is service (the most popular gripe on reddit is the moster cables/employees who dont know anything) they can fix this easy by not hiring morons or normal smart people and forcing them to lie and stop scamming the few customers they have. This is where circuit city failed. They fired the smart commission employees replaced them with cheap salesbots 3000 and they lost the customers they had to online. Best Buy is just a rinse and repeat of this.
