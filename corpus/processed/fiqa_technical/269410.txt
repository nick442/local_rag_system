It's really boring and you should automate it. Most front office guys worth their salt have built something that will normally calculate what they should have in their portfolios. Basically we own X units of stock K, stock K pays dividend D on date M, you check on date M that we have received X*D for all K's. When trades are made you also need to verify that the dollar amounts are correct, for equity its usually automatic but for fixed income and OTC products you can build a tool to check it.
