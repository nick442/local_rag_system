I think the point is that there is something structurally wrong with a company if it has billable orders a year and a half out, for a super -premium priced product, and it still can't make money. It's like, what is the turning point we are waiting for? I don't know that startup apologies are applicable when you have an 18-month lead time for six-figure cars. You can't claim that you're still trying to build a customer base with that kind of wait list. You can't talk about economies of scale, not when you can't even service your existing customers, especially not with this kind of product. If an 18-month waitlist of customers ready and eager to pay the super-premium asking price is not enough to break even, what would be?
