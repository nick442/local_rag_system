This subreddit has become pathetic. There are currently three comments in this thread (excluding this one). The two that are factually correct are both down voted to a score below zero, while an ignorant comment has 5 up votes. If we want to turn this into a ignorant circle jerk where we all sit around calling banks evil then I suggest we move it to another subreddit. This article is pathetic. The writer thinks that JPM has a balance sheet that is over 4x the size of the US economy. Here is a newsflash: there is no conspiracy they with the banking sector. Banks want to make money, just like every other business. That doesn't mean that they have the government in their pocket.
