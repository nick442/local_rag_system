They're wrong. The IRS instructions (pub 969) specifically say: To be an eligible individual and qualify for an HSA .. You [must] have no other health coverage except what is permitted under Other health coverage, later. So no, he is not eligible for HSA if he keeps your coverage. Here's what the same IRS Publication 969 has to say about the excess contributions (contributions in excess of what is allowed): Generally, you must pay a 6% excise tax on excess contributions. See Form 5329, Additional Taxes on Qualified Plans (including IRAs) and Other Tax-Favored Accounts, to figure the excise tax. The excise tax applies to each tax year the excess contribution remains in the account. You may withdraw some or all of the excess contributions and not pay the excise tax on the amount withdrawn if you meet the following conditions. You withdraw the excess contributions by the due date, including extensions, of your tax return for the year the contributions were made. You withdraw any income earned on the withdrawn contributions and include the earnings in “Other income” on your tax return for the year you withdraw the contributions and earnings. The 6% excise tax is on top of any other tax (like the regular income tax) that he has to pay on the money.
