I think the difference is that folks pay attention to who the CEO is based on the relevant value of the purchase. When it comes to a $1.50 bottle of water or a $6 fast food lunch I think you'll find most folks aren't even aware of who the CEO of the company is. When it comes to multi $1,000 purchases they do care because stability of the company is important for a long term purchase. I couldn't even tell you who the CEO of many companies I purchase from on a daily basis because, frankly, 24 hours after I eat their food or drink their beverage whatever it is is out of my system and down the toilet. For material purchases that cost actual money people pay closer attention.
