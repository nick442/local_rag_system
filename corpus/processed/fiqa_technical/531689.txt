"Since you're an idiot, here is a quote [""The Bank of England (formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England) is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world ""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England). Note that this bank, **founded in 1694**, is the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Now a quote from you: >The UK did NOT sell debt and simultaneously purchase its own debt in the past (until modern times). Owned, fool. And another quote to rub it in ""The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and also issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again."" You still have not listed an empire that did not purchase it's own debt."
