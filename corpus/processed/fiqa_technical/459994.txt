Well following your train of thought, if someone used the Visa/Amex/MC gift cards to buy something at another store, couldn't Visa/Amex/MC go to those stores and ask for evidence of who used the cards and then go after those people? The rabbit hole could go pretty deep, but if the amount was large enough they might be motivated to at least make examples of some people to discourage this in the future.
