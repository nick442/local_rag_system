"I would argue that we went from slavery to other forms of slavery, not a ""free"" society. Slavery still exists, and is even sanctioned by the government in some places (prison industrial complex, prisoners who cannot vote being ""forced"" to work for 13 cents an hour). Of course I don't think society will always stay the same, but I don't think that we can create enough new jobs to balance those being lost to automation and technological advancement (productivity/efficiency increase). Perhaps one day, we won't need to balance those losses, but today, in current times, unemployment is a huge problem with very few simple solutions. I just want to say that I am enjoying the discussion."
