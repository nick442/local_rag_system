I think thats a common but in the end false opinion, that automation will take away all the jobs. In the 1950s people talked about what we'd do with all our leisure time as a result of automation. But here we are 70 years later and we're still working 40-50 hours a week for the most part. There aren't a finite number of jobs. We create new ones when old ones are no longer relevant. I don't think we need to protect the switchboard operators, lamp lighters or bowling pin setters of America. If a machine can pack a box with toilet paper, toothpaste and AA batteries better than a human, I want more machines.
