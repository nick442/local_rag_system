I used to work in FP&A and never had to use SQL at all. What kind of companies are you looking at that require it? I did end up using it when I switched over to the Strategic Analysis team (they were much more data heavy). It was relatively easy to learn on the job but if you want to get out ahead of it you will have to know which software/database they use as there are different types of SQL language (I unfortunately found out.) Feel free to PM me if you have any other FP&A type questions.
