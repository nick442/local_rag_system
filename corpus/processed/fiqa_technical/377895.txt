"The difference between being the first result on Google vs. the second can mean hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars depending on the value of the search. 42% of people won't go past the third result. Yelp is a popular site but has yet to make money and may never have the chance now that Google has started putting its Google Places results before Yelp's for local searches like ""Italian food downtown Chicago."" I like Google Flight and I'm glad I found out about it. The consumer tends to win in these scenarios."
