See, here you have created a “blanket narrative” that is your explanation of what is going on, that provides no details of the actual process, which means resolving the issue is impossible. Then you toss an Link and claim it represents every other part of the system. This is labeling in the extreme, and obfuscates the issue, while trying to get me to accept your narrative. So I have to dig past your veil to the real information every time. And I’m not understanding your point on that link. The EPA is having their budget cut, and Trump proposed to cut it in half, and so the EPA will be laying off tons of employees, and will also have a harder time getting their air standards guidance out in a reasonable time. Who is the attacker on special interested her? Trump? He’s the only specifically mentioned voice on the cuts., and who are the special interest groups going after them? I don’t see what retaliation is occurring here.
