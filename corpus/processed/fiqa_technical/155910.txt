Not even close. PnL is part of the job requirement. Past performance is not indicator of future results. Sound familiar? If you were successful managing a multi-asset 200 mio portfolio making 20-25%/year at Fortress.. It will be quite a bit more respected than coming out of some 10 person prop shop on the west coast managing 5mio single asset making 25-30%. Not to mention just the proximity to the street permits the networking that is most essential for opening these doors in the first place.
