The average home in San Francisco is about $1.3 million. So yes, millionaires. Prop 13 is generationally discriminatory. It is terrible tax policy. If you want to lower property taxes, then make that case. Making taxes cheaper for older residents than younger irrespective of their socioeconomic situation is just dumb tax policy. It benefits the rich, to the detriment of the poor and middle class.
