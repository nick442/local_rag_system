Not only are absolute incomes (adjusted for inflation) not increasing, but purchasing power is also decreasing. Decades ago, the salary of one middle class worker can raise a family. Nowadays, you can't even buy a home with two salaries, especially in large metro areas. There are numerous factors why this is happening: 1. Globalization. Why pay an American more when something can be done or made in Vietnam for a fraction of the cost? Prices of non-renewable resources will increase as third-world countries modernize and their populations demand the same luxuries that we have. 2. Automation. Automation has eliminated many jobs further driving income inequality. There are people with very high salaries since automation are making them much more productive and then there are jobs that have been completely eliminated because of automation. I know of factories that laid off a large fraction of their operators because the machines are now automated (but they did a hire few more engineers and technicians to increase productivity). 3. Scarcity of land. Everyone wants to live in areas where the jobs are but you can only build so much housing in one area, so house prices go up faster than wages. People with good jobs in industries where jobs are clustered in one place (biotech, software, semiconductors, finance, etc.) actually can afford less real estate than one would think based on their income just because of their location. These issues will become even more relevant as technology continues to develop and globalization continues.
