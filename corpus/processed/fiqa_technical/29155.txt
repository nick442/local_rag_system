I think Michigan has a few good technical schools that could feed Amazon. U of M being #1 in the state but Michigan State and Michigan Tech both produce a lot of good engineers. And Detroit is on an up beat. I am from there originally and it was attracting a lot more young people/businesses. I live in Portland now and all my hipster friends say they have been hearing good things and a few were considering moving there. And Quicken employees a huge IT team in Detroit Amazon could start trying to steal. You might be right they are an unlikely candidate but I think they have a lot more going for it than you might think at first glance.
