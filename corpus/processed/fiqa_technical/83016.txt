Minneapolis is totally underrated, I agree. One of the more surprisingly cool US cities imo. I had a similar experience the first time I went to Pittsburgh too, not long ago. I spent the whole week talking myself out of impulsively just moving there. Did not expect that at all. I guess neither were necessarily 'underrated' per se â€“ more like under-acknowledged for their coolness.
