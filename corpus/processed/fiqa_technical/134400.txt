"I wouldn't call them favorable. Edmunds report provides a very long repair list and in the last sentence concludes that Model S is ""hard to recommend"". Consumer Reports provides a similar list of component failures, some of which likely caused significant inconvenience, even if they were covered by warranty; the review title says that Model S has ""more than its share of problems"". Though both reviews emphasize the quality of Tesla service, they're a significant step down from glowing initial reviews of Model S."
