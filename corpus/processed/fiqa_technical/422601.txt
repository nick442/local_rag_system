Well, modern satellite tv systems use mircowaves. Of course, random things can affect the signal, but it usually is pretty stable, or Dish Network would be out of business, much less be able to provide hd content. Sending information about stock trades wouldn't need nearly as much bandwidth, they're mainly shooting for low latency. But sometimes there will be a bad signal that interferes with communication. It would be interesting to see how they account for any trades that are lost in the air.
