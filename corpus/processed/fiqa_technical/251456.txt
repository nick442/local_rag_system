It’s not minutia when you’re criticizing the wrong industry. If you thought that Equifax was a tech company and started criticizing “those crooks over in Silicon Valley” it wouldn’t make any sense either. I’m not defending anything, what happened at Equifax was malpractice of the highest degree. They just aren’t Wall Street.
