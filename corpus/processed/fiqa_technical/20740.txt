I'm wearing shorts I bought online. Levi's. Amazon offers free returns so I bought two sizes and picked what fit me best. I don't buy them all online but I do things like jeans from a specific brand where I know the sizing well. A lot of places offer free returns now. Otherwise I might take a gamble on a shirt fitting, or check out what blank it's printed on to see if I know it already. Just bought a shirt yesterday that I knew was printed on an American apparel 50/50 blank so I knew what size I need as I have ten shirts printed on that blank already. Still need to go into a store for a lot of things though
