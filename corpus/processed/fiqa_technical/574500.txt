I like to think of Safeway as more of a middle-of-the-road store. Poor people don't shop at Safeway, but neither do rich people. Most of our customers are on the older side, around the 40 and above range. The key to shopping at Safeway is to only buy the things on sale. You shouldn't be buying your entire grocery list at Safeway if you're on a budget. A few examples: 2 Lb. Strawberries for $2.50 Recently I got 1.5 Quart Ice Cream for $1.25 each, it was the good 3-4 flavor stuff too, not just Vanilla/Chocolate.
