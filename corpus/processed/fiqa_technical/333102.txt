"One description of what happened is at 401(k) Plan Fix-It Guide. The issue is the plan was ""Top Heavy,"" i.e. those making a high income were making disproportionately larger deposits than the lower paid employees. As the IRS article suggests, a nice matching deposit from the employer can eliminate the lower limit caused by the top heavy-ness. Searching on [top heavy 401(k)] will yield more details if you wish to research more."
