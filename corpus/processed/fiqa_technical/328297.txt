Well, I personally don't get my news from Facebook, so I wouldn't say that I trust them. But I also don't think they have a reason to go out of their way to censor conservative news stories. Every time I've seen conservatives complain about this sort of thing, it centers around stories with may be rooted in truth, but have been perverted/spun into things that aren't true at all.
