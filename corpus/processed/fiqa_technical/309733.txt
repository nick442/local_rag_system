You're not wrong, but Uber has worse base pay, so it doesn't matter. After I found out that they dropped the detroit mileage rate for drivers to well below the standard reimbursement for employees using a car (expected to cover fuel and wear and tear @$.56/mi), I realized how insane the race to the bottom was. They have since brought it back up, but it makes clear the generally horrible business practices and total lack of appreciation uber has for its drivers.
