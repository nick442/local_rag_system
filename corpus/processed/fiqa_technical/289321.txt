Whats their actual service area? I can't imagine it's huge. In Austin, TX we are getting google fiber but we already had a second cable company called Grande in part of the city offering faster speeds at less money then TWC. The problem was it wasn't really cost effective for them to expand their service area so they only cover pockets of the city. Grande incidentally were the first company to offer 1 gig internet in Austin after Google fiber was announced however the area for that was even smaller then their normal service area. Basically just big enough so they could say they were first. If a company already in the business can't even expand their service area I don't think new players are going to be very likely.
