So here's the thing that everyone seems to forget: I bought Netflix to watch MOVIES. Original content is great and all but they started off trying to provide a service and then just abandoned that service to essentially become their own TV network. If I'm bored at home and want to watch A Few Good Men, for example, I can't fire up my Netflix subscription so I'm off to the video store instead, which is exactly the thing I was trying to avoid by subscribing to Netflix.
