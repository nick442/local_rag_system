**Have a business plan.** Even if this is just a piece of paper that you and your friend scratched on, you want a document that describes what you're going to do and how you're going to do it. Also have some note of how profits will be shared (most likely, this will be 50/50 but write it down!) **Plan ahead and have some cash onhand.** Not every one of your expenses will be something you will know about in advance. Plan your expenses so that you have money to cover them, but also have an emergency fund (you can build this with the profits you get in the beginning) in case your rake breaks and you don't have a backup. Also, if you use your emergency fund, REPLACE IT. **Trust each other and communicate.** All businesses should run on trust. You and your friend should trust that the other person is going to work hard and put in the work. If you don't trust that he will show up on time, the burden falls to you and you will need to work harder. If you're having problems with him, trust that you'll be able to approach him (be tactful and respectful though) and work it out. **Have fun.** Ultimately, starting a business like this should be fun. Yes, the work may seem like a drag, but if you and your friend are able to have fun while working you'll enjoy it more and it won't seem so bad. Also, don't be afraid to spend your profits on yourselves. I'm not saying blow every dollar you make, but going to dinner or going to see a movie together with your hard earned profits from that day's work can make it all worth it. These are just some ideas that I came up with at my desk at work. If you have any other questions, feel free to PM me. I'm happy to help out. Good luck!
