I'm responsible for all our hedging. Since we sell the energy to end users we do mostly fixed buys, swaps and calls. I'm a excel guru and dabble a little in SQL. we have Crystal Ball as well but i have no idea how to use it. I guess I'm trying to figure out if there is a tool that people use to help me analyze the spreads. or perhaps some reading material to help me through this. This is what i've been working towards for so long and i really don't want to fuck this up
