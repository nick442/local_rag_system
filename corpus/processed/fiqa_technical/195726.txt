Hi, This is treated as a electronic balance transfer. There may be a fee for performing this. Cash advance interest will apply on the EBT. You may get a teaser rate for a limited amount of time. After it expires, the normal cash advance interest rate for the credit card will kick in. Check your credit card statement. Somewhere, you'll see a section listing the interest rates. One for retail purchases, one for cash transactions. Do not do this. If you need to borrow money to pay off a large debt, do one of the following: 1) Switch to the lowest interest rate card your bank offers 2) Apply for a credit card with another bank that is offering a great teaser rate, transfer the balance, cut your living expenses and send every penny to paying off the balance before the teaser rate expires 3) If you cannot get access new credit or switch credit cards, seek advice from a professional credit counsellor on your options and the best one to choose Sorry to ramble. I've seen far too many people fall into the debt trap. You don't want to go there. Source: I work for a bank which offers credit card products.
