Yeah, this benefits the buyer who made an impulse purchase because they saw a celebrity wearing something similar and thought it was cool. Then a few weeks later it becomes another piece of discarded junk. I think the free market can work, but this is not the way. There are a lot of external costs that nobody is paying for, especially all the waste associated with producing junk products like this.
