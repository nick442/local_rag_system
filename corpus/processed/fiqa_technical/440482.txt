"Research on drugs should be publicly funded in universities. The private sector only invests when the ""hard work"" has been done. The internet it's a good example. massive public funding in the beginning, when there were profits to be made, suddenly the private sector woke up. the researchers that work in those pharma companies were mostly trained and educated in top universities with a mix of their tuition fees and public money. Then the pharma companies hire them and make billions off of their knowledge. Fuck that. Universities should do the research, own the patent, price it fairly according to a public/Democratic decision, and let any compan y produce the drug, competing on how efficiently it can produce it. Besides, there is too much of a vested interest for making profit for private pharma, so they continuously push drugs that are detrimental to society like opioids. Only the public sector can ""afford"" to loose money in dead end research and make up for it later."
