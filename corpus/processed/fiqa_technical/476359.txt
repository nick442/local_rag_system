">Perhaps ""almost always"" was a bit of hyperbole, but in matters of cost vs. quality I'd expect publicly traded companies to prioritize short-term shareholder profit (or be sued by said shareholders.) Can you give me any examples of where shareholders sued the company because they weren't making much profit or focused on long term rather than short term? I can't think of any. Maybe if the company were grossly negligent in some way, but in general, no I don't think that happens, or at least I've never heard of it, and it sounds like a stupid thing for shareholders to do because they're never under any obligation for a piece of the profit either."
