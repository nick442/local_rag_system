"overtime is a fond memory in the USA maybe. somehow the rest of the civilized world has discovered overtime/living wage are not mutually exclusive to progress and quality of life. and at somepoint, as history has over and over and over again shown. those who view themselves as ""ambitious enough and smart enough"" to exploit their peers, will have the floors ripped out from under them. additionally, this isn't ""overpaying"". this is paying enough for people to live a happy life. this is what it means to live in a SOCIETY. you are part of the problem, not some messiah who happened to be smarter and more ambitious."
