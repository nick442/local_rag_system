Equifax has a Single Use offering for $20 for their own score or $30 for the three big guy's reports. I am a fan of Credit Karma which offers a free service that reflects the FICO score as good as any you'd pay for. Since each reporting agency can vary slightly, Credit Karma will have a score that's in the same range. And it's pretty much real time.
