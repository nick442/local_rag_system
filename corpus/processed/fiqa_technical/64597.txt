My mention of Lego being expensive is in my personal experience of sets as I grew up, where what were seemingly similar sets appeared to skyrocket in price over a matter of years. Another point of reference for me is the fact that 'retro' collectors Lego is supposedly still of lesser value than modern sets, making it almost a reverse collector's item, if you're into that kind of vintage collectable unboxed lark.
