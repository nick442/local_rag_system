I work in financial tech, and we've been working on regulatory projects non stop since the middle of last year. Not a single feature enhancement for traders has been implemented despite very high demand. The other (smaller) wing of the tech division has been working on electronic trading. As regulation and position transparency ramp up, voice spreads will fall and desks will have to rely on volume driven by electronic trading to make up revenue. The people driving this will be technology, and not the traders. So: if you want to get in on the finances money, brush up on your programming skills: C++, Java, python are the bare minimum.
