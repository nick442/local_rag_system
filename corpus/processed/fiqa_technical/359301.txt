I'm not sure of another other forums, maybe WSO? For subreddits, perhaps r/Economics can at least guide you better. Thanks for sharing the papers! I wish I had some I could share with you but I don't know any. Maybe you can ask your profs, or even profs at other institutions? I'm sure they will appreciate the initiative and help you out. I really don't know much about any of that yet unfortunately. Wish I could be of more help!
