Financial analysis is as much art as science, you need context to give advice on what to show. If they hired you they believe in you and want you to succeed. My advice is to take a lot of notes and ask a few questions but not too many, then think about situation and go back to ask a few more thoughtful questions. Always ask if there's something been done before that may be helpful, as well as who might have done something similar recently. Sorry if sounds condescending, not remotely intended to be, I've trained a lot of new peeps over the years. Helpful if you can find someone who has been there a bit longer than You, but that you don't work for. They tend to like to help bc they just went through what you're going through and know how best to informally help. Also network with peers from school that have started similar jobs.. good to have a few people to call to discuss/learn with. Good luck.
