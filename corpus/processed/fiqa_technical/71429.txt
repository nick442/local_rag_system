"Your agent doesn't understand what ""willing to sell"" means in the housing big market. Willing to sell doesn't mean they can wait forever to sell. It used to be these people were moving so they had to sell their house. Now the people who own houses don't need to sell it because they can just sit around and rent it to someone. If people are unwilling to list the house they are unwilling to sell the house."
