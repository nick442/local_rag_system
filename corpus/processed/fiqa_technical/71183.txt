Hmm.. Oh. I had to get the Amazon Underground (Android) app. Now it looks like I can watch on my phone. That's weird. After reading more, this is the old Amazon app store, which I never reinstalled when I got my current phone. People also manage to stream by casting their phone's screen. Still not an elegant solution, but better than nothing. I wonder why you need their app store to watch their video content. I already have Amazon Music and Amazon Prime apps, seems silly to need the app store to watch video 0.o.
