I don't think anyone is blaming animal agriculture on its own for global warming issues. At the same time its undeniable at this point to say animal agriculture is not a leading environmental problem, even if it is 'just 14.5% of emissions', the deforestation, the ridiculous amounts of fresh water needed, and the untreated sewage wastage. . Also, so your argument is that hey we're producing enough food for everyone even though its an extremely inefficient way of producing calories - so whats to worry about? As much as we'd like to think we have unlimited resources, we don't. Our gluttony is destroying the planet. In addition to the environmental costs, it simply doesn't make sense to allocate the majority of our crops to feed and grow the billions of land animals when we could allocate those crops to foods that can feed people directly. You may not like to admit it, vegan and plant-based when it comes to food are the equivalents of 'clean energy', and animal based foods is akin oil and coal. Which is probably why vegan fast food is attracting the biggest investors. It's the future.
