"I know WFM have an expensive reputation, but their prices aren't that bad on many things, their products are generally high-quality, and the store experience (cleanliness, checkout flow, etc.) is better than most other supermarkets I know of. I feel like customer service could be better, but I digress. With that being said, I hope that Amazon aren't going to lower the quality standards along with the prices. I don't want WFM to become another lousy Walmart ""Neighbourhood Market."" I personally don't care for their image, rather the value I get, but Amazon's agenda can potentially erode both their image and value."
