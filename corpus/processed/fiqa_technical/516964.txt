What is best for everyone is maximizing the effectiveness of the resources at hand. We are most certainly not doing that, as there is just so much capacity sitting idle right now. Demand is what we are lacking. Stimulus creates demand. Demand puts people to work, it builds companies, it brings ideas to fruition. Effective limiters can be used to avoid consequences of an overheating economy when that time comes, but we are far away from that point. Imposing these silly superstitions that somehow someday the U.S. is going to get to a point where we can't pay back our debt is making us lose focus on the fact that real people are suffering today, and that we can do something about it. Without artificial constraints like congress putting a limit on the debt, **it is impossible for the U.S. government to default.**
