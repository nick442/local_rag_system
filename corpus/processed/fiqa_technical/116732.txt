"This sounds exactly like being an assistant professor. 1) Deal with nebulous and arbitrary funding agencies (""One ""good"" rating means you don't get funded!"") 2) Force your grad students to work long hours on very tenuous projects 3) Still might not get tenure depending on whims of your colleagues and administration, no matter how productive you are"
