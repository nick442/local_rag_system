"> Do you expect people who work at Sears to have a large allotment of skill assets in the first place? Absolutely not. In fact, I completely agree with your underlying point - the way American society is going, there is a steadily decreasing number of jobs for people willing to work, but without specific, modern technical skills. But what happens to your 50-something worker at Sears who's been working there for 20 years? It's all very well to say that e should have kept eir skills up-to-date, but is this actually realistic? Do you really expect this person to move from Housewares to writing Python programs? And before you say, ""Don't project,"" I'd point out that I work hard to keep my skillset up-to-the-minute.. but not everyone can do this, and many people have children and families that occupy their lives, thank Goodness for them! So you're absolutely right. Society is changing and people like those people working at Sears won't be able to make a living any more. And it will be bad."
