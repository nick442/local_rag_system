>$1160 per month, lets say you only have one kid. >Oh, wait, taxes are taken out. You really only have about $1,000 to work with. To be fair with your calculation, with $1,160 a month, you're not subject to federal income tax and most likely no state income tax, *especially* with a child. That adds an extra $1,900 to the calculation. Plus you'll get a $1,000 child tax credit from the government. I'm not saying the extra $3,000 is enough to live on, but that calculation above leaves a bit out. Edit: Brainfart - I forgot about Social Security / FICA. In most years it's around 7.65%, which would be about $1,000.
