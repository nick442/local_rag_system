I am sure some studios at some point in time cook their books for one reason or another but the example given is a really bad one. If the movie sites did $150m in box then I can see why it didn't net anything. Movie theaters keep about half the box, so the net revenue is $75m. The average marketing budget is $37m for a movie, so it wouldn't surprise me if they spent $30m on marketing. That leaves $45m. Then the studio needs to charge the production company for all of their services. For instance for a third party movie they often charge 15% of net revenue for distribution. So that would leave about $32m. Then there are financing charges and all kinds of what are effectively rental charges for use of the lot, studio time, etc. Point is that it is actually quite easy to see how this movie had a zero net.
