Minimum wage is terribly low. However, someone making $1700 a month (income from first job), does not have to be homeless in Kansas. You are not living in the ritzy neighborhood, and would need to budget. But this is a long way from homelessness. The average 2bed Kansas City is [under $500 per month](https://www.kcpremierapts.com/how-we-work/nitty-gritty/kansas-city-apartment-pricing.html) in some neighborhoods. That leaves enough money for food. Not a desirable lifestyle, but a long way above homelessness unless there are mental health and addiction issues.
