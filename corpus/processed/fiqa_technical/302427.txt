"I hate to put down the beloved people of Woody Guthrie and Steinbeck, but it really is a bunch of descendents of Dust Bowl refugees from Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, etc. who have been oppressed by the political powers since the 1930s. Many of their descendents have overcome the oppression and integrated but there is still a huge population of people descended from people who had to fight tooth and claw simply to get the right to work on farms for minimum wage, and now there's a huge working and often idle class of ignorant people known as ""white trash"" in California's Central Valley."
