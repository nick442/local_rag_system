">The problem is that the Boomers will only start dying when GenX starts retiring. Ah, but the key there is when GenX **starts** retiring (meaning when the OLDEST GenX'ers hit retirement age). The younger GenX'ers will still be in the prime of their life (late 40's and 50's -- and so certainly able to own/operate the funeral homes, casket & urn manufacturing operations, etc -- especially those who finally inherit their ""Silent Generation"" parents assets/savings). >While your advice made me chuckle, it is better directed at Millenials. :) The GenY Millenials will certainly have the *opportunity* to benefit, but (especially the younger ones -- yet to reach adulthood) will likely be the ""menial"" labor of the Boomer ""death/dying\* boom"" (but as I have said in other places, they can probably pretty easily demand HIGH wages for said menial labor, because the demand will outweigh the supply -- thus the accumulated ""assets"" of the Boomers will {one way or another} be transferred to GenX & GenY, even if it is a bit belatedly and perforce). ;-) \*It's not limited to the funeral part, there's gonna be BIG BUSINESS in things like nursing homes, and a high demand (and thus high wages) for bedpan changers, and sponge-bath givers, etc. (at least if the boomers want to be RESPECTFULLY treated by their sponge-bath givers.. they will learn to ""tip"" with $100 bills for having their crack ""properly"" wiped, those who don't {or can't} tip will be left to ""stew"" in their own juices so to speak)."
