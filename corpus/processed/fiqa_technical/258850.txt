Yeah, glass toys made by companies like pipedream and gl√§s seem to retail for around $50 and up, so I'd expect something made of rose quartz to sell for considerably more, and that I have no qualms with. All the chakra and energy and healing talk, however, do irk me a little. But hey, if people are into it, they're into it.
