If you're really strapped for cash, you can get one on the off-chance the furnace or air conditioner goes. But if you do have the cash to self-insure against these kinds of things, I wouldn't bother with the home warranty. Here was our experience. Our daughter was only a few months old, and the air conditioner went in June, in Virginia. We called in the warranty. They came out, tried the cheapest fix they could to fix the leak. It didn't work again in two days. Two weeks later, they try again with the next cheapest fix. (By this point, we had gotten a window unit for our bedroom.) It didn't work again in two days. Two more weeks later, they finally got authorization to replace the unit. They replaced it with the cheapest one they could, and wanted to charge me $75 to haul the old one away. When I said no thanks to that extra service (I was calling from work at the time), the guy ended the conversation in a huff, walked away from the phone and drove off. I later found out (when I called a reputable HVAC guy) that they didn't even hook the thing up correctly! What happens is the contractors get squeezed by the warranty company at every turn. These calls get low priority, and the quality of service is as low as they can get away with without violating the terms of their contract with the warranty company. For the big stuff, it's better than nothing, but not much better. Check to see that the big stuff is still covered before buying it at all, and drop it after getting a payout (like we did).
