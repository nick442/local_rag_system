You're missing the point. I'm suggesting (maybe poorly) that we should boycott corporations who support this legislation. I feel that few movies would be missed, although others would disagree. Which is their right, constitutionally as it would happen. If a studio does not support the legislation, I suggest supporting them with the dollars you would otherwise spend supporting the boycotted studios. No doubt movies are art, as is literature, fine arts and so on. I support a person or company's right to intellectual property, and their right to protect it. I do not support, and can not support a corporation or person who supports, the broad ham-fisted approach that is SOPA. I believe that it is a direct attack on our freedom of expression, and thus supporters of it are attacking our freedom of expression. I'm appalled that you would not sacrifice the enjoyment of a film to try to voice your opinion that you deserve the right to voice your opinion. The people supporting SOPA are the buggy whip manufacturers lobbying against the auto industry. They need to innovate instead of stifling the free communication of ideas.
