Those are valid criticisms. But Uber has revolutionised a market that was desperately needing it, and – without excusing Uber's actions – in many places the corruption around taxis makes today's Uber look clean as a whistle in comparison, while also delivering a phenomenal service to consumers. These are also things that haven't necessarily been put in front of people, especially not until the last few months. Right now there are very few other companies doing this so well in the eyes of the consumer but I'm sure when there is more competition, ethical concerns will be more visible. At this point, with some exceptions, most Uber users literally cannot get the same level of service from anyone else even if they paid three times as much.
