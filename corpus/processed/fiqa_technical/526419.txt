It's not valuable in that sense as it's pretty much uncontrollable. Reddit has one of the most outrage obsessed cultured out of any major internet platform. People here flip out about anything and everything. Take a look at the thousands of people who genuinely believe that McDonald's post in /r/gaming is a shill post for McDonlads posted secretly by an Ad agency. Despite the photo containing alcohol, an absolute massive giveaway that it's not gone through McDonalds and an Apple keyboard in the shot with the food looking like garbage. Something like that would absolutely never go through a client in a corporation as big as McDonald's, legally they wouldn't even be allowed to do it anyway. If they're showing alcohol in an ad they cannot serve that ad to under eighteens. Something you cannot control on Reddit, Facebook and twitter allow you to target over eighteens for instance. McDonald's aren't going go open themselves up legally to that just so they can shill on a gaming Reddit. Not to mention major clients like McDonald's don't really give a damn about Reddit hence it's abysmal profitability. They barely even care about Twitter. The only really care about Facebook and Google. McDonald's would never waste money on some shill post on the gaming Reddit in the first place, the world get far, far more results using that adspend on Facebook instead and would already know that. And on top of all that the ad would be extremely poorly targeted as it's supposedly an ad for the UK uber eats delivery service yet the majority of the users on r/gaming are from the US and not in the small London based areas which the service is available. Yet despite all of that, thousands and thousands of Redditors are outraged and up in arms over it. Reddit is awful as an ad platform really.
