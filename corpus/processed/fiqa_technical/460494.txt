No, you can also become more senior within the firm. It's not a board (of directors), it's just committees. Junior people (analyst/associates) screen deals and present it to senior people (VPs, directors) and if they think the deal should go ahead then even more senior people (MD/partners) will look at it and make the final decision. But such processes obviously depend on the firm..
