compare it to 2003 ?. forget about the article, did you even read the title here ?. it says that the median net worth right now is at a level not seen since the early **1990s**. its like the pendulum, when it swings back.it won't stop in the middle right away, it just goes to the other extreme. provided no one messes with it, it will stop in the middle eventually.
