"> At the same time, you were comparing this program to courses taught by MIT and Harvard and the CFA designation. > I was pointing out the method of instruction of these programs, not equating this program to them. Nor was I referencing the full-time, on-campus, ""real"" master's degrees offered by MIT or Harvard, as you seem to be. It being called a master's is probably deceptive, I'll agree with you there. It should be called a certificate, perhaps. But the US does not protect academic titles or control who can and who cannot claim to issue a master's degree. Blame that on politics."
