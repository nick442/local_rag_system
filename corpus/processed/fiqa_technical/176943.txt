well, saying: >DJIA went from 6,626.94 in March 6, 2009 to 17,100.18 in July 18, 2014. That's nearly a 200% increase in 5 years. The economy, on the other hand, has not reflected this rise. is disingenuous at best since you're measuring the starting point from the depth of recession, when the stock market was severely undervalued. This is also why many mutual funds boast absolutely ridiculous 5-year yields right now. The Dow hovered around 12,500 for much of 2007~2008, so if you used that as the baseline the index recovered to those levels in the 2nd quarter of 2011. From that point onwards, it's only a 25% increase over 3+ years for an 8% APR, in line with historic values. I'm not gonna get into whether QE is good fiscal policy or not, all I'm saying is the tapering/ending of QE won't result in a full-on reversal like people seem to be expecting.
