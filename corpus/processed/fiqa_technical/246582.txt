I'm not quite sure what version of reality you were watching during the past 6 weeks, but the customers did absolutely boycott this store. I was one them. If you had bothered to step out with any of these protesters, you would have found associates and customers alike. The store remained opened and there was always merchandise to buy. I went into my store, repeatedly during this 6 week boycott and the shelves were always stocked and being stocked. Meat, produce, seafood, and some dairy was not being delivered because, if it was not being bought, it was just being thrown away. Many vendors had stepped forward and publicly stated that because of the Board's irresponsibility in their handling with the Artie T matter, it was costing them business and they were no longer going to do business with Market Baskett until ATD was reinstated. This was a boycott, because putting a financial stranglehold on the business was the only way to make the Board listen to what was being said.
