It's a deal! And I bet that Trump wins in 2020 and Hillary rots in jail way before that. > I'm not saying the email thing wouldn't have lost some people their jobs and brought on possible charges, but it's not a super serious crime People went to jail for taking a picture (not shared with anyone) of a secret place. **But, just the fact that sleazy Hillary conspires with fake-news CNN to cheat on debate questions, something that my son would be expelled from school if he cheat like that on his test, something that NEVER EVER happened before and there was no need for it (it's just debate questions, the Trump handled very well): all this to show you how corrupt, evil, untrustworthy and conspiring is the DNC and Hillary.** True or false?
