"While I do not have an issue with treating customers/clients well the whole mentality of ""the customer is always right"" needs to be re-evaluated. In a case where a customer has unreasonable demands or is treating an employee poorly (by no fault of the employee) their privilege to be right ends. In situations like that it is more important to stand up for your employees then it is to side with the customer. If you do side with the customer in that situation it not only reinforces that behavior from the customer but makes the employee feel undervalued and will lead to morale issues. If your workplace has consistent morale issues you will have a high-turnover rate, this will end up costing you considerably more not just in human capital, but in workplace knowledge, time and most prominently money. Chances are if a customer is being a huge drain of your resources they are likely not worth too much to your company to begin with (see below). Another reason why this mentality of every customer is valuable is a bad idea is found within the 80/20 principle. Simply put, 80 % of your revenue will come from 20% of your customer base, and usually the 20% tend to be the lowest maintenance and have the lowest resource demand. Another application of this principle shows that 20% of your customer base accounts for 80% of the resource usage within your company. The principle itself is not limited to 80/20, but the axiom of a majority of x is provided by the minority of y is something that remains consistent across economies and cultures. In short, not all customers are created equal and as a result do not deserve the same resources as one another. In addition to this, workforce integrity is more important in the long run than possibly losing a customer. Average firms provide ""Good Service"", excellent firms provide ""Smart Service""."
