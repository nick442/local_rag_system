>Says who? Says the business that created the position. Are they looking for someone to work all day, every day, and therefore require a full salary that supports adult life? Or are they looking for someone to cover a 4 hour shift a few nights a week in their spare time? >Companies could easily cut a third of their workers and increase hours.. Why would they do that? That's a horrible business move. If the job you need done is unskilled and no-responsibility, it just makes sense to hire teenagers and students to do it. They want beer money, and you want a simple job done cheap. Everyone wins. Aldis, Costco, etc have different business models. They pay more to attract better employees, but not every business follows their model - nor could they. As I said before, the problem is that we have a lack of actual full time jobs available. Not that fast food places pay beer money or refuse to turn register positions into career opportunities. You can't empathize your way out of reality.
