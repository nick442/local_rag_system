I think in the uk to break into finance you only really need: - To have gone to a target (UCL/ICL/LSE/Oxford/Cambridge) - Have some relevant work experience. (Internships are pretty easy to get) If those two can't get your foot in the door then and only then should you look for additional qualifications (imo) I'm also trying to get into the industry and literally all of my friends who scored FO positions have literally just done that + been in a few societies.
