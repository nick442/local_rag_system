When I have had background/credit checks, I have had to fill out a form first. You may be able to attach your proof that the debts are paid to your form. I had a friend that bombed his background check because his birth certificate and passport didn't have matching names (two variations on the same name, but it spooked the securitiy company). He had a chance to contest the finding and was still hired.
