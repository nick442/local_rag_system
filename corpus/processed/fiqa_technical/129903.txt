Paying this off early is robbing yourself of the extra earning potential for this money. Think of it as an interest free loan from your future self. If you can otherwise use that money to get a better rate of return then you are better off putting it there. Best options would normally be to use it to buy additional regular RRSPs, RESPs, or TFSA because of government benefits but even puting the extra into a GIC for a year is better than paying back home buyers plan early.
