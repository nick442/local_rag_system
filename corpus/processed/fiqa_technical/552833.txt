I'd recommend Introductory Econometrics by Wooldridge. It was a staple in my undergraduate years, although I'm not sure how much it differs from the one by Brooks. Also, I would suggest looking into Mathematical Statistics. It helps with understanding some of the more complicated models used in forecasting (understanding maximum likelihood estimation, etc, was key for me). Here's a free textbook that I found helpful as well: http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/Teaching221/Forecasting.pdf
