What a great idea! A small business owner helping other small business owners. It's true -- to be a relevant small business in this day and age, you have to be visible on the world wide web. I use the world wide web multiple times a day to get information about businesses that I am interested in doing business with or to comparative shop. I don't think I am alone in this.
