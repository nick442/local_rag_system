If you earn Rupees, keep your money as Rupees, and spend the money on items denominated in Rupees, the dollar doesn't mean much to you any more than the Italian Lira means to me.. Do you mean to track as though they were dollars or actually convert as you earn the money? From X-rates, I looked at this chart. There's been a 10% swing in the exchange rate very recently. But going back, the years are not so volatile. Year 2000 ranged 43-46, so the volatility and drop in the rupee to over 50 is only recent. Has India experience inflation that concerns you? (disclaimer - I am slightly aware of the Euro in terms of dollar value, but not followed currencies for some time now)
