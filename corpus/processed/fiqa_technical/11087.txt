"Your best bet might be to visit a local IRS office in person. To find your local office, use the IRS office locator page. After you enter your zip code and find your nearest office, click on the ""hours and services"" link, which will show you a list of every office in your state. For each office, you can click on the ""services provided"" link to make sure that they handle ""payment arrangements"" at your selected office. Finally, you should probably call the local office first to see if you need an appointment, so you don't have to wait."
