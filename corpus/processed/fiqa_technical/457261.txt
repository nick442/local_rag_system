So your solution is take all three away. Take illegals, felons and potheads out if the jobs that 20 years ago the potheads and felons filled. Who exactly do you plan to fill those jobs with? The homeless? Who are all felons and potheads. Or ok automation. Fine but don't cry when society goes down the tubes because so many people are on the streets with no where to turn but crime/drugs. Then eventually in prison that you pay for. It was your idea though that you support. Sorry bud but I think it's your idea shooting yourself in the foot, literally.
