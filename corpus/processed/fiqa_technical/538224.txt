If you adopt the definition of functionality being what defines something as smart, then having the average person unable to use -something which its intended purpose being the abstraction of production into a roughly quantified measure- would make it too dumb rather than smart. The entire purpose of money is to make trade easier. If money becomes too complicated for the average person it is no longer as functional as alternatives. Unless we want extreme class separation it is in our best interest to keep systems meant for simplicity simple. Even thinking of a future where money is too complicated gives off a very dividing sentiment.
