"I used prosper.com about 4-5 years ago and all my loans have paid off since. I stopped using it because it was difficult to find people who were not fools. The last straw was a profile that went something like this: ""NEED $5k TO GET OUT OF DEBT"" and then listed Cable TV as a $130/mo expense along with a bunch of other frivolous stuff. Perhaps it has improved since?"
