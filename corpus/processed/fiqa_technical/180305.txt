Getting about a dollar more per day is the difference between starving and not starving for many people. If you compare that to the alternative without globalization, that is: not getting a dollar a day and starve, that's good. The author isn't comparing globalization with pre globalization, he's comparing globalization with his fantasy, and calling the reality outside of his fantasy a lie. What a visionary. And I'm so bloody tired of people not understanding resources. If these 63 people would throw their money to the poor that wouldn't make food magically appear, that would just make food prices go up, leaving the poor with as much food, but a bunch of useless paper-scraps as well. for the 100:th time: communism doesn't work.
