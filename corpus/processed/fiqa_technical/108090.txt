He's comfortably middle class, but not wealthy. The Tesla was purchased in a multi-owner shared arrangement, and the solar panels were installed by a company that supplies the capital for the panels with a long-term agreement to supply power to the homeowner and takes care of the more complex business agreements to feed back power to the grid. The situation on paper looks like a long term break even - but we'll have to see. Overall, even if he's paying a bit more in electric cost, the arrangement gives a lot of stability in exchange. To me it's clear that going electric car + renewable electric is a long-term good on the principle of becoming nationally independent from geopolitical enganglements, but also more towards becoming individually independent in terms of being isolated from instability in gas prices, utility prices, and even in times of natural disaster.
