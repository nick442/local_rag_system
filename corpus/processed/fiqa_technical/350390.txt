I know people complain about Best Buy. People complain about everything. But just speaking from personal experience, I have no issues with Best Buy. I even spent about $1,000 on a TV there a couple years ago, and didn't like the TV. I took it back and exchanged it for a different model. No questions asked. Their prices are fair. The customer service is usually fine. In fact, it's a little better than fine because I'm pretty sure they don't make any kind of commission, so I never feel pressured.
