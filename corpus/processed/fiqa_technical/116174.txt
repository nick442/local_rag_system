It's perfectly consistent with capitalism. Through the process of the market, not every resource is used most productively, ie there is always going to be waste somewhere in some form, but the goal of maximum productivity is still what is practically desired by entrepreneurs. I only brought up the govt job example to show an instance of unproductive work versus productive work, not to relate anything to government funded employment per se.
