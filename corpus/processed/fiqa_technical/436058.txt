Jobless claims are up, but this is due to the continued loss of public sector jobs. This is what happens when you shrink the size of government. The private sector actually added jobs, just not enough to offset the loss from the public sector. So recession? I say no. Still, with the uncertainty in Europe, a slowing economy in China, and the JP Morgan mess, the markets are skittish, and any little thing is going to make a sell off likely.
