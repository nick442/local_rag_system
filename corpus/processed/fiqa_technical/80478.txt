"I'm in a similar boat. I've come to a simple conclusion. There are three choices: * Get something liquid that paces inflation. Stocks or bonds or something. Your 500USD 2014 dollars will still be worth about 500USD 2014 dollars in the future. If you need the change, you pull it and spend it. * Upfront capital for something entrepreneurial. I don't know what to do, you don't either. Whatever it is it's probably a fuckton of work. I've heard stories about guys busting ass for a lawnmowing business and employing their peers for pennies on the dollar. 8 bucks is in the range of minimum wage. Charge 15 bucks an hour for your service and you've just become the recipient of 7 ""free"" dollars an hour for somebody else's labor. Congrats, you've got the first taste of capitalism. * Buy a motorcycle. Fun. Cheap. Sexy. Fun. Economical. Fun. Pushes all the right buttons for those in our position: you get economical transportation, it's fun as hell, and bitches love it. Wear leathers. I think I'd choose the motorcycle. Youth is fleeting, money is infinite. Don't be the average first-time Harley purchaser: 50 years old and way too old to enjoy it."
