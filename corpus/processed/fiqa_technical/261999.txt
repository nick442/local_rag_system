An actual discussion question? I just wanna push fluff to get traffic on my blog! The millenials did it!! In all seriousness, the housing market is all about supply and demand. Namely, there arent many housing being built across the US right now, so thats driving prices up. Cheap loans also helped diminish the supply because those who could bought up a lot of rental properties since '08. So these things have caused home prices to steadily climb, especially in desirable places to live such as large college towns, Boston, San Fran, etc. But keeping demand in check are a few thingns too. Rates are now going up and few millenials can afford starter homes due to student debt and relatively lower income in their late 20s than their parents. Plus theyre having less kids at the moment. So thats all pushing demand down, especially in rural areas. The wild card, IMO, will be the impending recession and the huge sell off in 10-15 years when all the Boomers start hitting their late 70s and early 80s. So theres your major volatility.
