As it should be. Taxes are theft. No one faults a traveler for taking a different route because one is known to be rife with criminals. Businesses build jobs, strengthen economies, provide value. Governments take by force, waste, abuse, and use their revenue to build armies and violate rights. The bad they do (including the initial act of theft) far outweighs any good.
