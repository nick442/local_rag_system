That last one. The government should subsidize the cost of maternity leave (and mandate paternity leave). It's not fair for women not to have equal employment opportunities, but it's also not fair to force businesses to shoulder the cost of providing leave to mothers who might not even come back anyway. The best solution is to have taxes pay for some of that cost.
