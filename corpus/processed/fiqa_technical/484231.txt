You’re conflating deductions with expenses, which are different. Revenue is all money collected. Income is revenue minus the sum of expenses and deductions and exemptions. You’re also treating direct subsidies as the only form of subsidisation, which would make the word “direct” superfluous, while ignoring indirect subsidies, which include deductions. And, no, not every business takes deductions and certainly not while simultaneously complaining (or standing idly by while others complain) about subsidies.
