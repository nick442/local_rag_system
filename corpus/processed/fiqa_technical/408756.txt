Inflation is low because middle class salaries/wages have stagnated (in addition to the fact their their measures of inflation aren't relevant to the thinning middle who are seeing their real earnings decrease). I mean it's not that difficult to understand and all their data points to this reality. If they can't explain why, it's because they don't want to have to explain it.
