Where does your image show the following entry: * Massive fees paid to parent corporation in tax-free state, to avoid local income tax This is much like the way Microsoft siphons off ALL its revenue to some tax-free haven with similar deals. If I were benevolent dictator, there would be no income tax, and no tac on profit of any kind. There would only be Sales Tax. Corporations can't avoid or evade sales taxes, because they are leveraged at the point of sale, and the vendor send the government the money. Income tax is retarded.
