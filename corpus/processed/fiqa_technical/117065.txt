It is illegal. Coverage has a lot of minimum requirements. What has really hurt Obamacare is that it groups those that were formerly uninsured, with those that don't have employer insurance. It turns out those that were previously uninsured (often very poor) are very expensive to insure. So that has forced up premiums on everyone else. The link of health insurance to employment in the US is to blame. The sooner everyone is forced to buy their own insurance, and then preferably the government offers medicare buy in for all, the sooner the system can be cleaned up.
