>Those nerds aren't in charge of industry though. Yes they are. I have friend who do PR and corporate communications work for auto and tech companies in China - most of the CEO's are Ivy-league educated technocrats. >China partners with companies to acquire technology still. They don't develop it. Well duh -they're a late-blooming developing economy. Just wait one or two decades and see if they're still doing the same.
