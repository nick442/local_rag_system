Taking every court to case isn't in the best interest of the public either (on a net basis). Often those settlements accept the fine, but dong admit guilt. This can be important in federally regulated industries where guilt would result in automatic suspension of licenses and practice. Those regulations were put in place knowing that most companies would settle. Also, there's valid reason for deducting the settlement! In many businesses lawsuits are ordinary expenses (consumer facing ones with lots and lots of employees). People being up frivolous suits all the time and it's cheaper to settle for a small amount than pay expansive attorneys to go to court. Effectively, it's like an admin expense, we don't tax revenue, we tax profit. Finally, this would seriously clog courts, and jury's can be crazy biased to emotional stories. Yes, some parts could be changed, but it serves a valid purpose.
