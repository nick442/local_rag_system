Not surprising. People have less money nowadays. There are two Silicon Valley malls that do well. 1 is Valley Fair in Santa Clara, maybe because there's enough people with money to shop there. I don't go there often though because of the traffic around that area. Yuck! The other mall is the Great Mall in Milpitas. It's mostly outlet stores and if it's not an outlet store, it's often a store that's often in a strip mall However, the mall in Cupertino is a ghost town and is looking to be redeveloped. Come to think of it, you used to go to a mall for premium items. However, more stores outside malls have them like Bed, Bath, and Beyond. In fact, there's times where Bed, Bath, and Beyond has higher quality than what's at the mall. Also, outdoor malls seem to be taking hold more than indoor malls
