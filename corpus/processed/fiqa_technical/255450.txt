Many drug developments are not finding cures for new diseases but finding better drugs/ways to improve existing ones. That's why you have a ton of anti inflammatory drugs, each with a purpose. Even then, each drug, like dexamethazone can be in development to treat something else. Or even in development on how to improve safety/efficacy. Funding these are unbelievably expensive. Wages for scientists, contractors, equipment.etc, and cost of failed drugs are immense. Keeping shareholders happy may be essential to keep the fundings coming.
