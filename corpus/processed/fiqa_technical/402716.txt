An employer also needs somebody to show up on time, be reliable and can take written instruction. A college degree also means that they can find different classrooms throughout the day, listen for 50 minutes and DO THAT FOR YEARS. Nearly anybody can do something for 5 minutes. I've employed people and those two are most difficult to suss out in less than 90 days.
