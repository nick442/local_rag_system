Are you referencing the stupidity of average tv subscribers? It seems like TV could face serious problems with regards to ad revenue without a serious drop in the subscriber base. DVR and the internet seem to pose a big threat to the status quo. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought advertising was a huge proportion of tv profits.
