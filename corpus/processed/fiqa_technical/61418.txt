">BPI took such a hard hit because they showed the world that they're the type of company willing to sell people really nasty shit just to make a buck (in my opinion). Honestly, if there was a news expose on 90% of the processed food that is on grocery store shelves, people would have the same reaction. You would be shocked as to what happens in food manufacturing facilities. Yes, there are FDA, USDA, and many other agencies that do both announced and surprise audits of food manufacturers to ensure food safety, but this is just a snapshot in time, and the food is only deemed as safe as to the standards of that company and what the definition of ""safe"" is. IMO, yes, BPI took a huge hit because of this being called pink slime. Are they manufacturing something that is potentially dangerous for consumption? Possibly. That all depends on who you ask what ""safe for consumption"" means. Are lobbyists involved? Bet your ass they are. But the market at the time was demanding a type of beef that was super lean. All BPI did was find a way to fulfill that need. I don't know what the outcome of this will be, but I can absolutely see both sides of the argument. The press needs to be free to report on anything and everything. However, there needs to be regulation regarding what they can and can not say from a slander standpoint. Coming up with a cute catch phrase such as ""pink slime"" is slanderous, and potentially damaging. That's where I agree with you and believe that they should have reported on the factual inclusions in the finished product. /rant"
