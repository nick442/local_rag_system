I think you're missing my point. I'm not saying automation isn't useful or beneficial to society. I feel it's disingenuous to argue there would be no net job loss. Companies won't invest capital unless there is the prospect of a return. Therefore, they won't build robots unless they are saving on labor. If they have to replace an equal number of unskilled laborers with skilled laborers at a higher cost in addition to the capital expenditure to purchase the robots, it doesn't make sense to purchase the robots. Companies adopt automation because it saves them money in the long run, mostly by replacing human workers and resulting in a net job loss.
