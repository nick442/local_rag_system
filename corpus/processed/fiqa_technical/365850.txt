The article doesn't say how many hours they worked, so let's work it out. If this was 12 hours a day 6 out of 7 days then it's a completely different ballgame and 220k is just what it costs. I don't care what they make in a year, I care what they would make if they were working 40 hrs a week. >The special-ops sergeant who made $265,059 is the highest paid policeman so far this year. His pay includes $115,394 in overtime. That means he made 115k by working past 8 hours a day, five days a week. Presumably. So 265k - 115k is still 140k per year at 40 hrs. That means that cop makes 70 dollars an hour.
