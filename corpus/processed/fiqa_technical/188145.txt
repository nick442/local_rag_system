In my area, motor fuel taxes pay for road maintenance. The state of Illinois takes a share and send the rest to my local government. They are required to use the money only for roads. It is never enough to pay for all needed repairs, so roads are repaired based on state use estimates, road commissioner decisions and local board directions.
