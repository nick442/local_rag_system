>mostly due to negligible labor costs That can be true for clothing and shoes, but why cannot the US make cheap electronic equipment, where the labor cost is negligible? I know the answer to that. There was a time, in the 1970s, when assembling electronic equipment involved a lot of hand work. Chips were packaged into assemblies like the [JEDEC TO-5 package](http://electriciantraining.tpub.com/14186/css/14186_34.htm) where there was a lot of very small wires that had to be soldered by hand using a microscope. (I am an electronics engineer, graduated in 1979, that's why I know this) Today electronic circuits are totally [made by robots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Juki_KE-2080L_by_Megger.jpg). The factories that went out of the US in the 1980s because of the labor costs have now been robotized. They are in countries where labor cost is not so significantly smaller by now than in the USA, like Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore. The US lost its competitive edge in electronics thirty years ago, and will not get it back without significant investment. Investment that will not be made, unless corporations get tax cuts in capital gains and depreciation.
