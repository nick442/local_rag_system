"There's no way to confirm this anecdote I'm about to say tell you guys. However, I'm a computer programmer. I went for a job interview a few years ago at a top-tier bank. When they sat me down for the interview. They told me that their job was to take a rich person's income and let's say they pay 40% in tax. They'll move it around so that they pay 20% in tax. Also, these banks .. a lot of the programmers are earning 550-650 per-day and that's in pound sterling. These programmers will create a company and pay themselves the lowest salary rate. So they will avoid as much tax as possible because it's their ""company"". Those programmers aren't in the millionaire range though. They're probably just pulling over 100,000 pounds a year taxed at a really low rate. After working with them .. you can't make any of these guys feel anything."
