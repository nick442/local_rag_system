I agree they are able to reduce prices in store to thin margins and rely on on a large amount of sales. My point is that the cost increase on product from wages is proportionally smaller than the increase in pay the worker is taking home. So yes, a Big Mac would cost about 17 cents more at a minimum wage of $15 an hour to maintain the same margins ( https://www.google.com/amp/s/thinkprogress.org/amp/p/184b7523b273 ), but the workers wage is doubled.
