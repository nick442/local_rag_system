One of the main criticisms made by product companies (especially publishers) of Amazon.com is that it violates the price floors on various products. When Amazon routinely sells products at a heavily discounted price, the product companies feel that the product gets devalued. Amazon has often been accused of anticompetitive behavior, because other retailers cannot compete with their discounts. It's interesting that this article makes the exact opposite claim --- that the product companies are the ones who are anticompetitive.
