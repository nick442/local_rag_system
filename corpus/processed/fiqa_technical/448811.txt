Why pick one - blame both. The government and politicians have done a bad job of regulating the industry, and have effectively taken bribes to allow this - so vote appropriately and let them know why. Comcast is a shitty company that doesn't care about its customers - so you should vote with your wallet and avoid them. Neither is innocent.
