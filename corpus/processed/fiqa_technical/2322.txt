thats my main regret - similar to cfa vs. mba they only hire kids right out of top tier schools with inflated gpas (harvard im looking at you) and these kids dont know their asses from their elbows and they immediately get into the models and bottles mindset id take a state schooler with a level head any day over wanna be rainmakers
