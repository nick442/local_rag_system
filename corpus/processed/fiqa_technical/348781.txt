Don't discount regulatory issues (the mess that was CableCard, Tru2Way, tuning adapters, and the lack of AllVid) and monopolistic pressure (the cable companies liked receiving $5/box/month and don't want to give any of that income up, combined with fear of becoming the dumb pipe they really are so they applied as much pressure as possible against good regulations).
