Range and energy density will keep a cap on electric car growth for a long, long, time. Try to estimate when it will be cheaper for a consumer to buy a certain size/quality electric car compared to a gas car of the same size/quality, and figure in total cost of ownership over 5 or 10 years. It is possible we are headed in that direction, but it is also possible that the time we get there is 50 years from now.
