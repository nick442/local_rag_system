"The odd thing about primary school education (that I hear from talking to teachers) is that the materials used in the classroom are all bought under some sort of district wide (or even state wide, in the case of texas) decision for which program to use. For reading they generally include a set of books (or single book) with a sequence of things to be taught. Teacher's who've been teaching for a long time will know which series has useful properties for teaching the material. They might refer to them by names, but it really just comes down to a set of materials and sequence of introducing material. When one teacher says to another ""I used $X to supplement the required $Y"" it'd be like a software engineer saying ""I used a hash map instead of a map for that case because it had better performance for the use case"" - there's a fair amount of baggage in the statement, but another software engineer would understand the differences and know what tradeoffs were being made. As to the ""Master's in Reading"" - there's a lot of goofy degrees offered through the Education departments at state schools. A large part of it is because the union pay scales include things like education level. They tend to be equivalent to any terminal masters program you'd find in other subjects - including MBA. ""Take these classes - part time and summers over the next 3 years, and if you pass them all, we give you a piece of paper that says ""Masters of Education - Reading"" or similar. It comes down to something like 45 credit hours with a focus on something. > Basically he/she just wants to ""work a program"" (by a semi-mindless rote) and is really only pissed because the programs keep being changed on them. I actually doubt that. It's going to come down to the sets of materials they have available for teaching. Some work, some don't. The structure of the system discourages improvisation, unfortunately, and the teachers often feel that they have their hands tied."
