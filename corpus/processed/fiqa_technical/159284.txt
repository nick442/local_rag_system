"I don't work at a ""call center,"" but my last two jobs were customer service where I had to answer the phone on occasion. It's amazing how often I got, ""Finally someone who speaks English!"" People care. The last time I called in for support and got a call center I knew they were going to transfer me to the US. If I'm calling in for support, it's a really difficult issue that even Google can't solve. The lady in India with no tech degree probably can't either."
