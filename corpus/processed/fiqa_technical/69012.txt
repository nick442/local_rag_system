"There are 2 different things, As per IT Act, one can get ""Medical Reimbursement"" upto Rs 15,000 which is tax free. The way it is supposed to work is an employee submits bill and employer will ""Reimburse"" upto Rs 15,000. So if one does not submit any bills, he does not get any money. If the employer has given the employee Rs 15,000 without any bills, it would have been taxed as per the tax bracket. In practise all employer factor the Rs 15,000 in the salary to the employee. If bills are submitted, then its tax free. If bill are not submitted, partially submitted, the difference is paid as ""Allowance"" and hence becomes taxable. Apart from above there is section 80D that provides additional rebate. Upto Rs 15,000 when health insurance is taken. Upto Rs 5,000 for Health checkup. Hence if you submit the details to your employer you will get rebate in tax, on Rs 5,000 it would be Rs 1,500/-. You would not get ""Reimbursement"". I should mention 20,000 under medical expenses Nope both are under different section as such you should declare these separately."
