Since the tenant reportedly left money in your mailbox, and now the money is missing, a crime must have been committed. As such, have her file a report with law enforcement and provide you with a copy of that report. Remind her that, for her safety, it is best to file the report during daylight hours with other people present. You didn't make it clear to your tenant the methods in which she could provide payment. That was a mistake. At the same time, her decision to leave cash in a mailbox was foolish. If she is willing to file a report with law enforcement and provide you with a copy, tell her that you will split the loss and only require half her rent as a one-time courtesy. Make it clear that you are losing half the money too. If she is not willing to file a report, require the full rent.
