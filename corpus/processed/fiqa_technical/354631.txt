"> It costs money to host a website. A technical problem with existing solutions. P2P moves terabytes of data every day in the conspicuous absence of money changing hands. If advertising is somehow 100% necessary for the client-server model, kill 'em both. The websites I like most don't even make anything. Reddit is all about comments from you guys. Image sites are all about artists. Youtube is all about some weirdo making mud huts. Each site on the web only provides a reliable point of exchange for user-generated files. Site owners demanding compensation for ""their"" content is an invitation to asking who controls the means of producing content."
