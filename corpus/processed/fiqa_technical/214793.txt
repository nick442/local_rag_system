> Taxi regulations exist to protect the public. It's not some racket to keep people out of the market. What makes you think that? And even if that were the case (it's not), why is the government more qualified to determine whether riding in a car is safe than the people actually choosing to ride in the cars? > Red-lining: Red-lining is where taxi companies will not server certain neighborhoods, meaning they will neither pick up nor drop off in the area. Which is good. Externalities are widely recognized as bad, even by the most liberal and progressive economists, and this internalizes costs. > Rates: Taxi rates are typically approved by the city so that companies can't constantly change them. This is a big one as far as Uber/Lyft goes. Customers are free to prefer companies that offer more stable prices. > Really what it comes down to is Uber/Lyft need to operate on a level playing field. They are a taxi service. There is absolutely no question about this and it isn't up for dispute. It *is* up to dispute, and you are wrong. Read any local laws about taxis, and it will be extremely clear that Uber and Lyft are not taxis.
