If flying business of first class allows your employee to be more productive, first class or business class is worth it. Small peas compared to the person losing a day’s work due to fatigue. The ticket is worth, what, an extra $1000? A day’s work for an executive is worth easily double that. And if you are flying multiple times a week on a regular basis, the extra comfort is well worth the cost.
