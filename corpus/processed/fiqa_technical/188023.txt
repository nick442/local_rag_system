Mark Zuckerburg is a mixture of hard work, intelligence, and soullessness. He spent more time working, reading, or studying, when others were out drinking. That's the story of most successful people. They spend their time taking risk, so they make their own luck. Sure, it boils down to luck, but you can't be lucky if you don't play. What people like to hear worse is that they can make their own success. Though success on the Facebook level seems to have some aspects of luck, most successful people are successful because they spend their time taking risk. If you are working for someone else, you are not taking a risk. If you are goofing off, you are not really taking a risk. Unless you are specifically building project for profit, or performing some service, this luck will never shine down on you.
