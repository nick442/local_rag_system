How do you manage things like right of way? Duplication of services etc? Are we to assume that all actors will build in good faith and allow all to access these pieces of infrastructure. What happens if we clog up all the first few meters of underground with network cable and the one water company needs to upgrade piping to meet population needs? Who co-ordinates all these kinds of things to ensure it works well? How are these people paid? Where do their interests lie? In the event of a big highway project tearing through a neighborhood who represents the people of the neighborhood and ensures their interests are heard as well? What about public services that are in no way profitable for a company to run or manage? I would love to just let the perfect free market reign however it completely ignores all kinds of physical and logistic realities.
