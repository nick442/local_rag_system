"In practice No, not at zero. Banks currently have the ability to borrow at very low interest rates but not quite at zero. Using the Fed Funds Range as a metric we can see that recently (Nov 2015) the lower bound of the fed funds range was 0.05%. Fed funds are overnight lend/borrow transactions between banks (often between the federal home loan banks and other institutions) 0.05% is also the FED's current Reverse Repo Program rate (RRP), which is the rate at which certain counterparties can deposit cash with the FED overnight in exchange for collateral. The collateral (US Treasuries) is insurance against the FED defaulting, a very low risk considering the FED has the ability to create more US Dollars out of thin air. In theory the RRP rate should be a lower bound for the fed funds rate however in practice it is possible to see lower rates trade in the street. What do you mean by ""Third party institutions""? Only banks of the highest credit quality are able to borrow at the lower bound of the Fed Funds range. These are usually large domestic banks like JP Morgan, Bank of NY etc.. As credit quality decreases the rate at which they borrow increases. Currently Skandinavien, German, French banks have relatively good credit and borrow overnight money towards the lower part of the fed funds range. Italian, Spanish and smaller regional US banks have lesser credit quality and borrow at the higher end of the Fed Funds range. Institutions with lower credit quality would borrow at still higher rates."
