I do notice a shit-load of fake reviews for certain items. Especially new products that just launch. They want to jumpstart sales, so they ask family, friends, or hire people to create fake reviews. I can usually spot the fakes because they are very oddly written. The praise of the seller and product are just too overblown. The average person doesn't talk like that, IMHO.
