"You call it ""gutting the core values"". I call it generating shareholders value. I used to be in investment banking and I'm now at a fortune 50 company. The amount of $$$ wasted on incompetent employees is incredible. ""The result is very quick employee burnout and turnover, and zero work-life balance."" What's wrong with this? You will attract a bunch of driven, hungry people who don't care about going home at 6pmor coming in to work during the weekend. Works fine for Goldman Sachs. Of course there is a limit. 3G can only do this for a certain type of jobs."
