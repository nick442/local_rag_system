They have an excellent history and Sprint stands to gain quite a bit if they keep unlimited data as well as having high data speeds. The fact that they only have 56 million subs also gives them room to grow. Both Verizon and AT&T have over 100 million subs and killed their unlimited data plans in the face of rising data usage. You're going to see those customers complain about data overage costs. If you give those customers a high-speed nationwide network with great coverage and unlimited data, what Sprint is aiming for (and they can accomplish it with the spectrum they have and the network overhaul project they're doing), customers will switch over. Sprint's network can support at least 2x their current subscriber base before exhibiting any kind of slowdown.
