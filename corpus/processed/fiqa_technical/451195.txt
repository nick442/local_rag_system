As an investment, the trend doesn't really matter, what matters is the price which you buy the house, and the price at which you sell. Say you buy a house for $250k today. In general, it doesn't matter if the house is worth $200k or $300k tomorrow (neglecting things like refinancing and home equity loans). What matters is the price when you sell. The longer you plan to stay, the less the current market conditions mean. Of course there is a lot more that goes into the decision to buy a house, since you are going to live in it. You also need to take into account things like how long you plan on staying in the area, the stability of your job, and future family size.
