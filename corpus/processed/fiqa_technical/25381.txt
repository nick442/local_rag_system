Many states require that USE tax be paid on items purchased out of state and the subsequently brought to your home state. The vendor has the responsibility to collect based upon the shipping destination. It is the buyers responsibility to declare and pay taxes on purchases where the vendor is not required to collect them for your state(like when you purchase it out of state). So if you have an item shipped out of state to avoid sales tax and then bring it to your home state then you are required to pay sales tax in your home state as well. Some states (Florida for 1) allow for the reduction in sales tax owed by the amount paid in out of state sales taxes. Some states (Like CT) exempt purchases under a certain amount.
