Without access to the ATM/debit card and with almost nothing in savings, you will probably have to visit a branch to make a cash deposit. If it is too far to drive you might be able to turn the cash into a money order and mail it to the bank, but I would check with the bank to see if that would work. Of course mail will take a day or two.
