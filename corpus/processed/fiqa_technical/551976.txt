Lol cmon dude, don't tell me you've never been through Charlotte's airport. You've gotta be a complete west coaster for that. I don't think law was that unique relative to the rest of the market. It was no different than coming out of college - I looked at cities with jobs and picked the one where I found the best job. That was likely true for a lot of different young pros in a lot of different markets. The big cities recovered faster because they had a range of different businesses within them. NY had jobs, that was why I went. I interviewed in ATL with a 3.5 from a T-14 law school in 09 and got nothing. I could feel the city's law jobs hadn't recovered so I dipped.
