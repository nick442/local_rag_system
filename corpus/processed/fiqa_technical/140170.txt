"With Hooters the difference is your business is based around the concept of having large breasted woman as your waitresses. Title 29, Chapter 14, Section 623 of the United States Code allows companies and other employers to make particular qualifications a condition of employment, even ones that violate other sections of the anti-discrimination law, in situations: ""..bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business.."" In one case your buisness is saying ""we have large breasted woman selling bad food"" and the other one is just ""we sell light bulbs"""
