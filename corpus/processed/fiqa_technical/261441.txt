Yeah. They actually have said that their new strategy is not to make money from breakage (people who pay but don't use it). I believe they also guaranteed the $10 deal for a year, but I'm not at all certain so don't quote me on that :) Instead, they want to make money from the data and, eventually, convince movie theaters to cut them in on sales and/or give them discounts on tickets.. both of which depend on people actually using MoviePass. I think those are really silly plans. The movie data is highly unlikely to cover the costs of the tickets that MoviePass has to buy. Movie theaters, like studios, are stubborn bastards who have a history of sticking to their guns and refusing to budge even an inch when it comes to certain terms - they also have recently demonstrated a preference for building out their own direct-to-consumer offerings rather than cooperating with third party offerings. I don't see them getting a ton more traffic from MP customers and more concession sales, and then deciding to give up any of their highly-prized concession sales - considering that most heavy theater-goers likely have a primary theater that they go to, it would probably make more sense for theaters to simply market their own offering to them in-theater and wait for MP to run out of money. Finally, AMC is the biggest chain and actively wants this $10/month subscription to fail. AMC has announced that it absolutely will not give MP any deals on ticket prices (something that MP is counting on to make this sustainable). Maybe MP is counting on AMC to eventually change its mind, but I don't think that's a smart bet. OTOH, what the hell do I know? I've been wrong plenty of times before :)
