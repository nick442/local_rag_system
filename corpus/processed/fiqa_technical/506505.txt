Its not H1-B visa, its the L1 Visa. L1 Visa have no minimum wage and people working on L1 can get Green Card faster. Some guys I know make around 40k/year in Silicon Valley @ Apple. H1-B scare is little bit overhyped in comparison to L1 visa. Anyway, people dont do their research and believe only these news channel say. H1-B is really helping US, atleast 60-65% are useful. Even if you a person is hired by H1-B, company has to invest more in HR and lawyer fees as a company by itself would not be able to apply. L1 Visa on other hand has no limit on salary so you can keep a worker at a drastically low rate which would for sure increase your profits. There are no year limit on L1. While H1-B have a max limit of 6 years. (Source: my collegues and USCIS website). Let me know if anything is wrong here . still researching on this.
