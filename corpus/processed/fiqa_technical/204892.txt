"I don't think this is ""curious"" at all. A large part of Bitcoin's value is based on speculation currently, and since it's both a global currency and a relatively small one, global changes can greatly affect it without having a huge impact on the US Dollar (e.g., the article mentions that much of Bitcoin's trade, and therefore its value, is coming from Japan right now). The symmetry you're looking for can also be deceiving when talking about currencies of dramatically different values. The US M2 money supply is worth over $13 trillion (measuring in US Dollars). The Bitcoin money supply is currently worth about $66 billion (also measuring in US Dollars). If Bitcoin spiked 10% and the change in value was completely symmetric with the US dollar, the US dollar would fall in value by only 0.05% (i.e. move $6.6 billion in market cap from the USD to Bitcoin). That's also greatly exaggerating the impact of changes in value of Bitcoin on the US Dollar since Bitcoin and the USD aren't the only currency pair in existence. Far from it, in fact. This is why you see, for example, the Venezuelan Bolivar tank against the US Dollar without feeling immensely more wealthy. People in the US also tend to price things in USD, including foreign currencies, because that's what they're used to doing as they're most familiar with the value of a dollar from everyday experience."
