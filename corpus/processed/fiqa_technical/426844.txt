"I know of at least one case where a person was convicted of ""structuring"". The person was depositing his own money into his own bank account and was found guilty of ""structuring"" since he made several deposits under $10K. The man did nothing illegal. He just felt it was safer to make several small deposits instead of one large deposit. From the article: Prosecutors did not offer evidence of any other motive for Gaskins' behavior. They said at trial that Gaskins should have known better. ""The point of the law is to make sure we don't have people who try to fool the bank,"" federal prosecutor Randall Galyon told jurors last week. ""The fact that he was trying is against the law."" The law states the bank has to report any transactions over $10K so the government can investigate any suspicous monetary activity. Of course, if you make several deposits under $10K you'll also be investigated and you could actually be breaking ""intent"" of the law for depositing your own money into your own bank account."
