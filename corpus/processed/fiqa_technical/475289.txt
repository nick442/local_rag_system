The donor might need to pay gift tax if they give money directly to you. Paying the tuition on your behalf (giving the money directly to the school) is exempt from gift tax. But that's not your problem, it is the donor's. There's no tax on receiving gifts, and you're not forbidden to receive gifts by virtue of being on a visa.
