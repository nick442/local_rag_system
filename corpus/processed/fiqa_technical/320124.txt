"The CTR stuff is unquestionable. Enough information has been released to demonstrate it as so. Regarding the ""tow the line"" or silence/ban policy in T-D, you're 100% right. It's their prerogative to run the sub that way, just as it is for /socialism to ban people that post in /r/libertarian even if they've never posted in /socialism before, just as the former default sub of /atheism is allowed to ban anyone who believes in god. My issue is the trend on reddit that anyone who posts anything that isn't 100% vile disdain for Trump must be from /T_D and that the extremists in /T_D are some kind of outlier in how they act - when there are other significantly sized subs that behave in a similar fashion."
