> But to answer your question, the two factors you mention are positively correlated, not negatively as you postulate. I'm not sure if there's necessarily any correlation. I'm merely stating the fact that they have so much savings that they must export capital but at the same time, they've ramped up domestic debt to somewhere around 300% of GDP which, I don't know why you say it isn't a lot, but it's probably twice the level of the average developing country. Wealth is probably very overstated, but the mechanism for why this has happened is confusing to me.
