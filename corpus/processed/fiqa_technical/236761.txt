Not as obnoxious as being a part of a group of people who are so assured in their opinions that aren't even their own then use that stance to put themselves on a moral pedestal. I mean really, I'm doing the exact thing but my pedestal is made out of awareness. So not really any more or less obnoxious to the person I was replying to.
