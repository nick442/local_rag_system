They are still finding more because they are looking harder - compared to other banks or credit unions there is currently way more external and internal scrutiny at WFC. And yes, my focus is on a faulty incentive system because you don't get such widespread mishaps when things are designed properly. It looks like somewhere in the command chain the supervisors responsible for oversight were also getting rewarded for failing in that duty and the people above them didn't have the ability to properly audit their behavior. That said, when I picked which of my bank accounts to close I chose WFC. I did so partially because I don't fully understand what the fallout will be from this scandal and that part bothers me more than what I've learned about it so far, but mostly because I was using it the least.
