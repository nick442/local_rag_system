The market is for sophisticated investors who have money to lose. If you fall into that category then you belong there. Otherwise it would be wise to have no confidence in the market whatsoever. There is more borrowed investment money in the market than ever. There are more derivatives out there than ever. There is less regulation than ever. The market makers will exit the market for the sole purpose of watching it drop in value as everyone else tries to get out at which time they will jump right back in after the crash. Its a game for them. A very profitable game at that.
