"You don't need to tell me your charity plans. They don't matter. Your comments still show lack of empathy, a basic innability to put yourself in another ones shoes. That actually is pretty important if you want to be a MD. Have you ever thought that these people work so that they don't become criminals? They maybe fucked up in the past, or maybe not, but the market is not a good judge for their ""worth"". They are people not a commodity or a number. The fact is, even if you trained these people, menial workers are NEEDED in a society, and therefore they should be able to make enough money to survive in the society. You know, free market is not the magical solution for everything. And you may not believe it, but I do have the view that for the most part the govt screws up, and should be given extremely limited powers. I don't claim to know the solution for their problem, but I do feel for them. Not only do they have to support their families with too less, but they also have to listen to people telling them how worthless thy are."
