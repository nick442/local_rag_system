If your argument is we should eliminate low wage jobs and replace it with some form of UBI, I'd be curious to see studies on that. Personally my interest is in making sure people have enough money to survive using the most efficient programs possible. EITC and non-wage subsidies do a pretty good job, so I'm generally in favor of them.
