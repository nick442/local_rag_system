Small companies are competing with huge corporations with small comparable fixed costs, so they turn to temp agencies that, due to size, can offer a basket of benefits a small company cannot, but at the expense of the laborer, who is now competing with a much larger labor pool, keeping wages low. Wages aren't increasing because the competition in the labor market is for better benefits, not for workers.
