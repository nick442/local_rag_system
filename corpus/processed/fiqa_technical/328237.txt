Of course, but the idea that you can simply use a supercharger and always get the battery back to X% in 30 minutes isn't accurate due to those limitations right now. It doesn't take that long before that 30 minutes becomes 35, then 40 and so on to prevent the battery from wearing out prematurely. BMW and Toyota have been working together on solid state batteries and (toyota) expect to have a production battery out in ~5 years. So the change is coming, but they still need solve the engineering problems that come with mass production and reducing costs of solid state batteries.
