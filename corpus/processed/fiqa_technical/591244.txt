"Well, the real problem here is that when the government (or really any entity) controls education (especially on a widespread but centralized basis) it means that everyone is trained to think alike. And as the saying goes: when everyone is thinking the same thing.. no one is really thinking at all. Education is inherently a system of indoctrination (doctrine = ""teaching"") -- that's really NOT a radical statement, nor is it some ""conspiracy theory"" -- it's really just tautological, saying the same thing in two different forms (though obviously one seems more ominous than the other). For example when people talk about the need for kids to be ""properly socialized"" via attending public schools -- what they are really saying (whether they realize it or not) -- is that they believe ALL children should be ""molded"" into accepting & regurgitating the *currently dominant* socio-political dogma. Far from creating critical thinkers, or from promoting ""diversity"", it really achieves the opposite, facilitating a mindless conformity (which ironically *might* even include a ""rebellious"" conformity, though it remains a conformity nonetheless) -- what is lost is truly innovative independent minds. *(And the proof of this will be demonstrated by the ""herd/hivemind"" that will downvote this post.)*"
