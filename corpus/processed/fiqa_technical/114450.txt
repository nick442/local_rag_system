I mean that's if it correlates. Placing it in the title does imply that I guess. As for the daily swings, like any stock, [SBUX has a strong correlation to the market](http://i.imgur.com/Ksl5vF3.png). The market is up today, Starbucks isn't. Why would it be down today than? Just totally arbitrary daily swing up and down reasons? I don't see the stock going down because of the NYT article that was produced yesterday, I see it down today because of the scheduling changes they made today. I could be wrong surely investors believe that there is a correlation between scheduling software and margins at the end of the day.
