"Navy is probably your best bet for your first ""business"" suit. Dark grey is also an acceptable choice. Black is mostly for formal occasions. Light gray is a little sporty. Suit prices will vary. The most important thing is getting it tailored. A $200 suit that fits you well will look FAR better than as $2000 suit that fits like shit. I'm going to disagree with vodkaspeed on getting a BB suit tho. While I fully support investing in your appearance, I just don't think it makes sense to buy an expensive suit unless you'll be wearing it for work. If it's only for interviews and every now and then, I'd just get something at men's Warehouse or the likes for around $300 or so. Instead spend your money on what you'll be wearing once you get the job: dress shirts, pants, AE shoes, etc. For reference a I have a BB suit, but never wear it. Dress shirt and pants is my dress code, and I've splurged on those items and good shoes. The suit sits wasted in the closet."
