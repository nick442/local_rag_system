"All the EMV contactless payment cards (paypass, expresspay, paywave etc) will sometimes 'request to go online' when making a transaction, which translates into asking for a PIN. The info you received with the card should have included something about this. For example, the Mastercard information about PayPass includes the note ""Contactless"" payments are tapped, not swiped. It's simple. [..] â€  there may be some instances when you are asked to enter your PIN number for security reasons or for purchases above a certain amount. You're not doing anything wrong; there's nothing wrong with the readers or your card; this is a standard feature of contactless. If you're asking ""why did my issuer's risk model instruct my card to go online for these particular transactions?"", well, we can't answer that, and your issuer probably won't, 'for security reasons'. Also, I've just seen that you say ""I have never paid using it before"" - I believe ALL contactless cards will require a successful PIN transaction before any contactless transaction can succeed - this is to stop someone who's intercepted your card in the mail from being able to spend your money.."
