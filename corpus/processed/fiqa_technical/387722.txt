"The mortgage has a higher interest rate, how can it make sense to pay off the HELOC first?? As for the mutual fund, it comes down to what returns you are expecting. If the after-tax return is higher than the mortgage rate then invest, otherwise ""invest"" in paying down the mortgage. Note that paying down debt is usually the best investment you have."
