Politicians are for sale and regulations are useless when they are not enforced. Community banks and credit unions have to comply or get hammered by the state and federal governments. The mega banks soldier on under an utterly feckless and corrupt congress. People should never pay fees or credit card interest, pay off their loans, and get out from under banker's thumbs. They are giant impoverishing machines.
