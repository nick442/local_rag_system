"I thought the same thing when I was making $40k in 2010. I'm around 110k now. Mortgage (300k near Portland, OR which is really damn good) + taxes + insurance and two kids is expensive. I have a single 14k car, my phone was free, and I drink tea. We vacation once every 3 years and don't dine out much (2x per month max). Our grocery bill is ridiculously expensive though and every month I end up spending a fortune on some bullshit like new tires, dental/medical copays, plumbing issue, electrical issue, or whatever the fuck else decides to break and cause more grief. The electric bill in winter peaks at $400/month with our electric furnace .. we never set the thermostat above 68. Probably more stuff I'm forgetting buy basically on a good month, I can set aside $600 in savings. That's not bad at all, it's great compared to the average family, but it's not even close to ""wealthy"". I still consider myself middle class."
