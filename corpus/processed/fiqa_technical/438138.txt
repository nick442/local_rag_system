Ebates is great for getting a little extra discount once you find what you are looking for. You can usually get about 2%-4% off from places like Dell, Staples, Home Depot, etc. What I do is do my research/shopping first and then add the item to the cart, then head over to Ebates and click through back to the store I was just on, and then purchase the item. Ebates will track the purchase and send you a check about once every 3 months. It is not much and not reflected in the price immediately but still it is a savings of some sort.
