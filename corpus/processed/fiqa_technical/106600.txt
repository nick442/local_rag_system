Eh, it's not an excuse. While economic reasons are major ones, saying that people don't manipulate and exploit others for non-economic reasons is a little too rosy. Some people are inherently evil and will step on and over others for personal gains beyond solely monetary. It sounds like you're trying to say capitalism is the evil here, but I don't think you're going to be able to provide one that isn't similar. Communism, tribal, socialism, fascism, whatever are all twisted and perverted by many involved in them for personal gain. The one constant in any system is humans and their nature, so I have to disagree that it's solely the economic system that we live under because there just isn't another one that has proven to operate differently in actual execution.
