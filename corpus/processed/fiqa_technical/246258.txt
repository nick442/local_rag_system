I guess it depends on the profession. There's a lot of employees that like it on a resume, but value skills/experience a lot more. Most resumes that include a college degree provide a small and brief section for it and cover their skills and experience way more in depth. If I could do it all over again I'd probably opt out of a 4-year degree and go to technical school for a certificate. It seems like the average person gets more bang for their buck out of tech school IMO.
