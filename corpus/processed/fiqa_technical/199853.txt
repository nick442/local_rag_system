> Back when I was in college, the best peripheral hardware you could buy (mice, keyboards, headsets, even at one point cordless telephones) were Microsoft products. I still think the Microsoft Natural keyboard was genius and ahead of its time. I use a Microsoft natural keyboard and Microsoft wireless mouse with my Mac Pro and wouldn't have it any other way.
