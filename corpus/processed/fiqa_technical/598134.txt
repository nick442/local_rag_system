If this is not all the proof you need that Fannie and Freddie need to be shut down completely, then nothing will ever convince you. Have a TAX PAYER FUNDED entity buying shitty loans from corporate mega banks thereby making money for the banks at the expense of the people who work 9 to 5's paying taxes. Even if you're the most mega left person on /r/politics, if you can support Freddie and Fannie then I just want to cry. :( 130 billion in aid to both of those firms, all our tax payer money, money that could have paid for health care, better schools, roads, NASA, etc, but instead, it all went to the big banks. Why would anyone want to support that? Because a few low income families might get a house? Why can't those people rent instead? Why can't they live within their means like most of us do? :(
