What the first person said. You're scared because you don't understand investing one bit. You'll be less scared once you understand it. Best way to understand it is to try it out. For me it has to be real money. So perhaps try out with small amounts of money you're comfortable with and do w/e you want with it, think of it as a purchase and not an investment. Then research why your account balance went up or down.
