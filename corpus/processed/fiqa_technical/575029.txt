"My visa would put the goods on the current monthly balance which is no-interest, but the cash part becomes part of the immediate interest-bearing sum. There is no option for getting cash without paying immediate interest, except perhaps for buying something then immediately returning it, but most merchants will do a refund to the card instead of cash in hand. This is in New Zealand, other regions may have different rules. Also, if I use the ""cheque"" or ""savings"" options at the eftpos machine instead of the ""credit"" option, then I can have cash immediately, withdrawn from my account, with no interest charge. However the account has to have sufficient balance to do so."
