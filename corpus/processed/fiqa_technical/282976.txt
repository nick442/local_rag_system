PMI (Private Mortgage Insurace) is not part of foreclosure. It is part of the MORTGAGE process. Say a bank wants a 20% down payment, for a mortgage and you can only put up 5%. You can take out PMI for the 15% difference. The bank will force you to do this every year (usually for lesser amounts) until your house has risen enough in value so that you have 20% equity. That's because banks want a maximum loan to value (LTV) ratio of 80% (sometimes less, nowadays). OK, by allowing you to buy a house with skimpy equity, PMI increases the chance of foreclosure.
