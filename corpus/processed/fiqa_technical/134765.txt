"My opinion - this subreddit should be about discussing the industry. This venue should be for those already established in the field - those able and willing to contribute insightful perspectives and notions to the group. We should have dialogues on current events, case studies on previous events, how we were involved in said happenings, what our perspectives were etc. Even a place to share and critique write-ups on investment ideas. For those that are ""dying to get into the field"". For 90% of us, I can assure you, we were there. I sure as hell know I was. Finance, or at least investment banking, trading, etc. is one of, if not the most, competitive fields to enter into directly out of college. All of us had a lot of questions. All of us were worried and anxious. Those that succeeded, however, didn't spend time asking anonymous people on the internet if they had a shot. They went out, worked their asses off and did what they needed to do. I'm 6 months into a full time investment banking gig in one of the most prestigious groups at perhaps the most highly regarded investment bank in the world. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder how in the fucking fuck I got to be where I am at. But this shouldn't be the place to discuss it. There's so many other venues - r/financialcareers, wallstreetoasis, etc - that cater to such concerns. Though I don't post much (partly a side affect of working 120 hours a week) Reddit needs a place to discuss the happenings of the financial world. There are a lot of redditors that work in finance. The problem, however, is that there really isn't a place to discuss the field. At least for me, I tend to only visit the subreddit every now and then because I know it will be convoluted with career questions. Make this subreddit a subreddit about what's happening in finance. Redirect posts about financial careers to the appropriate forum. It's that simple."
