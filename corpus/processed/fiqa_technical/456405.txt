The only time I took prescription pain killers was for legitimate pain and the only thing I got out of it was creamy poop. No buzz and frankly not much in pain relief. It's more like I just didn't care about it. I quit and suffered through. For the life of me I cannot understand getting addicted to it. Just smoke some cannabis. It's essentially harmless, non-addictive, and the worst thing you might to is eat an entire bag of Doritos.
