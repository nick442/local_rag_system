"Listen asshole, you clearly have an opinion on the thing, but you're going around wielding it like it's a fucking club. A pretty clear sign you should be sitting at the kid's table. Furthermore, it's a goddamn opinion and yet you're sitting here - not helping OP in the slightest, mind you - attempting to verbally attack a stranger. Does that make you feel like a big man Mr. anonymous internet guy that's clearly got an ego problem? Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. I happen to know that it would make him stand out more than NOT having one - something you can't prove wrong no matter how many job descriptions you look at. It stands out - period - otherwise people wouldn't get them. How is this not clear to you? The whole problem is that you're acting like a child, an asshole, and proving that you don't understand the first thing about business - treat people fairly. So if you think I'm inexperienced, I guess I'd have to consider the source. My guess is that you don't stack up very well, or that you're a millennial that believes he's entitled to something he hasn't earned, like respect. Why don't you grow up, and when you're ready to be an adult I'll talk to you again. In the mean time, however, I'm just going to report you to the mods for being a dick so they can ban you. There's no place for that here, especially for someone who ""supposedly"" has an MBA. Figured you'd be able to handle yourself as an adult by now."
