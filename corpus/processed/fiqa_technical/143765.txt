There has literally not been a single apple sold in stores since the early 1900s that is not spliced. All of those Apple"" varieties"" in the store are a result of splicing over the years, including your overpriced ""organic"" ones. There is a vast difference between grafting tree branches for ideal traits, and inserting specific strings of genetic code from an organism that cannot otherwise contribute its DNA. And part of participating in organic food production is a discontinuation of petrochemical fertilizer. Yes, we use vast amounts of petroleum product to fertilize farmland. If you want to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, organic production is part of that. Another part is the elimination of nasty industrial pesticides, like those that are causing bee colony collapse syndrome. CCS is a huge problem not because honey is tasty but because bees pollinate a wide variety of trees that produce food. Participating in organic food production is not a hazy Mother Earth granola fest. The concerns are material and immediate. I don't even eat granola. To many carbs."
