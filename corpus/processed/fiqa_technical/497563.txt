> The Prime video content is like 9/10th garbage. I find this true of any streaming video service.. We're all in it for the 1/10, but which 1/10 you like varies from person to person. And some of their originals are really good, I'd have paid real money to watch Man in the High Castle. There's other good ones like Alpha House, Transparent, or The Tick, or that movie that they won all the awards for?
