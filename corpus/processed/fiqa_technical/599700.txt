I think most people will have a similar idea to you, but I believe manufactured meat will approach a stage where it is far more efficient to make compared to natural meat, simply because you're avoiding all the extra effort associated with animal husbandry like vaccinations, marking, grazing, slaughtering etc. Once that happens, manufactured meat will be a much cheaper and more environmentally friendly option and people will make the switch organically.
