Technically it does. The value is that you have higher credentials that are tangible to a business. When choosing between two people of same experience and background, the person with the MBA will likely have a higher chance of earning a job. Down vote my comments all you want, I didn't come here to circle jerk with MBA's. I came here to discuss and I appreciate you getting into a healthy debate with me, I personally enjoy it. I was a psychology major in undergrad and a part of me wishes I pursued something in psychology. I guess it's never too late.
