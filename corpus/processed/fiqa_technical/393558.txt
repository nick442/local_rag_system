Agreed. I tried to use it at a friends' house (I don't live in a cabled area, the one time that I did I didn't have a TV) and I really didn't get what was going on. I eventually managed to change channel and ended up playing with the thumbs up/down buttons. I'm a technical person and most things come easily to me, but that didn't. Sky's solution may not have any bells and whistles but at least the buttons do what they say.
