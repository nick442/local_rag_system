There was a house for sale at around $400k or $500k if my memory serves me posted to /r/Boston a little ways back that was from a poorer city in Massachusetts that was covered in bullet holes and was totally trashed inside. It had been spray painted and was missing a raised porch from one of the upper floors so this door just opened up to nothing.
