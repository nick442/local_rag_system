I just finished working for a major retailer this past summer, and most retailers are freaking out because Amazon has a diversified enough portfolio that they can undercut everyone else's prices while maintaining revenue, but one day they will have to actually make a profit. Unfortunately, that's probably gonna happen after they've screwed everyone else out of the market and they can charge reasonable prices. Retail is about to get a lot crazier folks. Grab your popcorn.
