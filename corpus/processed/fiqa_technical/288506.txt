From a little guy perspective, I've been working inside computers since I first cracked open my Apple IIE in the 80's. There's some sort of disconnect in my brain with mobile devices. I can barely use the functions on my smartphone and I just can't seem to grasp the fundamentals. It makes me feel so old.
