My $.02 is that the problem boils down to the disparity in the tax rates. Money is taxed at a lower rate than people---in other words, money made by money (capital gains) is taxed at 15% and money made by people (income) is taxed at 35%. Over time, money will naturally flow to wherever the tax is lowest because tax rates factor heavily into ROI. We should equal the playing field, or even tax people at a lower rate than money. Then there will be job creation, and more money will flow to employee's pockets as income, since it's no longer hugely advantageous to hold the money and invest it. Consider employees to be another investment class, and lower the barriers to investing in that class. Anyone care to opine on this?
