> Nonsense! Mugging .. is so rare Edited to reflect what I actually said, and to respond. Mugging is rare, but it's not non-existent. Being proactive about making yourself a poor choice of targets is important to staying safe. Your arguments have shown a pattern of this lack of fore-sight, so far.

Yes or no? > On the other hand, cards that require signature can be used when stolen or copied because signature is a worthless method to validate the charge. Yes or no? I think you've broken, and it is clear that you are the one trying to keep the argument going for the sake of it. So I'm done. > Do you see?
