"1.) The US mint is a private business. There's your first flaw of any argument about currency before we talk further. 2.) That small percentage value of the penny ""not being worth your time"" is a huge fallacy. It might not be worth anything to him, but I generally would be intent on getting a few cents back that are due to me. Similarly, using his example of 3 cents adding 2 seconds to the transaction ends up at a rate of $54/hr. That's quite a bit of money to be considered. 3.) No machines take pennies. Fair enough. Not really the fault of the penny itself, but more so a fault of brash inflation. 4.) Supposing the penny does get removed, the axe gets held above the neck of the nickle inevitably. Then the dime, and so on. You'll also see a massive disruption in handling of accounting principles and tax rates due to being forced into /5 rates. All adjustable, yes, but it does cause a whole new mess of issues in it's own right. 5.) Lincoln's face has nothing to do with this argument. 25 seconds worth of video wasted (that's about 35 pennies worth)."
