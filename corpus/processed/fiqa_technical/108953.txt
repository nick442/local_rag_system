I mean if he signed a non-compete clause as a part of the contract, he's boned. I still think it's silly on Sony's part though because they fired him because the commercials didn't do anything for sales and he wasn't directly endorsing Nintendo nor does he have a contract with Nintendo. They're just really trying to throw off any momentum the WII U is about to gain because Sony knows it has the potential to kill the PS3 and they sure don't want to rush another console on to the market.
