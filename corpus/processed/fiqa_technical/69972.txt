[Thanks for civility] Your situation sounds very rough and I'm sorry for it, truly I'm. This is a hard question to answer and would love to open a dialogue with people who are willing to actually listen/talk. The question: How can we as a society help those in financial need? Raising minimum wage? - Doesn't work as well proponents would like. Prices go up, people who used to make $ for the employer may not anymore thus is fired. (Burger flipper 1 makes the owner $11/hr, bf 2 makes $13/hr. Minimum wage goes up to $12 and suddenly bf1 no longer makes a profit and is let go) UBI - Wouldn't work, it'll simply raise the costs of everything Universal HC, food, car insurance, etc - It'll create lower quality products that are largely ineffective. Look at Canada So how can we help without simply giving $ away in times of artificially raising wages, giving free money (UBI), or giving free stuff? I really don't know the answer and i'm like to talk solutions
