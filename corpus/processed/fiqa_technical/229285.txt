>“Growing debt . . . would increase the probability of a sudden fiscal crisis, during which investors would lose confidence in the government’s ability to manage its budget and the government would thereby lose its ability to borrow at affordable rates.” I suppose it's too much to ask that the CBO understands how our monetary system works. Do they honestly believe that we rely on investors to loan us a currency we can make in unlimited quantities? The only way the U.S. could default is if congress decides to stop paying off our debts.
