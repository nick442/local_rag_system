The other side of this is that businesses can (and do) negotiate to have ratings/reviews removed or altered by the poster. So the idea that what you're seeing is anything like a real sample of customer sentiment is a fantasy. No negative reviews? Might just mean the business owner actively manages their reputation. Ugly 1-star reviews? May just be an extortion attempt in progress. Want a refund? Just write a horrible review on Yelp, perhaps the business owner will pay to have it removed.
