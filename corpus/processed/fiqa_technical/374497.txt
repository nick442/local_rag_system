"No, you're right. I don't think they should leave, but I do think they should quit whining. If you're opinion is unpopular convince people as to why it shouldn't be (or change it, there's no shame in realising you were wrong or at least rude). I just don't agree with the redditor hivemind arguments, or the ""Redditors think this"" statements. Fact is the response to any given comment or view can vary dramatically depending on time of day, or just who happens reading at the time, or in what context it is presented. The redditor demographic is very varied for an on-line community - possibly the most I've come across? Actually one example that winds me up is on /r/uk where you get tory voters complaining about anti-conservative party bias on the sub-reddit, while forgetting that 2/3rds of the UK voted against the Tories at the last election. It just reflects the country, so quit whining and start trying to convince us why we're wrong and shouldn't think their policies aren't total bollox."
