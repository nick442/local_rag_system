"I hate Amazon's delivery service. Their drivers are so concerned about the quotas they got give a care about your package and they're rude as hell. Delivery dude rang the door bell, in the 7 literal seconds it took me to get up, walk over and open the door he had too see my packages on the rug outside and was running back to his car. Had the nerve and audacity to yell ""I have 300 more packages!!"" when I called after him. My manager has seen them sit in their car and mark a package as refused/undeliverable because they didn't want to get out and walk to the back of the building. If I can't choose to have my packages delivered by another service, I'm going to stop buying from Amazon."
