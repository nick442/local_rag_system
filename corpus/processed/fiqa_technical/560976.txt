What Amazon is doing is called the Grey Market and normal bricks and mortar retailers do this as well. For example, buying Irish Whiskey might be expensive at all the shops in Australia because the licensed distribution companies set a high price for Australia. One retailer may simply buy Irish Whiskey off the retail shelf in South America, ship to Australia, pay import duties, and undercut all the competition. This happens for all sorts of products all the time. It destroys the channel distribution control that consumer goods companies have where they control distribution and set the prices consumers have to pay.
