He's old enough now that he could handle that. I just wouldn't want to lose him permanently (outside of the whole possibly gonna die thing, but I already do some other high-risk things). I grew up with a dad that deployed fairly often, but for shorter periods of time (3-6 months) for the most part, and I was OK with that. I just wouldn't want him to grow up thinking I left him to go off to school or move to a new city, which is what it would be in the other situation.
