Seriously.. People worry about what symbols are used or not used on their discount food while we have a lot bigger problems than a company's effort to stay neutral in religious matters need to get a life or choose matters that are more worthy of outrage. In a country where the majority is atheist or doesn't practice there are people who worry about this just sound very hypocritical.
