"Robert Lutz recently came and gave a great talk to the Rotary club I belong to. His views aligned very closely with my own. He likened cars today to the horse at the end of the 19th century. It was unheard of that horses may be replaced by cars (the automated horse). Today, horses are a niche business; you can buy/sell/breed horses but they come from specialized dealers and are used in private areas. Commercial fleets will be the first to be fully automated. We're already very close there, and I see real mass adoption of commercial fleet automation within 5 years. Individual adoption will follow after, starting on public limited-access highways. Once the critical mass of 25% automation is reached, the federal government will step in and say ""Look, 75% of you are causing 99.9% of all accidents out there."" They will set the timer on individually operated vehicles - probably something like a 10 year window. All in all I'm with those who see complete automation within 20 years."
