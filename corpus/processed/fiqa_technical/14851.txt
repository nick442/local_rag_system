How about sperm donors? Did they choose how their sperm is used? Did the children of that sperm and egg choose their parents? How about animals? Do they choose their parents as well? I have the family I have through pure luck. Unless there's some kind of heavenly website or registry that I'm not aware of, it's sperm and egg that make a child and nothing else.
