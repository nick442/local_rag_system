Well, no, it's not. Government is reactive. We didn't decide to give non-citizens education before there was a class of people living among us who couldn't get an education. We didn't decide to give them drivers licenses before there was a serious issue of unlicensed/uninsured drivers getting in accidents that they could not be held liable for.
