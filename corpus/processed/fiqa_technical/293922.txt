It's not big with restaurants in Mexico, but it seems like half the pharmacies name themselves after some religious figure, especially the Virgin of Guadalupe. The other half name themselves insinuating that they are cheaper than the others or sell cheap knock-offs of major brand patented pharmaceuticals. After twenty years living in Mexico I can't recall a single pharmacy named after a scientist. But, honestly, I lived in the US for thirty years before that and can't recall a single pharmacy named after a scientist up there, either.
