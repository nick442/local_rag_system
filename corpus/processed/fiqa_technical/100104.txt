This seems like kind of an odd analysis. The exact same comment can be made every year at this time in regards to iPhones (people are waiting for the next version to come out). Yet every year Apple sells a ton of these things. Don't expect anything different this time around. As to Qualcomm (also cited in the article) I expect they will be selling plenty of chips this quarter as Apple gets ready to roll out their iPhone 5 this fall.
