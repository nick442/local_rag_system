MS lacks the marketing balls to treat the ARM surface as a unique product and treat the intel surface as a win7 laptop with a touch screen. They see value in putting their eggs under the windows 8 umbrella and crosspromoting their virtues. I think that it's a mistake, but one that the media will fix for them. I understand why they lack the balls. Apple had a 10% market share computer and were entering a new market so tying the Mac and iP_d marketing together wasn't valuable. MS has 90% market share with Windows so connecting everything with Windows is the safe bet. You just don't hit a lot of home runs by bunting.
