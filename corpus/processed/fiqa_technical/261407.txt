Whether or not Uber/Lyft are taxi services only matters to determine if they need to follow taxi regulations, which are meant to protect customers. From looking at Uber and Lyft's performance, however, they provide better service at a better price than taxis, so what are those regulations actually protecting us from? This isn't about these guys trying to get around the law anymore, the business model has been shown to be highly effective, and the laws need to be changed to allow for this new model that benefits consumers more than what we had before. The hurdle now is that the taxi companies have an interest in keeping the barrier to entry high to prevent competition, and that means preventing Uber and Lyft from getting around those barriers.
