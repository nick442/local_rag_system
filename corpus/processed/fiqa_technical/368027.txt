My experience has been that they are expecting all damage to be covered as best as possible. They may withhold the remaining funds until you prove the work was done. Any money leftover is yours as long as they accept your proof. Be careful they don't withhold so much that you aren't able to get a full repair, and try to get paid directly as most repair companies wanted to inflate the costs while letting me know they would handle the transaction. No thanks.
