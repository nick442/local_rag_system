No such law in existence or planning. There are no limits on what you can transfer in or out of the USA, as long as you're not doing tax evasion/money laundering, or violating embargo laws against specific countries and organizations. Explanation why Rob's answer is wrong: There's no, and never has been, withholding requirement when transferring money between own accounts. FATCA doesn't impose any new withholding. It reinforces the existing 30% withholding requirement, and suggests that the 30% withholding requirement may supersede treaty positions. Generally internal legislation cannot supersede international treaties, so I'm very skeptical about the US Gov't ability to enforce this. 30% withholding on payments to foreign people/entities has always been there. It's not new. Certain payments that are income sourced in the US and being remitted to foreign payees is subject to 30% withholding (unless treaty says otherwise). There's nothing new about it, been like that forever.
