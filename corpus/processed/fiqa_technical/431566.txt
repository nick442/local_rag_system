I'm not saying they shouldn't try, and perhaps, in the very long run it might be a good idea. In fact, if they were able to fix some of their own problems, it would be a great idea. Here is my understanding of a few points to suggest as of now it's not: - Ukraine is still very corrupt. - Ukraine doesn't really have an economy that can support itself. - Ukraine had traditional ties to Russia, and these ties included economic ties. To join the EU, a country should be in a position to foremost support itself. Not only will joining mean having huge inflation, but you're substituting one creditor and buyer for another. Problem is, you're right beside Russia, so you should be extra prepared for hard times. Most peopke I've spoken to don't necessarily agree on what's right or wrong, but economically, sticking with Russia and cleaning up the government would be the ideal. Problem is Russia exerts a less than clean influence. This is a problem, and where many people are stuck. Because just switching to EU will probably be harder on average people.
