I don't work in risk management in the bank I'm in, but do talk to them occasionally. Depending on what job you will actually do there, you need a very good math background. I would also consider a familiarity with programming to be needed for a lot of the jobs. If you are considering risk management outside of the financial sector, I guess the bar will be lower. At least the company I used to work in had a Treasury/Risk Management group largely composed of finance and economics majors.
