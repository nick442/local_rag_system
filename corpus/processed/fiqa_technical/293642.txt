That's actually pretty damned clever. If GE started recommending local 3D printers for replacement items it could avoid a slew of aftermarket part creation and transportation costs, while providing nothing but the design specs which they've already had created. Hell, if they *annually licensed* those specs to said authorized printers, they'd actually make *more* than the old model of selling parts, since they're now cutting costs *and* creating an additional revenue stream. Brilliant!
