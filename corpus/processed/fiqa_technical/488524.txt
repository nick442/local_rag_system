The real reason for America's success is mainly that the King of England actually gave people property rights in N. America to encourage people to settle here, which shockingly enough actually worked and encouraged people to move over here and invest in building a new life. It's not a coincidence that the people moving were religious minorities who had been persecuted. When we rebelled, preserving those property rights (along with establishing liberty/freedom) was of very high importance when the Constitution/Declaration of Independence was written. When people have legal recourse to protect their property they unsurprisingly try and produce more and better property.
