I think one of their problems is that so many things have reached such a high level there's no motivation to pay a premium for Sony anymore. Unless you have two TVs side by side I can't tell the difference. The cheap one will look really good to me, and if a higher end Sony was beside it, it would look even better. I won't buy an MP3 player for the sound or build quality, they're all good enough for me. I have an iPod touch and using it as an MP3 player was very low on the priority list.
