"In general, insurance payouts you receive in compensation for damage to your vehicle are not taxable income (see for instance this Nolo page). However, I don't see how that is related to your three bullet points about how your sister should buy her car. You can transfer the money to her in any way that's convenient to both of you. Whether the dealership will accept cash is something you'll have to ask them about, but my impression is most dealers are eager to accept cash. As long as the car you are getting from her is not worth substantially more than the $8500 you're giving her, I don't see that you'll be in trouble income-tax-wise. As mentioned in the question you linked to, you can give each other up to $14k per year tax-free. So if you give her a $8500 and she gives you a car worth roughly the same amount, no problem. If you actually do it as a sale, even better, since then the only amount that will count as a gift to either of you is whatever one party gets above and beyond the fair value of the car. (That is, if the car is worth $10000 but she sells it to you for $8500, she effectively gave you a gift of $1500 in car value. If it's worth $7000 but she sells it to you for $8500, you gave her a gift of $1500 in cash.) As Rocky pointed out in a comment, if you do a sale it may be subject to sales tax depending on what state you're in. In practice it is very common for people to not deal with sales tax in informal transactions like this between family members, but you do owe it if your state's laws require it, and the state could theoretically come after you for it. Another edit: I see from your comment you are in Michigan. According to this page from the Michigan Secretary of State, ""no tax is due if you purchase a vehicle from an immediate family member"". So you would not owe sales tax if you do it as a sale."
