My view is that hedge funds and high-frequency traders tend to create this correlation because they're making directional bets on individual stocks, grouped as a whole, and then share these ideas with so many other funds (who, in turn, do the same thing). I think Beta and inflated share prices are related to this effect, but are not the cause of this effect.
