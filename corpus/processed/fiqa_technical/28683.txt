Assuming you're talking about your United States Federal Income Tax payment or refund, the IRS has a website for checking the status of your refund. You can check that site to see where your refund is. If it doesn't show up on that site (assuming you provide all the information correctly), then you may want to check TurboTax to verify it was correctly submitted. I believe that site also works for payments. If not, Turbotax's page is not refund-specific (though I suspect it is just an API call to the same tool).
