That whole sexual harassment thing isn't really enforced. Most married couples meet at work and it has to start somewhere. If you see a nice piece of ass and there isn't a ring on the finger, go for it. If there is a ring, well, that's makes it a bit more fun. Besides, nobody stays at companies for 30 years anything, the tail you're nailing will most likely move up and out or something.
