I have a loaded Accord right now. Model 3 is faster, safer (most likely given Tesla's track record, doesn't need gas, and (hopefully) cheaper and easier to maintain (no oil changes, etc). It's also just a hair smaller than my Accord and sits more forward, which I really like. The Accord feels like a boat to me.
