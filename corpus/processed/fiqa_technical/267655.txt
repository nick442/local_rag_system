the SP500 is all in the US, though. if you plan to buy and hold long index, you will probably be fine. i would recommend to diversify into different assets for a number of reasons. but if you invest without an advisor, you need to stick to a savings and investment plan without question. if you start thinking about what sector you think the next big break is going to be, or if you should be buying in right now, or if now is a good time to sell, it is more likely than not you will be doing yourself a great disservice.
