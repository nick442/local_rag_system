I did read the article. I'm very surprised that such a simple and alternative idea was poorly received, but I have a feeling it's because you didn't read my response carefully enough. The 3-5 years which you took to mean the training time, was presented as the commitment in return for free training, which I expected would take around 6-12 months. The candidates suggested would already have Master's Degrees in other fields, and so it's to be expected they'll need around 30-60 hours to train them to an academic level. Full time this should only take a year. An H1-B visa takes around 6 months to process, and when you factor in the amount of time it takes someone to actually move from a foreign country, it can easily be faster to train than transport. In any case, you could do both while you transition to a training process. Here's an article on the processes that I am discussing where Peter Capelli is interviewed by the Wharton Business School. The gist of it is that because companies control every aspect of the hiring and job creation process, it is a large part of the fault on their shoulders when they 'can't find the right person.' http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=3027 Thanks for playing.
