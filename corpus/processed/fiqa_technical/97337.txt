Finance and accounting go together like peanut butter and jelly. Having said that, you really should (read: need [to]) determine what part of finance you're interested in, because that's the only way to give you an informed answer as to whether you should pursue a CPA / CFA / MBA. With all of that in mind, your post -- in my opinion -- really comes across as you sounding like you don't want to put in the work to pass the CPA. If that's the case, finance is *really* not the field you want to be in. Lastly, experience is not a substitute for having your CPA license, but rather a compliment.
