But I'm not choosing to forgo negotiating on my own. Someone else with ties to the listings is giving special access to my negotiations. Given access I can't get. I'd rather negotiate on my own, usually adding someone in the middle of a conversation between 2 individuals is bad for everyone. I'm not being given the option to negotiate on my own, I either take the artificially inflated rate or skip investing all together because I can't get the access that HFT's have, nor can I negotiate around them.
