Nope. Both the Nexus 4 and the Motorola Moto E do not have a consumer replaceable battery, unfortunately. While this did concern me in regard to my Nexus 4, obviously it wasn't an issue as my stupid butter fingers rendered the phone inoperable before battery life was reduced to a point where I needed to replace it. With the Moto E, since it was only $129 I suppose I don't mind that I'll most likely just replace the phone after several years regardless of the battery.
