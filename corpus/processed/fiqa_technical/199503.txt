"no, good questions my friend. when did you do this rollover? if it was this year, your firm should have forms that you can fill out to ""undo"" the roth conversion - only earnings on your investments will be taxed, and everything gets rolled over to a traditional IRA. not fun for tax filing but.. you can also leave them as is and pay the taxes (usually only a good option if it's a low income year for the filer). i would consult your tax advisor regardless in this situation."
