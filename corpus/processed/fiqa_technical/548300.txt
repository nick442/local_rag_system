Wow! It wasn't the sexiest line of business, but between the margin on the kit plus the project finance the margins always seemed attractive at 20%+ after SG&A. Granted, they made a couple bad buys in the membrane space, but that sales team was godly. They'd get themselves written into the specs - voila, no legitimate competition when the RFP/tender hit the wire.
