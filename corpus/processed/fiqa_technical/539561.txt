The whole part of needing to build fewer towers is negated by capacity constraints. Each tower can only support a certain number of users before the speeds choke. Wireless carriers will need to increase tower density in areas where building penetration matters most; densely populated cities. The rural areas that get fewer towers are just fine with limited spectrum allotments. TL;DR: every single carrier will have to build a ton of towers in cities regardless of spectrum holdings. The carrier with the largest amount of spectrum, money, and who has gear with carrier aggregation support will end up winning. Sprint has all of the above now, they just need to finish their network refit and repair their public image.
