I know quite a few mutual fund wholesalers making over a mil right here in the states. Having said that, none of them are at Fido. Fidelity is a private firm but having started my career there, I wouldn't be surprised if they're paying a few people that much who have been there forever. They also extend extremely cheap credit to employees at the MD role and above, at least that was the case when I was there.
