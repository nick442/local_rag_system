Hi! Question! I just got hired at a publicly traded banking company in Southern California. My position will be in one of the corporate offices, working in the IT department, doing mostly documentation and communication. My question is about dress code, more specifically tattoos. I interviewed in a suit, dressed the part and everything and they extended an offer to me. But my last job was much more lax and I didn't have to hide my tattoos. The office culture appears to be business professional/business casual dress. I didn't see any visible tattoos in my tour but I didn't meet everyone. Obviously I plan to wear long sleeves (I have a sleeve tattoo) in the beginning at least to feel it out, but if it continues to prove to be a strict environment I'll need to go shopping for more appropriate clothes. I'm 29/F, have piercings (both tragus, conch orbital and ear lobes), interviewed with short (ruby rose style) grey hair, but I wore a suit. Just trying to paint a picture of what they subscribed to. Does anyone have experience in banking and can shed some light on the tattoo issue?
