thanks for the reply. I just graduated and I'm having a lot of difficulty getting any solid job. I guess I will pick firms in the area like MS, trowe, and see what would be best. My contact who told me to do this said it's very important to be passionate about it though..perhaps even if I pick a more targeted stock it won't be too valuable given my inexperience?
