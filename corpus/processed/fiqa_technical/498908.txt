While I disagree with a strike and am against minimum wage laws, why do you or I or any of the more fortunate deserve whatever it is that we do? Surely someone in the third world could do better than us. Just because they went on strike does not mean they are wrong. Walmart has the power and the right to hire and fire them and they have should have the right for collective bargaining. It is good system of check and balances, kind of how our country needs both liberals and conservatives.
