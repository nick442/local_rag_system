"What does this have to do with libertarianism? If anything, this makes the case for libertarianism. In the future, if nearly every job is taken by a very advanced robot, which are even capable of maintaining themselves, humans would not just be left behind. The economy needs consumers. Instead, we would live in a world of infinite entrepreneurship, in which the means of production are nearly free for anyone, and people prosper by their ambition and drive. Everyone would own their own robots that do work on their behalf. The amount of resources available to all would be incredible, and people would be free to do things they actually want to do. The contrary of course, is a socialist ""utopia""; a world of everyone being dependent on the government to provide them their basic income. Instead, we're looking at a free world in which every person is a capitalist in control of their own robots. *^Thanks ^to ^/u/VassiliMikailovich ^for ^this.*"
