"my problem with your argument is its base falseness: ""During the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, Goldman was able to profit from the collapse in subprime mortgage bonds in the summer of 2007 by short-selling subprime mortgage-backed securities. Two Goldman traders, Michael Swenson and Josh Birnbaum, are credited with bearing responsibility for the firm's large profits during America's sub-prime mortgage crisis. The pair, members of Goldman's structured products group in New York, made a profit of $4 billion by ""betting"" on a collapse in the sub-prime market, and shorting mortgage-related securities."" that is wikipedia, but they seem to know what is going on better than you do so.."
