I can understand stuff like shirts, flower pots and shit that probably cost a couple cents to manufacture being cheaper in brick and mortar stores. With that said, I've never saw a lower price on walmart for video games, high tech toys or anything substantial. In additiona, Walmart doesn't carry high end goods such as Omega watches, Shun knives and the like. I probably buy 50% of my stuff from Amazon, 30% from Costco and 20% (clothes,shoes, etc) from else where.
