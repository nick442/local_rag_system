Interesting, I actually didn't know some bankers ended up going to jail, wondering why there's so much misinformation about that. I guess after seeing numerous times, high level executives and bankers get away with enormous crimes, people are simply out for blood. You can't legally go after economists or home buyers (unless they lied about their income but with ninja loans, they didn't even need to have an income, so why lie about one?), but there were bankers who were betting against the very financial instruments they were selling to clients. There were the credit rating agencies who had a fiduciary responsibility to provide accurate ratings of these mortgage-backed securities. You can definitely make the claim that at least in these two instances, people acted outside of the law.
