If you really want to decrease inequality in a sustainable way, the solution is to make energy cheaper. The rate of median household income growth started flattening in the 1970s, and it isn't coincidental that it happened when fossil fuel prices sustained significant rises. If we can't make energy at least as cheap as it was before the 1970s, we have to adjust to a much slower rate of NGDP growth. The government targets a straight line upward moving rate of NGDP growth through massive debt spending and loose monetary policies. If it doesn't pull back on these, the increasing divergent rates of growth of the NGDP and sustainable economic growth puts us on track for a future correction that will be bigger than the Great Depression.
