So is it weird that I write my check to the name of the company on the power plant? I cannot for the life of me see any of the middle men in my distribution channel. Where I am, you usually get power right from the big energy company (Xcel in my case) or if you live out of town you can opt for the co-op (that buys from Xcel). The co-op is in theory the better deal because they can negotiate larger volume pricing and all profit from the co-op goes to its members, but there aren't very many steps either way. edit: after a bit of digging, my power provider is also a buyer, but most definitely the owner of a large nuclear plant near me.
