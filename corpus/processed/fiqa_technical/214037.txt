Alot of older NCR and Diebold ATMs also don't encrypt data in transit. You can see all the packets over the network with Wireshark. PINS, ACKS. (Using this you could theoretically have the ATM eject money if you could access the network and fake those acknowledgements) I've also seen an ATM connected to a hub, which would just broadcast those packets to whatever else is connected to the hub. Also the local data closet at your typical brick and mortar bank is a wild nest of cables and wires.
