Yeah, I am Canadian and my professor is a big believer in Warren Buffet style valuation. Both of these probably play into his love for the CBV as well as having a couple former students who have it. I think I will start with the CFA and get the CBV if I think it is necessary. I have already started to study for the CFA, I downloaded the schweser notes. Hoping to take it in June after I graduate.
