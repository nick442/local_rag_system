Mhmm, so it's not cheaper.. you might want to shoot an email off to the execs at BK, I think they might be interested in your theory that they aren't going to save money in this merger. They were dying out there (in the states) and they chose a Canadian rescue boat called Tims. Would it have appeased everyone if the US company just went belly up in the long-run?
