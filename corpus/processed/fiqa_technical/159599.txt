There are two intertwined potential problems that this might create for Russia. With the embargo there will be less competition in the market place driving up the price of goods. Also, while I admittedly don't know the capacity Russia has to produce food, it could create a shortage of food for the Russian people further driving up the prices. This will make it harder for the lower income citizens to buy food, and because food is a necessity the middle and lower classes will have less money to spend on other goods and services. So while it will be good for the Russian agricultural sector, there may be other serious economic issues created by the embargo.
