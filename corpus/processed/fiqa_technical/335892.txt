"On a side note, was CNN always this sensationalist? The headline makes a bold statement, which is then pretty much invalidated right in the first paragraph of the article. I have neither watched nor read CNN a whole lot, but I used to respect them. Until this year, when their reporting on various issues (Fukushima, the Arab spring, recently the Moscow protests) have caused me to put them in the ""do not trust under any circumstances"" category. Is CNN becoming a less funny version of the Onion?"
