"There are far more questions to be addressed here than one answer can address. Let me work backwards, and start with the easy part - ""I make $120K/yr, what can I afford?"" You are making $10K/mo. A great income. A well written mortgage will allow you to use 28% for housing, that's the mortgage, property tax, insurance, and HOA. On $2800, let's take out $500 for prop tax, and just $300 for insurance. I'll even ignore HOA for now. The remaining $2000/mo will fund a mortgage of $400K. That's not close to a $700K condo. A $550K mortgage would cost $2800/mo, and $3600 with tax and insurance, $4100 with HOA. Over 40% of your gross and a sign that you are in over your head. The real question is why you'd want to do this. $1600/mo rent means you can save $2000/mo in addition to what you already save if you stay put."
