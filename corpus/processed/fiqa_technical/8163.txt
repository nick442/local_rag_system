Republican voters need to stop thinking that the GOP supports small business. In fact they dont, they work agressively to margnialize small business because small businesses dont have the political clout that large multinationals do. What happens in this scenario? You the small busienss owner end up subdiziding the cost of big business in the form of higher taxes while big corporations get away scot free. Stop believing that the GOP wants to help small business when the GOP has supported every pro-monpolization and pro-consolidation law for the past 90 years. I sympathize with workers who do personal care, other kinds of jobs where they really are at the mercy of the market, where making smart decisions that negatively impact employees is often a choice between staying in business or not.
