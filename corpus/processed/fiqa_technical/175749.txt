Supposedly people's birth certificates and SSNs are routing numbers and account numbers for federal reserve banks. Apparently this has been a thing since 1933 when Roosevelt did something. Anyway the story goes there is an entity called Strawman and it's a bank account with your name on it and it's been accruing monies since the day you were issued a birth certificate and SSN. Idr much sorry for being vague on the details
