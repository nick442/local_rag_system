A fucking credit union. Even if they use an all paper system and have no website, no phone app, and can only be contacted by fax or telephone, use a credit union. Even if the only place you can get your money is a 45 minute drive to the next town, use a credit union. Its not about finances, its about reclaiming basic human dignity in the world of American Finance.
