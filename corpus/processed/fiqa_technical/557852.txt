My point of view is that monopolies happen because politics (whether that's politicians, trade boards, or oversight committies) allows them to occur. It's a failure of politicians in allowing it to happen, not a failure in business (as they're just pursuing their profits). When business started to interfere in politics to gain market advantages, that's when monopolies started to form. Competitive marketplaces are self-sustaining unless you create the conditions for monopolies to form. Once you legalize what price you sell a good at you're going down a slippery slope of communism. It's a free market and companies should be able to freely sell a good at whatever price they want. If other companies can't compete in the market at that price then they aren't as efficient as the other company and it would hurt the economy in the long run to have them operating at higher costs than similar companies who can do it better. I didn't say that the **only** exit for a startup is acquisition but I digress.. The reality is that the tech market is dominated by large businesses who meddle in politics to maintain their position ([such as Google and Apple colluding in hiring practices](http://pando.com/2014/03/22/revealed-apple-and-googles-wage-fixing-cartel-involved-dozens-more-companies-over-one-million-employees/). This is bad for everyone and especially for startups and needs to be redesigned so that startups and big companies alike can competitively challenge each other in the tech sectors. I think we're arguing for roughly the same thing but it seems that it's a different between equality vs equity (I might be wrong however).
