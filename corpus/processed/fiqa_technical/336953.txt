My use is occasional (like weekends where I get out and overdo it and need help calming aches to sleep) and occasionally recreational. But I have strict rules about dosing frequency (no more than one weekend a month) to avoid dependency and withdrawal. OTOH, I had hernia surgery a couple years ago and it was ridiculous the hoops I had to go through to get my post-op stuff. Doctors are beginning to under-medicate. I think that might be worse.
