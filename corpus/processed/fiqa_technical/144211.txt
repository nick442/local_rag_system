Yeah, reddit is full of ppl just trying to push their side/story (usually liberal vs conservative), I figured that it's best to take just a moderate/rational approach and figure out what's best in each situation. from a purely economic standpoint racism is extremely irrational (there are some specific examples where it can be rational, but that is always due to other external factors making it rational in that specific situation, not because it is actually rational). Yes, you're right that there is a huge growth potential. Africa tends to have a ton of natural resources per capita and a young population (lots of time left to work/produce) that can produce a lot in their lives. The issues are that they need to cut corruption, focus on educating their citizens, and encourage economic production (stronger property rights really help here!). The battle between religions (specifically strict adherence to Sharia law & Islamic religious doctrine with Al-shabab, ISIS, and Boko Haram) is a huge issue there as well.
