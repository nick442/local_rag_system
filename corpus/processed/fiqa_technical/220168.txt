I can think of one short-term solution: lower your debt-to-credit ratio. Even if you pay off your credit card before the due date, the balance you owe is registered as a debt on your credit score for that statement period. If you pay off your balance before the statement period closes, the amount will be zero. Debt-to-credit ratio is one of highest impact factors used in computing the credit score. The dip from the hard pull should be only temporary. Additionally, there are different FICO scoring models that lenders use, which can provide significant variance. Once your score is in the mid 700s, however, that and sufficient income should be sufficient for a prime-rate loan, credit card, or other service for which the credit score is relevant.
