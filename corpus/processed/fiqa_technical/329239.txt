Comparing zoning laws, which have a real effect on property rights and values, not to mention permanent alterations of the landscape, to ridesharing companies who negatively impact the taxi industry, are not comparable. I'm not sure what industry is comparable, but not zoning. Again, if laws are stupid, counter productive, and a drain on society, I fully support busting them up. Without a company like Uber, Taxis would still be the best mode of transportation around NYC. Taxis would have no real incentive to innovate because they have been in their protective cocoon for the last 60-70 years. If Uber would have tried to do it legally, it would have backfired monumentally on them. The taxi industry would have fought them tooth and nail, and consumers wouldn't have weighed in because they wouldn't have known any better. Uber has shown passengers what service can be like and now virtually no one wants to go back to the days of smelly yellow cabs.
