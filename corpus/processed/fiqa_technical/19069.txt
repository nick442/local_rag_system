Ok, I see your sarcasm, but what specifically did the executives do to cause the scandal? Maybe their head of community banking would be culpable, but do you think that the head of wealth and investment management would have any insight into retail accounts? Do you think the CEO gets that kind of granular information to even make that decision? Do you think the CFO has any insight into it? I see a lot of people calling for the heads of everyone at WF, but at most, **maybe** one person on the executive board would have any influence in the area where the scandal occured. That area is not where the focus is, apparently.
