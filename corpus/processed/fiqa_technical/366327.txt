"I did sort of the same thing as you after a some time in consulting. The biggest annoyance for me was how poorly I thought the most basic, obvious bullshit through. Figure out how you'll bill for travel -- when do you fly vs. drive, what's your mileage rate, etc. Get your proposal template looking razor sharp, and have a standardized invoice ready (don't say ""net 30"" or 45 or whatever, some clients won't understand what you're talking about and there's no way to explain it without sounding like a douche). Be prepared to negotiate heavily at first. Until you start to get a steady client base, people are going to lowball you, perhaps rightfully so. Consider the consequences of establishing yourself at a low rate, or being considered unreasonable and inflexible. Also, since you're working with a partner, figure out how you're going to register your business by considering your financial situations or, preferably, hiring an accountant. I also *strongly* recommend working with your partner and an attorney to draft an operating agreement. I've seen so many horror stories with people who either didn't have one, made their own shitty one, or otherwise got screwed on technicalities."
