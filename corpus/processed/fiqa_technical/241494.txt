I'll agree to that. They are definitely manipulations that end up with unintended consequences. Even the idea of tying stock to the CEO's salary was intended to make the CEO think long term, but what happened is that they figured out how to game the system. Which is unfortunate, especially since the employees end up taking the brunt of that. Need a stock boost? Lay off some people, buy back some stock or announce something.
