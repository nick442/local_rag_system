> However, the linked studies are essentially irrelevant to your bombastic claims; they still fail to backup your idea that literally everybody who consumes cannabis is a degenerate who lives with his/her parents and works a minimum wage job and is a danger to society. That remains an unproven (and unprovable) assertion First of all, I never said all. But it seems to be a pattern among redditors. There is a correlation, just not proof. You also can't prove its not true either. > My point was simply that your generalizations of marijuana consumers are spurious, close-minded and not based on any real research. You've yet to provide any counterfactual to that. Do you think escaping reality by doing drugs all day everyday is a good way of dealing with your problems?
