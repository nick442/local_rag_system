Yes, smartphones are VERY dependent on country. If you look at India, AAPL is pushing the iPhone 4 and not even talking about the iPhone 5, because it's their only way of affordably breaking into what's been a pretty hostile market for them. Conversely, in Japan (to which America is closer here) iOS actually outsells Android. But yeah that 11.7% figure still just feels small.
