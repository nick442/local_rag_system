Many mortgages have a clause saying the bank will not sell the loan. You are acting like this is unheard of, but it is a standard checkbox on most bank's mortgages, where they either mark that they can sell it or they mark that they won't. So, it is common enough for it to be on their standard forms. (There are many sources of funding for banks for mortgages that explicitly prevent them from selling loans)
