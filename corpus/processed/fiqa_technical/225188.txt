You can read [the government report](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201709_cfpb_financial-well-being-in-America.pdf) yourself to verify it. I can tell you that a lot of extreme poverty gets completely papered over in popular culture. It's never touched on in popular fiction or mainstream news. Back in college, I would volunteer as a youth mentor and teacher's assistant in our small city. The city was at one time an important rail hub with an impressive steel mill. The mill had been abandoned for decades. The old part of the city had all sorts of decaying but nice antebellum homes. The rest of the city was newer, but nonetheless the decay was everywhere. Broken windows in every corner, and abandoned buildings galore. More than *70%* of the kids in the district couldn't even normally afford school lunches, so they qualified for free meals for it. It's really heart breaking. Under the nose of the people in the center of society, vast swaths of America have become nearly third world, [and it happened quite quickly in many regions.](https://i.imgur.com/orRkVOf.gif)
