"Thats because min wage jobs are for high-school kids, not grown adults with kids. Min. Wage hurts the poor because : 1. It increases the barrier to entry for low skill jobs and 2. Incentivizes automation increasing unemployment and 3. Incentivizes price increases for the ""big evil corporations"" to protect their profit margins and make their shareholders happy. If you want to destory the economy, you might as well go all out an just make min wage $1000 dollars an hour."
