"RBL is likely *reserve based lending*, which is a type of asset-based financing in oil&gas world where debt is secured by oil reserves. Presumably context is that have an oil&gas company that the analyst thinks should be acquiring other companies. To fund that, the analyst is saying the parent company should borrow money against their reserves (should be relatively inexpensive capital b/c asset-backed) and then using it to fund acquisitions. For the target's capital structure, those amounts are equity infused by the Parent (even though the Parent got the money by borrowing it). The Target can then borrow money against its own operations.. this borrowed money will ""gear"" up the Target -- gearing is just a term for leverage, typically specifically debt-to-equity ratio. So to fund the acquisition, the Parent is (1) going to borrow using a RBL on Parent's assets to come up with equity to put into target and (2) going to borrow against Target's business. Presumably today Target is relatively debt free or even cash heavy."
