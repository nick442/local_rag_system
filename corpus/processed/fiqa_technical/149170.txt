> The report I linked to appears to disagree with you about the numbers. I can't remember the report you linked anymore but prior to 2010/2011 (drawdown) there was only a single point (2007/2008) where contractors outnumbered troops, and it was by (iirc from the chart) 30-40k. USAID had 53k contractors under them at that time. The math there means that, at no point prior to the drawdown, did DoD contractors outnumber DoD personnel. >I wonder how it works out from a budgetary perspective for the professional mercenary companies, who I've read get paid massive amounts, which, I imagine, must irritate those doing similar work for government pay. People like Blackwater and their ilk. That was the contracting work that I did. The military guys are just envious (but in a pretty positive way - certainly not hatin') and the government civilians can be annoyed but largely don't care. Everyone is in the same boat, pretty much - you're all there together. The military guys know that if they want to do contracting they need to follow a certain career path which they either choose not to pursue or can not. State Department employees had the biggest problem with it because a) contractors fuck all of their women and b) they make more than the Staties without having a degree. It's very much a classist thing, and they are on the losing end of it. Kids educated at Cornell and now playing diplomat don't appreciate that. Pay (for me) was $675 a day for some of the time, $1125 a day for the other part. It was decent pay, I worked 4 hours a day on average, and I got to work out a lot, but the food sucked and there were too few girls. And the ones that were there.. you didn't want them. Or at least I didn't. But I've seen some of the best looking guys I've ever met dick down some ugly girls in country, and there was no way that I was about to fight with them over the (stretch marked or busted looking) scraps.
