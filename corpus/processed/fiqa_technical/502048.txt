"Not true. The language used in the Navy & Army clauses are different. There is a duty to ""maintain"" the Navy and ""support"" the armies. There is no such mandate in the postal clause. Nor can the act of establishing be read as implying maintenance, because the Constitution specifically includes those things for the Army and Navy, suggesting it was not implied. You can establish something and then privatize it. Government-chartered companies were common at the time, so it's not like the idea didn't occur to them. Strictly speaking, I don't see any reason that Congress couldn't also privatize the army and navy, assuming that ""maintain"" and ""support"" don't imply direct congressional control. But that's a harder argument, compared to this much easier distinction in the case of the post office."
