"Appeal to Authority - Using an authority as evidence in your argument when the authority is not really an authority on the facts relevant to the argument. As the audience, allowing an irrelevant authority to add credibility to the claim being made. That is what I've been getting at in my comments. You kept saying you have more experience so I brought up that I've actually studied economics. Then I immediately followed it up with that, despite my studies, that doesn't mean I'm right just like your experience doesn't mean you are correct. That was my whole point and why I brought it up. Experience or ""authority"" doesn't mean you are correct. It's like saying ""I'm older so I know better."" But, you kept pressing forwards with ""I have more experience and more academics than you,"" and even calling me kiddo despite not knowing my age, so I went and grabbed a link to a consensus of 600 people who are considered experts in this field that disagreed with you. Each personal individually would trump your experience, let alone 600 of them collectively. As far as my first source, it doesn't matter. I can go find more if you want. I stand by my claims because I've also seen it elsewhere. Sorry I didn't send you 10 links instead of just one, and now I'm in mobile so I can't easily discuss it. As far as your source that discusses academic leanings, I'm intrigued with its findings, because it appears to be reputable, and plan to look over it. I've personally said for awhile that when faced with new facts/evidence I'll consider it in regards with my position, and will change my position if the evidence appears to line up. I've done it before and I'm not so prideful to not do it again. Besides, that's what people should do instead of just digging their heels in because they don't like what they hear."
