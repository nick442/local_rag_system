depends IB is a huge area, are they quant traders, portfolio construction researchers, ML researchers, data engineers,analysts, software engineers? One year in $150k is unlikely however if a trader, quant trader or quant researcher, software engineer certainly possible. $1m by 30 good luck I own a recruitment business for IB's, HF's, its not common to earn $1m at a bank, certainly not these days, buyside again very difficult but more likely. I work with directors/MD's predominantly and Barclays for sure will not pay that by there 30, they have some MD's on million dollar sums but they are not common. They have a hell of a long road before they get there, at Barclays he could be canned in 2 years regardless of his performance. Citi VP's are capped at $180k base if you perform exceptionally matching bonus realistically between 30-50%of base, though this can vary. Depending on the role typically goes like this: associate - 2 or 3 years, then VP 3- 5 years, director 7-10 years MD 12-15 years + depending on area, role, bank you join. Each area is different. If you go into finance research your area it's highly competitive, if you cannot explain your enthusiasm for finance and why you want to do it beside money you will find it hard. School is not that important JP hires shit tonnes from Baruch and Lafayette College its about your GPA. Learn to code Python, KDB+/Q, C++ and Matlab are decent languages that are universally used. EDIT - Citi also pay higher than Barclays generally across the board.
