Dude go the dermatology route. Basically a standard 9-5 and starting at $250k in the Midwest (more on the coasts.) IB is hell, and also 80 hours a week, at least it was on the M&A side. It sounds like you're just picking these options for the money, and no real passion for any of it. You're not going to like what you do if you're just doing it solely for a great paycheck.
