On the contrary. Outsourcing to India and investing in India in general is quite profitable and strategically appealing. 1. India's Silicon Valley alone is incomparable to that of the States'. 2. Country is indisputably more advanced than people think. 3. Their call centre alone is known and classified as one of their strongest proficiencies. 4. Not to mention the strongest argument of all, they have their own production lines for almost everything. Thus, not importing anything but rather exporting and sharing its advanced products. 5. One of the most (if not the most) IT savvy countries in the world. Only argument for the above post is the potential obstacle of discrepancies of culture between the outsourcing country and India. India may not be as diverse as would be preferred in order to rid the possibility of potential bottlenecks with regards to diversity.
