"Funny you mention that. I actually prefer Vons food delivery over Amazon Fresh, mostly because of selection options.. Amazon Fresh is great if you want boutique food items like organic happy meats and free range ketchup, but I'm not interested in a 200 dollar grocery bill for 12 items, even if they're supposedly superhomeopathic foodstuffs. This may change now with the purchase of Whole Foods, although I'm not going to hold my breath.. There's a reason why the chain has the nickname ""Whole Paycheck"" after all."
