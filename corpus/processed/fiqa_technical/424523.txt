"We generally speak of the ""elasticity of demand"". Greeting cards are expensive because they can be. We buy them in a sentimentally weakened state, and we do not buy them by the tonne. There is also the concept of ""Market Segmentation"", but not so much. Essentially the price is determined by finding the ""point of pain"" and winding it back a little. So people will pay $5 for a card. They will not (generally) pay $5,000 unless there is a good reason (vanity ?). Why sell them for $2 ? The customers who baulk at $5 tend not to even have $2. (Market segmentation again). In short the price is always going to need to be set before the point where demand rolls off sharply, to maximise profit."
