I’d chalk amazon up to 1) the market giving then a pass on earnings, 2) AWS rising to eat everything else. I didn’t think it could break past 750-800 last year. Netflix on the other hand..not sure on the value there. Best case scenario they are HBO or all the content providers realize the game sucks and go back? Content is king and everyone is charging more and more for it OR launching their own streaming options. Unlike hbo, I can subscribe for a month and consume all the content I want and then be done. The pro for them is their service is amazing..apps, online, etc. really good experience.
