Since you are considering dumping your savings into your student loans when they are equal, you should go ahead and do it now. You will immediately reap the benefit of paying less interest per month. Also, your minimum monthly payments will decrease so if you had unexpected expenses pop up, you could shrink your payments for a limited time. If you don't have emergency expenses, more of your regular monthly payment will go toward the principle of your loan and pay it off faster. Make a goal to get your savings back up as soon as you can after your loans are paid off. In the mean time, see what other things you can cut back on like eating less expensive food or switching to a less expensive phone plan. If you have stuff you don't need anymore, try selling it on Craiglist or eBay. Or just focus on doing more at work so you can get a raise. These things are not necessary, but it's a good feeling to be able to shave another month or two off paying a debt.
