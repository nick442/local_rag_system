"Not normally, for a limited liability company anyway. In extreme circumstances a court may ""lift the veil"" of incorporation and treat shareholders as if they were partners. If you are an office bearer or a director that is found to have breached duties/responsibiities then that is another matter. Dim views can be taken of shonky arrangents for companies formed for activites not of a bona fide business nature too."
