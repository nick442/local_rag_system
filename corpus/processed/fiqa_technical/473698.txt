The amount of money spent on compliance to prevent insider trading alone probably dwarfs the cost it may impose on the markets. But separately from that, the information that insider has is obviously going to get out, right? If it were spread through word of mouth heterogeneously and not released to all market participants at once, you eliminate or greatly diminish the value of ultra high frequency trading, which has become a useless arms race that probably doesn't add much value to society. In the world of information, there's no clear marking that says *public* and *non-public*, but rather many shades between. I just don't think it's really worth pursuing except in the case of actual company insiders. We should be focusing our limited energy elsewhere, in my opinion.
