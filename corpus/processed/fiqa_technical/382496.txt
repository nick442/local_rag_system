> For these processes.. I'm going to go ahead and tell you now that no one at your firm understands these processes to the extent necessary to migrate it to another data pipeline. It's not a knock on you, your firm, or your tech: it's just a fact of life where technology migrations are concerned. The time to avoid embedding Excel in a workflow is when someone has the bright idea of embedding Excel in a workflow. After that, it's a lost cause. Unless you stand to gain millions, there is no point in excising the tumor. > ..with the Technology Transformation Team Yeah, this is happening whether you like it or not. My advice? Quit, become a consultant and charge (conservatively) 3x what you're making now to fix their upcoming self-inflicted gunshot wounds. If these rates sound outrageous, understand that politically you give them a fall guy when (not if) the migration fails.
