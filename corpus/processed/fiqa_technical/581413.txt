Be your professional self no matter what. Because weeks/months afterward your true self will come out. If this so-called 'conservative' company representative does not feel you were an optimal fit so be it. Employers, are like women, they're plenty of 'fish' in the sea. And there's nothing worse then not being yourself 8 hours a day 5 days a week. Got it?
