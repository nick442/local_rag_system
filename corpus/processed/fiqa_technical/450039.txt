That is how the market works. Maybe these roofing companies should find another line of work. Roofing is a shitty job, and I can understand why people don't want to do it for $10/hour, which is ~20k a year, which is subsistence living at best. Less roofers, less supply..well you know. So it is in the workers best interests long term to turn their nose up at low paying laborious jobs. Just like a company would do if they were in a line of work with low profit margins. With the difference being, when labor does not get motivated for low pay, they are considered lazy.
