Alright guys, let's get some real business discussion going on (well, at least let's try). This is surprising. Citi has not been doing well but I didn't think there was any pressure on Vikram to resign either. The timing is very weird too - right after a successful Q3 and with no planned transition plan announced in the Q3 earnings. As for Pandit's legacy, it's definitely an unsuccessful one. First, the whole thing started on the wrong foot with Citi buying his hedge fund just to make him the CEO -- and subsequently closing the fund and writing off $200 million. The bank's shares are trading at roughly half book value which shows how much the street didn't trust Citi (and him).
