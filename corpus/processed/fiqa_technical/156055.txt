They would get caught on other crimes, and then rat you out for immunity. Happened to a lot of people in history. And your friends are probably unavailable for crime for the same reason you would trust them: They have values. For doing crime you would need a definite antisocial streak, and that would imply you would be more likely to betray partners. Come to think of it, finding trustworthy accomplices would be really difficult unless you have already good connections to the underworld. People not used to criminal activities probably would do mistakes, or face psychological tension. And it's not like you could make a craigslist classified and make applicants go through an assessment centre. If you have close friends who would all be willing to go for it, maybe, but then parting ways might raise suspicion.
