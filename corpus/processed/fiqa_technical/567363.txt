I'm sorry. But it seems like you are the idiot. You confuse economic models with reality. You are frustrated that the models you learned based on a perfect world are wrong. So rather than reviewing the models you say that world is broken. Control what you have control over your models. Adjust them and try to explain what is happening, when you find the reasoning please share it with us on reddit. Until then don't throw words around, not only are you wrong and misinformed but you have also made a fool of yourself.
