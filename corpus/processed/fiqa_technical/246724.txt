"GM could have developed electric cars - hey they had the Chevy Volt. Yet GM is now worth about the same as Tesla - a company that has only sold a tiny fraction of the cars GM has. Acquiring Cruise Automation was a good move but $1bi is not a lot of money for a company their size. I do not believe GM has the vision necessary to transform the auto industry. They are too entrenched in their existing business model. Now my previous comment was a direct retort to Miller's comment saying ""to say you can be a full level five with just cameras and radars is not physically possible"". It is obviously physically possible, regardless of whether Tesla is full of shit or not."
