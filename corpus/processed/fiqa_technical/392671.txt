I was born in '63 and I have not had it so good. The 80s and early 90s were good. They hired anybody with a pulse back then. The late 90s and 2000s were horrible. I could not find anyone who wanted to give me a chance and I did the most soul-crushing, low paying things to keep feeding myself and stay out of debt. I finally found something decent--pay is not great but the work is professional--and worked my hiney off the first two years until somebody noticed. Then I got a promotion. I will be doing this work and working hard at it, until the day I drop dead and I'm damned grateful for it! Although I am maybe several hundred K behind in total earnings compared to the folks 10 or more years older. Don't hate all of us. We didn't all make them mess and a lot of us suffered from it, too.
