You are right. It's not actually a scam but people call it that way because MLM promoters lie and use misleading statistics and demonstrations to make it look easy despite having pretty much no chance of success. Also MLM promoters usually lie to people about owning a supercar or mansion, and telling them that they can be rich by joining MLM. But yes it's a gamble disguised as a decent business.
