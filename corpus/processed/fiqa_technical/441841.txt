"We're conditioned to ignore ads. While growing up the ""commercial break"" was used for other activities like getting food or taking a piss. Now with other mediums available including ways to circumvent ads, ie. ad block & streaming, there is minimal penetration. Even ads we cannot block out, ie. billboards, we simply read and forget."
