"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2017/09/macro_events_in.html) reduced by 91%. (I'm a bot) ***** > NGDP aggregates prices and output, and thus NGDP cannot change unless at least some individuals adjust their output or pricing decisions. > Proponents of NGDP stabilization point to such abrupt downturns in the growth of nominal GDP as occurred in 2008 as something that could be eliminated by having the Fed stabilize nominal GDP. We do not doubt that a sufficient monetary expansion could offset any decline in nominal GDP, provided only that V remains positive. > Unstable monetary policy shows up as unstable NGDP. Since wages are sticky, employment tends to move with NGDP in the short run, and unemployment is countercyclical. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6z8a10/macro_events_in_big_economies_dont_have_micro/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~207480 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **NGDP**^#1 **economic**^#2 **monetary**^#3 **targeting**^#4 **agents**^#5"
