Libya thought toppling Gaddafi would imprpopve their system. Sometimes destroying for the sake of destruction, without a proper plan, makes things worse. As bad as things are, things can be many thousand times worse. The US with all its problems is still one of the best places to live. Dont assume that what we have built will be so easily rebuilt.
