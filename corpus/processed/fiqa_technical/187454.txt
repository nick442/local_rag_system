Actually sadly true. Between not living in a major metropolitan area and rarely eating out, there are probably 5 restaurants we've eaten at in the last year. Four are local places and quite good. Olive Garden has been our go-to when we visit relatives in a nearby larger city because at least the quality was fairly even and these relatives liked it. We've had some pretty sucky service on our last few visits, but assumed it was just that they were probably working new waiters barely out of training in the late afternoon hours before the regular dinner staff came in. It all makes so much more sense now.
