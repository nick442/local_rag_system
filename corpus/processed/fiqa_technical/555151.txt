"> It starts off being the sole province of a handful of fairly-well-off nerds who don't mind wasting their time on something that may end up being a technological dead end, then becomes a high-end rich person's thing once it's proven useful or enjoyable, then as the market expands, it gets cheap enough to benefit everyone. If allowed to be an early adopter of mind-enhancement technologies I hereby pledge to allocate at least 5% of my time thereafter to finding ways to making the technology more available to all classes of people. I will totally Borg it up in this shit. (Hrm. Nanovirus that infects and replicates itself into uplifting humans to transhuman.. while also producing a ""pill"" in a person's palm that they can swallow to cure themselves of said infection? I like it.)"
