"Yeah, but really - Amazon and a brick and mortar like Walmart do about 3/4's of the same amount of ""shipping"" between manufacturer and eventual consumer. The consumer does the last part in Walmart's shipping model, in going to a physical store, whereas Amazon just takes that upon themselves in delivering the goods from a warehouse that's probably not more than few hundred miles from the nearest walmart."
