"No one can claim markets are perfectly efficient. The Grossman-Stiglitz paradox explains one reason why it is impossible for the market to be perfectly effecient, and there are plenty of investors that show it is practically possible to consistently beat the market (e.g. ""The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville"" or RenTec's Medallion Fund). However, even if you accept as true that prices behave strangely around round numbers, that isn't a refutation of the efficient market hypothesis. The efficient market hypothesis says that price reflect all available information, so the expected price tomorrow is just the price today (not taking into account the time value of money). The efficient market hypothesis says nothing about how prices are distributed. Historically, a random walk has been used, but that is neither a consequence of the EMH nor a required assumption. You could say that prices are more volatile the nearer they are to a round number or new high, but that doesn't necessarily give you an edge in making money off the stock."
