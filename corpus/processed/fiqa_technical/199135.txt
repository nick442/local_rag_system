There is no slack of money. People who are saving their money don't have it stored under their mattress. Instead they have it saved in a bank that is in turn being loaned out at the lowest rates in history. All of this manipulation of the economy has finally caught up to us and the last thing we need is more manipulation. We just have to let the bad investments and the misallocations weed out first. I agree with you that it's a tough thing to endure in the short term but it will help us in the long term.
