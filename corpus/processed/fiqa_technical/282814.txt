Answer their questions as honestly as you can, they should know that you aren't going to have the answer off hand to everything and that is ok. One way that you can cover yourself is to take photographs of everything that way if anything catastrophic does happen you will have something to show exactly how it was when the adjuster comes to do their estimates. Hopefully you never need to use that but better to err on the side of caution. The insurance company isn't all that important, read reviews as mentioned in another answer. You can also look into multiple policy discounts. If your insurance provider for your auto insurance also offers homeowners policies they might also offer you a discount on one or both policies for grouping them. Feel free to shop around and look for the best coverage at the best price. Overall the most important thing is going to be a company that is easy to deal with. It is not worth saving a couple dollars a year to have insurance through somewhere that is going to make it a nightmare to make a claim. In addition to answering all of their questions make sure that you have all of your own questions answered. Depending on location you might want to ask if they cover hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, other natural events, etc. If you have any special items like collectibles, jewelry, expensive electronics, firearms, etc you might want to ask if that is covered of if you need a separate rider for those items.
