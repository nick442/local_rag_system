That's a good question. Are these internet companies actually natural monopolies ? I'm unsure about that, but if it is true they fall into the category of enterprises such as utilities that many have argued should be removed from private ownership and placed in some collective ownership. The record of privately owned utilities has been truly dismal from a public interest point of view.
