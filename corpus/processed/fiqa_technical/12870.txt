Wine is often invested, as is whisky and some other spirits And fortified wines that have particular vintages, such as port. You need to be particular about which ones to invest in though. Top vintages of wine and port can rocket in value, to make the big profits you need to buy the new vintage before everyone realises it is going to be a top year and sell it some years later when it is approaching its peak. This is obviously quite tricky to do. It is fairly common to buy a share in a particular batch of whisky (proper Scottish single malt), then after 12-18 years when it is matured you can take your share in bottles or cash.
