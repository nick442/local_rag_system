Nobody would goto SeaWorld if they didn't have whale/dolphin shows. That just the bottom line of reality, 90% of people goto sea world because their kids want to sit in splash zone and see whales and dolphins jump around. If peoples kids don't want to goto SeaWorld anymore they can go out on a date or something instead with that money. If they dropped the Orca shows, a bunch of hippie environmentalists that wouldn't be caught dead in a Sea Park would be really happy and keep not going to seaworld, while the thousands of children that basically keep their business afloat would rapidly loose interest and they would have to just become another SixFlags 2 hours away from a bigger, better six flags. I don't like the Orca shows anymore than you do, but if 2 or 3 whales living in sub-optimal conditions helps keep marine science research and development afloat I think it's worth it even if their conditions where 5x shittier. Seriously nobody cares about 100's of thousands of starving children or the million people kept in a shittier tank in Gaza, but some uncomfortable whales that almost single-handily keep funding up for projects that are saving millions of sea creatures are a huge deal. Edit: Downvote me all you want, it doesn't make it less true that 90% of their visitors couldn't give a single fuck about Orca conditions..
