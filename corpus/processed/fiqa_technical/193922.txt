"I think this needs to be stressed a lot more if you ask me. As a society, we seem to be falling into this weird paradigm where businesses somehow have a right to a profit and that is basically creating this odd sentiment that somehow ""burdening"" businesses with paying a decent wage and offering benefits is ruining business. If you ask me, all it is doing is ruining the businesses that aren't viable anyway. If the only reason your business turns a profit is because you are gaming the part-time/full-time employment rules for cost cutting purposes, guess what? Your business deserves to fucking die. I think far too many ""business men"" feel entitled to profit and can't see that maybe it isn't how high their costs are, but how fucking little people want what they are selling."
