Pretty much. I'm working overseas developing an electronic system to streamline a paper approval workflow process. The amount of manpower it takes to manually maintain all this information is amazing. A simple access database application that tracks signatures and approvals could probably knock five people out of a full-time job. I've already had several easily implementable features knocked off scope by people afraid of losing their own importance.
