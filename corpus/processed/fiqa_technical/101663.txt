> They pay for it with tax money. Why would they have to make people work for free that doesn't even make sense. Where do you think tax money comes from? If you pay a 25% tax rate, for every 100 hours you work, you are forced to work 25% of those for free. Do you think the poor in America are in danger of starving to death? They are one of the most obese groups in all of human history. They are not in danger of starving. Most people don't want tons of kids, but those in poverty have 15% more children than the rest of us. That is a dangerous statistic that should be addressed. You cannot escape from poverty by adding more bills and responsibility.
