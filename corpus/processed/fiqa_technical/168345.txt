In the case of HP, in the early to mid 1990's they had done really well, but by the late 90's the board and shareholders wanted to see even more profits thanks to the internet boom. They ousted their CEO Platt, who rose through the HP ranks, brought in Fiorina who was from AT&T (old Long Distance AT&T not the SBC/Cingular one we have now), who over-promised and never delivered and basically forced HP in buying Compaq which nearly destroyed HP. The only reason why HP is still around today is thanks to its business line of workstations and printers. The company made many bad decisions during Fiorini tenure which was amazing that anyone trusted her, but I'm guessing she was great at hissy fits. Somehow she has made a name for herself and is now trying politics and her type of leadership fits perfectly with the current republican party.
