"Most people can't see trends and trajectories. Who knows why, but only few can and they write articles like this and we laugh at them. Or they come up with slogans like ""This changes everything"" and again, we laugh at them. You can see ""This changes everything. Again."" used and abused all over the internet every day. But let's take a look at this particular meme. When iPhone came out just five years ago, Apple was making computers for 5% of the world market and was totally irrelevant for 95% of the market, Microsoft was making an OS for other companies' hardware and Google was just a search engine. Motorola, Nokia and RIM were the biggest phone manufactures. Well, damn! Five years later - everything has changed - like it or not. EDIT: se -> see"
