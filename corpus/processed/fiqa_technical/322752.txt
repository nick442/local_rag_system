This shouldn't be an either / or situation. Yeah, Amazon is headed towards a monopoly.. and we need to somehow address that down the road.. but let's not act like Trump isn't guilty of doing exactly what he accused Bezos of doing; using media to bully politicians for a certain agenda. It doesn't matter if you own a newspaper or not.. especially when Trump gets the luxury of Fox News being run like HE owns it. They BOTH have enough media attention to get their ideologies out. Trump is just upset because majority of the American public agree with Bezos over him (on just about anything).
