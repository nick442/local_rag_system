"First they failed miserably to meet their Windows 10 adoption goals, and now they've fired a bunch of people to ""refocus"". Microsoft should abandon the Windows Kernel. They should adopt a variety of *nix, the way Apple did, and then give Windows away as a free Desktop Environment like KDE and Gnome. Then they can focus on their applications. Office, exchange, and so on, which is where their profits have been coming from for the last several years. They could market and sell those apps to people on all platforms, which would probably help their sales. Microsoft is in a dangerous situation. They belong to an old model, before open source took off. Microsoft became huge when computers were out of reach from the general public. They had early access to the machines which gave them an edge. Now everyone is on equal footing and the philosophy of freely sharing software tools to enrich everyone's lives is becoming more popular than the idea of making money from software. If Microsoft can't do something to keep their products ""worth buying"" in the face of completely capable and free competition, they're going to shrink a lot. For many of us Microsoft's products stop being worthwhile several years ago. They don't currently offer anything that can't be had elsewhere for free, and their products are not really any easier or more stable or reliable than the competition, despite their marketing efforts to convince you otherwise."
