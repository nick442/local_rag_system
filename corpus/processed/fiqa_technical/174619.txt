Toronto is small relative to the states. Have you considered moving to NYC or even Chicago? Everyone seems to be wanting in right now. I know of a guy with a master's from the london school of economics, CFA level III who's just started as an unpaid intern(not me). You might be better off working a job wherein you actually produce something good for people to make money rather than just siphoning funds from others. Then you'll have funds to start your own trading unit with talented people you respect and trust.
