Yeah I agree. What Cat did was likely illegal, but a lot of that was due to incompetence. If done properly, they could have ended up in the gray range where they could potentially justify their tax position to the IRS. To the larger point though, it just seems wasteful to play these games. I understand everyone does it and that it's part of the system, it just all seems a bit ridiculous and I wonder if there's a simpler solution that could benefit all stakeholders. Governments get similar revenues without dealing with ridiculous complexities of tax avoidance schemes, companies are more efficient, and then efficiency or revenue gains can be passed onto workers. My main worry however, is that these gains would be passed onto executive bonuses instead.
