"New Zealand has a statute of limitations on debt of six years, twelve years if it is ""a debt acknowledged in a deed"" (probably not the case here). If you have had no contact with the bank for that time, the debt expires. If you got convicted of a crime in relation to the debt (e.g. fraud) then that would fall under a different statute of limitations, but a bank isn't going to bother doing that over $600, and the courts would probably not accept the case anyway."
