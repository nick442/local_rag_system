What he is describing is incredibly common in Scandinavian corporate structure. I can send an email to anyone in the company. I can discuss things and ask questions across departments no problem. Decisions however need to go through the hierarchy, but I can do all the groundwork and investigate the angles **before** I bring a proposed solution to my manager. It makes us agile and fast at solving issues and it just makes sense. It does require people to not be obsessed with the power of their position and trying to take all the credit. Luckily that kind of attitude is not that common in at least the Swedish corporate world.
