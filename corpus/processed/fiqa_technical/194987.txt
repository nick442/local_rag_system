I figured you might say Australia. Unfortunately, you'll still need to pay US taxes (if I understand things correctly) on top of any Australian taxes you'll have to pay so long as you are still a US citizen (and afaik, you can't give up US citizenship w/o first becoming a citizen of some foreign country). Do you have a plan for this (yet)? If so, what? I have to say that the reaction to Eduardo Saverin leaving the US is frightening and certainly goes a long way toward validating your concerns.
