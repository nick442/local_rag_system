"Embrace the role and learn how to tell your story. Find an interesting way to tie your past experience, education, and goals directly to the role you want. If you can show that you are glowing interest with the background and skills you have then you will have no problem finding a quant-type role. You need to make it sound like everything you have done up to this point was to prepare you for this type of role (e.g. ""I accepted a SE role so that I could take steps toward learning how to implement the types of Actuarial models I learned at my previous gig on a larger scale, how to integrate those models with others, etc."").
