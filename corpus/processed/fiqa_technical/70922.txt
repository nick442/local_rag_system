Notice that a textbook publishing conglomorate owns the majority share of both Penguin and Random House. Golly, I wonder how those textbook guys got to be so profitable? I don't suppose they viciously abused copyright law to threaten teachers and students like thugs to extort outrageous fees for material they didn't even necessarily have rights to? Do you suppose that's how they did it? Or was it through controlling distribution and shutting out independents and making textbook distribution pay-to-play? Hmm, why choose when they're both so profitable?
