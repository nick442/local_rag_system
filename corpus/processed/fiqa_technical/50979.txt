You make a great point. For a large part of America, their support for Trump was reactionary, not based on his qualifications. For better or for worse, is a bad electoral strategy it alienate voters with valid criticisms of a celebrity they like. Like you say, they will just stop listening. Instead they will react with an intense desire to stick it to those dirty liberals for being mean, and elevate that priority above the well-being of the republic.
