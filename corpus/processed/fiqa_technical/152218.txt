Many people have asked how to setup a business email address and if it's acceptable to use a third party email system like Aol or Gmail. Aol's mail system has always been less than efficient because of the massive amount of filtering they've had to implement in order to try and circumvent spam. Gmail is a great email system but corresponding via Gmail for business matters will probably appear unprofessional to some if not most. The most professional looking email address is usually the one that has a suffix which matches your domain name.
