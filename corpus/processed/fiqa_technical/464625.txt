I'm not alarmed. I definitely have some sociopathic traits, but I doubt I'm really a sociopath, or if I am, I'm very bad at being one. I do not know how to con or manipulate people. In fact, I used to be quite vulnerable to being manipulated myself. I think I can be an ok liar, but since I don't lie often, I don't really know. In childhood I was known for being well-behaved, and I did very well academically. I have, in the past, felt bad about doing some immoral things, but I would never acknowledge remorse out of pride. (It's embarrassing to be remorseful and give in to society.) When I thought about it, it didn't make sense to feel bad about violating society's rules because I don't like society, except for the food and material goods. Beyond that, society is restrictive and weird.
