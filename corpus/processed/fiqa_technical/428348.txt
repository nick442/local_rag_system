"As I understand your scenario, you paid the contractor twice for cabinets - Once by paying the $20k in cash on the original contract and once ""in-kind"" by providing the cabinets yourself. The $20k that you got from the contractor is not income to you, it's just a refund of your overpayment. I don't think you need to report that at all. Just make sure that you can document that the check that you got back from the contractor matches what you paid for the cabinets and keep that record."
