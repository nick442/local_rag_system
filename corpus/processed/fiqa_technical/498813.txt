[We already](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12784.htm) did this [quite well](http://sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/GAO%20Fed%20Investigation.pdf), and why does [Ron Paul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Transparency_Act) keep [introducing crackpot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_Abolition_Act#Sound_money) bills that die mostly because they're irrelevant? [He wrote a book supporting the gold standard](http://www.amazon.com/Case-Gold-Ron-Paul/dp/1469971801) and added a double helping of economic idiocy with [End the Fed](http://www.amazon.com/End-Fed-Ron-Paul/dp/0446549193). Amazing he gets such a following, but I guess they are mostly economic crackpots, and he is their prophet :)
