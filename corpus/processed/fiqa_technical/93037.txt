I omitted Germany and France because they are in fact doing well. But I am not going to say someone is healthy just because their lungs are fine but they are suffering from stomach cancer. Finland and Denmark can not be compared to the US in any meaningful way as most of our states have higher populations than their entire country. Hell, we have cities that have a higher population than their entire country.
