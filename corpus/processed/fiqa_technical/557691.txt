"Two things here: 1. They (and all companies and people) should be honest and transparent about what they're doing. 2. Like almost all the privacy and tech issues there's a convenience/intrusiveness line that's constantly in flux. Uber wasn't trying to track everybody post ride for fun, they were trying to model future demand for cars before somebody punched in they needed a ride. You can imagine all kinds of events like pro sports, concerts, festivals, etc. that could cause spikes in demand, which lead to: - Long waits (which people hate) - Surge pricing (which people hate) So they have algorithms that look and ""see"" -> There's a 20x increase in density of Uber users in this 3 block radius of downtown that started 1 hour ago, we predict with a 80% confidence based off past behavior that we'll need more drivers in that area in the next hour. They're 100% doing this so that when you check Uber and it says the wait is 5 minutes for a car, and when you look at Lyft and it says 10 that you'll use them. Yeah, it's kind of creepy, but we're all making the choice to carry a GPS enabled microphone and camera within arms reach 24/7. What Uber's doing is not much different than FindMyPhone apps, Google Now, and lots of other systems."
