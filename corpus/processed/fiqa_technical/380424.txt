First, can I even roll any my profits into a 529 plan to avoid taxes. No. 529 plans are not pre-tax (except for State taxes in certain States, where 529 contributions are deductible. Ohio is such a State, with certain conditions). For Federal taxes - funding a 529 with yourself as a beneficiary doesn't change a thing on your taxes. Is there any special requirements for the state of Ohio. Yes, see the link above. Essentially you'll be carrying the deduction forward for years until you exhaust it, $2000 at a time. Is there a better solution that I am overlooking. No. If it was easy to avoid income taxes - everyone would be doing it.
