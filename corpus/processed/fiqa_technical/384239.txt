That was precisely my point. 99% of the people who ignore their parents' advice are just learning the hard way. 1% are not just smarter than their parents, but so much smarter that their parents' life-lessons are inapplicable. (unfortunately, the 99% tend to think they are part of the 1%, and the 1% tend to take their parent's advice).
