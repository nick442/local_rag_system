I think it depends on how much time I am saving and what I am saving doing. I do not go out of my way to save a few pennies on gas. But If i know that I will be traveling somewhere with cheaper gas anyway I will wait to get there to fill up. But I if I need gas before there I will fill up at the place i stop rather than just getting enough to go to the new location. I heard it best said as being dollar smart instead of dime foolish. Going out of your way for gas like this is dime foolish. On the other hand if you can bundle your trip to the store nearby or other tasks it certianly adds to the value.
