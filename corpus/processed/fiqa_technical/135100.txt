> Food delivery has limited success for luxury or novelty food items (e.g., fruit baskets, steaks, coffee, snack food, etc.), but for general eating/family eating, it's not an everyday food shopping need. In the UK, all of the non-low end chains have food delivery where they delivery everything (usually better selections than the large shops) to your door. I used to live 5-6 minutes away from the shop, and I still did food delivery for perhaps Â£2-3. If your average store can do delivery, then surely Amazon can beat them at the same game.
