"Many reasons, but let me pick my favourite: The incentive to save isn't there. Any government subject to elections has the incentive to spend as much as possible to remain in power. What is worse, it has a DISINCENTIVE to save. Because the money it saves - and which it pays for with bad will from the electorate, who should really be smarter - is going to be spent by the OTHER guy who will then look incredibly good and be reassured of re-election. ""But isn't it afraid of accumulating debt?"" you may ask, and its simple. Somebody else will be there when the debt is due. The problem of incentives is a fundamental one."
