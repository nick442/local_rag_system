When I go into a store, it's because I'm shopping for something where I *don't* know about it already. I go straight to Amazon for products that I can buy sight unseen. That's why Best Buy's piss-poor service ruins it for me. You have nine products with near-identical information written about them, and all your salesman can do is read the numbers off the placard.
