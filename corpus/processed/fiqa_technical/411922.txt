I completely agree. We're a specialized company that focuses on doing things right, not just throwing up a web page. We see high conversion rate increases. Trust me, we're not a one and done shop. We know what we're doing, and we know that the value of our work is $2500 baseline. Sure, we can install WordPress and a stock theme while throwing up content for the person while installing some standard SEO plugins for $1000. And landing pages are something we never recommend doing without our clients knowing that they aren't cheap; landing pages need to be combined with other marketing tasks. They won't convert people who don't go to them. And, it's ridiculous to think that you've optimized conversion right away. We always strongly recommend A/B testing at the start of a marketing campaign for at least two weeks. Plus, all of that testing on the first landing page we do results in direct knowledge for any future ones, resulting in lower cost and a much much much higher ROI for our clients. So, yeah, I agree with you on the 'most designers' comment. But I would argue that isn't necessarily a *good idea* to do. You get what you pay for, I suppose.
