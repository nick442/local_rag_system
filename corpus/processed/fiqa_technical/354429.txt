"> From what I understand, the prices of futures are decided after the parties ""discover"" the price they think is appropriate for the underlying asset after some time. What do you mean by that? The price you buy a futures contract at in the market is the price you get. The concept of price discovery doesn't always apply as directly to derivatives as it does to equities. When you buy a futures contract not only are you aiding price discovery for the underlying asset, you're also signaling the value of tangible things like storage, weather, and transportation costs as well as intangibles such as future macroeconomic events, global policy decisions, etc. Also consider that derivatives markets have significant percentages of market participants who are hedgers. The classic example is a farmer who's going to be harvesting his corn in Oct/Nov but wants to ""lock in"" the price of his corn right now. So he can sell futures contracts (for delivery any time after Nov) at whatever they happen to be priced at currently in the market. Maybe he sells Dec contracts for 400 (400 cents per bushel, 5k bushels per contract assuming he's based in the US and trading these at [CME](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_contract_specifications.html)). Whatever happens to the price of corn between now and December, he knows he can deliver his corn for $4/bushel."
