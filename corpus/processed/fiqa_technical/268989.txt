Pretty much. There is an executive trying decide between a trader who has made the firm millions in the past few years and a quant who costs him a 6 figure salary but doesn't pull in any revenue. Then on top of it the quant is talking mathematics which the executive doesn't even know in the first place. Who is executive going to side with?
