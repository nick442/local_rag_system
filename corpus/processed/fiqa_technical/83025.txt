"> Though high maintenance is awesome ""Though"" is an insult to High Maintenance here. Disjointed is a pathetic excuse for a ""millennial weed"" sitcom with a goddamn laugh track. High Maintenance is a modern miniseries that explores interesting tropes in New York City - and obviously, as a self-respecting show, with no laugh track. The two aren't even on the same plane. HBO wins here."
