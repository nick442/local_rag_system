"Great find. The first sentence of the article itself is enough to raise multiple flags: > According to Michelle McQuaid, a world leader in positive psychology interventions in the workplace, [..] A **world** leader? In *""positive psychology interventions""*? This whole article was written by McQuaid's PR staff. It reads like a company press releases of a new product."
