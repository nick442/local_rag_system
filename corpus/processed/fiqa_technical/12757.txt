"Absolutely no conditions. The central bank just uses the money as if it were real money, which is technically becomes. They just simply buy financial products. It's as if I had a printing press in my basement. I would just print the cash, then walk into a store and buy some products. Anyone with half a brain can obviously see that this is not a solution, but a temporary band-aid with devastating consequences. I believe there are three types of people involved here. People who don't understand what's going on (most people), people who understand it and are OK with the obvious fraud, inflation, and wealth re-distribution which benefits the 1%, or people who are against it and actively seek to abolish central banks. We're the ones the media calls ""crazy"". You'd be surprised at how many people understand it and still advocate it. If you'd like to read a book about this topic and the other horrible practices of today's major central banks, read ""[End the Fed](http://www.amazon.com/End-Fed-Ron-Paul/dp/0446549193)"" by Ron Paul."
