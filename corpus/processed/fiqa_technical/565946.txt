Unless a lot of people I know don't actually exist, yes there are a lot. First off putting UChig as tier 1 is questionable at best. Second, if you've never met anyone from UVA, UMich, BU, Georgetown etc. on the street than you must know only a handful of people. Also, I was a front office hire out of a lower tier undergrad so there's that as well..
