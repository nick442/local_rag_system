Because I've seen it countless times at all levels of the workforce. It's very frustrating when an incompetent woman who constantly leaves early and comes in late gets promoted just because they want more females at higher ranks. In the end it just makes the companies less profitable and worse at what they do, as the stock market routinely shows when a company announces a new diversity initiative and their stock immediately goes down. But men are evil so I guess we deserve to reap fewer rewards for our labors.
