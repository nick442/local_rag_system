"That was just one example, there are other things that could be implemented. Some countries, like the UK, have different wages for lower age groups. So your example could have an under 21 or an ""under 24"" wage, unless married or legally emancipated like with the FAFSA. Or we could expand the work-study program so that students can get jobs and employers pay part of the salary and taxes covers some. Or there's a limit on the number of employees that can be considered on apprenticeship at any given time. There are lots of ways to address things. We already have various rules that have exceptions for different industries. Farmhand wages, tipped workers, etc. There could be other options."
