I'm on the border of Gen X & Millennial, and it seems to me that the overall market is what's impacting a lot of these companies rather than a particular generation of people. I don't buy napkins because I have paper towels. I'd rather spend money on Netflix than Cable TV. I mean I'm sure age has something to do with it as culture changes over time. But just as in important, with a quick google search I can find the DiY guide to redoing my floors or anything else for that matter. It's easier to save money with more information and the internet has provided a bunch. Now the trick is just getting accurate information. ugh.
