The CFA is not a gatekeeper to any given job, but can be a requirement after you get a certain job (equity research, asset management). There are even some that actively think it is a waste of time (investment banking). Networking and prepping for interviews is what ultimately get you what you are seeking; don't rely on the credential to do so. Source: private equity 6 mo., BB IB for 3 years, equity research 6 mo.
