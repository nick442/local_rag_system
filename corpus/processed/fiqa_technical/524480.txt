Without Obamacare I would be without insurance. Also, if you follow economic theory, the cheapest way to provide healthcare is to have a large amount of people paying into the same pool. The largest pool would be the entire population. The only way for that to function would be to pay the government to provide healthcare for all. There is an economic academic paper on this subject. I'll post it in an edit once I find it.
