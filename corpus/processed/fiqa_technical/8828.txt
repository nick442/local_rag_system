I don't think communism is bad as a form of government at all. I do think that people can in no way be trusted with it though, both leaders and the population. Also, socialist programs are horrible in the U.S. specifically because they have 32455 different departments all trying to run programs, causing overhead to be ridiculous. There really needs to be a lot of reform with that. =/
