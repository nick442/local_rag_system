Central Banks always controlled by politics. Bush Jr. told Greenspan that he needed to be reelected, and all Greenspan could do was lower interest rates to help, and that fueled more speculation by the commercial bankers. The president appoints the fed chairman, so dont tell me that they are independent of politicians. the whole notion that a central banker must be independent of the government force is fuking insane. You let private bankers control your monetary policy and you lose your nation's sovereignty. I'd rather put my trust to elected officials than unelected private financial mercenaries. Nationalize the FED.
