Yeah, if they actually did that - that is, defame your professional name with no merit - they would be in big trouble. Thats the kind of stuff you take to a lawyer and they have a field day with, at least if the evidence is there. I'm glad you left that place - it sounds awful. You should leave them a very honest Glassdoor review, to help future generations not have to go through the same stuff. Also, if they withheld OT wages from you, and you can prove that, and it hasnt been a extrodinary long time, I feel very confident you could wistleblow on them with your department of labor in your state and collect. I know thats probably not your style, but thats money you are owed. Hows the new job?
