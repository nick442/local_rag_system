As far as I can tell, it works like this: (Note, I am assuming you were 18 on Jan 1 2009) Contribution limits: So by the end of 2012, you will have been allowed to contribute $20,000 of new money. You say you've contributed $10,000, so you still can contribute another $10,000 of new money this year (But let's assume you do not..). Now, your original $10,000 has grown to $25,000. You can withdraw this without penalty. Next year, you will be given an allotment of another $5000 of new money (bringing your total lifetime limit to $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000 new money) PLUS, you will be allowed to re-contribute up to $25,000 of OLD money. Of course, the government doesn't make a distinction between old and new money, so the net effect is (assuming a 25k withdrawal): 2012 limit: $10 000 2013 limit: $40 000 less 2012 contributions. From http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/tfsa-celi/cntrbtn-eng.html: The TFSA contribution room is made up of: From this wording, it means the 25 k you withdraw will go to the 2013 contribution room (bullet 3). If you don't re-contribute, it will roll over into the 2014 contribution room (Under bullet 2) For correctness, I must add that I did not include any indexing of the annual amount.
