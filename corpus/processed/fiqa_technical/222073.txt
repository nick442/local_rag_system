">> Everything that President Trump promised you is going to happen. > I also doubt that the revised Health Care plan will be ""affordable"" and covering everything. You give this gray topic of affordable health care that Trump promised to act upon, but has yet do anything. Am I right? Did Trump do anything against or for drug prices? Isn't trump trying to replace the healthcare act? Yes or no? > I am still waiting for the Wall with Mexico, but I am sure it will not be done. Are you serious? Illegal immigration from Mexico? It's Trump fault? Is Trump against the wall and limiting immigration?"
