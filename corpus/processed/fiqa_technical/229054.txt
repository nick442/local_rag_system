It's all about keeping your employees happy and ensuring they feel like they're part of something other than a job. Make them feel like they're part of a family and support system. Throw in other things besides pizza parties once a month. Have corporate parties at your house on a weekend, or frequent happy hours. Have an employee of a month kind of thing or recognize your employees for the hard work they do. BUILD, SUPPORT, and SUSTAIN.
