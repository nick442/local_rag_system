The IRS has a website called Where is my refund? Get up-to-date refund information using Where's My Refund? or the IRS2Go mobile app. Where's My Refund? is updated once every 24 hours, usually overnight. Refunds are generally issued within 21 days after we receive your tax return. You should only call if it has been longer. I don't know what information you see on this site if you owe them money. Are you expecting a check from them, or did you send them money electronically? If you sent them money you should check your bank or card statement.
