In comparing housing to investing in a stock market, the author claims housing is a poor investment because houses depreciate. He's forgetting about the land component. The improvement on the land is only a portion of the value, and it's the only part that depreciates. In markets where the prices have risen significantly the value is largely in the land. Land has a finite supply, which is even more evident when we are looking at land located where people actually want to live. While strong banking controls kept Canada from suffering the same crash in the second half of the 2000's; availability of land where people actually want to live is likely responsible for a lot of the divergence between the US and Canada. Most Canadians live within 100 kilometres of the border between the two countries; as the weather makes living more northern undesirable. The US has lots of available land in places with a better climate than a lot of Canada. Sure, there's some highly desirable places to live in the US where prices have skyrocketed; but the scarcity of desirable land affects all of Canada and is not going to go away.
