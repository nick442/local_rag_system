This could also be solved thanks to an idea Tesla had at the beginning of the Roadster era, but never went through it because they could never get it reliable enough. If you can build a transmission that can stand up to the high torque from no RPM that an electric motor provides, then that solves the problem. Obviously easier said than done, but it's not a fault with an electric motor itself, it's that they're all running on a 1 speed transmission
