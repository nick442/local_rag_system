I'm a seller of large items on Amazon. Had a customer buy and return the item because he ordered the wrong size shelf. Shipped it back damaged, full refund for the buyer, amazon refused to even take my claim seriously. cost me hundreds, going to be closing my account if it happens again. Amazon is the worst seller marketplace out of all the ones I use. I'm not going to held hostage to their BS!
