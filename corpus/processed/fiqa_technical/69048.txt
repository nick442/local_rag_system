> help them save money I believe they should also focus on brand loyalty (PR), more than cutting costs. The whole FBI and Apple thing. the way Mr. Cook handled that, made me like Apple a whole lot more. Things like that can inspire loyalty. > A better quality control Also this. I rented Scarface, some random TV show and Batman Begins through Netflix's DVD service about a year and a half or two years ago. I ordered these DVDs at different intervals over these 2 years. And every single time the DVD was unwatchable. Scratched, skipping etc. I'm not bashing Netflix, I have no idea what it takes to pull off what they do. But still. I don't believe Netflix can justify raising prices. I'm pessimistic about Netflix as a company to be honest. I just don't see them lasting longer than say Blockbuster did. Blockbuster 2.0 2042, i'm calling it now. *** **EDIT: Like with Netflix, they have virtually no competition in the DVD-in-the-mail thing. Amazon tried. Blockbuster tried. But we all know Netflix pioneered it. They have an *edge*. I don't understand why they don't focus in on what got them to where they are now,** **Instead of making TV shows no one really cares about or having another Adam Sandler Shows that no one likes.** **How many times have you heard a 23 or 24 year old go on social media and praise a Netflix show beyond Orange Is The New Black, Breaking Bad or Weeds?**
