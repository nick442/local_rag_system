"Yes, it is indeed hard to get out of poverty. But for the people that do, and sacrifice it all in order to make a better life for their children, would you then tax them so their children have to start over at nothing again? That sounds like incentivising poverty again, and it doesn't actually fix anything. If unemployment benefits and higher taxes are the problems keeping people in poverty, I don't see how the solution should be to tax more so that we can what.. have more benefits programs that incentivise poverty? It feels good to demonize the ""rich"" because we all can participate. The homeless can blame the $40k income can blame the $250k income can blame the $1M income can blame the %1. Because they have more stuff than we do. But taking that stuff away doesn't increase the standard of living for anyone, it actually makes it more difficult for everyone."
