Have a look at the reviews of the New York Times on the kindle: http://www.amazon.com/The-New-York-Times/dp/B000GFK7L6 In summary: Many of the stories are missing, it costs $27.99 per month, maximum of one photo per story - all charts and graphs are omitted. All in all, I wouldn't buy it. (For reference, I subscribe to the weekly Science journal for $50 per year.)
