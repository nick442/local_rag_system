>I said all that to say that you are correct in assuming I blame the socialist disproportionately, but I think this blame is justified. If they didn't have such an irrational/ignorate fear of the free market we wouldn't have such complex, unfair set of rules that tend to hurt the most disadvantaged in our society most. There wasn't a regulation that was causing insurance companies to not cover people with pre-existing conditions. That was a decision the market made based on a strict economic basis. I think liberals are right to want to protect people that aren't profitable customers.. the market isn't interested in them. That is why many liberals do not see the market as a viable solution, especially when you are talking about healthcare.
