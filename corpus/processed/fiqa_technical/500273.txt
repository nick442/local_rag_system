"ok so now I am not sure which defecit we are talking about. I was talking about the budget defecit. In reference to that, check out Koo's ""the holy grail of macroeconomics"". He details during the Japanese recession exactly the effects of stimulus and austerity (they tried both) and how they affected tax revenues and the national debt. Long story short, stimulus increased revenues which as a net closed the budget defecit, while austerity was so devastating to the economy that it increased the budget defecit (the cuts in spending were smaller than the loss in tax revenue which resulted). When you say ""years prior of stimilus"" I think you are referring to tax cuts? I do not think that tax cuts count as ""stimulus"". Right now I think increasing taxes would force businesses to hire and would be more stimulative than tax cuts. The current account defecit is a result of free trade and cheap labor overseas."
