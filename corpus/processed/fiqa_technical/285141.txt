Is this true? Yes. Do student loan companies provide predatory lending practices? It appears some do. Does anyone force a student or family to sign the dotted line on their student loans entrapping them in many tough financial years? No. People want to blame others for their problems far too often. How about cash flowing a cheap community college? How about applying for HUNDREDS (yes I said multiple hundreds) of scholarships? How about saving from the age you're able to work until college? How about not picking the most expensive out of state education just because you saw them playing a sports game on ESPN? This system is a mess, I don't disagree there. I think all of this reverts back to the signers of these loans. Plus when people are in massive student loan debt they don't fully commit to getting out of it and working every job possible.
