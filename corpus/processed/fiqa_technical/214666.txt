"I've seen many Redditors school you on this over the years, and I'm not the least bit surprised you're trying it with me. There are several first world countries with suicide rates higher than the US that have much more strict gun control than the US. I'll take you back to your false claim that started this latest bit of trolling from you: *""Gang violence makes up a relatively small portion of of gun violence""* To make that lie even worse, you're only referring to deaths. Your lie gets much much worse when gang/gun stats include drive-by's, assaults, robberies, shootings, and rapes that didn't just involve death. I mean, I know you're rather slow, but do you honestly believe if it doesn't involve a death, it doesn't qualify as violence?"
