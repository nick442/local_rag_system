"If I was in your shoes I would have some term insurance, and it is pretty darn cheap at your age. Your wife is dependent upon your income, and it will take sometime to transition from non-working to working. As she could probably get a job doing anything, it will probably take many years to build up to the lifestyle she is accustomed. She may never be able to obtain your salary. While she could spend down the amount you two have saved up for retirement, tax will have to be paid on any non-ROTH contributions. The decisions for this have to be made within a year of death and are not easy. I would not want to put my spouse through this. Plus some day she would have to retire. If she spends down a significant portion of the savings you have built, well that will need to be replenished and you probably know time is not on one's side when it comes to compounding. Do you have to have 10x-15x times your earnings in insurance? No. Do you need to do a 20 year level term, No. Perhaps a 10 year level term for like 5x your income. Just something to ""bridge the gap"". If you live, you will be much better off financially, and could probably drop the coverage. If you don't you will not leave her sad and with difficult financial decisions; just sad."
