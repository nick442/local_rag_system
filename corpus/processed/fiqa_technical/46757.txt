>Lack of demand? There is no such thing as a lack of demand. People will always demand stuff they want and need. Lack of purchasing power. You get laid off from your job. Does that mean everything you used to purchase is now overly inflated and misallocated? No. Yet the *demand* for those things just went down because you have no money. Multiply times many millions and you get a self-reinforcing shortfall in aggregate demand. Capacity to produce can't meet desire to consume for systemic lack of money.
