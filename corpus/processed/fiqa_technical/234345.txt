Well, it's just a press release, but: > In July 2012, NantWorks’ scientific team (Five3 Genomics – http://www.Five3Genomics.com) collected 6,017 tumor and germline exomes, representing 3,022 cancer patients with 19 unique cancer types. The sample collection included: 999 breast cancer; 1,156 kidney and bladder cancer; 985 gastrointestinal cancer; 744 brain cancer; 745 lung cancer; 670 ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancer; 436 head and neck cancer; 177 prostate cancer; 70 melanoma cancer; and 35 blood tumor samples. > This massive amount of data totaled 96,512 gigabytes and was successfully transferred and processed via our supercomputing, high-speed fiber network in 69 hours. This overall transfer speed represents a stream of one sample every 17.4 seconds, and the supercomputer analysis for genetic and protein alterations between the tumor and normal sample completed every 47 seconds per patient.
