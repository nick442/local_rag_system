You should be able to live if you're working 40 hours per week. All of your links were to a 15$ minimum wage. I clearly stated I was against a $15 minimum wage and instead should increase the wage based off median rent within the state and other factors. Econ 101. You think at the margins. a $4.50 cent reduction (lets say the minimum wage is 10.50) would have far less consequences than $15, especially when it concerns millions of people. Because you know, 78.2 million people in America earn hourly wage. Your reply to my citations, once again mention $15 minimum wages, which I'm vehemently against as I stated. Your restaurant link is also context-less. Your ignoring that most waiters,waitresses aren't paid salary at all. So your jumping from close to zero labor cost to 15. Which, once again I stated I was against. Restuarants are also an outlier, because I don't know too many business model's that pass labor cost on to customers. Succinctly, the minimum wage was employed when Americans had trouble finding housing, food and other basic necessities. (https://www.laborlawcenter.com/education-center/purpose-of-minimum-wage/). A home, food, utilities, are ALL necessities. Combined with the fact that the minimum wage used to support families, I will absolutely argue that it was it's intended purpose. Trigger warning?: I have both parents. They love me very much and have sent me and both my brothers to major schools. It doesn't trigger me. Your just an asshole because if this woman was raped, it's not poor decision making. Nah, your right, she should've stayed with her abuser. No Edit Needed: Did you even read my reply? I'm going to guess you skimmed it and replied to the few points you barely read with things you already believe. Poor /u/thewaywardsaint making poor choices in responding and looking like an asshole while not replying to any points. It must suck.
