I mostly volunteer within a church environment. Given this is reddit, I'm not sure how that comment will fair. But I also see a lot of workshops via networking sites; linkedin has one called 'Financial Culture | Financial Literacy', between the articles and financial counseling workshops in the area I live it would be pretty easy to get involved. Also, START FOLLOWING COMPANIES on linked in. Join groups that are related to what you want to do, they post items all the time about relevant news to their industry. The more educated you can get the better.
