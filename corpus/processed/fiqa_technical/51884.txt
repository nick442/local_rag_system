"You've been taking the RMDs. Each year the RMD is calculated by taking the prior 12/31 balance and dividing by the divisor, calculated when you inherited, and dropping by 1 each year. Some great trades and your account balance goes up. That's great, but of course it sends the next RMD higher. I'd understand how marginal rates work and use the withdrawal to ""top off"" your current bracket. This will help slow the growth and runaway RMD increases."
