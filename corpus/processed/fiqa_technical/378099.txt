what i dont get is that the debt actually went down for once and not up and people seem to be unhappy about it because it was under trumps administration. People need to get this in their heads that this is a win for the people. The nation is so split apart that when something positive it is meet with negativity. Who care if trump did it or not. IT WENT DOWN thank jesus,buddha or tom cruise who ever but it went down.
