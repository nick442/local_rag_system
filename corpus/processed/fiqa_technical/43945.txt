">Thank you LW. Some of the crime is committed without violence, but if the sheep ever complain, then the violence is right there to put the boot on their necks. I would venture to say that far from ""some"", in fact the lion's share of crime is committed without (any apparent) violence (it also goes unprosecuted). Overt (obvious/apparent) violence is the hallmark of the ""petty thief"" and the ""petty criminal"" -- it is a path of desperation that normally only yields trivial sums. Bernie Madoff was a far more successful criminal than Bonnie & Clyde; and the impact of his crimes was significantly higher and broader -- but he used ZERO violence, and naught but fraud. And yet Bernie Madoff was a *piker* compared to the REAL criminal masterminds. >Fraud that is backed up by violence is violence. Yes, I wouldn't dispute that.. but very often the ""violence"" (or even the threat thereof) is almost entirely non-obvious (again Cf Madoff, Enron, WorldCom, and a host of others.. ). And the of course there are the government-based scams/schemes (which are significantly MORE profitable, and generally ""stable"" and non-risky for the participants -- heck, fractional reserve banking is {and always was} nothing more than a fraud {ala ""stone soup""}, and yet the risk {especially of prosecution} is virtually zero.)"
