By your own logic this may not work. Tax cuts which are matched by government spending cuts will have an immediate negative effect on the economy as government spending contributes a very sizeable chunk of the GDP and employs a not at all insignificant workforce. Thus for the net total economic growth to compensate at the very least that entire tax cuts has to be spent in the economy preferably in sectors where the income velocity of money is the highest. Income velocity has often been proven to be the highest among the low income sections while the lowest among the high income sections. For example if the corporate tax cuts is just invested as share buybacks the net velocity is tiny even though share prices will increase. What proof do you really have that this will not be case? Let alone 35 years, even recent data has shown that increasing the monetary supply to corporate America does not really translate to sustained GDP growth as the money velocity remains abysmal. This has been demonstrated both on a state level in Kansas, and in a slightly different way at the federal level through our experience with quantitative easing.
