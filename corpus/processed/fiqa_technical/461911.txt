"> But You can't call it capitalism currently when the government makes laws that's kills competition in my post i am specifically referring to ""unbridled capitalism"" -- otherwise known as crony capitalism -- this is what all other forms of capitalism will grow into if you don't keep close controls over free enterprise. the US is a crony capitalist society - one where very few people (the leaders of big businesses and the elite) get to call the shots. the corrupt FDA that we have is the consequence of unchecked capitalism. it slippery slope began in the mid 70's with the powell memorandum ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_F._Powell_Jr.#Powell_Memorandum ), which put an end to the prosperity-for-all of the 50's and 60's and replaced it with prosperity-for-the-rich that we have today. the laws that our current government makes are a direct result of the evolution of capitalism. other western countries are eroding slower, but will soon enough decompose into the shithole that we have in america, such as : (i) the federal reserve and a financial system privately owned by a handful of bankers, (ii) the military industrial complex which now sucks nearly half of all our federal taxes to maintain, (iii) the medical cabal which limits competition and charges anything it wants to, (iv) a highly privatized education system that now enslaves our youth to a lifetime of repayments, (v) a privatized prison and border security system which makes profits from picking on the poor, etc, etc, etc"
