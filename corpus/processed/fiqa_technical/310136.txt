California is very aggressive about enforcing LLC franchise taxes. The only correction I'd make to Kekito's answer is that the fee is $800 minimum or some percentage of the LLC's total business volume in the state. What's killer about it is that the tax is dependent not on what your LLC's profit is, but what its revenues are! Here's a good link explaining how the tax is calculated: California LLC Franchise Tax Rates Be very careful about making sure you comply with every dot in the California codes or else you really won't like what happens. It's one of the reasons so many companies avoid locating operations in California if at all possible. I hope this helps. Good luck!
