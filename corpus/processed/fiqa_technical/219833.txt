You're saying I can substitute my 2-week for dailies and wear the dailies for a month? That would be 5-10x cheaper (i buy from visiondirect) depending on if i decide to use the dailies for 2 weeks or 4 weeks (a month). Why haven't I heard of this? Is there any reputable source that can confirm that dailies are built exactly the same as monthly contacts?
