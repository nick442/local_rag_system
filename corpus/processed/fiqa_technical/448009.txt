I'm not sure if you have listened to what people are talking about in california, but *everyone* has their sacred cow. They say that nothing can be cut. The fact is if you have no money then the best thing to do is cut something from every single program. You hurt the future generations more by given them unsustainable debt than cutting these programs.
