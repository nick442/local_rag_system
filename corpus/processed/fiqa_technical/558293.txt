I can assure you after seeing both versions of Layer Barns (Free Range and Industrial) I wouldn't eat anything free range. The industrial setup has more square feet per bird. Poop gets dried and shipped out of pens quick and eggs roll down hill to a conveyer. The other version is people picking eggs out of bird shit all day.
