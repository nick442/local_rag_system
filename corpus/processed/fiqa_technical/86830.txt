"That's a very good point, but advertising inevitably gets out of control and consumers end up hating it, which is why we see things like DVRs with their ""ad skipping"" technologies emerging in the marketplace and being hugely popular amongst consumers. People hate ads, even tho they want them in small amounts. People who live ad free lives, as I do, learn about products through the recommendations of friends, or through very filtered means such as user groups where someone says ""Hey guys I found this neat widget, check it out"". You could argue ""that's advertising"" and semantically you might be right, but we're speaking specifically about paid ads that Widget Company A pays Social Media Company B to place on their website, and similar models. All of that is going away just as fast as the technology makes it possible to eliminate it with or without the approval of either company. Consumers hate ads and love ad blockers. To understand whats happening you need to appreciate just how young ""ad blocking"" technology is. It's only existed a very short while and has already decimated the internet to the point that various websites have gone bankrupt. Nobody as big as Facebook (yet), but large popular magazines and newspapers have been really struggling. And the tech is in it's infancy, as it matures it will cause more shake-ups."
