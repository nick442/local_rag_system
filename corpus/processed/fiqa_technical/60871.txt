Funny, I warned everyone on Reddit to short Facebook before the IPO - [MULTIPLE TIMES](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/txj48/facebook_stock_down_by_10_in_15_minutes_of/c4qo194) - and no one wrote a USA Today article about me. In fact, before the stock tanked, I had 100% downvotes from all you honest Redditors..
