Have you checked out merchresearch.com? Also, there are some Chrome add-ons that show the BSR (best seller rating). I'm not at my laptop to give you those right now, but Texas Gal Treasures on YouTube always goes through them on her streams where she designs a shirt start to finish. Hope this helps!
