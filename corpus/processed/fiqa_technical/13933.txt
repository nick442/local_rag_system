Our group leader was very interested in the Amazon Go concept which got us thinking about that as a potential deal. While writing the paper I found some articles discussing Whole Foods Amazon potential merger from last year, but it seemed unlikely since the companies had a sit down last year and it didn't amount to anything. Obviously Amazon thought this was a good target then so it was known at the time. However, we didn't think the deal was back on the table. Recent mentions of the possible deal didn't come out until a few weeks after we started writing our paper.
