Obviously, it varies from place to place, dependent on factors such as, say, what rent/public transportation costs in whatever city your business is located in, but, overall, i'd say 15-25$ an hour should cut it, at least, for the average American. That's about $600-$1000 dollars a week, $3000-$5000 a month, assuming you're working 40-hour weeks. Of course, my ideal scenario would be UBI but that's a whole other thing.
