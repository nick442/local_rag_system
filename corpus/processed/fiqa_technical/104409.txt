"Whole Foods quality standards will always make them the best option for strictly healthy food. Whole Foods biggest flaw is not advertising why they are healthier so many people believe that Trader Joe's and the ""healthy"" selections at other grocery stores are just the same at a lower price. In a few cases this may be true but most products at these stores are no different than the name brand products, they just have a ""healthy"" looking label. Whole Foods just got the ""whole paycheck"" stigma early on and rather than explain why their prices are higher, they just let it be. Ultimately I think Whole Foods hit a wall with their customer base and since they continue to open stores faster than they can get new customers, the same store sales have been steadily declining. Introduce competition with lower prices as well and Whole Foods was sent reeling. Also the stock has been consistently trading over the buyout price per share since the announcement meaning the market is even saying that the price was too low and that Amazon got a great deal. I'm interested to see if the speculation of a bidding war will actually commence."
