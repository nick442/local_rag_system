"Keep in mind that a *lot* of ""news"" content is wholly written by PR people on behalf of organizations and handed over to editorial departments for publishing. It's not the worst thing. News outlets get free content, the organization gets exposure, and we get more content to read that doesn't cost us or the publisher anything. Only problem is that sometimes you get an article like this one that's a little obvious with the praise for a given brand."
