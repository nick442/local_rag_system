I really wanted to like SoundCloud. I tried to like it, and for a while I did like it, was considering to upgrade to the paid platform. Then I discovered the Google audio cast simply did nto work on many musical tracks, for no apparent reason. Sometimes they would work one day, and not the next. That is fine, I figured it was some kind of retarded DRM on the platform given over to the creators. I'm fine with that, but the way the bug works is it doesn't just skip the track blocked on Google chrome audio cast, it just gets stuck. Fuck it, I switched to Google play audio, via YouTube red. No stupid chrome cast drama, which BTW.. could easily be circumvented by connecting an audio cable or using Bluetooth remote audio, it's just more convenient to use chrome cast.
