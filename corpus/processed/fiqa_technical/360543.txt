CNC machining is used in manufacturing both metal and plastic parts. It is a robust and cost effective method to create prototype from actual production grade materials of plastic (ABS, PC, PP, POM, PMMA, PBT, Nylon, PEEK, PVC etc.) and metals & alloys (Aluminum, Magnesium, Brass, Copper, Bronze, Mild Steel, Tool Steel, Tungsten and Titanium.)
