Sure you can, esp if you are creating a special class of unsecured creditor. Its going to piss off businesses and add an additional factor when validating the credit-worthiness (thus credit does cost a bit more) of a company but that may not be a bad thing considering that screwing over your employees for some cash should be more of a black mark than it is.
