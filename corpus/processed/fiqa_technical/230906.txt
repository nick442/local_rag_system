"Guess the military doesn't get those sweet, sweet OT bucks. Seriously, though. This is what happens when departments are stupid and don't hire the people they need. Having said that, I'm pretty okay that some SWAT guy gets more than an executive manager. When an executive ""takes a hit"", it's because their pet project overran the budget. When a SWAT officer ""takes a hit"" they end up in the ICU. Plus, as is the case with firefighters, it's not exactly a job that you can do for a long time. There's a period of physical fitness that you can only stretch for so long, and the nature of the job tends to mean that injuries are very likely to suddenly terminate your ability to perform your job. Got to get your retirement covered while you can."
