I have trouble getting into the Prime original stuff. It is in no small part that they refuse to just let me stream shit on my chromecast. I have to stream it through my Tivo, which in theory should be no big deal, but usually, means an inconsistent and often shitty experience. I know they want me to use their competing Fire Stick thing, but.. no. Then the actual content usually seems to be slow moving drama. I watched several episodes of Man in the High Castle (during my multi-year checks of Prime content) and was bored even just having it on while doing other stuff. I just saw that they have The Tick. It might be time to check on their line-up again. Relative to Netflix, I don't feel like Prime holds up. It is more obnoxious to watch (finding the content seems tougher in addition to the device limitation), and the content is meh. That said, we love Prime. We are ordering stuff sometimes multiple times a week so the free and fast shipping is much used and loved. I even signed up for the Unlimited ebooks thing because I read tons of shitty novels that even at 1-5 dollars a pop were adding up to over $10 a month.
