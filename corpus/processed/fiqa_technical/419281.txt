That's true, it definitely depends on the ambient temperature. The dew point is the temp at which water condenses (or evaporates, depending on which way your going on the scale) and is dependent on the relative humidity. When relative humidity goes up, the dew point goes up. As long as your external body temp (skin temp) is higher than the dew point, the sweat will evaporate. Bjartr mentioned the heat index being 102°F. This would mean you'd have to get your skin temp higher than 102°F which would mean your core temp is even higher (dangerously high). This is one of the major advantages of moisture-wicking clothing. It removes the sweat from your skin when evaporation isn't good enough and helps cool you faster.
