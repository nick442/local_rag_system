You can do a bunch of sales if you price your product too low to make any money. Lots of sales, not much revenue. Kind of like what Square is going through right now. Now if you do a lot of sales at a good price, leading to good revenue and cash flow, THEN you are winning. EDIT: Before people get pedantic over my Square analogy, yes, I know they are making a lot of revenue but their margins are incredibly thin and the bulk of their revenue goes immediately to Visa/MC etc so the analogy still works. Lots of sales, not much green.
