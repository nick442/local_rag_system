If I was an upside down homeowner and I went to my bank to refinance the mortgage at a lower rate and they declined, I'd give them the middle finger by not paying the mortgage and declaring bankruptcy. A homeowner has no incentive to continue paying a mortgage for a home that is no longer the value of the mortgage and if the bank is unwilling to work with the upside down homeowner to get the home owner a lower interest rate (that is the least the bank could do) - then make the home the bank's problem and let them eat their cake. This home owner is not asking the bank to forgive part of the mortgage or write it off, but asking for his mortgage to be refinanced at the lower rate - that is pretty straight forward and simple. We as taxpayers bailed the banks out in 2008, the least they could do is help upside down homeowners. The banks reluctance to help upside down homeowners is why we have a stagnant housing market. **The bank by not working with this home owner to refinance his mortgage at a lower interest rate is a bank that indicates they don't care about having a paying customer.**
