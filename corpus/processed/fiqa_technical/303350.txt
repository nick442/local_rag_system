It's basic financial responsibility. If you can't afford the risk of something, either don't do it- or pay the consequences. The risk of unsafe sex was children. She couldn't afford that risk, much less two of them, so now she is paying for her actions. She was a perfectly capable adult with the ability to make decisions and you think since she is in a crappy situation, it is somehow not her fault.
