I don't know. I like his attitude. Why not try weird stuff? I went to a Star Trek convention just for fun to see what it was like. Not my thing but I loved the experience. Same with a convention for restaurant supplies. Travel whenever I can and try to stay in the weird hotels. I'd probably try this service too, just to say I did.
