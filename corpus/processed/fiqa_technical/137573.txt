I have a Surface RT and I am pretty happy with it. Not sure what you mean by 'not compatible', considering I use googledrive and onedrive to transfer my D&D PDF's and Inventory Excel sheets and Spellbook Word files between it and my Win7 Desktop. It's entirely compatible, you just can't install .exe applications. Which, I grant you, is frustrating when it's just so close to a full system. But it's way more compatible with my desktop than an ipad or android. Also, the Surface RT and Surface Pro both released at the same time. I will grant you that was a marketing mistake, and they should have had a more obvious name difference because one is a full fledged computer in tablet form, and the other is a hybrid.
