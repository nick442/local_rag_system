What a bunch of idiots, I worked for Lowe's and their entire computer backend is ancient as fuck and a huge mess. I don't know if they still do it but before I left they bought a shit ton of iphones for basically scanning a product's tag so it can show you the product in front of you, only now on an iphone screen. They basically were trying to force you to use these iphones but they didn't really have a purpose, they did what we already did only now with an extra layer of obfuscation. And then once you were done with the phone if you had to do any kind of ordering or lookup you had to get on the computer anyways and enter all your shit into their ancient backend anyways. Product counts were never even reliable, someone always fucked something at some point in time so it might be accurate, it might say you have -2 products, it might say you have 3 products when the store only stocks one at a time. Plus all the crazy stupid shit they make employees do on computers, or take shitty tests to learn about what you are selling, except you have been selling those products you are just now suppose to be learning about for the past 6 months already.
