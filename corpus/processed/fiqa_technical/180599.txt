"I seriously didn't. Scout's honor. You are reading into what I wrote. I was really surprised, not ""blowing a gasket."" If I got pissed every time I got referred to as ""he,"" I would have had a billion heart attacks by now. ""I had this experience in b-school"" ""That's everywhere, not just in b-school"" <-- not a rebuttal, an addition Pretty sure this is about perspective. See, I wasn't really replying to you, I was writing in relation to what you said for the benefit of everybody else readingâ€¦ just like I argue in the other comments, not for me (cuz I don't really care what strangers on the internet think about me) but for the silent lurkers who otherwise would see that crap go uncontested. If you assume a reply is definitely just for you, I can see why you'd think I was railing on you. But I wasn't, and I'm sorry it seemed that way."
