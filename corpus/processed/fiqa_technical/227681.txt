Number one sounds a bit like how are you going to help me. Your primary focus should be how I am going to help you. One things that turns me off as an employer are questions about how much time you will have off, how much training will you get, etc. No benefit related questions, you usually get an opportunity to talk to hr. I'd recommend generalizing number 4, something along the lines of - is the company focusing on new (ideas, focus areas)? What ever is relevant for the position.
