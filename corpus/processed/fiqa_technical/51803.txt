3G capital is one of the major holding companies of Heinz. They own (co-own) many major bands, such as Burger King. They are known for completely gutting the core values these companies were built on. All the matters to them is cost cutting (often food/product quality, salaries, wages, benefits, company perks, company celebrations, etc). They promote a zero based budget meaning every organizational expense is tirelessly scrutinized in the search of slimmer costs to increase profit. They embody all the is wrong with capitalism when it comes to society-at-large. So how does this guy play into it? They are also known for promoting their young employees quickly. It effectively allows them to pay young employees less for more work. I know first hand, it creates a culture of young people working long hours for low pay with the hopes of being the next rising star. People like this 29 year old CFO may be compensated well, but likely has most of the compensation held in bonuses for short-term results. The result is very quick employee burnout and turnover, and zero work-life balance. All i can say to finish this rant off is that in the short-term, the system 3G is putting into place for the companies they are absorbing is effective for trimming costs and increasing profits for shareholders. Long-term, the low pay, long hours, and zero family values is and drain on society. They are a cancer in the business world. Read some articles about their takeovers of Heinz, Burger King, Tim Hortons. Their treatment of employees is horrific, again I've seen it first hand. Head over to /r/Canada and read how Canadians now view the products and values of their once beloved Tim Hortons.
