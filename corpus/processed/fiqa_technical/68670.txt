"Ok sure, your homeowners insurance now includes all those things. Floods, hurricanes, terrorism.. its also now twice the price. You're on /r/finance, not /r/politics. You should understand that you pay a premium for every risk that you off-lay. It is well known that basic homeowners insurance does not cover floods. If you want it, you can get it. Most people in a non flood-prone area will say, ""I'm willing to take that risk, I'll save $500/yr and not get it"". Would you rather the government just force you to get it? You just complained about Auto Insurance ""forcing"" you to get uninsured driving insurance. You can't have it both ways."
