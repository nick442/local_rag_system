"? You have no idea what school I am talking about. In my hometown, a child getting accepted into U of Illinois was one of the proudest moments in a parents life. I didn't get accepted into UI, but eventually I got accepted into a respectable school. I deal with people like that other commenter all the time. It's an epidemic. Why would I care to read his rude comments on Afghanistan when I have read books on the subject and been in the theater? What, realistically, am I missing by engaging with him and putting up with his attitude? And then there's you. A brief view of your history shows me your school, your program, your lavish vacation, your frequent flyer tier as a freshman in college.. Honestly, I'm excruciatingly jealous. So I hope you forgive me for my ""waving"" my pedigree of trying to be the first person in my broke-ass farm family to actually get a degree, but then getting beat out by my little sister because my mom could afford her college while I had to find a way to have Uncle Sam pay for mine."
