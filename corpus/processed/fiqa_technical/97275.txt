That's an important number when considering rent vs home ownership. If you own a home, you are much less likely to move for a better job, because of all the material and emotional investment into the house. So that 50% of salary difference (about $2000 a month if we take average salary of $48k), should be added to the monthly mortgage bill when comparing it to the rent.
