"> H1B's have a skillset that the locals do not. Like ""working for 20% less than market rate"" I've seen H-1Bs hired for a LOT of jobs that could easily be filled locally. The problem is that since the local folks have put in the time and effort to build their skillset and gain expertise, they have higher salary expectations than management wants to pay. H-1Bs were designed for very niche or specialized or advanced expertise, not ""Journeyman level web designer who knows Angular.js"""
