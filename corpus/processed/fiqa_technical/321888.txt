That is absolute madness. The repercussions of that are, I believe, not being properly factored into your calculation. If I'm an entry level employee, and I have lots of kids, I may receive fairly generous public dollars. If I have no kids, I won't. Is your solution to pay all entry level employees more, or just to pay people who have kids more? Neither of these is without consequence.
