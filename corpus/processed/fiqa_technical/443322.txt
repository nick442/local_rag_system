Love blaming other people instead people taking responsibility themselves. Doctors prescribe these drugs because people want relief from pain. Doctors are measured by patients' feedback on pain level. Unless you have lived under a rock for the past 30 years, you know that these pain relievers are addicting. It is each person's own responsibility to fill the Rx.. the doctors do not force anyone to take these drugs.
