>You were an unsecured creditor. Yes, but his situation was more complicated than your run of the mill unsecured creditor. He had a trading account. It may very well have been technically *structured*, for accounting purposes, as unsecured credit - but the reasonable assumption for the average person is that trading/deposit accounts are held in trust rather than as individual investments/grants which the company can use how it pleases with just the promise to pay you back later. Now, granted, somebody with a Refco forex account should be sophisticated enough to understand the difference - but that doesn't change the fact that even such investors might normally just assume that their accounts are being sequestered. It would make the most sense. It sounds to me like Refco's accountants, and everybody involved in the process, were thieving scumbags.
