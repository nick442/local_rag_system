A cheque/check is just a piece of paper. There's nothing whatsoever stopping her from sticking it in an envelope, putting a stamp on it and sending it via the regular post. The important question is what happens if it goes astray? How easy would it be for her to stop and replace the check? How easy is it for a dishonest party to deposit the check elsewhere? It sounds like the people quoting you a high price to insure are treating the check as being as good as cash - if that's true then you'd be taking a big risk sending it uninsured. On the other hand if it's not true and the check is easily replaceable and essentially worthless to anyone other than you then there would seem to be no need to insure it in transit.
