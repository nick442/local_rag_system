I guess it is an effort vs. reward thing then. If you are born into the upper class you can put in 1% of the effort of someone who is lower class and get 10x the reward, including the fact you get to think that your position in the world is based solely on your efforts and nothing else, simply because you are surrounded by privilidged people who are all in the same situation. If you grew up rich you probably don't even know what work is. Of course everyone thinks nobody knows what hard work is by them. When I was a kid I used to think I knew, then I got to the real world.
