This works when you want to command and have others follow. Great for most businesses. If you want a workplace that generates ideas and inovation you or your hiring staff may not be the best at picking the best. I would say this is an extension of the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect. The best is a subjective judgement, dont forget.
