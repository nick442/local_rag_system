Anyone with a background in finance should have been well aware that the government would swoop in with a bailout of the major banks. Such a scenario was even discussed in money and banking textbooks pre financial crisis. Since I have no excess cash, and wad in senior year of college, I was unable to capitalize on that, but I did invest in the banks in market simulating games 😁
