The problem with this is that the advertising revenue doesn't justify it, and neither does the pay per channel. When Hulu starts making money, then it might be a possibility. Right now advertisers won't pay as much for a commercial on the internet that reaches the same number of viewers as it would on tv. Unfortunately, the cost doesn't match up to the benefit at the moment.
