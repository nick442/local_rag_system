I don't feel bad about this at all. I am actually surprised that the Sears near me has remained open as long as it has, and the K-Mart in a nearby city when I tried to pick up something from online purchasing was one of the oldest, creepiest looking stores I have been in in a while and was the biggest hassle of all time. I wrote them an email about my experience and surprise - they never got back to me.
