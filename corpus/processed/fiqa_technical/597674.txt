The problem is you need to take a more global and long term view. In order for us to achieve a post-scarcity & UBI enabled future we need to ensure that poverty globally is erased, and that people have a certain baseline quality of life and education. That wont happen without globalization, and as we are seeing with Trump - it doesnt take much for you to end up on the short end of the stick, so saying 'but me!' is a really bad perspective to take. Rather I'd advocate that when (not if) your job is automated or outsourced you consider yourself lucky that you have the option to retrain or work towards a future that enables UBI globally (which is the only way UBI works candidly).
