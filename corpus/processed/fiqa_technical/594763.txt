Their biggest problem is that their main industry is shipping. Anything they could do to their currency wouldn't help the shipping industry at all. They can't even raise taxes, they aren't the only convenience flag in the world and ships are obviously very easy to move out. The only industry they have that could get any benefit from a devaluation would be tourism, but that would be mostly negated by moving out of the euro.
