"> As far as Palestine is concerned, there is no justification for Apache helicopters and F-16s to bomb unarmed women and children, No kidding! Tell that to the ""Palestinians""! If ""Palestinians"" did not shoot 100s of missiles on Israeli civilians, women and children, then Israel would not shoot at them.. like now. Trust me: if Israel, with one of the best armies and most equiped armies in the world want to killd women and children, they could have done a much better ""job"". So, basically, you have no clue what you are talking about: ""Palestinians"", Israel, North Korea and 9/11."
