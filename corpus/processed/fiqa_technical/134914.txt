sure, and I'm happy they're getting paid more.. this is important work. people shouldn't have to scrape by just because it's not the most desirable career. but saying that increase in cost won't affect an increase in price and that average people will be better able to afford higher construction costs is misleading. just because construction workers have more money in their pockets, doesn't mean the average person will have more as well.
