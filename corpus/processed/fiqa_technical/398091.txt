Details, as usual, will depend on local culture and jurisdiction, but in most jurisdictions, there is generally no obligation for you to actively return something (money, parcel, whatever) you received in error - usually it's enough to notify the sender. Actually, it might be a dangerous mistake to return it yourself - what if you send it to the wrong account? So you probably have done all you had to, and can close your account without further delay. However, until the time specified by Statute of limitations or similar concept in your jurisdiction has passed (usually a few years), the company could ask you to return the money. If they do ask, be prepared to return it - so do not spend it. My recommendation would be: Then lean back and wait :-).
