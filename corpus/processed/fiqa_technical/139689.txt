My girlfriend works at the honest company and Jessica, like another used stated, is there quite regularly. The office space is an entirely open environment with Jessica's desk being in the middle of one large area. I visited the office last week for a company event and was very impressed with not only the layout of the office but the aesthetics and interior design work. Jessica was at this event and like all the founders, seemed very enthusiastic about the company they are running. I predict big things for The Honest Company.
