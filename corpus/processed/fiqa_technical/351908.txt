Been following ZH (less these days) for about a decade now, and rarely do they have good stuff with even that 10% being too gracious. I would peg it at about .5-1%. The USA should have collapsed oh about 30 times now, with gold being the world currency and all our ID's being imprinted on our arms, but hey maybe this time is the charm with Trump.
