Several states have compensation programs for victims of violence, and it's been around for decades. I got compensation through a Los Angeles program 35 years ago. Someone made a YSK post for the sake of anyone who was a victim of the Las Vegas shooting. Poor folks are covered through Medicaid, seniors and handicapped folks through Medicare.
