Limited government people never liked Trump, though they may consider him a lesser evil than Hillary. In any case, massive deficits are not a new thing, or a result of Trump's policies. They go back to Bush's presidency, and lasted all through Obama's years. Blaming Trump for something with a decade of inertia after ten months in office, while being opposed strongly, is just partisan nonsense. Trump got handed several wars, and a welfare state badly out of control. How is he supposed to fix that in 10 months? Why should we think Hillary would have if she was elected instead?
