"I doubt they'll be paying them anything, just like Google itself pays Wikipedia nothing for showing Wikipedia snippets in its result boxes. Wikipedia's license actually doesn't require any money to reuse it, and with things like data dumps and a public API, it actually encourages this. Of course then you have large companies leeching off of your hard-built volunteer project, but that's par for the course for open source in general and anything more restrictive would harm the exact people you're targeting (saying for example that ""companies with more than x employees must pay"" is actually something a lot of services do, but it's by definition not truly Free since it comes with restrictions). On your note about begging readers for donations, Wikipedia refuses to put up ads because that would force them into a conflict of interest (say large company A that is a large customer doesn't like how their article portrays them and threatens to pull their ads) You become beholden to whoever pays the bills, so it makes sense to ask readers to support the project. You might've heard some hogwash spreading around that Wikipedia already has enough money, but that's not true considering a prudent non-profit needs a sizable reserve to protect against fluctuations or disasters, and for long-term stability. Not to mention the project is nowhere near the size it started at and is still growing."
