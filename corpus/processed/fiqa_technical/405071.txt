"I currently use Mint for this, which I see that you have already disqualified but not why you have disqualified it. Set ""budgets"" for how much you want to spend on what type of expense, and then be sure to assign expenses to a budget as they come in. Mint actually learns what expenses go to each budget and eventually does it automatically."
