That's a really optimistic view of algorithmic trading and ML . ML is good at pattern recognition and finding new patterns (finding alpha), not at evaluating sources. The algorithms are programmed to only try to improve returns within a given risk tolerance; it does not care whether the information is fake or not. If anything, it behooves the people (quants) who design these algorithms to utilize fake data and enjoy a free lunch at the expense of dumb retail investors.
