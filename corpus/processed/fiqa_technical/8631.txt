Original concept originates from Marx - commodity fetishism. I believe Paul Bowles merely re-explained this concept with the examples of modern consumer devices. Marx goes on to argue that because we eliminate the perception of social relationships involved in production, we forget that an item holds subjective economic value, and henceforth transform items into those that hold intrinsic value of themselves.
