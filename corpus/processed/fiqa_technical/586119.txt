"Only a few ""prototypes"" were used in the big event on March 31, 2016, and in late July 2016 is when Elon announced the designs were ""pencils down"". People have tried to make comparisons between the photos of the Model 3 from the event last year and the photos taken of the vehicles spotted on the road the last 2-3 months, but we have nothing official to go from. I think they said they produced 50 vehicles since beginning of July and now: 30 were going to customers, and 20 were being used for ""testing and validation"". The vehicles shown in March 2016 were pretty much never seen again publicly. A few months ago, Model 3's were seen driving around the Fremont plant, often with a BMW 3-series behind it, since that's the car they're trying to compete against. These were the first ""production"" vehicles spotted, as they were most likely manufactured using the same process the delivery Model 3's would utilize, but they're not meant to be delivered to owners. The 30 that were delivered last night were from the first batch of 50 cars."
