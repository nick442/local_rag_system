This is the correct advice. If you aren't part of their recruiting network, AKA alum of a school they go to, you're odds are going to be very low. The only other path would be if you are basically top 5% of your profession skill wise. Normally this would mean an advanced degree, lots of work experience, etc. If you don't have an MBA with a finance focus, it seems unlikely to me that they would hire you for any finance related consulting. But computer engineering consulting seems reasonable. Based on the brief info you have given, I would say you need to figure out what they want, and then take the steps to accumulate those skills.
