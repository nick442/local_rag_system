"Cultural Marxism has nothing to do with Marxism, it's a misnomer. It's not even a real thing. He probably means the ""Frankfurt School"", which is a bastardized ""Marxism"" stripped of everything that makes Marxism *Marxism*. It is opposed to every Marxist state that ever existed or currently exists. It's a purely academic, useless philosophy that scooped out the organs of Marxism, tossed them aside, and put on its skin. In other words it has nothing to do with this article, since this article is about Marxism not the ""Frankfurt School""."
