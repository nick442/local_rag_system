Don't be ridiculous. Or in fact, lets be ridiculous for a second. Why can't a software developer make $500k? It's still only a fraction of what one of the executives make. Now, since realistically they won't get paid as much as you make it out to be, why is it so wrong for people to make a living wage? Why do we have to trumpet and pursue a race to the bottom in compensation? Why do you think that's ok? Is not fair for Americans and is not fair for the foreigners that are forced to come all the way to drive prices down by flooding the worker supply. They deserve as much pay as the Americans they're replacing but because they are looking for the better life and pay that they don't get they have to settle for a sub par pittance. It's all just one sided. It's appalling that you can even pretend to be so indignant about it.
