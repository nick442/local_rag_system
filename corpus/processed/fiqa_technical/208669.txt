Who you name as executor of your estate is to your judgment. If you feel that this friend will execute your wishes, then that's really all that matters. If your friend is your first choice, then name his wife as a back-up (in case something happens to him in the meantime). You can change your executor as long as you're fit to do so, so this isn't a forever decision if you have a falling-out.
