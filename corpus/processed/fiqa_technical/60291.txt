No but from what I remember, they didn't label this pink slim at all when they sold it. The example I gave is from a recent one as from what I remember about this, they were tossing meat in a dryer with ammonia to break down scraps to re-purpose later. They weren't required to label anything they sold as what they did and it was misleading to consumers and many people wouldn't approve of the process they used to obtain the meat. It's a lot like meat products bought in the US and being labeled as US products but the cattle is killed in the US, shipped to China for processing then back to the US for labeling and resale.
