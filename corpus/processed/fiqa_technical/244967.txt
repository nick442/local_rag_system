It just takes a decent power outage to make it worth having some cash on hand. It's possible that worse things can happen as well -- things that would shut the financial system down or cause bank runs. It is an assumption that you'll always be able to (a) access your money at your bank, either via teller transaction or ATM, and (b) pay with a debit card or credit card. If either (or both) of these abilities are taken away, you'll be glad you have some cash. The amount that you have on hand (how much you want to hedge against these possibilities) is up to you.
