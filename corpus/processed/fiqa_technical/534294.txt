> ..if we can't trust people to know what they want.. I'm not saying people don't know what they want. I am saying what people want is easy to influence and every large, successful company does so. > When you say that not being able to resist buying skittles is a serious problem, while there are still people living on the streets, I think you need some perspective. I think both problems have the same issues at their core -- what is best for corporate America is not always what is best for the greater good. > I'd wager that what you're seeing as you get older is the poverty trap.. No, what I see is that people solve problems as best they can with the tools they have learned. People make bad choices because they have an incomplete and/or bad assortment of tools to use. For example, someone might be worse off in life because he/she never learned the value of good organization skills. Another example is one person in a couple being unable to trust his/her partner because everyone before was untrustworthy. > ..which is caused by barriers to expanding earnings.. Just had to throw your primary assertion back in, didn't ya? /grin > I'd still like to know whether you believe you yourself need to be protected from these marketing practices.. I do believe I need protection from company marketing practices. I also believe I need protection from their products, influences on the market, environmental impacts, and employee treatment. FYI, I don't believe impulse buying racks at stores should be illegal but I do think it is a great illustration of how a company caters to needs that are different than our true innate needs.
