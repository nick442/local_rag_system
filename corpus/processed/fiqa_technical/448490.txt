Dark navy or medium gray suit. Black is for funeral or formal evening (tuxedo) only. Regardless of suit price, budget $75-$100 for tailoring. You need to have the waist of the coat adjusted, sleeves proper length and pants hemmed for it to all fit correctly. If you're in good shape I'd suggest Suit Supply instead of Brooks Bros - with the former catering to a more modern and generally younger clientele, still with excellent quality (comparably). Jos A Bank if you're really on a budget but do a little research on suit fit, button stance, lapel width, and pants break and taper before you go in because they'll sell you garbage if you don't know what you're talking about. /r/malefashionadvice has a good sidebar and wiki if you want more info.
