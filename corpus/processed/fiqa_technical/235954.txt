So fuck everyone else as long as America is OK? I can put words in your mouth too. People will always do anything they can to improve their own living, at all levels and in all places. I'm not for decreasing standards of living any more than I'm for drunk driving. I'm just saying if you want things to improve for you, you are the most capable and responsible for making it happen. Don't count on some nanny fixing your wages or your prices. Selfishness is built into the human psyche. Flying under the banner of public good doesn't change that one little but.
