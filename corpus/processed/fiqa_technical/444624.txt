I've been doing this exact thing for almost 2 years using the Amazon app. What I don't understand is why they came out with this new app which scans barcodes or pictures to show you items on Amazon? This is already in the Amazon app. They're basically identical apps, why are there two apps, can I get the discount in the primary app or should I uninstall that and use this identical app now?
