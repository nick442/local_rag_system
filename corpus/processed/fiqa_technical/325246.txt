>Not everything is about marginal utility and trying to define people by their marginal utility is almost sociopathic. This needs to be said more often. Walmart earned $4B this quarter yet they pay their employees slave wages. They could afford to pay every one of their employees an extra $3 per hour and still make huge profits. That's a 25% raise. Apple, to extend the comparison, earned $8B yet pay their contractors slave wages. Perhaps they should revise the ethics classes for business degrees and start teaching social responsibility as well.
