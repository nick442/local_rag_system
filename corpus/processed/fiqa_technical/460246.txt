"*While the politicians delay dealing with the stickier issues of immigration reform, surely they could get together on abolishing the limits on H1b visas for young educated foreign workers.* Yes, surely they could get together on abolishing the limits on H1b visas for YOUNG educated foreign workers and thereby throw even more older tech workers out of work. As you can see from the first graph and table at http://econdataus.com/h1binfo.htm , the top 11 users of H1b visas in 2013 were companies heavily involved in outsourcing. And as you can see from the third graph and table at http://econdataus.com/h1binfo.htm , over 80 percent of initial H-1B hires are under 35. Few of those high tech firms pushing to increase or abolish the limits on H1b visas even suggest that we need have any concern for U.S. workers. Perhaps workers and other citizens should reward those tech companies by giving them a taste of their own philosophy. Ignore any suggestion that we give any deference to tech products made in the U.S. and buy only foreign products. That will help build the foreign competition, giving those foreign workers places closer to home at which they can work. That may dry up the supply of cheap foreign labor and cause U.S. companies to treat their U.S. workers a little better. And, to paraphrase the pro-H1b philosophy, why should we buy a product made in the U.S. when a ""more qualified"" one is available from a foreign country?"
