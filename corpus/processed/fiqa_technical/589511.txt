To be 100% honest, im not american i dont know who Amway is, and i dont know how this conversation has heated up over a comment about another country. I dont even know what you're argueing? Are you saying what im saying is not true, or the more kids they have the less money they get. IDK.. but its happening everywhere in the UK.
