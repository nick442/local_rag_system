"Winnings are taxed in the year you receive payment. Period. Constructive requires an unqualified right to receive immediate payment. One qualification is that lottery tickets must be verified. Large winners usually have to wait a day or two, which voids the ""immediate payment"" clause. Here's an extreme example: If you don't cash the ticket until July after you've already filed your income taxes, is the state going to issue a retroactive W2G? That's kinda hard when the IRS requires that tax reporting be received by January 31st. Which year do you get to deduct the state income taxes paid/withheld? Benton"
