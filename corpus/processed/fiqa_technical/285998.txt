">It's more like, asshats never let the government really try to help these people. No, there are actually several inherent paradoxical effects of such ""assistance"" that actually tend to exacerbate the problem. >Welfare was reducing poverty up until the early 90's [..] Ummm.. no, it wasn't. From the University of Michigan's ""National Poverty Center"": >*In the late 1950s, the poverty rate for all Americans was 22.4 percent, or 39.5 million individuals. These numbers declined steadily throughout the 1960s, reaching a low of 11.1 percent, or 22.9 million individuals, in 1973. Over the next decade, the poverty rate fluctuated between 11.1 and 12.6 percent, but it began to rise steadily again in 1980. By 1983, the number of poor individuals had risen to 35.3 million individuals, or 15.2 percent.* [(Source)](http://www.npc.umich.edu/poverty/#3) Note that [LBJ's ""Great Society initiative"" and it's ""War On Poverty"" (aka the welfare system)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society#War_on_Poverty) were not [passed as legislation until near the end of 1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Opportunity_Act_of_1964) and really weren't rolled out (in their initial, limited form) until 2 years later (circa 1967) -- Nixon's administration (elected in the fall of 68 and taking office in early 1969) then *expanded* the programs to what is commonly thought of as the full ""welfare system"".. And that took effect in the early 1970's, about the time that the poverty levels actually QUIT descending (in fact they had already leveled off) and began INCREASING again. Now doubtless the inflation of the mid to late 1970's exacerbated the problem (said inflation chiefly due to the Nixon Shock of effectively ""defaulting"" by taking the dollar off the Gold standard -- a move that was NOT the result of some ""grand economic theoretical change"" but rather was something that HAD to occur due to the balance of payments crisis {foreign countries were cleaning out the US gold reserve bey demanding gold in exchange for the dollars that had been blatantly ""printed"" and spent by both LBJ and Nixon to pay for the welfare/warfare state}). But regardless, the point holds that the ""welfare system"" accomplished NOTHING as far as ""ending poverty"" (which WAS in fact it's purported aim) -- and in reality, it ENDED the steady long term *natural* reduction in poverty that HAD been ongoing for the post-depression decades (and the several decades prior to the depression era). >If you want to say welfare is a failure, you should really limit your data to periods where we were actually providing a realistic amount of aid to families and not the last 20 years If you want to claim that it actually REDUCES poverty, you should come up with SOME data (really ANY) that shows that.. because history (both in the US and elsewhere) shows that it simply and plainly doesn't. If you want to know the hows and whys .. I'd suggest you check into a fairly recent book entitled [""The Careless Society: Community And Its Counterfeits""](http://www.amazon.com/Careless-Society-Community-Its-Counterfeits/dp/0465091261) by John McKnight (a ""lefty"" disciple of people like Saul Alinsky) who is director of the Community Studies Program at the Center for Urban Affairs and Policy Research at Northwestern University (i.e. hardly a hotbed of ""conservatives""). >where we gave them an increasingly smaller share and wondered why they weren't getting ahead. Your correlation is misdirected. The chief reason for the ""flattening"" of wages has a lot MORE to do with economic fundamentals of monetary manipulation. (Look at any graph of wage growth.. you will see an almost DIRECT change right around the time the dollar went OFF the Gold standard.) The reasons this impacts the lower classes (lower AND middle class) significantly more than the upper class are (oversimplified, but still) essentially: 1) the lower and middle classes have to conduct business in the form of dollar-based contracts, and chiefly derive income via selling their labor (something that is not easily multiplied) -- IOW their potential revenue streams are limited, and their wages are set in terms of dollars (which are being steadily and regularly, often very significantly, debased via inflation); even when they DO achieve ""cost of living"" increases in pay (to purportedly ""make up"" for inflation), said increases *always LAG* the inflation (by definition). 2) While the lower classes *may* have some debt (basically mortgages) that *might* ""benefit"" from the inflation (via being able to pay off the debt in later ""debased"" dollars) -- because of the lag factor mentioned above, the benefit is essentially negated -- in addition, the lower classes are not ""leveraging"" debt for productive investment; they are instead carrying ""consumption"" debt. 3) Meanwhile, the upper class chiefly owns ASSETS, and increasingly under the ""fiat"" monetary system that has existed (in ""pure"" form since the fall 1971 Nixon ""shock""), they have leveraged that via easily available credit (on far better terms in the form of lower interest rates, often well BELOW the rate of inflation, thus every dollar borrowed actually INCREASES their holdings values); and so they gain increased control over productive assets, which they have (via the leverage) been able to multiply several times over. *The really SAD thing is that instead of comprehending what the REAL problems are, far too many people (like you sourbre) have been ""duped"" and tricked, and indoctrinated into looking for even MORE of the same things that have caused the worsening current situation.*"
