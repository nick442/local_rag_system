The Interest rate of 3% and 7.5% is for funds held in regular savings account that are denominated in Rupee. Moving these funds back to US will require compliance with Indian Foreign Exchange Act. If you are not intending to move funds back to US, then this would be good move. However you would still need to pay tax in US on the interest generated as personal tax in US requires one to pay tax on income world wide. As also pointed out by others, there is a risk of FX Conversion. The other option is to hold funds in NRE or USD denominated acounts where funds can be moved back to US without any hassel and are held in USD. However the interest rate on these accounts is similar to what one would get in US, slightly better at best. So you need to figure out if you need the funds back in US, then I guess keeping it in US would be a good move. However if you do not need the funds back in US, then moving it to India would make sense.
