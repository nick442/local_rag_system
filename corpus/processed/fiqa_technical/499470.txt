Why would you consider Amazon to have an anti-trust issue? Think about monopolies of the past - you didn't go to them because you wanted to, you went to them because you had no other choice.. With Amazon, you can you Google's cloud services or Walmart's ecommerce site, but you don't.. Why not? Because Amazon does it the best. You, the consumer, still have a choice.
