>What we couldn't give less of shit about and what would get you laughed out of a conference call: the person's life circumstances, their heating bill, their three kids, or anything not strictly related to their role. You don't give a shit about stressful conditions the employee may be in that strongly affect their ability and/or willingness to perform their role well? You're an idiot.
