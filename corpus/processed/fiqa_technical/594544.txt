"You don't understand our current system at all if you think people aren't making decisions for you. This is a false narrative pushed by insurance companies trying to get us back to the system that got us here. We spend the most & get the overall worst outcomes of any industrialized nation. ACA's failures were bullshit put in by the GOP & collusion by insurance companies and Republican governors. It wasn't perfect, but it would have been a helluva lot closer if the GOP hadn't lied and colluded through the process. Their 217 amendments were mostly garbage add-ons. I actually read it. Our military would be a ""failure"" if its funding was constantly threatened & fucked with and colluded against by government & private companies.
