>If you take your blinders off, you'll realize that multi-generational households are a common phenomenon worldwide. Yes, the world was very poor, things were supposed to change and people could live better lives, but now people live at home until 28 just to try and have a home of their own. And we argue that this is preferable, for some stupid reason. You did make a sound financial decision, in a warped, lopsided society that lets rich people get away with murder. Romney pays 14% of his income to taxes? pfft, this IS class warfare, and the lower and middle classes are losing. >The Italian side of my family did it back when they immigrated and it's becoming a trend yet again. Yes, average people are having to do this again, because the income gap in the US is as high as it has been in 100 years. It is not a natural phenomena, it is caused by changes in laws, taxes, etc. http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/who-killed-american-unions/258239/
