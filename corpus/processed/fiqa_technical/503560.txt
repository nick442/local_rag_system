The advantage of having a mortgage rather than borrowing money in other ways is that it is cheaper because the loan is secured against the value of the property. If you stop paying then the bank take the house and can sell it keeping what they are owed and returning any excess. If you have enough money to pay it off then you do not need the mortgage. They normally run for 25 years. It is a lovely day when finally you realise that you own the whole house and no longer owe anything to the bank and the charge against the house is removed and the record of it removed from the land registry. When you sell a house with a mortgage the buyer has to check that the bank has been paid off before they accept the property.
