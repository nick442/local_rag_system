> The ACA was objectively bad for healthcare/insurance companies. Citation needed. [In Rare Unity, Hospitals, Doctors and Insurers Criticize Health Bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/health/health-care-bill-criticisms.html?mcubz=0) Healthcare stocks have been performing just fine for the last 10 years. In Medicaid Expansion states, the healthcare exchanges have generally stabilized and are serving the public just fine. Health insurance prices have risen, but they were rising before the ACA as well. Obamacare wasn't designed to fail. It was designed to be a first attempt at delivering health insurance to all Americans. However, like every piece of sweeping legislation, it was probably going to need some legislative tweaks after a few years to address unforseen problems. They clearly didn't anticipate losing the Medicaid expansion in 25% of states, including many of the poorest, sickest, and most expensive to cover states. I am still baffled to this day how my own state legislature sleeps at night knowing that they're denying healthcare to our poorest and most vulnerable people because they would rather have some sort of political advantage.
