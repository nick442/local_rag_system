Yeah! We were super excited when we got approached by Armenia and Oman; I personally didn't know agriculture was so huge for them, but I guess it's most of their export. The philosophy we have, and have always had, is that we don't want to restrict the tech to just the US, we want to help farms all over the world! Of course, our pilots have been local to the LA area, but we're still fairly small; we can't send our whole install team across the world just yet lol. Soon!
