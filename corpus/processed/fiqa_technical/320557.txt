What your are talking about is price controls. The US of A has used price controls several times in the past. -1942 there was a maximum wage you could pay workers. So employers offered extra benefits such as medical and paid leave. -1971 to 1973 the Nixon administration set the price of gas. This helped cause an oil shortage. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis) -Today we see lots of price controls in the form of rent control. Not allowing rent prices to go up doesn't give incentive to housing developers to build more housing. The problem with prices controls is they don't tell consumers to stop consuming. Say if there is a war and the military need all the metal it can get. By allowing the price of cars and other metal products to go up in price. The people will not buy as many cars and fix up what they have freeing up metal to be used on tanks. Also the metal producers will make more money from higher prices and re-invest their profits to make more metal for tanks and a very few expensive cars. But if prices did not increase the people will buy cars like normal and the government will try to used up the metal on tanks. The price of metal is the same so metal producers won't make much extra profit as such won't be able to re-invest in expanding their production. The biggest example of price fixing was the Soviet Union. But if we look just under the hood there was long lines and shortages all throughout the Soviet Union. As Soviet planners tried to make prices correct for each product based on many number of variables such as man-hours and individualsâ€™ needs. But no mathematical equation seemed to work. The Soviets gave up and used the prices out of the sears catalog for some products like shoes. If you want to good read on the subject this is a really good article.
