The momentum is there and seems unstoppable with the Europeans, US and Asian car makers going all electric and a stop to gasoline & diesel fuel on the horizon. Might be some fuel cell use (hydrogen) but generally electric is the way to go. Enhanced battery tech investment needed badly. Range is critical and removable and replaceable batteries the way to go too. Pull into a garage and have your spent battery pack removed and replaced by a fully-charged pack. Pay $3 and go on your way. It's the way of the future.
