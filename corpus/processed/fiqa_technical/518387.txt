To answer your question, plugins aren't cross-platform, so if you need Bloomberg or other third-party vendor data feeds, you're probably out of luck. Now, for the rant: Hot keys, hot keys, hot keys. Using Excel on a Mac is like working with your fingers glued together if you use Windows Excel all day at work. I have a windows laptop at home just for Bloomberg + Excel. If you make money using Excel, you need to consider at least getting VMWare Fusion or Parallels and running windows on your Mac. Once you are decent in Excel, you'll hate the lack of page up/down and home/end keys on your Mac, as I do with mine. The Fn+Ctrl+Left/Down/Up/Left just isn't the same.
