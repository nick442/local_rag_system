"They're not all ""bad at math borrowers"". How would you like it if you applied for a mortgage, very carefully reviewed all the paperwork, and then the mortgage broker simply transposes your signature to another set of documents with different rates? People got screwed because the companies often screwed them. For every person with zero income who got a home, who's no worse off now than before, there's dozens who got refinanced and later thrown out on the street when their rates magically reset."
