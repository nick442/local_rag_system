Sometimes, but it was more common for the 'presentation' leg of the project to use Excel as the last step before passing the data on to the next team or pushing things into a powerpoint. For new projects, those were much more likely to be R end to end and yes, I often used an organization like you mention, extract and transform -> Fit Model and export predictions -> produce visuals and explanatory data. I did have a few examples where I used R to build on top of excel models, e.g. passing data that was already being calculated into a regression or producing a plot that excel couldn't easily do. In my case we had 10+ people who were good with excel and only 1 or 2 being proficient with R. If the majority of people were strong R users, I'm sure it would have had more predominance in our work.
