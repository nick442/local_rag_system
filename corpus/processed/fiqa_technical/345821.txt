Jeff Bezos hasn't really made much money in Amazon. His goal was for Amazon to achieve a critical mass through economies of scale so hey kept building up his business instead of cashing out. Musk is doing the same with infrastructure. He's not just trying to create an electric car. That is a means to an end. His vision is to change transportation infrastructure by switching from fossil fuels to electric. This includes charging stations, battery technology, and energy harvesting (solar). All his projects are somehow transportation related. The Hyperloop, Boring Project, SpaceX, Tesla.
