I took about about two weeks for the 7, but I was studying 8-12 hours a day 6 days a week. It was miserable and I would definitely recommend taking more time to spread it out. As for studying I used the Kaplan book and online tests, but in hindsight I think a class could have helped. I didn't take the 65, but did pass the 66. Personally, I thought it was easier and took less study time than the 7, but others in my office have said the exact opposite.
