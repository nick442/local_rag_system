Obviously, there will be individual differences. However, the difference between groups is greater than the difference within groups. Gender differences are real because biological, physical, chemical and social differences are real. Men tend to be problem-solvers. Most work is about solving problems. Women tend to be more centered on emotion, and most work is not about emotion. Most men are just better-suited for most work. Maybe this is because men invented business and modern commerce. From my experience and observation, men tend to enjoy work more. We tend to take fewer sick days. We tend to arrive earlier and stay later. We make work a higher priority in our lives. We take the success or failure of our projects and businesses more personally. We complain less. It's human nature to look at what someone else has and wish you had it, too. But most people who engage in that tend not to want to do what those others did to get what they have. I'm convinced that any woman of intelligence, ambition and diligence can get at least as far in the corporate world as any man, if she decided to put all her intelligence, ambition and diligence into that. Most women tend to have other priorities, and those are valid choices on their part.
