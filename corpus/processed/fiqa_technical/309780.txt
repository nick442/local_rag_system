Having a cushion / emergency fund will hopefully keep you from having to build up any more debt once your cards are paid off. I would increase your payments on the 2% cards to a point where you feel comfortable in how much of a cushion you have. Keep your payments steady on the 0% card. Be careful and watching your statements each month, often having a credit problem in another account (electric bill, cable bill, etc) will allow credit card companies to jack up your rates unexpected. If that does happen, you've still got an emergency fund to pay them down quickly in the future.
