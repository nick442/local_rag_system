One of the things I found most interesting is while the national average is 7.45 years, Texas fell in the best position at 5.68 years while Hawaii fell in the worst spot at an average of 10.10 years to pay off their debts. What causes such a huge discrepancy within the same country. I realize cost of living can vary drastically even from city to city but we're talking a difference of nearly 4.5 years here.
