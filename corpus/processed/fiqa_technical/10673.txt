This is just pure capitalistic evil. OK, I think I spoke too soon. There are caps on how much you pay back (2-1/2 times principal), and the royalty isn't for your whole life, but a specific period. Perhaps not evil, but I don't think it's a great investment. Unless you plan on working for a non-profit.
