">my favorite part by far was the fedora worthy ""nonsense, and unworthy of further comment."" I was mocking the tone of your post. Your whole post sounds like that. >you're borderline illiterate, and spend too much time on r/libertarian or watching fox news said like a true berniebro >""they are rational"" - lol Uhh yeah, in economics rational does not always mean ""makes the best decisions in hindsight"" it just means the person is making decisions in their self interest. This is the problem with arguing basic economics with far left liberals, basic economics is so antithetical to your socialist beliefs that you only learn a special sanitized left wing twisted version of economics that assumes that left wing politics is all correct before getting started. It is like someone studying evolution as a creationist. >literally choke on your MLP figurine you worthless fuck. And you expose your true ugly self behind your pretentious mask."
