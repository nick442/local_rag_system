And you have yet to explain how it would matter how they use the benefits they are entitled to. If they didn't spend any of the money they were given it would stay on their card. If they bought food and didn't eat it, it would sit on their shelves. What if they bought food and let someone who was hungry eat it at their house? Are these people abusing the system as well? What you don't seem to understand is ITS THEIR ENTITLEMENT. They can do with it as they please, it would be smart to use it to eat food but guess what some people have drug problems and or likely a mental issue. Apparently in your worldview poor people don't get to have freedom? These people would get it either way if they spent it on food or drugs. Not to mention we are talking about a very small percentage of people and an even smaller pittance of money. We have THOUSANDS of tanks we paid hundreds of millions of dollars for each just sitting in the fucking desert that replaced the already working tanks we already had that we do not need. Yet here you are concerned about some person at the lowest rank of society trading 15 dollars on a snap card for cigarettes.
