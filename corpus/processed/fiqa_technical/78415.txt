"Correct - I believe in freedom. Just because you ""work"" does not mean you now have the right to put a gun to someone else's head who adds more productivity to the country to take their money. I believe in productive work as that is the only way standard of livings will rise for all. If we had a bunch of people doing non productive work and expecting to make the same as productive work we would all be poor."
