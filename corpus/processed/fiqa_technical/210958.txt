"This article feels like a project by an editor to see how well his new hire can write a ""finance"" article. Low hanging fruit: explain Tesla's junk rating compared to Ford's. The conclusion I was hoping he reached, which is my belief, is that Musk flys to close to the sun trying to balance expansion and debt with cash flows and revenue. If they fail Ford's the best positioned car manufacturer in my opinion. Sure, the Volvo's of the world are going all electric, but that's not what makes Tesla appealing in my opinion. They're a tech company masked as a car company. Ford is a car company trying to pivot to a tech company. Electric isn't the future, the vehical cloud is. Someone has to make these cars. Google or apple won't. Ford will hopefully build and service their own."
