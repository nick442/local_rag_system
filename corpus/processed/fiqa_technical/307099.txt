>he found the process of booking the flight to be archaic and obscure. It required phone conversations with a broker, tedious insurance paperwork.. and >JetSmarter acts as the concierge service, helping their tech-savvy users book flights and meet their travel needs, primarily through a messengering service on the app (although 24/7 human phone support is available). This doesn't sound tremendously different than what every single charter company does already. >JetSmarter hopes to enable jet-setters to sell unused seats on their chartered flights. Currently, “empty legs” are available at a discounted rate. Again, pretty much all charter companies already offer discounted empty legs. I do not know if any existing companies have an app, and that seems to be the only unique feature of JetSmarter but that's really all that it is. They don't provide pilots or aircraft so hopefully their 'finders fee' is enough to keep them afloat.
