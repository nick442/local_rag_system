Most of the reason is due to infrastructure costs in the suburbs being hidden in general taxes. Suburban governments don't make enough property tax revenue to maintain infrastructure. New suburban homes don't pay affordable housing ordinance taxes of 10-20% (which new Chicago apartments must pay). Schools is the first reason people leave Chicago. An awful public school system forces the middle class to flee for the burbs, even if they would have preferred city living.
