Landed an internship in undergrad through a combination of networking and just sending out resumes to lots of places with decent IR departments. Then from there I had the experience that finding a job post-grad wasn't too hard. It's a relatively small community and now that I've become basically specialized in telecom, media, and technology it's easy to know where to look. There are plenty of corporate PR firms too if that's more your angle. I really recommend you join your local NIRI chapter. Best networking move you could make, and anyone interested in IR can join. It's a super rewarding career because I love finance but I still get a lot of interpersonal interaction and you're as close to the clients as possible, even at the most entry level.
