This is not really a fair response to the article. The article explicitly addresses the different treatments for different cancers, it advocates the principle of vaccines as a treatment for a class of disease, one they have not really been adapted to previously. In fact, many cancers do have a lot in common, though they use different pathways to achieve immortality, many have disruptions to common apoptopic mechanisms with key genes/proteins like KRAS and PTEN being common problems. The idea of stimulating immune responses as a course of treament to cancer in general is a perfectly valid classification of these approaches, though not the only one.
