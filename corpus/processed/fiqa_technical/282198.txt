The point is that if you are good at what you do then you should get paid a lot of money. A lot of money. Especially if you are saving lives and making the world a better place. If you don't allow people to make a lot of money on life saving drugs, procedures and products then you will get a lot less of them. The US subsidises the rest of the world by paying drug companies billions and surgeons millions a year. If the US did not do this, then you would see the innovation and products that the rest of the world provides..which is very little. Smart people and investors will just stay in finance where they can make a lot money doing nothing really useful.
