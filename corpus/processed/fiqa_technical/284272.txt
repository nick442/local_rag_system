I work in Reserves management at a Central Bank. We work more or less the same hours..but the content of the day is very different. Trading is usually wrapped up by 11-12pm. Then I have a ton a time in the afternoon to hit up the gym, attend economist presentations, grab a lunch, or grab beer with colleagues. Generally very relaxed..very against the industry
