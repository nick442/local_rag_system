Beyond the numbers, how do you objectively establish causation between Amazon and a lost job? That, to me, is what is practically impossible. Ma and Pa might blame Amazon but that's hardly dependable information. What if Ma and Pa's business model was unsustainable or simply mismanaged? Now, with Walmart, you can establish a stronger connection because you'll see those effects tightly correlated with a local store opening. Doing that with an online business is considerably harder. You'd need to know who the customers were and how they substituted Ma and Pa's goods and then correlate that with a drop in sales, for example.
