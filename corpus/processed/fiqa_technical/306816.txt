Where did you get the impression that it is a $70k per year job? Not even the apple picker is going to pick apples all year long. The seasonal nature of the work means that you'll put in time during certain times of year, but often you won't be needed at all. We're talking hourly pay here because it is an hourly, not a yearly, job. If you bring some skills to the table, I know some farms that would jump at the chance to pay you $70k per year. But most people don't have those skills and those that do can make even more elsewhere. Source: The real world. I don't know how to link to that. Sorry.
