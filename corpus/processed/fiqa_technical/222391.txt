Two Questions, please feel free to pick either one, or answer both if you want. 1) If tax reform does get passed and corporate & income taxes are reduced/consolidated, what will be 1. the short term effect on the U.S national debt? and 2. The long term effect on the debt, factoring in the obvious (and already priced in) supply side growth potential of the tax cuts? It seems to me that the GOP tea partiers/deficit hawks that rose to political power in 2010-2012 have gone oddly mute on the (probable) increase in the federal debt as a result of both the proposed Trump tax cuts and (subjectively) wasteful budget provisions like Wall funding, deportation enforcement ect.. 2) A. What is your best guess of the reaction of U.S & European asset markets (Eq & Bonds) in the event of a war on the Korean peninsula, with both conventional and asymetrical weapons & methods used on North, South Korea as well as U.S ally Japan? I ask because the economic fundamentals of U.S/Western Europe are strong, and am wondering whether an obvious negative market shock (nuclear? war) would be enough to send those respective western economies into recession/financial crisis. B. What will be the geopolitical result? Does China back NK to prevent a immigration crisi/power vacuum or do they side with the UN/U.S and allow military destruction of NK in the event of a NK-started war?
