"I find it really hard to feel sorry for them. For many years now the local Post Office has been a farce. Many local businesses quit using them because they'd just flat-out lose mail so consistently. The small company I worked for (local ISP) was constantly fighting this battle since we would have customers calling up pissed off because their service got cut off when we didn't receive their payment. Now sure, you have the classic ""check's in the mail"" bit, but this happened too frequently to such a random selection of customers that it was quite obvious there was an issue. More than once I took it up personally with the local Postmaster (functioning Manager-type person) and would always get told ""Oh, it's not us, it's the Columbia branch"" and when I called to straighten it out there I was told ""Sorry, you'll have to take this up with your local office"". Funny, they never seemed to lose all that fucking junk mail that crammed up our PO or mailbox. Hate that it got that bad, but once again sounds like a bad business model - Provide services at a loss, pay into pensions you know you can't afford, and refuse to modernize effectively and in-time."
