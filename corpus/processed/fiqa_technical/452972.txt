When I read this website I feel like he is spinning the story the wrong way. He has a lot of stories about how the internet has allowed quick organization of a large amount of people out to a specific goal. You can tell the author has a lot of disdain for consumers the way he always talks negative about people using their brains to get a better deal and how these poor multibillion dollar companies are going to suffer minor loses.
