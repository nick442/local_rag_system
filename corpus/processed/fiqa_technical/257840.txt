Portlander here too! Have you made sure to consider the tax burden you will have from the inheritance? Investing in extra property is something that you should do when you are all paid up. You don't want a job loss or other emergency make it impossible to keep the house you live in. What happens if you buy a house and then lose both your jobs? Do you let the bank foreclose on both homes? I think you would be in a much more stable position owning fully all your property. Once your first house is paid off, you can rent that or consider buying another. The key advice here is to stabilize and remove all your debts now. It is less exciting but safer. But if you don't owe any money. Go for it.
