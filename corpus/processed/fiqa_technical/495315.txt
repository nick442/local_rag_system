Is it possible to move money from NRE to NRO account Yes you can move money from NRE to NRO without any issue. You can't do the other way round. i.e. Move money from NRO to NRE. I would like to move USD earning to NRE Yes you can further move money in NRE to NRO account Yes you can I am planning to give NRO account to HDFC Home loan for EMI processing Yes you can. Depending on your long term plan it may not be a good idea. For example if you were to sell the house you cannot move the funds into NRE and outside of India without some amount of paperwork. However if you pay the EMI via NRE account, on the sale of house, you can transfer the funds into NRE account to the extent of the loan paid and the Original downpayment [if made from NRE account]. also I can deposit money from other savings account to NRO; As an NRI, you can't hold ordinary savings account in India. This is violation of norms. Please have any/all savings account in India converted to NRO at the earliest.
