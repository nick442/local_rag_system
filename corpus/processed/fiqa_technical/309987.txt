Yahoo didn't know what it wanted to become, and as a turnaround CEO, if she had one job, it was to figure out what Yahoo wanted to become, establish that vision, and catalyze Yahoo's employees, investors and users around that mission. Mayer didn't even make a nominal effort to do this, she was preoccupied with details. Rearranging deck chairs. Possibly she's a good manager, but she's not much of a leader.
