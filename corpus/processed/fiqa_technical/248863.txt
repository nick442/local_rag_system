Large businesses are, in every model, considered to be less likely to default, and Lehman brothers etc notwithstanding, this is historically correct. However, this is still stupid, since the diversification of lending money to many small businesses is way better. This, in turn, is not mapped properly by the regulations on reserve capital. Tl;dr: Banks get punished by regulations if they lend money to small institutions instead of large ones.
