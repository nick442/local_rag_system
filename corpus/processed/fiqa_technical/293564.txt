I wouldn't really call it a counterpoint. A counterpoint to this would be to argue that tasks won't be automated just because they can. That being said there are tremendous risks in taking humans out of the picture in many cases. Unfortunately as this video proves these tasks are still automated despite the risks. Automation can work just fine when it's been thought out well, tested in a sandbox environment, and monitored to prevent mistakes that are made from reoccurring. Edit: When I wrote this I hadn't finished the article and gotten to the point where he pretty much says all automation is good, period.
