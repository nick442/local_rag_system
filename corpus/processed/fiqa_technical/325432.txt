"People do not take the time to get to know you, and find out what you know (or not) before hiring you. They are lazy. And they are cowards. They will hire only someone who appears to have the right credentials, got it? There is no reason for them to put themselves on the line by telling corporate they ""have a hunch"" you'll be a good employee. Almost guarenteed not to happen. You have to make it easy for the person to hire you. And that means you gotta get the degree."
