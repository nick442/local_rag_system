vol shouldn't matter if you're looking at the long term. I get all the other things, to me people just don't like bear markets. I think retail is also scared for macro reasons. Shitty economy, total clusterfuck politically. Europe is clearly a mess. And all those things don't have any resolution in the near-term future. So sit on cash/fixed income and at least you're not losing.
