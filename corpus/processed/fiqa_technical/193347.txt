"Dude, I'm a small business owner. The fact of the matter is employee costs are a big expense. But the truth is, I think people that pay minimum wage are scum. If you're so convinced that a livable wage would make it ""worse"", why don't you standardize a companies 10-k and show me that the cost of the product will raise equal to the wage increase? You can't, because it won't. The cost increase on margins is divided over every operating metric a company has, and therefore the price won't increase at a 1:1 ratio. Further, the margins that are made by the companies employing the people making minimum wage are often from government assistance. So you're claiming it's cheaper for the populace to create false net revenues by directing tax dollars to support the very people that can't buy food because of a $7 an hour wage. Then you have the countless people stuck in the welfare hole of losing their benefits if they get a slightly better job that just knocks them out of the specified ranges required to qualify. So you have people that want to work, but now can't make too much money or it will make their life worse, all because of the system that was created by a minimum wage that never matched inflation and cheap companies that rely on welfare systems to keep their employees happy a rough to keep living. Companies that pay minimum wage are jokes."
