You're offering a false choice where a lack of mega-corporations results in prices that are beyond the reach of a significant amount of people. It is false because the mega-corporations have not always existed, and yet we did not have prices that were beyond the reach of a significant amount of people. In fact, our economy was actually a lot better and we had less income inequality across the board.
