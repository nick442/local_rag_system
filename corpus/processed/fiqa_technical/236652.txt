To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what a PhD in Finance gets you in the next 5-10 years. Most banks and hedge funds are going to be hiring computer scientists with backgrounds in machine learning. Anything quantitative you learn in a Finance PhD program will be too weak compared to those skillsets. I think the only bright spot might be behavioral economics, which has a qualitative social science research component to it. I would be less worried about getting into one of those programs and more worried about if it will actually be useful. If I were you, I'd get into a PhD program that exploits your statistics background, so you can at least go towards approaches in statistical machine learning.
