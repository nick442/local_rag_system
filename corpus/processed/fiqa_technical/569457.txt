I agree with you and I think it's more of a regulation thing. Hotels pay immense taxes and are subject to inspections. I don't think the issue is with people renting out their homes but with people buying homes to rent them out without being regulated or paying the same fees a hotel would when they're essentially running a hotel business. That being said, I think AirBnB is much better than staying in hotels and I don't wish nor think it'll go away anytime soon and I've never personally had a bad experience when staying in one.
