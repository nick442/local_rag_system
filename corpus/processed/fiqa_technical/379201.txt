Interest rates are at historic lows. In my opinion they can only go up from here. With that in mind, it is best to lock in interest rates now. I would only take an adjustable rate if I expected my personal income to increase in excess of the increase in interest rates. I hold that the recent technology of fracking has driven down the price of energy. I also believe that this is a short term situation and energy prices will return, and have already begun to do so. With the price of energy going up, inflation will return.
