My best advice is to avoid shopping as much as possible. Minimize the amount of time you are in situations where you will be tempted to purchase random things (i.e. the checkout line! they put that crap there for a reason!). Don't go to the mall. Make your trips to the grocery store as fast as possible. Put your head down and run past it all to grab the thing you need and get out of there.
