"I feel like any ""mental health"" issue that can be solved in two days isn't the kind of thing that warrants missing work. And if a person is just stressed the fuck out and needs to unwind a little, *just say that -* Tumblr already exists; we don't need more people self diagnosing their idiotic and pretend disorders. On top of that, since everybody knows this isn't ""real"" in the way that alcoholism or depression is real (though I don't doubt something's bothering her) all this is is a big ""dear everybody, I can't really handle my job. Remember me next time there's a layoff!"" This has given everyone too much information, it's too much detail for her boss, and it's too fucking ""omg gimme hugs"" garbage for her CEO."
