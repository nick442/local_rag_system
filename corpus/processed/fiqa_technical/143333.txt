"Nonsense. I am not saying the Elon and Tesla are perfect, but all companies have delays. Especially those inventing things nobody did before them. And some companies have production capacity issues. Especially those experiencing super high demand on their products. Big deal! Tesla got 0.5 million pre-orders. With approx 2-3 years of waiting time, and people had to pay 1000 USD upfront, out of their pockets. And they did. Tesla is seeing an extreme demand for their high-priced product. Every entrepreneur and enterprise would love to be in Musk's shoes. **So, delayed deliveries and shaking liquidity should be considered only ""logistics"" issues, not ""will he fail!"" discussion.**"
