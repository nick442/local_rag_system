No. The article needs to have business as its central focus. Not as something which one can extrapolate as a consequence. This is a health article not a business article. I have, quite sadly, removed it. Even though I liked it and found it informative and hopeful. It would be great if some day the admins gave us the power to move submissions to more appropriate subreddits rather than remove them. Oh to dream.
