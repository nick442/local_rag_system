There are, if by competitors you mean Internet providers who can offer gigabit service at a reasonable price. It just takes an incredible amount of initial capital investment to get started and likely face NIMBY bullshit red tape and sweetheart legacy deals, so most if these competitors are small in scope. For example, I have service from a provider that offers gigabit service, Condo Internet here in Seattle. But even they are limited to only certain buildings, because they just don't have much capital to expand yet.
