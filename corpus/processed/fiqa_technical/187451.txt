HuffPo's [article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/15/michelle-apperson-teacher_n_1601015.html) has more detail; the reason that she was laid off was because the teacher layoffs here were mandated to be seniority-based, as is common in public-school layoffs. Seniority-based layoffs rather than merit-based are something that teachers' unions have [long promoted](http://www.writeonnevada.com/2012/05/seven-outstanding-rookie-ccsd-teachers.html); one is rewarded for being part of the system for a long time rather than doing a good job. There has been a general shift [away from seniority-based layoffs](http://eagnews.org/indiana-schools-will-use-teacher-performance-as-predominant-factor-for-layoffs/) and towards performance-based layoffs. Generally-speaking, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about strictly seniority-based pay and strictly seniority-based firing; it doesn't seem to make a tremendous amount of sense.
