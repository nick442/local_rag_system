I drive to many destinations every day. My average week is 10-15 destinations 5 of which will be new. I have two other nav apps (waze, navigon) Apple maps is fucking terrible! 5 times it has taken me to the complete wrong destination, many blocks from the correct one. You can search for something obvious that is near you and will insist on giving you something on another continent. That is not an exaggeration. You can search for the same thing in detail (name city state) and it will find no results. Waze or google find it only by name. All this happens to me in Silicon Valley where I work and live. No lie I have been taken to the wrong block in Cupertino. They shouldn't just fire him, someone ought to kick his ass. End rant
