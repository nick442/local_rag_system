Very respectfully, your statements, although true, aren't what I care about. I absolutely want the bias of bad customer service and bad customer experience to affect the reviews of an establishment. That bias, if absent, lets me know that I've found a truly great place (which is CRUCIAL for services I rely on that typically have a lot of terrible practitioners, such as auto repair or dentistry). The issue with Yelp is NOT that they feature survey feedback. I love survey feedback. The issue with Yelp is that they bias their feedback according to their *own* bottom line - you pay, you get good reviews (usually) and the bad ones get filtered, and if you don't pay, the opposite happens. You might not like the aggregate, but I find it EXTREMELY helpful. I wish more than anything that Yelp were an honest company, but they are not, and that is the point of the OA. Your point, although true, is mostly irrelevant to people who want to see feedback on businesses. (I could cite Amazon's ratings as well in this regard - imagine what would happen if Amazon were as corrupt as Yelp. Would they still be the web's premiere e-tailer?)
