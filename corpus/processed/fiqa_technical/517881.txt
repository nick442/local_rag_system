Yeah, the company has less than 18 months left before total collapse imo. I wouldn't be surprised if it goes under around Christmas tbh. Their suppliers no longer give merchandise on credit but the only reason I give the enterprise that much time is because they might have overstock from all their recently closed locations flooding the still-open ones, lol. From wiki: >Since 2010, Sears has gone from more than 3,500 physical stores to 695 US stores.
