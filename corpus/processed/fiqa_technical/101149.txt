Right, in that case disregard most of what I've said that's specific, especially on the law bits. Check with someone local (or check the court websites) if small claims court is an option, and if you get a judgement what options there are to collect. A collection agency can also take the legwork out of that, mostly at the customer expense. And selling off debt is still an option, the US industry for that is even bigger than in the Netherlands. And your loss on that is most likely tax deductible, so ask yourself how much your time and aggro is worth.
