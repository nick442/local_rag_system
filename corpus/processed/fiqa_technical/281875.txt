I don't understand why Walmart would use that as a strategy. Amazon can duplicate any sale they have online. Its not like Walmart has the capacity to put Amazon out of business at this point. This would just hurt both companies needlessly. Walmart needs to innovate to get people to use them. They need to create a great web experience, provide products and services that are unique to Walmart and of a quality that people will want to utilize them. They may even need to create an R&D division and look to develop their own products to help prop up their business and push traffic to their online presence. But they gotta look at this like the US did the space race. They were too far behind the Soviets to catch them in getting to space and doing a space walk, etc. What they could do was plan to be the first to make a moon landing and hop ahead of the Soviets. What form that would be for Walmart, I have no idea, but I think if they want to gain ground online, that's the way they need to think.
