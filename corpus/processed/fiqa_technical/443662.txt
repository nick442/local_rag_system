"Get the book ""So you flunked the Series 7?"" It's basically a guide to creating, memorizing and using the mother of all dump sheets for options. Options are a significant portion of the exam and having that entire section compressed into a dump sheet that you mechanically use during the exam, leaves your brain free to focus on other troubling topics for which dump sheets are less useful.. like muni bonds. It'll create more work.: i don't know what timeline you're on, and if you can afford to cram this in, but i did it. i think that book saved my ass from failing. I got something like 98% of options questions right. you should also create note cards-- so many note cards over and over that your hand hurts as much from writing as your brain hurts from thinking. the process of repetitious writing encrypts the information and helps with retention and recall. plus having the cards on hand helps to reinforce edit: can i ask which firm you're with? edit 2: the author of the above book is accessible. i reached out to him to say thank and we actually text each other from time to time. if you need an accountability buddy or have a question let me know. PM me. this is one of the biggest ball busting exams the world has ever seen and we can all use a hand through ."
