The job I have now, I am lucky enough to be able to be lax. At my last job I would have been fired if I wasn't available at all times. I also had clients who expected me to be available whenever they called or I would lose them. It wasn't being a doormat. It was the definition of the job and everyone from the lowest person on the pole to the top did the same thing.
