Just google ""U.S. Central banks buying stocks and bonds"", then connect the numbers. **Insider Information:** At my previous company we sold solar manufacturing equipment. I went to said Chinese city that bought our equipment. They were producing ton loads of solar panels, I asked one of the manager's where all of the panels were being sold (domestic, or international?). To my surprise, he said they warehoused the panels they produced; because, there weren't enough customers. And, why were they warehousing the panels? Because, the Chinese government needed to show numbers that jobs were plenty, and manufacturing was still strong."
