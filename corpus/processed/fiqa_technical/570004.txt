So you dislike Unions? Why were unions necessary in the first place? Is that problem resolved, or will it crop up again if they go away? My belief is that Unions (or rather, the problems they solved) are still necessary. But their methods need oversight just as much as businesses need to be held accountable for how they treat their employees. Government paying their employees well shouldn’t be an issue. We should be paying all employees well. But we are on a race to the bottom, when it comes to employee wages. When we can outsource our work to other countries (by building American businesses their), and get rewarded for it, we have broadened the field our own employees have to compete against. When those businesses pay pennies on the dollar that they have to pay here, our employees CAN’T compete.
