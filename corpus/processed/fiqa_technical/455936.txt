Studies suggest people aren't comfortable around others who are way poorer or richer than they. You sound like a rational adult. You would be surprised how weird people associate with money. Also, if we compare to earlier period it can only account as far as the same people in question were alive e.g not a generation before. Why? Because people can't understand how it was to live differently without actual experience. Yes, the majority of the world lives better today but we also have much higher expectations, that needs to be accounted for. Another matter is the rising cost of living expenses. Real estate doesn't seem to be dropping and that easily adds to financial anxiety when due to globalisation and technology the job markets become unstable.
