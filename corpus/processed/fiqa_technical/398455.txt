**OFC there is more to it than meets the eye!** Its a nice breakdown though. In my opinion, there are just 2 ways out: One is to merge the whole European Union into one Nation, much like the **United** States of America. (*United States of Europe*, ehehehe) But i guesss Germany, France and UK are not very interested in feeding everyone else even more. **OR** Split. The thing is, the ones with the most power are not interested in one of these solutions. And now to come to your question, YES Recession is coming (isnt it alrdy here?) Greetings from Austria!
