"I worked in the service industry for over 10 years and this came up every now and again. Mostly in hypothetical situations. I'm not a tax expert, but my general understanding is that it is viewed as income by the IRS if you performed a service of any kind in exchange for the money. In other words, if you waited on the table, and they left you a gift for doing so, it is taxable. You'll probably also find that if you pool tips with other employees or have to tip out the bartenders, cooks or dishwashers, they'll generally agree with the IRS that you clearly received a tip and want their fair share. While the concept of ""gifting"" money to others in a situation like this is intriguing, especially in the service industry, it really doesn't meet the definition of a gift in the eyes of the IRS. For it to truly be a gift, the person would have had to intend to gift you the money even if they hadn't come into your restaurant at all that night. That clearly is not the case here."
