ISIS wouldn't exist if not for the US invasion of Iraq. Afghanistan is going to be garrisoned by US troops indefinitely because it suits the whims of the ruling class and their US Empire. They don't want to win, just to occupy and control. Fairly classic for an empire really. Poor people die, our tax money is lit on fire, and some folks in the Military Industrial Complex laugh all the way to the bank while the Pentagon has a huge force it can just set in Central Asia apparently permanently..
