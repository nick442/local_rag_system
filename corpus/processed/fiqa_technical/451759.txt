First, I would agree with you that the Stock market is too high and risky now. I became extremely conservative with my investments in the last 3 months. But that high stock market is an indicator about the expectations that the economy will do good (under Trump). If there was a projection that the economy is going to be harmed by Trump, there would be a big correction soon after the elections. Remember: one wrong statement of even action from Trump, and the stock market crashes. Whether Trump is responsible in the last 6 months to the improvement in the economy or not, do you see anything he does in regards to the economy (economy, not politics) that will hurt the economy?
