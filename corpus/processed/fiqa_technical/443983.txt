Yes, it should come out tax free. However you should have reported it to the IRS at the time (currently it is done on form 8606). If you haven't done it, the IRS may disagree with you on that and require taxes. If you have proper documentation of the contribution, then when you withdraw from your IRA - you use that same form 8606 to calculate the non-taxable portion. Note that you cannot just take $2K out of the 1099-R, the non-taxable portion will be prorated through all of your IRA withdrawals. Also, keep in mind that only the actual after tax portion will be tax-free, the gains will be taxable. I.e.: if you deposited $2K after tax (and nothing else), and they have now grown to $100K - you will only have 2% of your distribution tax free (2k/100K * distributed amount).
