The one those investors said 'hey instead of pricing Tesla 10 years out, we will pool in and create jobs, by founding a $5b bank with locations nationwide'. I use them because they give great rates at places I shop. Such as if I buy a new tv from that new company founded by that hedge fund that pulled out of netflixes 10 year pricing and started an electronics firm I save 25%!!
