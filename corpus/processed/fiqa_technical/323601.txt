">My father and my grandfather and my great grandfather could all sustain their families on a single middle class income Well, depends on what you define as ""middle class income"". Some of it is a **rising expected standard of living**: What size house did they have? How many automobiles did they have? If you go back to your great grandfather's time, he probably had far fewer sets of clothing. They probably didn't have the television, telephone, and air conditioning services that I expect most middle-class people expect. My dad ate fruits and vegetables only in season; you didn't get to have strawberries in the middle of winter or avocadoes shipped in from Chile. I expect to be able to travel via air to visit relatives; go back to the 1960s or even into the 1970s, and it was considered something that only the well-to-do would expect to be doing. My father didn't have video game consoles available to him. Some of these are driven purely by technology, of course, and someone can manage to pay no larger a chunk of change than they did before. We eat more meat, if I remember a lecture on this correctly. My parents had a lot more casserole and spaghetti (inexpensive foods) than I do. But some of it is also adjusting norms. Reading about the sort of house that a farmer lived in a few hundred years back would make me think of horrible poverty by modern standards.. Most women seem not to have wanted to remain housewives when women started going out and doing men's historical work. So if they go out into the workforce, then keeping up with the Joneses, doing what's considered middle-class requires doubling income, and downwards pressure on some fixed costs (like, say, utility costs or gas costs) is lessened; that makes things tough on the few holdout families who want to have a single-income standard. Sure, maybe a small percentage of people out there want less-expensive beef, but its the bulk of people who get catered to.. **Automation** has greatly decreased demand for some types of jobs; performing a repetitive, pre-defined task on an assembly line has fallen dramatically in value as the need for more people to do this sort of work has fallen off. Wages for a particular job are a function of how many people are available to do them relative to how many are needed. Every ATM is one less bank teller, every e-commerce website fewer retail workers. That increases the productive capacity of society, but whereas before there might be tremendous demand for someone to perform a repeated task on an assembly line (which it was easy to train people to do), many of the types of labor that are currently under-supplied are things that take longer to train people to do and require more specialization. **Debt Service**. Any debt that someone has that doesn't have a positive return-on-investment (an engineering degree would probably have a positive ROI, a large television probably a negative) winds up making them poorer in the long run. Any debt at *all* (barring investors making bad pricing decisions and hitting default or unexpectedly low returns) means transfer of wealth from people without money to people with money. The more (non-defaulted-upon) debt, the more people with more wealth make more wealth from lending. People have vastly more *personal debt* than they once did. Compare the amount of debt that someone has today with the amount of debt that they typically had in your great-grandfather's time, in the 1930s. There's a constant *drain* of wealth towards the lenders. This is one of Elizabeth Warren's favorite grousing points â€” people take out a *lot* more debt, particularly on housing, than they ever did in the past, and so a lot of their income is eaten year-by-year on debt service. There are lots of factors that make it easier to take out more debt. The biggest source of personal debt is [by far mortgages](http://www.utahfoundation.org/img/pdfs/rr689summary.pdf), and this is where the largest increases have taken place; policies to try to encourage people to go into debt to take out larger and larger mortgages have been steadily ramped up over this time, with the government subsidizing and taking on risk for insurance liability on mortgages to keep encouraging ever-larger amounts of debt. Lenders have computers and much more information and sophisticated systems for evaluating risk of default, which permits lending out more wealth. So there are technological changes driving this. The government has more *public debt* which means more such payments, even if they don't show up on your personal checkbook and are only seen by an increasing disparity between what you pay in taxes and the services you get back. Here's a chart of [inflation-adjusted debt per capita](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/07/chart-of-the-day-americans-income-and-the-us-debt/241463/) in the United States. That means that there's a constant increasing in the siphoning off of taxes as well to pay for the government having purchased a good or service without having actually paid for it at the time it was ordered. That decreasing green line means not that personal debt is falling (well, most of the time) but that the government is taking out debt on your behalf even faster than private debt has been going up. **The rest of the world catching up and breaking a temporary limited monopoly on certain goods**. China and India were not industrialized (and the former stuck under Maoism and not trading much with the rest of the world), so there were fewer people available to do this sort of work. Europe rebuilt from World War II, so it didn't have to purchase from the overseas US manufacturing industry. What could change? Well, standard-of-living is a cultural thing; that seems hard to manipulate. I'm sure that it's possible to change that, but I have a hard time suggesting how. Automation would be an across-the-board good thing if workers could be efficiently shifted into fields which currently have more demand; it's only an issue for workers if they stay in a field that has falling demand. I'm sure that our mechanisms for re-educating workers are not terribly good. Today, our education system still involves having a person stand up in front of a lot of other people and talk at them, then have those other people go and repeat some rote tasks to try and hammer something into their brain; it's the same mechanism that the wealthy used hundreds of years ago to tutor their children, but ramped up on a larger scale. If it were cheaper and easier to learn a new trade, it'd be easier to enter lucrative fields. College costs in particular are ridiculous. When you take college classes, you're basically getting a reading list, a very few limited slots to ask questions, and a set of predefined tasks plus some grading. That can be done far less-expensively than it is provided today. I personally have high hopes for online courses as a start here, though I'm sure that there will be stumbling blocks. Ditto for things like Wikipedia; using hypertext means that I can skip over things I already know and focus on what I don't understand, and electronic, automatic distribution means that it can be done far less-expensively than having some guy with a PhD stand up in front of a room and read some lecture notes aloud. Instead of answering questions generation after generation, *those* people should be polishing databases of *answers* to questions so that every subsequent human being can quickly and easily refer to their answer, and so that we can direct people to the best explanation easily. It's possible to adopt some measures that would reduce debt service by reducing public debt, but the public debt has been growing for a long time, and it seems very clear that people are much more willing to take out debt than to cut into *their* favorite concern (low taxes or lots of services) in the immediate future. As for reducing debt service via reducing private debt, most of the policy and technological factors that drive private debt seem unlikely to change to me. Maybe if we see some sort of cultural change, an aversion to taking out debt with a negative ROI, but all of the information I'm giving here has been public for a long time and people haven't changed, so I doubt that we'll see any kind of a reversal or social movement against taking out lots of debt. You'd have to have the equivalent of a [Great Awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_awakening) with respect to debt..and given that attempts to excite interest in the matter have generally not gone anywhere thus far, I suspect that this is human nature and doubt that things will change. You can always change *your* personal debt decisions, but society as a whole? As for the temporary monopoly..well, I think that it's pretty much inevitable that the rest of the world catches up to a great degree. Asia will catch up, even Africa will eventually get there. I think that that would be a pretty difficult thing to stop, and I think that most of the world would object to someone attempting to stop it."
