"One of the principles of Sharia Banking is (Wikipedia): Shariah prohibits what is called ""Maysir"" and ""Gharar"". Maysir is involved in contracts where the ownership of a good depends on the occurrence of a predetermined, uncertain event in the future whereas Gharar describes speculative transactions. Both concepts involve excessive risk and are supposed to foster uncertainty and fraudlent behaviour. In other words risky investments are prohibited in Sharia Banking."
