Selective reporting. There is a lot of negative press about opioids but the benefits outweigh the death risks by a ton and nobody ever mentions those. Opioids saves countless amount of lives and brings people out of misery from excruciating pain; marijuana should not be the drug of choice for pain like that, it isn't strong enough. We are utilizing opioids pre-surgery, post-surgery, chronic conditions. What are you going to do, have patient take a hit after they get out of a surgery? It's not even going to make a dent in alleviating the pain as soon as stat dose of fentanyl post surgery fades away; you're going to need oxycodone for that pain. Marijuana is not as effective as opioids for severe acute pain (or even chronic). Marijuana should be legal, I agree, but that shit is overhyped in the medical world.
