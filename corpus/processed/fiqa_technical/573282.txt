"I have real, working insight on how some businesses look at IT as a third wheel. We have 800 employees, with roughly 200 of them being computer users. While some companies are debating on whether or not to name a CIO, we have no acting IT director, no one that is titled a manager, nothing. We have two people dedicated to IT. I have a bullshit title, answer to the IT ""manager"" who has another bullshit title who answers to the controller, who answers to the CFO, who answers to the CEO. I have trained a PR person enough to handle website editing tasks so I don't have to get my hands dirty for little things and to handle social media. I could go on for hours about how to properly structure your company for IT services by describing a terrible scenario but you already hit the nail on the head."
