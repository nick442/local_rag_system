**NEED** a car and a average quality 2 bedroom apt? your entitlement and privilege may be skewing what is necessary. how about public transport/bicycle/ ridesharing/ living in a 4 bedroom house of a bargain quality with more people instead of that avg 2 bedroom. my god the entitlement and privilege is crazy!
