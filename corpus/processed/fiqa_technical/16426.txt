"As an American who just came back from spending two years in a developing country, uniformed statements like this really annoy me. Say what you will about the state of the American economy and political system, but the United States has one of the finest road systems the world. Our roads are wide, well-paved, and graced with lines that tell traffic exactly where it should be and what it should be doing at all times. When there are potholes, they are the exception, not the rule. I just spent the last two years in a poor country with narrow, horrible, and often unpaved roads. When a road was paved, it often was more pothole than pavement. Sometimes, you would come across a little island of asphalt in a sea of mud that would let you know that at some point in the past the road had been paved. Before somebody calls the American road system ""third world,"" perhaps they should spend a little time living in the actual third world."
