Capitalism assumes people are selfish? Or it accounts for both sides? Capitalism actually does none of the above. Capitalism simply says that Capital is the means of trade and financial growth. Pure Capitalism would mean that Capital is used for every transaction that can influence Trade and Growth. That is impossible. Capitalism neither adjusts for, nor makes rules about, whether people are Selfish, Selfless, or somewhere in-between. Capitalism does promote Selfishness, but isn’t based on Selfishness. It is based on Capital. To give Capitalism any other extraordinary properties is to fail to see it for what it is. I’ve been hearing people associate Capitalism as the cause for tons of modern things: Roads, Medicine, even the Space Program. But Capitalism didn’t do any of those. Where did this foolishness come from? People made Roads, Medicine, and the Space Program. Capitalism was the market style they used, because it is the prevalent style in America. But it is just a tool, a method, and not some gift of amazing abilities. It simply makes Capital the standard for exchange and financial growth.
