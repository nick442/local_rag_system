Yeah. Definitely fast food enemies. The only fries I like better than Arby's are McDonalds' fries. So tasty! I will admit that the burgers there are not great, but do love to grab a bundle of the little cheap ones. They're basically just ketchup/cheese sandwiches on buns. And the McChicken is great too, especially the new one with Cheddar and Onions on top. As to horsey sauce, it is a horseradish mayonnaise blend. Mmmmm. I am sorry for your food poisoning. Arby's is a franchise-based model, so the quality can vary a lot.
