I do that. And to preface I truly don't understand what steps mods take to block spam. But it does seem like some subreddits are harder to submit to than others. So if this subreddit is doing something different to filter spam, and good posts are currently being blocked in high numbers while spam gets through, maybe something needs to be altered?
