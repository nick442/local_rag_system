We (the people) don't need the Fed. The Primary Dealer banks need the Fed. And the deficit financed Federal government needs the Fed. What the Fed accomplishes for the people is permanent inflation. That inflation happens as waves over the economy. The wave starts in asset and commodity prices and as it loses momentum eventually arrives at wages. It means that the standard of living of the average guy continues to decline unless he finances it with ever-increasing debt.
