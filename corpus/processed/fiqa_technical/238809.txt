"Fuck exempt salary positions. The necessary reform is overtime for anyone who isn't a partial owner. If you own a company and want to work a 100 hour week, fine. But you cannot hire an ""exempt"" employee and work them 100 hours because of some classification. Any non-owner should get overtime. That would fix the massive unemployment/underemployment problem straight away. If businesses can't force people to work two jobs for the pay of one, they'll have no choice but to hire more people. The other problem is unpaid internships. If someone works, they get minimum wage. Probably more. Remember, people fought and died for 40 hour weeks and fair labor laws. Asshole corporations have fought to deny this. I'm surprised they haven't tried to repeal child labor laws yet. Most of them would be happy with ten year-olds working ten hour days for nothing."
