There are many facets to the question of why HP is failing so miserably, but if you ask me it comes down to the many failing companies that they have acquired over the years. Compaq, Palm, etc. It seems like HP loves to scoop up companies on the downswing, spends billions for them, and then quietly kills them off with seemingly no advantage to HP. Granted, this is an outsiders point of view but I never thought that Compaq or Palm were good fits for HP, other than knocking another competitor out of the playing field, but when you pay billions for a competitor, it just makes the payoff that much less.
