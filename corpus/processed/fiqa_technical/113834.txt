When I worked there we had a '10 Foot Rule', you had to acknowledge any customer within 10 feet of you. This rule was rarely followed as you were usually busy with something else and didn't have time to acknowledge everyone within 10 feet of you at all times. And as someone else already pointed out, they have a 'No Pressure' sales approach. This is a businesses way of telling you that they don't pay their employees on commission. So I couldn't give a crap if you bought that computer at my store or another Best Buy or at the Circuit City across the street (whoops looks like I dated myself.) I didn't see an extra penny if you bought from my store. The only thing they did pressure you to sell was extended warranties, and it was negative pressure, in that if you didn't sell enough of them you were warned and then eventually let go. Couldn't get out of that place fast enough.
