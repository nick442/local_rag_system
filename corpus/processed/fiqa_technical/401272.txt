Yes, conflicts of interest are absolutely okay - are you serious? Conflicts of interest are a constant part of life. All scientific knowledge we have ever discovered was implicated in conflicts of interest, in that the researchers have an interest in finding scientifically significant results so they can get published and receive credit for discovering that knowledge. Do those conflicts of interest mean you dismiss evidence off-hand? Of course not. A conflict of interest is a reason to give less weight to a source's claim *in the case that you have evidence to the contrary*. It is never a reason to reject a claim in and of itself. By your logic, it is wrong for your doctor to recommend a certain examination because they profit if you take it. It makes informed decision-making impossible.
