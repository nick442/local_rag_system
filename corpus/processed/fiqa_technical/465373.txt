Whether behaving illegally or not (and their behavior is sometimes illegal), Wal-mart can certainly not be trusted to do what's good for its workers (or those of its suppliers), communities, or the US economy. Refer to [here](http://www.epi.org/publication/ib235/) for one example. You're right that determining what policies will help can be tricky. That doesn't mean we should just let the market do as it will. If we've learning nothing from the recent bubbles, it's that this is clearly dangerous. Moreover, it is citizens and our electeds that should have more say that a self-interested private business.
