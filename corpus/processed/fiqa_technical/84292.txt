"> Literally not a single word of this comment is true. Every word is true. > 1) 26.9 gross margins just got posted, with zero ZEV revenue. I'm not talking about their posted numbers. Taxpayers get tax credits for buying them. If taxpayers didn't get those tax credits then TSLA would have to lower the price of the car and they would be a loss. > 2) Your 11,000 number is completely made up, particularly given that they had zero ZEV revenue. See above. > 3) What competition? Name a car. There's nothing. I said competition is ""coming"", not that it's here. > 4) Again, literally on that very same call, they said they've shaved hundreds of pounds off of the Model S since it started production due to improvements in battery technology. Batteries improve 8-10% every year. Everyone knows this. 1. TSLA has worse battery tech than the cutting edge battery companies whose batteries are coming in the new competition. 2. If you believed everything that companies said in conference calls you would be leveraged long every company in the world."
