So why are large US companies privy to the language but large US consumer or civil liberties groups not? For example, analysts at Cisco, IBM, Intel, and HP have access to the text of the TPP and can make comments to guide policy decisions that will go into the treaty[1], but I don't believe the EFF has had access except for leaks[2]. So, where's my advocate in the negotiations? Why should I believe the negotiators have my best interests at heart? Even if the treaty comes back as something generally positive, it's going to be tilted in such a way that those with a spot at the table come out ahead whereas Congress' only option is just 'take it or leave it'. By extension of my representation in Congress (and even that's kind of weak given the current state of US politics), that's my only option as well.
