You've already done everything I would suggest: Contact the collections agency, being careful in what personal information you provide. Check all three of your credit reports, for any trace of incorrect information. At this point, since you've confirmed that the social security number that the collections agency has does not match yours, and you've confirmed that you have nothing in your credit report about this debt, I don't think you need to worry about it. Collections agencies employ a number of tactics to try to collect on bad debt. The first dilemma they have is finding the debtor. Sometimes this is easier than other times. In this case, they obviously don't know where this person is, so they just started contacting people that have the same name as the debtor, hoping that they will get lucky. Intimidation is a major collections agency tactic, so I'm sure the letter you got was strongly worded. Your phone call to them may or may not have convinced them that they have the wrong person. (Believe it or not, people sometimes lie to collections agencies.) So the biggest thing you may have to deal with is continued harassment by the agency. If they think you are lying to them, you can expect more phone calls and more harassment. The FTC has a FAQ page about debt collection. If you hear from them again, don't fall for any intimidation tactics that they might say to you. Just tell them not to contact you again, and report them if they do. They will eventually get the message and go away.
