"Your question is expressed as a run-on sentence, which I'm having trouble parsing. Maybe you could restate. I'm just pointing out the stupidity of the statist canard that [the debt is not a problem because] ""we owe it to ourselves"". Collectivists like to think we're all in this together, but that's not reality. Some people are taking from others by force of law. The debt is owed to BANKS, and they want to keep this system going. Wouldn't you like to have a legal monopoly on the supply of currency? Institutions which are funded by loose credit (government, academia, military contractors, crony corporations) likewise benefit from this system. Those who invest in US dollars, and those who are farthest from the central planning spigot are the losers in this scheme. But there is more debt than currency, so it can't ever be repaid. So that is a moot point - it can't even hypothetically be considered. There are however a number of other ways that this system could unwind, when it inevitably does. The banks could be left to fail, and their assets would be bid on by others through the bankruptcy process. Or the Fed could keep issuing currency to keep the banks solvent, eventually inflating the whole system into irrelevance."
