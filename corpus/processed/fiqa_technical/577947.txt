"Investing in a company that loses money with the mindset ""its good for the environment"" is not something I will be doing. I'm all for Tesla building cars. Just not going to risk this with my money. Maybe it will be a mistake and when I'm 80 I will look back and go damn it was the next Microsoft but thats the decision I'm making."
