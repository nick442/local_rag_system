I believe it. We switched to CenturyLink a few years ago to save a few bucks. I was regretting it within the first day. They guaranteed a certain speed, but I wasn't getting it. I had to fight with them for days to prove they weren't fulfilling their guarantee. I was so happy when I finally got out of the contract and went back with my previous ISP.
