Dude! I specifically said big businesses got paid. But you IMPLIED big Business was more altruistic, was the great giver of our infrastructure. Now you’re telling me the financial sector pays for everything, and should be loved for it, as if they aren’t making money off the loans either. Back to the beginning: Big money is not to be thanked for our infrastructure. The government is. Big money is the parasite using that infrastructure to leech money from the government as many ways as they can. Every item you have pointed out is another place where big money has gained off the government. We need to relearn thatbpeopke are more important than money, and it starts with big money being held responsible for its practices and how those practices affect We the People. Well, maybe we should make the Media accountable first.
