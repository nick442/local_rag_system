Land value tax is only one part of a proper tax system, and doesn't play well with free trade. Taxing land creates a competitive advantage to importing goods. It works in the 1700s, but with free trade and cheap, efficient transportation of goods it drives local production out of business. To properly tax land, you have to do it in a way that doesn't allow production outside your borders that earns money from your economy to escape those taxes.
