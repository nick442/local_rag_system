"It's not my job to address your points. You have dumb points based upon what you think is ""fair"". There is no true meaning to that word. You and the millions of others who watch/read the news, whether it be Reddit or Fox News, have this weird fixation on ""the problem"". I don't know why people are obsessed with ""the problem"", but it's really pervasive in society. * What is ""the problem"" with this generation? * What is ""the problem"" with music today? * What is ""the problem"" with Hollywood? * What is ""the problem"" with the government? * What is ""the problem"" with the economy? * What is ""the problem"" with people? (bibically, they're sinners!) My advice is to stop thinking everything is a problem. Make your null assumption that everything is working well (not perfectly but alright). Then, use some logic and focus to really decide if there's a problem that's going to cause the end of civilization as we know it or not."
