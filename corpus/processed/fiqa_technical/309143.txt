The other aspect that you're not mentioning that makes TJ so special is their churn rate. Because they only sell a limited number of versions per category (no multiple brands -mostly self branded) nothing just sits on the shelves. So they do massive amounts of volume on almost everything that gets put in their store. also I have never seen anywhere sell macadamia nuts anywhere close to their price.
