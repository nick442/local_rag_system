"In this context, we're talking about terms of art in accounting, specifically double-entry book-keeping. In accounting lingo, an ""asset"" account represents an actual asset and it's value. So if you buy a car with a loan for $10,000, you apply a $10,000 debit to the asset account and a $10,000 credit to the loan. Debits and credits are confusing when you first start learning about accounting."
