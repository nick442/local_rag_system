> So, for every trading partner, you need a unique EDI process. You don't have EDI operators in US? Our EDI operator accepts all the regular standard and maps them to our needs so we don't have to worry about EDI message mappings. >inbound invoices, they have to be handled differently depending on what is purchased. In our process we ideally have PO number that we send to supplier and then we match the PO number to the invoice that supplier sends to us. All the postings come automatically from the PO from ERP. For invoices that we can't apply the PO number process we can make automatic posting rules. Some suppliers can provide row data or we can OCR it from the invoice. Mobile phone bills are great example of that. We just make a rule that number 555-555-555 has this posting and this cost center and if the sum is less then X it will be posted automatically by that rule. I agree that it would take a lot of time if we had to do this process in terms of the suppliers and one supplier at a time.
