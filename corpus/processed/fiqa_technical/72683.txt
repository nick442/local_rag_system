Interesting thing is not all of this analysis is typically done by the person you are speaking with re: your mortgage. Likely there is an economic team (at some institution or another, as many many loans are sold/distributed in some fashion), finance team, and all of them are looking at various rates etc. Typically what is offered is matching an offsetting liability somewhere else. So there may be cases where the spread someone is looking to pick up might be tighter or looser within institutions or types of institutions vs others, even though the overall market is at one place. (e.g. banks vs. insurance companies). So you may have negotiating room at a certain term, but not another, or the reverse at another firm. One firm might have lots of 10 year money, while another might be limited, so will be picky in what they choose. Either more conservative loan terms/ltv, or a higher spread, for example. So many things go into the ultimate rate someone can get, but in theory the blog did a decent job.
