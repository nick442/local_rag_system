> but their prices aren't that bad on many things They're often somewhat more expensive in my experience, but they carry products you can't get anywhere else (sustainably harvested/produced meat/fish, products with no artificial color/flavor, niche organic products, quality hot/cold bar, etc.) while providing employees a living wage and customers a superior experience. If you chose to shop there you know you're paying a premium for the later two.
