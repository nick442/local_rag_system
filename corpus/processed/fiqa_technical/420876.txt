The hell are you talking about? Yahoo doesn't own Alibaba. They owned a stake in the company they got in 2005, long before Mayer had anything to do with the company. Mayer sold off $7B of this stake in 2012, and kept ~$1.3B of that to finance more idiotic acquisitions where she'd overspend and then lay off all the staff and shut down the products she bought.
