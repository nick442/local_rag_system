"As trane_0 suggested above, I am not questioning the validity of the study by Kenichi Ueda and Beatrice Weder Di Mauro. I don't doubt that there is some discount to the risk premium demanded in the market for the debt of systemically important banks. What I am doubting is that this is a ""subsidy"" by the US government. This is a ""subsidy"" by bond investors, not the US government. Additionally, it is based on the assessment of risk by those investors as there is no explicit guarantee by the US government (see Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns). There is no transfer of wealth by the US government and therefore there is no active subsidy."
