The biggest hedge funds seem to be copying the large mutual fund company strategy. Launch many funds. Take positions with high beta to the sector or asset class that is the focus of the fund. Wait and see which asset classes outperform. (For Och-Ziff: Their massive bullish bet on credit!) Promote the outperforming funds and their portfolio manager to gullible investors.
