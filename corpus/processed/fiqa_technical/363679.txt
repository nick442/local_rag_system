">We are talking about the SEC conference, right? A bachelor's degree, right? Four years of that is $25K-$50K (depending) just in tuition, and it completely ignores books, or inflated housing, or opportunity cost. So WTF are you on? Less than 10K? Do you mean annually?? 50k? For fucking who? Vandy? Everyone else is <20 in state, max, before scholarships. They're cheap as hell, and COLA is cheap as hell in most of the college towns. Keep saying finance ""pays worse than trades."" Fucking idiotic. I graduated a while ago. Been in finance and consulting, know the market well. All of your ideas about the field are **embarassingly wrong.**"
