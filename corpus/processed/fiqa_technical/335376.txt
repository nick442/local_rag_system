"You're being scammed. I'd be willing to bet this 'celebrity' friend is a fake account on Instagram with 20k followers that befriends lonely neckbeards then tries to scam them. Save your money. Even if this is a legitimate long term friend whom you trust, you should put a lot more thought into ""investing"" money (that you don't have) into her brothers drug shop."
