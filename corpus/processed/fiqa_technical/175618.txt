>Thats fine and dandy, but it would never ever pass congress. So the people should elect a congress that aren't such a bunch of blindly ideological fools. If they choose not to do this, then let them go down with the ship. The point is that cutting government employees in the middle of a period of low economic growth is not a way to fix anything. Also I'll just add that Australia is no miracle economy, our government should be lauded for the way they handle the purse strings, but they simultaneously inflated a massive property bubble (currently deflating gently - for now) which still poses large threat to our immediate future. That said our budget situation is in a good place, even if we have run a few deficits lately.
