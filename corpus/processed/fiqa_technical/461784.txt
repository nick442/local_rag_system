The point of Lewis' speech is that society and culture has (wrongly) been attributing all success to skill alone, and almost completely discounted luck of opportunities as a factor. It is a given that successful people work hard, they have to in order to make the most of the opportunities they were given. But the general consensus has been that people who are not successful are not simply because they lacked somehow in skill, determination or dedication. In doing so, as a society, we (well, the majority anyway) have allowed ourselves to become emotionally separated from those who aren't presented with the same opportunities and instead attribute their failure in life to lack of the aforementioned attributes.
