"You hit on the biggest advantage of keeping things out of tax-advantaged accounts: Easier access to the money. It hurts to take money out of a 401(k) early. It may hurt more in the future. (Do you think the reason the 10% penalty is there in order to protect you from yourself?) It also may be converted into a vehicle besides what you have it in now, due to a ""national liquidity crisis."" You have plenty in tax-advantaged accounts, IMO."
