I moved to England (from the US) for my second half of university, during those two years my tuition in the U.K. was almost the same as in-state tuition in the US, and I had gone to an out of state school the year before so I actually saved money when I moved abroad. It's actually pretty damn easy if people bother to put in an effort to move to Europe from the United States for higher education, as many institutions here have lower costs even for non-EU citizens, accept US federal loads, have majors in English, offer easy to obtain student visas, and while you're here you have access to their healthcare, get to experience a new culture, might learn a new language, etc. People think it is impossible or pointless; it is not.
