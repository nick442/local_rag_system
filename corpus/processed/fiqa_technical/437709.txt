Well from that perspective nothing is legal. The legal team we had were not stupid. They put it right in the job description that they had to be Christians because there is a solid history of similar cases that the employers have won. This is the only way in which the company would have been this brazen. They put a big bulls eye on themselves by doing this and no one has sued because other lawyers also know the case history. Unfortunately I do not know the case history as I'm not a lawyer.
