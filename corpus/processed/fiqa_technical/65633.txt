American workers generally get an average of 10 days paid vacation a year, sometimes with a few extra sick days; but a full time American worker averages taking only 5-7 days a year. I'm an American worker and I get 1 day a year. After 5 years, I get 2 more. That one day is vacation and sick leave. I work for a US based multi billion dollar company as an hourly employee.
