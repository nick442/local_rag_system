Jez, i didn't know their export market was so bad.Down 85% in some areas. I used to have a lot of Japanese electronics. Now I only have a Sony Blue Ray player that hooks to my KoreanTV. It isn't near as good as the similar Apple TV and Sony has no way (unlike Apple) to get money from movie purchases, songs etc. It looks like they have even worse crony capitalism than the US. Older people ripping off the younger folks who don't have a future - all to keep a huge bubble from bursting. Anyone know much about the story of Japanese organized crime threatening to kill the British exec who found accounting fraud? What a mess.
