In major East Coast cities, the universities often own large tracts of real-estate because they're simply very rich institutions with the longest lifespans and time horizons in the entire city. But yeah, MIT is pretty much *the* engineering school in the United States. CalTech can *maybe* compete. And no, I'm not saying that because I like MIT. I think they're suicide-inducing slave-mongers with a depressing campus who own half of Cambridge but pay no property taxes because they're a university. I *like* the land-grant state universities and went to UMass Amherst.
