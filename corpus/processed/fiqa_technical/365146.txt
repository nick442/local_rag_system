I kind of answered this as well, but I'll re-word it Too expensive. Fiber cables are expensive to place, takes a lot of time, and nobody is willing to pay it; or at least not the people that COULD front the bill. (Being Comcast or TWC) Cities aren't willing to help much unfortunately. A great story of what happens when a city does help with these installation fees is Oldes, Alberta in Canada. The city helped install all the wires and now has one of (of not the fastest) Internet connection in the country.
