Hi I have a question about net worth value of rich people on those forbes lists. For example most of those rich people have high net worth because they are shareholders. Do they take into account that if they want to sell all their assets then actually they would receive much less in cash (as the stock price would drastically drop) or is it just the nominal net worth (i.e. the value of all their at the current price)
