Did you just assume my nationality? How dare you.. We should not talk about military spending as long as Germany's budget is at 1.2% of the GDP instead of the 2% that was agreed on in NATO contracts. Btw, the US' military spending is at 3.3% of their GDP. And I'd rather have a state that concentrates on its core tasks than one that blasts more than 40% of its annual expenditures into social welfare while neglecting the rest.. And the German healthcare system is crumbling. It used to generate at least 9 billion euro in deficit every single year; despite the fact that you have to pay 15,5% special healthcare tax and despite the billions pumped into the system from other sources. It's basically funded by the upper 10%; not voluntarily of course. The only thing that keeps it afloat at this point are the insanely low base interest rates of the ECB. And German mandatory public pension funds are a Ponzi scheme.. PS: you obviously don't understand the concept of subcontracted labour if you think it's a bad thing.
