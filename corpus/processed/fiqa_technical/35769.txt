>He changed it at the Hayden Planetarium before the vote. They built the planetarium with one less planet instead of adding 4 more. >It's not. It is more massive, not larger. It's similar in both size and orbit. And so is Quaoar, and so is Sedna, and so is Eris, and on and on. There have, since 2000, been more than a dozen dwarf planets discovered that are all almost the exact same size as Pluto with the same lack of gravitational pull to make them classified as planets. >The definition of planet is arbitrary and it would be easy to make a definition to include or exclude. The decision to lead the charge for declassify is a publicity move that worked very well for him. And again, you would be here saying the same fucking thing if the IAU had gone the other way and now we were teaching kids about the 22 planets of the solar system. And then 23. And 24. And on and on as we find more and more. I'm sorry you disagree with the classification, but it has zero to do with publicity of Neil Degrasse Tyson and everything to do with astrophysicists needing a way to classify these celestial bodies that they are constantly discovering. Sounds like you got a personal beef with /u/neiltyson more than a problem with the IAU classification though, for some unknown reason.
