"One of two things is true: You own less than 5% of the total shares outstanding. Your transaction will have little to no effect on the market. For most purposes you can use the current market price to value the position. You own more than 5% of the total shares outstanding. You are probably restricted on when, where, and why you can sell the shares because you are considered part owner of the company. Regardless, how to estimate (not really ""calculate,"" since some of the inputs to the formula are assumptions a.k.a. guesses) the value depends on exactly what you plan to with the result."
