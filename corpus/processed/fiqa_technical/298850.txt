I'm down to hate Monsanto but the people who actually do are terrible at explaining why. Always such flimsy, easily falsifiable taking points. If you want me to be concerned about Nestle's terrible labor practices and monstrous position on water availability, don't tell me the Quik rabbit is a gay Muslim.
