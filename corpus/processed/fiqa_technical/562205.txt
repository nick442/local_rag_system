"Wrong. Between Ford (1914) and FDR's Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) the middle class formed. Unions forming from textile plants pushed for what became the FLSA. The middle class didn't exist in any society prior to this. Unions pushed for the things that made modern society possible. The right has been conned into wanting to dismantle all of that even though the only people who would benefit are the top 1%. This is why the rest of us call you dupes or dummies. Edit: A ""slow down"" is no shortage. You said it generally as well. There's no overall housing shortage."
