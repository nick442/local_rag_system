HP needs to knuckle down and focus on core principles if they want to survive. Time was they were synonymous with printing, they need to get back to that. Stop making disposable inkjets that are cheaper to replace than purchase ink for. Start making bulletproof hardware with 100,000 duty cycles like the old HP Laserjet 4s that many companies still run because the new stuff is shite.
