Cristina from Avangate :) Well, most of your shoppers will not even know that you outsource online purchase activity to a payment provider, unless the solution you select, is not capable to integrate with the look and feel on your business. If talking about Avangate, I can share some insights that our clients buyers usually appreciate: 1. Geographical Location - translated payment pages based on IP that present also the price in local currency and allow them to pay with a local payment method, if available (ex. Brazil - credit card with instalments - Portuguese); 2. Financial Support - specific area, called myAccount, where shoppers can track relevant info about how to renew/upgrade or get in contact with the merchant; 3. Taxes and VAT management - if you are targeting both B2C and B2B customers, the possibility of getting an invoice that can be presented for accounting/bookkeeping is very important. Should you be interested in having a more detailed discussion, make sure to get in touch with me - I'll be happy to chat :) cristina.rotari@avangate.com
