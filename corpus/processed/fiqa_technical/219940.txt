All this speculation and no one really has the right idea what's going on. It has almost nothing to do with VAT and nothing to do compliance. [It has everything to do with a very a chronically weak Euro.](https://www.google.com/finance?client=safari&rls=en&q=eur&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=we) Apps in the App Store are tied to tiers. My app sells at tier 10. For USD, this means I sell my app for $10 and make $7 after their cut. Tier 10 used to translate to 7,99€. Now it's 8,99€. This means before the hike I, as an American, would get 4,79€ or $6.19 after the exchange. This wasn't a problem back when the app store opened. The economy was relatively strong and the Euro stood around 1.5 to one American dollar. This means in 2008 I'd get about the same $7 after the conversion. With the Euro crisis, the tiers remained the same which meant each European sale only netted around $5.75, a $1.25 discount for each European. The Euro conversion was a long standing issue and the price hike restores the exchange back to the $7 dollars it used to be.
