I'm a finance manager at a dealership. The thing that I tell people about leasing: It's good if you plan to make more money in the future. You can get a new car. The downside of leasing. When you get out of your lease you will either pay straight cash, get another loan for the unit, or get a new unit. 3 years down the road you have no idea what interest rates will be. If you lock in your rate today you are guaranteed that rate. With the government increasing rates we could see higher rates that could cost you more. Also if you get a loan today it will be 5-6 years. Leasing will have a 3 year lease with another 5-6 year loan on top of that. Causing to pay more in the long run If your brother doesn't have straight cash to pay for it at the end of 3 years I recommend buying new
