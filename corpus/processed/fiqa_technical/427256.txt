"It's about god damned time. I feel like American cell phone companies have been purposely keeping speeds slow so they can later get people to upgrade to ""super fast 4g service"" that the rest of the world considers average. It's like they've been keeping the bar set so low for so long to reduce consumer expectations, and then they overcharge for speeds that are normal for other parts of the world."
