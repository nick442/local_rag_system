> Essentially what the author is saying, I think, is that wages have been replaced in part by provided services, whether we want or need them, or not. The report mentioned in the article finds wages stagnated when adjusted for inflation, not cost of living. This means the increased costs of Internet, cable, and cell service are not accounted for in the stagnant wages and people have to pay for them on top of not getting paid more. > ..we should ignore what we are being paid, and just be happy with all the gadgets we can get on the cheap, and the services that are provided for us. Funny how that attitude doesn't apply when we talk about raising taxes on the wealthy.
