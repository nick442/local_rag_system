AI will take much more jobs than it creates. **The whole idea of AI is to take jobs away from humans.** The government can control this by regulations. For example, make a law that all customer service, specifically talking to people when doing work for them, must be done by humans. Then, AI is just a tool at the hands of humans. Chances the government make such laws: very very small. They care more about saving money for corporations than the well being of people.
