Yes, he has done a few companies over the course of his career and done fairly well, at the time of his teaching the course he had two companies operating under him and would also consult (for free) for another few that started up as a result of the course. He was pretty wealthy but he did say that he really wanted to some day buy himself a brand new aston martin so not wealthy enough to do that yet hahah. The other profs in the entrepreneurship stream of commerce at my school were all quite successful in their ventures. The program expects students to have launched a company by the time they graduate with ~1 million in revenue (not profit). But that's a soft target. I only took a couple of the courses as electives out of personal interest. It was pretty interesting and the main value i got from the courses was that it really shows you how to think about new ideas and how viable they may be. They really get your mind working a bit differently in those classes. But yeah I totally agree with you, when there's profs teaching something they have zero practical experience in, especially a subject that really demands it like entrepreneurship, it's wack. My program overall was quite good for that though. I was in the accounting stream and I think almost all of my accounting profs didnt even have masters, but they did have accounting designations and a lot of experience in private firms and public administration a lot of the time so they knew their shit really well.
