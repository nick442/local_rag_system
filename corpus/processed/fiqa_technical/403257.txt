Prime Day is a poorly executed concept. You cannot put up items of which 90% are worthless and expect people to get excited. Black Friday is not about clearing your inventory of garbage. It's about kick-starting the shopping season. It's an entirely pointless exercise if you offer discounts on things no one wants.
