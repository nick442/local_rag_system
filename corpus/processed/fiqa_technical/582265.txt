"We need a new kind of economy that is actually economic, that ""saves"", rather than the one we have now that is largely based on waste. We need more jobs and higher wages so that everyone can work a little less hours and have the time to go back to doing a few things for themselves like gardening, or even walking their own dog instead of paying someone to do it. We need to include the ""cradle to grave"" costs of products into the price so that someone can get paid to take it apart and actually recycle it instead of land filling it. And, we need to build products better, in the first place so that each item lasts longer before needing to be recycled. The last 2-3 decades, we have been so focused on getting a lot of stuff as cheap as possible. We need to reverse that and buy less individual items of a higher quality so that they last a while. I am willing to spend more to buy a TV that will last 30 years like my parents TV did. Today's flat screens seem to be doomed at 2 years. We also need to focus on rebuilding and repairing what we were given by our parents and grandparents--the nations roads, bridges, pipelines, water systems, and landmark building--all of these things need to be repaired before they are beyond hope. Unfortunately, none of these things are going to happen."
