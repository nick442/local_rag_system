I'd be fine with taxes going up if they got spent on things that I agree with. Like universal healthcare for example. But we both know this will not happen. If taxes go up they'll get spent on messing with Iran and North Korea and building a wall with Mexico. And you still haven't shown me any evidence that more taxes are a good thing. In the absence of any evidence either way, I'd rather have more money.
