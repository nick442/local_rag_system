I think the surface is a very cool machine in that it combines a lot of features from different devices: touch screen and portability of a tablet, specs and operating system of a laptop, and the on screen stylus of a Wacom cintiq. I think they messed up by dropping Wacom for the Surface 3, and that may have turned more than a few artists away from the device. I like the idea of it, even if the execution is still a little lacking.
