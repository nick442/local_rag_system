Anytime the Government gets into subsidizing something, it becomes more expensive. This happened with housing in the 1920s/30s when they deemed all Americans need to own a house, Medicine when they started Medicare/Medicaid in the 1960s, and Education which iirc they started with the GI Bill at the tail end of WW2 and student loans shortly thereafter. Credit allows people to spend money they don't have now, causing what prices these systems can charge to rise, and encourages serfdom servicing the loan later in life. Add to that the accreditation system and Education becomes the expensive tollbooth to many jobs that worked on an apprenticeship system before (pay you a token wage learning the trade, and maybe room and board in some cases). The middle classes have been getting plundered the last decades, and it shows from the country going from 1 breadwinner households with luxury time to 2 breadwinner households with unpaid overtime in many cases to afford the same or lower standard of living.
