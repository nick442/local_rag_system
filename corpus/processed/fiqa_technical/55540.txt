That's fearmongering. You think a California farmer's going to farm watermelons at that price? HELL NO! They will pick something else that has a better profit margin while the midwest farms will start to produce it. If the Midwest farmers can't because it's still too costly for consumers (doubt it), then we will import them. Simple economics..
