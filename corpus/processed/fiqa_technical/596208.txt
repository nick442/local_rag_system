This guy is doing you a *huge* favor by taking his time out to talk to you. These people are under enormous time constraints and you need to act accordingly. Don't babble on about what you're doing as an intern; the company could have hundreds of interns doing this exact same thing, and it's probably boring as hell. Focus on asking high level questions about his career, his lessons learned, and his vision for the company. This man is going to be a treasure trove of advice and knowledge. Don't waste it talking about the LBO model you cranked out last week.
