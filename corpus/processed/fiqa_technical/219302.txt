"The McDonald's affair was plain and simple petty politics, which Russian politics is full of. Only 4 branches were closed all in center Moscow, including the symbolic 1st and largest in Europe McD. This was a populist (and stupid) move intended to ""flip the bird"" at ""American Imperialism"" and ""avenge"" for their exit from the Crimean penninsual. Economically speaking McDs hire over 35k people, besides being supplied almost exclusively by domestic (Russian) food manufacturers. Even if Russian unemployment rates are at record low (4.9%), 35k posts being lost overnight, besides suppliers and 3rd party service providers, the impact will be colossal. >""About time they closed !"" - Gladly said 28-year-old Anton, just a few seconds before was trying in vain to open the door of the restaurant - ""If due to sanctions, even better then !"" >""Were you not about to go in ?"" >""No! That is - yes .. But just so I could chat with my friends"" - Anton embarrassed. And switched to friend: >""Let's go to KFC"" [Food isn't the most important at McDonald's](http://www.kp.ru/daily/26271/3149400/) - This is a Russian tabloid (Komsamolskiy Pravda) but the idiosyncracy is very plausible."
