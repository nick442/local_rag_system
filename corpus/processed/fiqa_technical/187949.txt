I'm going to assume that the 401K is not a Roth. If that's the case, no, you should not withdraw from your 401K to pay off your mortgage. You will pay taxes on the withdrawal as if it is income, and that loss will far exceed the 6% you are paying in interest on the mortgage (which is deductable, so may actually be less than 6% all things considered). The calculation is really more complicated, but in general, this sounds like a bad idea.
