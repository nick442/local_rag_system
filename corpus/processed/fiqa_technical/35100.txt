I can only answer in hypotheticals since it doesn't exist, but I could imagine chip readers becoming common place to verify integrity of the ID. Add a federal mandate on things like TSA checkpoints, hotel reservations, etc. and you get a lot of data real quick. There's plenty of ways for it to be abused. My question is, what would a national ID card solve?
