It depends on a couple of things. One is your age -- if you're recently out of college that's totally fine; if you've been a professional for a long time then you may want to go a bit more formal. It also depends on the kind of investment firm and how client-facing the role / firm is. For example, I used to be at a firm where interviewing in shorts and a t-shirt would've been completely acceptable but I wouldn't suggest that at a white-shoe bank.
