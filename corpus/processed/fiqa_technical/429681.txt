I'm not sure what you are trying to say. I just saw the following statement in your reply which is inaccurate: >Bjartr mentioned the heat index being 102°F. This would mean you'd have to get your skin temp higher than 102°F which would mean your core temp is even higher (dangerously high). Not sure if you momentarily confused heat index with dew point or what.
