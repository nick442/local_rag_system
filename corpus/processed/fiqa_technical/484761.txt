"I'll chime in as someone who started a business after my first year in college. That business kept me going for a couple decades and allowed me to retire young. First thought - ""you don't just start a business"" with no idea what you're going to do. When you have a true passion, you'll know it. Once you discover something that you love to do, you will find that you dedicate your time to it and it won't feel like work. You'll spend countless hours on it becoming 'great' at it. It will be obvious that you should pursue it. If you don't feel like this, then you'll very likely give up when you need to double down. Or, if it's really a good business idea, you won't be competitive. Starting and running a business may be the hardest thing you'll ever do. When your friends are out partying, you'll be coding, or stocking shelves or writing ad copy or paying bills or cleaning toilets. When the business has a bad month, you'll forgo your income so you can pay your employees or other bills. But you'll love it and believe in what you're doing, so you'll keep going. It seems trite but so much will just come down to persistence and hard work. Over time, you'll become one of the best at what you do. But that will take years. Years before you'll likely make enough money to survive. So for most people, you'll have to get a conventional job to pay the bills. As you try to sell yourself or your product, you have to keep asking yourself ""would I spend my money on this?"" If you wouldn't, why would anyone else? Always remember that. The positive thing is, if you find your calling, you'll keep thinking ""I have the best job in the world!"" and it won't feel like work. It will just be what you do."
