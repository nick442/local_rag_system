There are two answers to this (excluding central banks which are really just a banks to private banks): **Please note: This is an oversimplification and not accounting for the fact that banks operate in both categories now. ** Banks are either depository institutions or financial service/transaction providers. * Depository institutions are your typical retail bank (regions, boa retail, wells fargo retail, etc). They accept deposits from account holders and lend out via reserve lending to mortgages and business loans for their revenue generation. * Financial service/transaction providers are better known as IBanks. You have your Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, etc. These have traditionally been banks that do not accept deposit accounts but revenue generation comes from financial services such as asset management and research or from financial transaction facilitation such as market making (offering both buy/sell quotes in capital markets). This is generally the role that banks have played historically from the medieval ages on.. They started out as being entities that provided access to connecting buyers and sellers of markets.
