The companies that are directly affected by climate change are the ones to watch. For example wineries and wine regions, where the wines made are specific to the climate. Burgundy for example needs very specific temperatures to make Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Other regions may be able to switch grape varietals to match the changing climates, but in Europe you can't just plant whatever you want.
