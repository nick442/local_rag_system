"Hans Rosling has pointed out that most people have worse ideas about large issues in the world (specifically development, trends, etc.) than would be developed from random (""I asked the chimps and they got it right 33% of the time""). Highly educated people world-wide are wrong on poverty in the world, mortality, wealth distribution, economic variations in regions, etc. in vastly higher numbers than can be accounted for by no knowledge, it's rather wrong knowledge (bad generalization rules). The generalization rules come from teachers, books, materials, etc. that have not incorporated the vast amounts of change (the emerging areas of stability and affluence in sub-Saharan Africa following the path of Korea for example) or the fact that world population will stabilize at 40% African, 40% Asian, etc at 11-12 billion people with zero growth as soon as those currently born are all reproducing and current generations reach death age as we are currently at zero population growth rates world-wide. The videos are quite entertaining and informative (there are a lot of them as Hans Rosling tried to spread the word about this from 2003 on) It's about making use of the data that we have (most of which is hidden in hard-to access charts, reports, data bases, etc -- Gapminder is devoted to summarizing and displaying this in easily understood forms"
