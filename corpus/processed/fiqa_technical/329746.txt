MoneysavingExpert has a regularly updated page about the best cards to use outside the UK. At the moment Halifax has a good credit card but you will pay interest on the cash withdrawal. I have a FairFX pre-paid card but that requires a UK address for the card delivery (at least) and can be topped up online from a UK bank account.
