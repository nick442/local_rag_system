Scenario A: get a $60 tank of gas once a month, immediately pay it off when I get home Scenario B: Spend about $300 in $25-$50 increments throughout the month on things like groceries, food, gas, etc, but immediately pay it off every time Would my credit get better and/or faster in Scenario B due to the more use?
