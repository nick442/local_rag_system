You are right, there is a lot to be said for Europe right now: that they have been delusional for decades, and that now it has finally caught up to them. Why on earth would we want to emulate a continent that has had economic problems so massive they have led to riots? Is your solution really to force broke people to take vacations? How will that lead to economic prosperity?
