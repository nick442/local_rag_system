"No it isn't. The argument behind the OP's post is that success is attributable to your ""luck"" to be born as a white, middle to upper class American. Even if you replace the word ""luck"" with ""random chance"" success is still far more dictated by your own actions. I have plenty of friends from high school who had far more privilege than I and have been far less successful. Our school's valedictorian was from a middle class family, but our salutatorian was poor white trash, both have become immensely rich, like sailing yacht and E-Class rich. Something I haven't mentioned yet, I didn't figure this shit out until I was 23. It took me another two or three years to dig myself out of the hole I dug waiting around trying to get ""lucky."" If I had taken responsibility for my life at age 18, or hell at age 12 like my wife, I would be driving a god damned Lamborghini by now. Because of my own stupidity the best I'll probably do now is a M3, we'll see. I personally *love* cars, but you can insert whatever personal aspirations you have, material or otherwise, into that sentence. On that note, I don't suggest that financial success is the only kind of success. When I was younger I dreamed of moving someplace very remote and surviving off the land. It would have taken responsibility and hard work to achieve that goal, not luck. It's best to take some responsibility for your life and stop going through it like a pinball bouncing from random event to random event. But don't do so on my account, I want you all to be successful. I want to work with people who are responsible and hard working. I want to be friends with people who are responsible and hard working. I'm proud of my friends who are more responsible and hard working than I am, not jealous."
