> If you bought a Barbi doll for a 6 year old boy who obviously doesn't want it and won't play with it, would you say the toy is bad? Of course not and I also would not blame the boy for having no fun. > School being paid for and given to kids that don't want it doesn't mean it's a bad system, just that some have no interest in using it. Right, so do you give up on the kid or do you try to offer a different form of education that the kid finds compelling? It sounds like you want to assume that if a boy doesn't like Barbie he must not like toys at all.
