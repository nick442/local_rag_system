Issuing/selling equity vs debt is often done during very different periods of a company's life cycle and for very different reasons. If I were to generalize - equity is most typically involved in the beginning and end of a business, debt in the middle. In the beginning your company has no cash flow, no track record so the only people willing to invest are angels/venture capitalists/true believers/friends & family. People who are willing to take risk either because they like you or they believe there is a chance of high risk/high reward. In the middle of the life cycle (when the company has a demonstrated track record), it is easier to issue debt because you have stable cash flows which banks find attractive. Banks are low risk, low return investors. Towards the end of a company's life cycle the owners may decide they have successfully grown a business and want to retire (or start a new business) or maybe they just want to lock in the earnings they've achieved which are sitting in the company. In this case they may sell the company entirely to a rival firm or a private equity group. I feel like OP's original question is a bit off because I don't find too many situations where a company is seriously considering both equity and debt alternatives. Usually it is a variety of equity offerings **or** a variety of debt offerings and you're trying to figure out which one is better of the company.
