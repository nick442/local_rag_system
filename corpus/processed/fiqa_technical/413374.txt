Thanks for starting this thread. Interesting to see I'm not the only one that is thinking about this. There's a lot of exchanges out there. I found that coinmarketcap.com gives quite a decent overview. I found this great website: https://www.coincheckup.com For a complete crypto analysis on every single tradable crypto out there.
