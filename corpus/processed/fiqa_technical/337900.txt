Seattle's unemployment rate is 3.1%. This has been pretty flat for years and falling some over the past year. The authors finding of 5000 unemployed, which would cause an increased unemployment rate of 0.7%, is inconsistent with unemployment rate and methods used by other studies. I am very skeptical that this paper using new, untested methods, which get a different result then two other methods, is showing a real effect.
