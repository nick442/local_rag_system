"Except here's the problem. Sunglasses for example are something you'd be a fool to buy online without trying them on first. So you go to a store, try on a pair of ray-bans that cost $260, and you get them online for $120. The problem is that when all the stores disappear, we no longer have that option. Honestly I did this at Sunglass Hut.. I bought them on an impulse, found the model online, and returned them and said: ""I wouldn't care if it was $40 difference - being able to try them on is worth it. But you're selling them for double what I can get them for online, so I'm going to return these. I feel like an ass, but you guys don't price match."" The 19 year old girl probably didn't care too much on my rant, but maybe one day it'll get to the company's management."
