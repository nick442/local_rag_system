Hold on a moment - you were getting 5-7.5% commission on a product that only had a 40% gross margin? That's.. amazingly high. Really. Considering that you are saying that the cost of goods sold for a typical TV is 60% (which sounds close enough to be realistic - my business is typically about 56% COGS), and then add to that the overhead of base salary, utilities, leasehold and leasehold improvements, taxes, operating costs.. Sears was probably making a final total of about 2% net margin on that TV sale, which isn't particular great. Getting paid a commission that high on commodity goods is really quite good.
