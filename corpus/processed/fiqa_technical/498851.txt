>Let's be honest though; you would to if accepting reality meant that your way of life, your job, your grossly inflated salary, etc. just dried up over night. I can't speak for everyone else, but for me personally: Hell no. I work for a telecommunications company and network neutrality is terrible for us. Our management has actually asked us to volunteer to contribute to anti-neutrality PACs. Local municipal broadband initiatives in rural areas (our territory is largely rural) are opposed strongly by my company. And you know what? If those local broadband collectives eat our lunch and cause the demise of my company? I'm totally fine with it. I'll find another job somewhere else. I am not cheering for my own company's downfall - far from it - but if it happens due to competition, I'm not going to stand in the way.
