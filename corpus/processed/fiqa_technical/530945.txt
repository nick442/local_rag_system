You also can control how much of the economy the government holds dominion over. Restricting what interest groups the government can and should listen to and under what circumstances is a slippery slope back towards tyranny. One man's asshole is another man's victim. We've established that interest group politics disincentivize the government to act efficiently. Thats pretty much the beginning and the end. Government can be trusted with law and foreign matters, but it cannot be trusted to adequately furnish goods and services.
