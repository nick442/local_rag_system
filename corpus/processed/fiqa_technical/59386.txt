As a Financial Engineer myself, I recommend this too. It allows you to pursue finance without dropping your technical skills. I still frequently program and resort to MATLAB at my current role at an investment bank. I started off as a computer engineer (hardware) and grabbed a CFA1 before getting a Quant Finance degree. Programs to consider (not an exhaustive list): * University of Michigan: Financial Engineering * Carnegie Mellon: Computational Finance * NYU: Mathematical Finance (I think) * U of Toronto: Mathematical Finance * Berkeley: Financial Engineering * Columbia: Financial Engineering Some universities call it Quantitative Finance as well. If I remember correctly, NYU and Berkely programs are very Math intensive and generally pretty tough to get into. Pretty much all your colleagues in these Quant Finance programs will be undergrad engineers with a small minority of hard sciences (like physics or math).
