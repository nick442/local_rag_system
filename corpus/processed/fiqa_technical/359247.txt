"*eyeroll* The context of my comment was education, which can be determined by the fact that you were discussing college, I brought up trade schools and I more generally referenced an ""educated populace. Try not reading into what isn't there. >Also you never did answer my question about high school/GEDs being good enough in your world are we dodging or are you just that fired up that I want to apply context to your statements? Yes, I did. I said ""there are many ways to achieve an educated populace."" That would include high school/GED, sure. It could include homeschooling, it could include traveling to another country, it could include studying with monks."
