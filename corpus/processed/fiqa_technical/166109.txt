Nope I live in Orange County. I get to put away some savings no lie but even still it's not like I'm driving a Tesla or BMW. No student loans that are out of control although I did pay off my education loans a bit fast but I only got stuck with those after dropping out and being unemployed for over a year. Learned to code and it helped a lot. Afterwards I had a bit of a personal fall out with drug and alcohol abuse when someone close to me passed away and since lifted myself up but it's not been easy because rent for a 1bedroom 600 sqft is around 1200-1500 here. After taxes I'm taking home maybe 2,2k plus car payment insurance personal insurance since I own my own business and being young and single means I get raped by taxes for whatever reason.
