Hedge fund idea: Cynic Capital 1. Create unclever, mostly-passive funds consisting of a sufficiently diverse array of holdings with historically* low volatility 2. Lever the shit out of it 3. Market it with excessive jargon to impress laymen 4. Attract investors with more money than sense 5. Make it up as you go along until you can hire actually smart, creative people down the road and pray that the market doesn't correct in the meantime Yeah it's stupid but why wouldn't it work? Furthermore, is this not basically what some hedge funds have done in the past? ^(*past performance not guaranteeing future performance yada yada yada)
