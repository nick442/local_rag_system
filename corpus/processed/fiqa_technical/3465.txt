"I'm from north jersey and not much of a gambler, so I'm def not their normal customer. But I'm young(ish) and have some extra cash - they need to find a way to get me and my crowd. I think if they did organized trips, like party-buses drive back/forth, cheap/reasonable hotel room prices, and maybe some entertainment - I'd go. And i'd drop enough money on shopping, restaurants, and booze to make it worthwhile. One problem is that when I think ""what should I do this weekend?"", driving 3 hrs to pay for parking so I can gamble at a rundown hotel doesn't seem to come to mind."
