You can see some IRS info on distinguishing a business from a hobby here. Nolo also has some info. The upshot is that you can only deduct losses if your activity is, in the judgement of the IRS, a for-profit endeavor. You don't have to make a profit right away, or make a profit every year, for it to be a for-profit endeavor, but you have to be able to convince the IRS that you're doing it in order to (eventually) make a profit, not just for fun. You can't just keep deducting the losses year after year if (as in the worst case you suggest) it never makes a profit and doesn't seem to have any chance of doing so.
