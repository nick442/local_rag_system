"Thanks for the advice. My phone autocorrects to ""résumé"". As far as the sophomore thing, I figured I might stay another quarter after 2 years if I am unsuccessful, but how would I market myself as a sophomore now? I have to turn in a resume for a program I am applying for through school by next month, so I have to put CC down on there. Once I get a GPA at UCLA, I figure I can omit the CC at that point."
