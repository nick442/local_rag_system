"If you're doing a masters, that's awesome! Being out of school is the toughest part! First thing I'd do is lean towards IT, it just naturally makes a lot of sense (not to say not to do strategy, too but its a whole different beast). You should sit down with career services at your school ASAP. They should help guide you through the process and tell you about timelines, firms that come to campus, etc. Since your in a MS you'd prob be applying for an Associate role. To get those you need to brush up and master a case interview (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT). Basically they sit you down in a room and ask you to solve a real world problem without a calculator. There are a number of books such as ""cracking the case"" that can help with that. Also, go on LinkedIn and start searching for alumni that are at your target companies. Network hard, it matters probably more than the interview. They can give you a really good ideas on how to position yourself, too. I'd also look at boutique firms that specialize in Comp. Sci related work. It's easier to switch into a McKinsey from a boutique, than as an outsider. Seems like you should be in good shape (much better than i had ignorantly assumed)! Best of luck! I hope this helps! Just remember, work hard at it and make sure it's for you!"
