"A lot of these arguments seem to be, ""Well, it might be better, therefore it *will* be better."" While many of the concerns seem trivial, what bothers me is the unaddressed pressure to partake in the enhancements, despite the social net we deploy to help those who fall behind. You won't be able to join the military unless you are enhanced. You won't be hired as a labourer unless you are enhanced. Management positions will go to the enhanced. Physician positions will go to the enhanced. Engineering jobs will go to the enhanced. The list will just increase over time. Now, you are mostly born into poverty, and getting out is a tough road. Soon, you will be able to choose poverty just by deciding to not getting enhanced. And what worries me about that is the unintended consequences of everyone getting enhanced. Will we all become super susceptible to the same disease? Might an enhancement actually turn into a time bomb? Right now genetic variability is what gives us long term viability. Will enhancements reduce both? That said, being able to live younger, longer, and to take a pill that will give me the psychological bent to actually enjoy life are two things I would find difficult to turn down. As for love, the mistakes I've made would suddenly become inconsequential."
