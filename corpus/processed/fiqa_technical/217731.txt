Yeah, having a $1B profit is a necessity. If only we could increase company profit to $1.5B by lowering taxes, those $500M would trickle down for sure. Company execs and shareholders are just greedy enough to pocket all the profits for themselves at the current tax level, but with a lower tax level they would share the additional proceeds fairly with those on the bottom. Right now we have: Profit - taxes = greed --> nothing left for increased wages While we could have: Profit - (taxes / 2) > greed --> money left for increasing wages
