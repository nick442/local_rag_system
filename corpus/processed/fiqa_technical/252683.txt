I posted this here because I thought it would get well thought out and intellectual responses, save this for r/politics. Responding to your replies to CuilRunnings, the truth can be simple, sure. But more often than not it is a shade of gray, not a pure, simple black or white, especially in a field as complex as economics. Also, CuilRunnings idea that you should be loyal to objective truth is not diminished if he/she does not follow it; it is still just as valid a point if he follows his own advice or not.
