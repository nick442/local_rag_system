".. interest rates will go up. When that happens prices will be kept down. (if you can only afford $1,500/month payments and the interest portion of the mortgage goes up then you have less to spend on the house) There are also millions of houses that are foreclosed or in some process of foreclosure that are being kept off the market. That ""shadow inventory"" being kept off the market is keeping supply artificially low. At some point the shadow inventory will be brought to market and as supply increases it will hold prices down. .. [housing prices could drop another 20% or more](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304299304577348083297932466.html).. and it could take a decde or more before the housing market works through the effects of the great recession. btw, I just refinanced again. It was easier this time than any of the other times I've refinanced. This time I got 2.875% for 10 years.. I'll save over 20 grand of interest over the next 10 years. The banks are loaning money out, and at incredibly low interest rates."
