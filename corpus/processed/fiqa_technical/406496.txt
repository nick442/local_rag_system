Former Boeing manufacturing / industrial engineer here. I worked in the Seattle metro area, mostly on widebody aircraft assembly. absoluteskeptic raises an excellent point. Trade offsets are a major driver for commercial aviation sales. It's pretty simple; if you want to sell into Japan or China or a lot of other markets, you have to bring aircraft work into the country. Of course you used to be able to just have fabrication work done, but nowadays the capabilities are more sophisticated and the ante is constantly being raised. In that sort of environment it's not surprising that sr. management felt a lot of pressure to go in the direction of more outsourcing, with bigger and bigger chunks of the airplane involved. That being said, it wasn't hard to see these types of problems coming. Especially when attempting to bring in major new technology (e.g. major structural elements made from composite). Boeing never seemed particularly strong at risk mitigation.
