The solution to this overly complex bullshit monetary system we currently find ourselves drowning in is to teach the next generation the concept of the *community*. Instead of competing for resources, the apple farmer, the hunter and the shoemaker must, by necessity, form a community. And they must be taught that competing against each other (capitalism) will doom everyone's existence. Thus, they must develop a cooperative mindset. BUT this cooperative mindset must still hold each person accountable, otherwise if someone becomes irresponsible and lazy, the system will break down (socialism). So there must be a cooperative mindset that holds individuals accountable; cooperation is the antidote to capitalism and accountability is the antidote to socialism. [Reminds me of a *family*](http://www.scribd.com/doc/34551310/The-Principles-That-Govern-Social-Interaction)--the most economically, socially and philosophically sound choice that alleviates us from the slavery and burden of money. In practical terms, this means whenever you view a business as a stranger or whenever a business becomes a stranger to you (big chains like walmart and home depot), you're competing against yourself. And whenever refuse to spank a family member exhibiting dysfunctional behavior (unions and the welfare system), you allow your community to rot from within. Capitalism is an attack from the outside that will kill a family, and socialism is an attack from within that will make a family die of malnutrition and poor oversight. A community mindset does not equate to an aggressive, dog-eat-dog yuppie or a passive, live and let live, hippie. The best fruit requires both a good soil *and* pruning, and the best society requires both cooperation and discipline.
