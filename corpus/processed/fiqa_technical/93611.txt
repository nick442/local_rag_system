"FTA: >SD: And to all the young filmmakers listening, I had 5% of the net of that movie. That was in my contract. And it cost $19 million. And it made $150 million worldwide. There's no net. That's how movie math works. I read a book some 20 years ago on screenwriting that said never to ask for a cut of the net profit, always ask for the gross. The net is what is left over after everyone else gets paid out of the gross and there's usually nothing left over. Sleazy folks love using this confusion over net vs. gross to hoodwink people. I remember when oil companies where in the news for their record profits, there would be people posting saying ""Oh, well, I'd like to see what the net is. This doesn't take into account exploration, development, and extrapolation data flux coupling. Which is all very expensive. The gross profit means nothing."""
