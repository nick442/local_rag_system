You're correct. Amazon literally doesn't give a shit if they don't make profits for a while on this business. Hell it's potentially possible that their 1P business is still in the red and just used for the platform. Amazon isn't looking at whole foods for profit in the short term or even on a 5 year time horizon. They're looking to expand their presence into the fresh market, give people a local touch point to pick up online orders, and get more people into their platform. It's completely likely you'll see some form of price decline. Edit: just wanted to add, this is far from new.
