"I note that each response to me includes a personal insult. You might want to ask yourself why you feel the need to be rude? If you're sure you're right, why not simply explain yourself to me? > You're advocating an incompetent business with an inefficient model to continue running just to keep people employed. I said nothing of the sort. In fact, I pointed out that these businesses must die. _I am simply deeply sad that these thousands of people must suffer_. Any compassionate person would feel the same way; the fact that I'm being downvoted at a huge rate indicates how few such people are. > You're further assuming that they'll stay unemployed and no other, more efficient firm will capitalize on the niche that opened up with sears' passing. Assume? Current labor statistics tell us that these people should be expecting at least a year of unemployment; and things are particularly bad in the retail sector. And it's not like there's any mystery on who the ""more efficient firm"" is - it's Amazon (and to a lesser extent, other online retailers). But ""more efficient"" actually means ""employs only a fraction of the number of workers of standard retailers"". Be honest - do you expect most of these people to get a new job as ""good"" as their old mediocre job within a year?"
