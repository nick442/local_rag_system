I use my Acer W500 (Windows 7 64bit) for browsing Internet (porn, news, reddit, wikipedia) and reading books. Haven't found any other reason to use it yet. Maybe if I would do some work that requires lot's of walk work and browsing inventory, it could have some additional use. I wonder what kind productivity improvements MS is planning.
