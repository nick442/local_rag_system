Pay to play in business is normal and completely ethical. You want to be in the Yellow pages, you have to pay. You want to be associated with an elite group of like businesses and share leads, you have to pay. You want to be in the Chamber of Commerce, you have to pay. There's tons of businesses that are in invite only groups that cost $10,000+ a year and $300 a month just for sharing leads and those leads are worth the cost.
