My shocking suggestion would be to not bandwagon onto knee jerk first idea that popped into the op's head actions. Instead.. Why not put the most knowlageable people on the issue, give them time to make a proposal. I am thinking quants and the folks that know the issues inside and out. Drives me up a wall that we have phds serving coffee and we still try and fix complex issues by racing to blurt out the first and loudest brainfart. Anyway, my brainfart might be not a tax. A randomized time delay based on typical trade execution might work. Small enough to be unnoticed by distant traders but enough to level the playing field. But again I would rather the answer didnt come from idiots such as myself and the op. I think the exchanges have some motivation to adress the issues. I hope they put the smartest folks available on it
