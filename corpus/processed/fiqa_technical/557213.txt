It makes sense as democrats tend to spend money more internally and republicans tend to spend more on foreign iniatitives. BUT, With such a small sample size you get too big of an error thrown in from the random timing of events. The internet boom had very little to do with Clinton. The housing bust had very little to do with Bush. Nixon, Ford and Carter were victim of the pent up inflation from artificially maintaining the Gold standard for too long. Eisenhower had massive war debt dropped on his lap. I suspect that the effect is real but I doubt it is as pronounced as the raw numbers suggest. Furthermore, I am a lot more concerned about the long term effects of policies than the effect they have in the few years a president is around. Stimulating the economy is easy. Maintaining that stimulated economy and erasing the debt load that stimulation rang up is another matter entirely.
