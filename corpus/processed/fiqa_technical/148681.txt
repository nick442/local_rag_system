"Sadly, most jurisdictions don't think this way when they assign property taxes. ""You have X acres, our standard for this county is $Y per acre, so you owe $XY property taxes."" And if you tax by dwelling size and features, you are saying a poor person cannot live in a nice house. Lets say Joe Millionaire buys a fancy $2M house with a fancy pool and all the trimmings. Sure, Joe Millionaire can afford the high taxes of, say, $20K/year. But what if Jim Garbageman, who makes only $35K/year spends 10 years and about $100k building a similar nice house out of scrap materials he finds, purchases on sale or on craigslist, etc. He rents a backhoe and a gunite gun and builds himself a fancy pool, landscapes it really nice..and the county comes in and says ""Well Jim, that's a $2M house, you owe us $20K/year in taxes for it."" Jim can't afford it, and the county takes his house for unpaid taxes. Screw you and your efforts, poor person! And before you say ""he can just sell it for $2M"" Well, what if he made it unique to his tastes, and no one wants to buy it? Or the market is bad right now? And yes, this has happened to someone I know, though the house was valued at $500K, he still couldn't afford the taxes. And since it was not yet fully finished, he had to sell it for only about $100k, after working on it for several years. So yes, as long as you want to make sure poor people cannot live in nice places, property tax is the way to go."
