>**Because if it is achievable**, it is almost certainly better than just tying the whole economy to the price of a single commodity. **If it is not achievable**, then it is almost certainly better to let the markets adjust and correct, however imperfectly, than to tie the whole economy to the whims and wishes of incompetent and politically-motivated money-printers. So.. what I'm getting from all of this, is basically how we view the possibility of a workable flat currency. I think the possibility of whether or not a flat currency will actually work depends on many things, some more important than others. The size (and power/influence) of a country can greatly affect how a flat currency will work within that country. If the country is large and power hungry (like ours), then a flat currency will most likely not work in the long run. It will promote greed and monopolization of wealth, but what of gold? That can't work either because a large country can't sustain itself off such an inefficient monetary system. So.. to me, it seems like extremely large countries should be split into smaller countries that can actually use flat currencies (or gold) without all of the potential for corruption. This same sort of logic applies to our primate cousins. If a tribe of chimps gets too large, the group will split to relieve social tension. This is a big part of why I support ideas like Cascadia. Do you think there is a way for monetary systems to work in very large countries?
