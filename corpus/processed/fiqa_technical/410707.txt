"When he wrote this I think there may have been greater interchangeability between workers, workers were perfectly competitive if you will. I find that there is huge wage growth, in certain industries and with certain skills. This only impacts a limited number of people, with the majority of workers in fields that are not heavily valued. Another avenue would be to look at the ""real"" wage. If wages are going up only 1-2%, but inflation was at negative 3-4%, then those workers wages were increasing at 4-6%. I am not sure the gig economy is to blame. The gig economy would suggest that we are nowhere near full employment. How can people have time to have these gigs if they were gainfully employed already? Another scenario is that we are not near full employment at all, that you have a large number of people who are reluctantly part time, supplementing their income with other jobs to make ends meet. And I am sure that were Milton Friedman alive today, he would change his assumption to match reality. I wonder what wisdom he would have for us today."
