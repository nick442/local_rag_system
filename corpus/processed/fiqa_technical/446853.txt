Well one of the main problems is the unsteady purchasing power of the money, and the unwillingness of the federal reserve to allow anything less than 2-3% inflation, when deleveraging requires deflation. A lot of problem is also regime uncertainty. Companies will keep large cash reserves on the sidelines if they are uncertain about the regulatory environment. A business man can't accurately plan his business if he does not know how much his productive output will be taxed 5 or 10 years down the road. For larger companies it may be the safer move to hold onto the cash and not put it to productive use.
