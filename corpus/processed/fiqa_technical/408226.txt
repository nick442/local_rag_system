"That right there is one of the most dangerous things that I think I have ever read. Google, has turned evidence over to the NSA and FBI numerous times even without warrants. Look at their TOS; you will see that you are allowing them to do that. Google is one of the most horrendous companies when it comes to ""your"" privacy. Microsoft has taken the US government to court more times involving their user's privacy and protection. Granted they are all about the monopoly, so there's that. Apple has an impressive history of telling the FBI to suck it. When it comes to cloud-based security, one of the best roads to go down would be creating your own, if you can."
