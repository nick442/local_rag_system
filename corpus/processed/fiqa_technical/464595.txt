I'm 100% ok with that. I'm 100% not ok with giving Walmart my tax dollars, if we are going to hand out tax dollars to someone, I'd rather give it to people who are out of work instead of being middleman'd and giving it to walmart who then gives a tiny piece of it to their workers. Walmart can exist on it's own merits or not exist at all. This is how the free market works.
