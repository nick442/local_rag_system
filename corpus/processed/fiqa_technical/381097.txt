I was in a very similar situation and successfully landed my top choice job in finance. The best advice I can give is, as most people have said here before, network. I can honestly say networking is the main reason why I got my job. After networking though just make sure you are prepared for the interview. You mentioned that you were interested in ibanking. If so, don't bother spending your time making a buy-side equity report. Brush up on your accounting skills (know how to do a DCF), make sure you know exactly what ibanking entails and finally make sure you have a very solid story as to why you want to do it and what you hope to get out of ibanking. It's a tough road but it is possible so don't give up. Edit: Also don't just focus at BB banks. Look at boutiques and MM banks as well. Anything that will give you experiences you can put on your resume.
