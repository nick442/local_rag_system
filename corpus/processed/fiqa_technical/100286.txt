The answer to your question: I don't think it's being irresponsible at all. You are at least saving for your retirement, some people aren't even doing that. My advice? Replace the car with a cheaper car that you absolutely adore. $1000/month is a lot to pay for a car that's just a car. Sell yours, take the resultant money and buy a cheaper car outright. But buy something fun. If you're going to enjoy driving when you get in your car, really enjoy it. I suggest a used Miata, or a BMW 325i, the E30 version from the late 80s. Rear wheel drive, light, responsive, and practical. And cheap as chips to fix as well!
