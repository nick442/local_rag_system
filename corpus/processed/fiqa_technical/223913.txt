What other ways would you suggest? Plus, if I truly believe that the product I'm selling is going to improve your life, it would be incredibly fucking rude not to give you the opportunity to obtain it. And that is how I feel. I'm not wasting people's time, I am honestly trying to better their lives with my product. I don't really understand how that makes me an intrusive asshole. Honestly, its people like you who are the assholes. I'm making cold calls because that's my job. I believe in my product and believe my potential customers will find it desirable too. When people like you assume we are just intrusive assholes trying to rip people off, it makes my job harder, less efficient, and no where near as fulfilling. I would suggest you take a look at yourself and change your attitude towards people who approach you with their products instead of assuming everyone who attempts to sell you something is just a rude, intrusive waste of time.
