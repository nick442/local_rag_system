"With a ""normal"" CD you can't, but some banks do seem to offer CDs where you can. For instance the ""variable-rate CD"" at USAA allows ongoing deposits. I also found a United Bank ""saver CD"" which requires you to set up automatic monthly deposits. You would have to check each individual bank's CD offerings to see if they have such a product. However, if you make ongoing deposits to it, a CD becomes less distinguishable from a savings account. Even if a given bank does offer a ""depositable"" CD, you might conceivably be able to find a higher rate on a plain savings account at another bank (especially an online bank offering high savings account rates). For instance, the USAA CD I mentioned above has an APY of 0.46%, but the high yield savings accounts on this NerdWallet list have higher APYs than that. So even if you can find the kind of CD you describe, it might be better to just use a savings account anyway."
