His mom's death is very sad but also keep in mind it's the one and only problem he has that he didn't make for himself by being an Ayn Rand / Gordon Gekko asshole. His mom didn't make him sabotage Lyft, or ignore sexual harassment, or use the medical records of the Indian rape victim to strategize how to defeat her.
