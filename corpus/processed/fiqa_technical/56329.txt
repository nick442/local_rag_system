My personal opinion, start a small business and just do it. You will learn faster than anything you can learn online. Keep it small, then when the disasters come, you can recover. Decide what kind of business you want to do, what area, then just start. Feel free to PM me if you need help. Also, SCORE is a consulting group of retired executives, Free, and you can get a lot of advice there too. Classes are fine, but if you want to do business, just do it, you will learn more, faster, than any class (once you figure out what kind of business you want to do)
