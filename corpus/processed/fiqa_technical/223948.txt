How would the economy affect Dell? * Sales revenue (look at financial reports since 2008), especially in enterprise-level sales for small businesses * Research and development - are they investing in creating new products now, or making minor adjustments to older lines? The lack of available credit in the economy might affect this decision. Connect this with the next part of your project - with their current course, are Dell's products going to be relevant in 3 years? * Supply issues - any recent supplier changes due to economic hardship? Any evidence of outsourcing/insourcing based upon the current economy? Also, there is currently a massive shortage in hard drives due to floods in Thailand. Just some thoughts.
