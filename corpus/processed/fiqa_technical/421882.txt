So they basically tried to make their antiquated methods faster, rather than improve their methods. Okay. Not what I would have done. And apparently they aren’t advertising their improvements well, either. What I don’t see in that document is the percentage of people making less or more in all, so I can’t tell if large numbers of people on one side or another are skewing the average in a direction, nationally or in the government itself. Those numbers would give us the whole picture, rather than a distorted picture. Also, it seems the average wage is only $3.00 / hour higher, so that’s something. Your “socialist Universal price” quip tells you are definitely seeing with distorted glasses. Let it go for a little bit, not to change your mind, but to verify you are seeing as clearly as possible. They keep the wages basically equal across the U.S. because they are a nation-wide entity that has to be internally self-consistent.
