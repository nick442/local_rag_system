Summarized article: Demand for antibiotic free meat is growing and the movement has been led by Chipotle Mexican Grill. Chipotle switched to naturally raised pork over 10 years ago in effort to improve pork sales. Although the price went up a full dollar for an antibiotic free pork burrito, sales significantly increased. Many food providers and retailers are now following suit including Hyatt Hotels, Bon Appetit Management Co. and Walmart. The current market share of antibiotic free meat is estimated at 2%. But demand is increasing as a growing number of consumers have become aware of how antibiotics used in livestock animals can lead to an antibiotic resistance in humans. Consumer concern led the Food and Drug Administration to launch a voluntary plan for pork, beef and poultry producers to limit the use of antibiotics. *For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit*
