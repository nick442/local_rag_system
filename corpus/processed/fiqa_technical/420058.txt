Blue Apron has become pretty synonymous with dinner delivery services. The name recognition alone is probably worth their current evaluation. I think you're right it wouldn't be hard to compete, and they do have a lot of competition. But I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who can name something other than Blue Apron.
