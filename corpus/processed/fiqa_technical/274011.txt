For sure they are about to take a hit through winter. People in California either have solar, waiting for better technology (mostly cause by hype of Tesla home batteries) or hate it because of the looks. Then there are people who have shade / low electric bills and just aren't qualified. I've had my whole division in solar (managers, everyone) be laid off in two different companies in two years, after getting promoted too :(. One filed for bankruptcy recently the other has been around awhile and might barely survive..another asked me for an interview..nah I can't take another lay off.
