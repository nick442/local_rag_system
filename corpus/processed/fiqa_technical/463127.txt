Well thats a fucking surprise . . .Banks win an everybody else gets fucked But how is that possible? The Banks were the ones with all the bad debt, the CDOs, the SIVs and what not that was dragging them under, the Fed bought up that shit at AAA valuations even though there was no Market. The Fed dropped interest rates to 0% so these assholes could borrow emergency funds from the Fed even after the bailouts. They kept rolling the debt over for the last decade while it sat there on the Feds balance sheet. Now that the Fed is about to write off 4.5 Trillion dollars of this debt Banks win . .because they got a free lunch with no consequences This has to be the Bank Heist of the Millennium Lets give them a bonus for their great performance
