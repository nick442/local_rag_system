"The entire idea of accountability in America has been in serious decline over the years. Not to get on my high horse and preach, but this issue begins early on with child care and has branched it's way into our economics as well. Kids get 9th place ribbons for races with 9 racers. Young post-college adults are struggling to survive on their own in the real world. CEO's are told to retire early as opposed to stepping down. At the end of the day, everyone wants to credit themselves with a job well done and shift blame to others or outside forces. However, this doesn't mean that there's no position left in the US with 'accountability.' For instance, the Fed Chairman has to be correct on their position or the entire economy can be destroyed in the process. So what do we do instead? Those positions are the ones we blame for what's happening around us. So naturally, their response is to leave as delicately and unnoticed as possible. If you ask me, those people at Equifax should be in jail. Not because of the hack, but because they waited so long to let everyone know. Stepping down and retiring shouldn't mean they get away from it, the same way declaring bankruptcy doesn't mean I get away from my student loans. If people started taking accountability for their own actions, America would be much more healthy in my opinion. But then again, at the end of the day it is just my opinion, so you're free to believe whatever else you like. Cause you know what they say, 'opinions are like a**holes, everyone has one."""
