The comparison with tulip mania shows a wilful ignorance of what bitcoin is. Scarcity is one of the things that makes bitcoin good, sure, but it's not the only thing. Could you have transfered millions of dollars worth of tulips around the world in minutes, securely and for pennies on the dollar? >In bitcoin’s case, Dimon said he’s skeptical authorities will allow a currency to exist without state oversight *Allow* Bitcoin to exist? Authorities don't get say whether Bitcoin is *allowed* to exist or not. You'd think the CEO of one of the largest banks in the world would know that. >“If you were in Venezuela or Ecuador or North Korea or a bunch of parts like that Bitcoin is outperforming a lot of currencies, not just in Venezuela, Ecuador or North Korea. > if you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than U.S. dollars,” Why would Bitcoin be better for *only* those things? He's trying to smear Bitcoin as being only used for illegal activities and that is simply not the case. Besides, the reason that people *do* use it for those things is due to the inherent privacy aspects of Bitcoin (though not perfectly private, they're still useful).
