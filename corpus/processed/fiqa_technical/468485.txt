Failing some answers to my comment, I am going to make some assumptions: Based upon a quick review of this article I'd probably be in the Russell 2000 Value Index Fund (IWN). Quite simply it gives you broad market exposure so you can be diversified by purchasing one fund. One of the key success factors is starting, not if you pick the best fund at the onset. I can recall, 20 years ago being amazed (and it was quite a feat) at someone who was able to invest $400 per month. These days that won't get you to the ROTH maximum and smart 20 somethings are doing just that.
