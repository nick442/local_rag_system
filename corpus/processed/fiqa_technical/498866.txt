Exactly. A minimum wage increase, or a decrease in tax burden on the lowest wage earners, or an increase in available wages for the economically disadvantaged (through government jobs) are the most reliable ways for a government to increase demand (aka: grow an economy aka: create new jobs) by putting more money in to the hands of the people who are going to spend it. Much better than the gilding the parachutes of the super wealthy (aka: republican policy).
