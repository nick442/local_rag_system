I was just talking about this with my father in law. When the min wage was about $1.50 a hour, going camping at a state park for a night was just over $1 a night. Now, where we live, it's often $20 a night just for a campsite in a state park. Min wage is $7.25. My family paid $400 for a Beta vcr in 1980. Single income family, factory worker, blue collar job. Could someone do that today, adjusting for inflation? Absolutely not.
