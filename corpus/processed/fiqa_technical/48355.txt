The government needs me to function. It can jail me, strip me of my property and life if it seems fit. It is absolutely accountable to you. I pay the salaries of the government officials. The government needs its just amount to function properly because some people rely on the government the way the government relies on the people. You're out of your mind if you think trickle down economics works. It doesn't at macro levels. That's why the country's worse off economically after supply side theories are implemented. Would not having roads, schools, police forces be a better option?
