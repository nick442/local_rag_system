Do you really think it will be cheaper for Equifax now? Treating your customers right is always cheaper in the long run when you still have a respectable business running. Going out of business or just declaring bankruptcy is extremely expensive and stuff like that happens when companies treat their customers badly. I know monopolies like Comcast are a bit different but for the most part this theory holds true.
