I do a lot of work in Gsuite but is it really a good replacement for excel? I find the hotkeys limiting at best in comparison and I don't think there are good alternatives to powerpivot and powerquery in Gsuite. There are a handful of things Google sheets offers that excel doesn't but overall I find it fairly limiting. If you're referring to just basic computing than yes Google sheets will get you there but I don't think they're comparable yet. I could be 100% wrong and just not know the Gsuite alternatives to these tho.
