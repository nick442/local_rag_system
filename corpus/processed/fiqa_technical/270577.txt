Why are we talking about coal miners like they are little children? Clean energy jobs exist and are growing, coal is on the way out. If they want a job in clean energy they can get up and get one. If they want to pine about the good old days of coal where a high school drop-out could make good money for life in the mines, well, they can do that too.
