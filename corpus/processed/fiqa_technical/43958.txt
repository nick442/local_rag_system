Because Gary is basically a ghost town. The crime rate is one of the highest in the country. There are so many vacant buildings that the property tax incomes cannot begin to cover maintenance for the roads. The schools are under control of the state because they are terrible. There are almost no retail or restaurants left; except for a dollar store that gets robbed monthly and a few low-end fast food chains.
