There's no demand? Of course there's demand, demand is infinite in the sense that everyone wants things to make their lives better. Sure, maybe there are some people that have maxed out their credit and physically can't buy any more stuff, but they still need to buy food/clothes/housing. The problem is not a demand problem, it is a supply side problem. Central banks have over levered the system to a point where investors and entrepreneurs do not know what the govt is going to do next to try to fix it. Is there a huge tax increase on the horizon? Is more reactionary legislation going to be passed? Many established businesses have a hard enough time keeping up with the regulations that are already on the books, and in many industries such as the financial industry, it is physically impossible to get through an audit without paying fines for doing something wrong, because no one can follow every single rule theyve written. So yes, the regulatory environment is far more uncertain than it was even a decade ago, let alone 30 or 40 years ago.
