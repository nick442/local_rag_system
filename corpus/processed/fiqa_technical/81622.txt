My local shopping store giant does 'online shopping', and by that I mean you can order your stuff, pay extra online etc etc, then another extra fee to reserve your time that you DRIVE TO THE STORE and pick it up. (and some times fill up So be quick, rofl) I mean sure fills a small NICHE, but why do online shopping without delivery, especially when they are charging all the extra fees already. I look forward to Amazon wiping these guys out.
