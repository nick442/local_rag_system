You know that [most authors have come out *against* Amazon in this dispute](http://www.authorsunited.net), right? Even [Stephan Colbert has sided with hachette on this one.](http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/ukf9gv/amazon-vs--hachette) The authors that seem to side *with* Amazon are ones from Amazon's own self publishing platform, which ironically has some of the *worst* terms for authors when it comes to choices of how and where they can sell their books. I'll give credit where credit is due though: Amazon *does* let self-published authors retain the intellectual property for their works, which doesn't always happen with traditional publishers. Granted, Amazon doesn't front any of the costs involved in creating a book like traditional publishers do, and Amazon can literally change it's terms of service at any time without notifying you (whereas contracts signed with traditional publishers are legally binding), it's still a pretty nice move that Amazon only views self-publishing *authors* as a source of revenue, and not their intellectual property.
