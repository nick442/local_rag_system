"Ok, let's revisit some of the things you *did* say then. >[If they weren't losers and were actually responsible, it would be a different situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6pujj4/economy_needs_workers_but_drug_tests_take_a_toll/dksx7c2/) >[they are weed smoking losers living at home and getting paid minimum wage, that is if they even have a job.](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6pujj4/economy_needs_workers_but_drug_tests_take_a_toll/dksv33x/) > [Stop with the smoking at home bullshit. Most [marijuana users] smoke a few times a day. Even before work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6pujj4/economy_needs_workers_but_drug_tests_take_a_toll/dksu660/) > [More pot smokers smoke several times a day than drinkers who aren't alcoholics](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6pujj4/economy_needs_workers_but_drug_tests_take_a_toll/dksu9ad/) > [That's he problem. These weed smokers do it all the time. Not many only do it on their own time](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6pujj4/economy_needs_workers_but_drug_tests_take_a_toll/dksumrg/) > **[These people are entitled losers that don't want to be responsible for their actions. They still live at home at 30 and don't have a real job or make minimum wage, but it's not their fault according to them. They blame it on everyone else ](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6pujj4/economy_needs_workers_but_drug_tests_take_a_toll/dksupyt/)** *Those* are the statements I was hoping you would have some research to back up. Clearly, you don't. Finally, your reply to my statement about your generalizations of marijuana consumers being utterly fallacious is a non sequitur. I have expressed no opinion on the topic of the health of ""escaping reality by doing drugs all day everyday."" If you're curious, I do **not** think that's good. But it has nothing to do with the fact that your generalizations are just..dumb, for lack of a better word. I'm going to go ahead and depart this conversation now; arguing with raw ignorance is exhausting. Plus I need get ready for my minimum wage job by smoking some the devil's lettuce in my bedroom, which is obviously in my parent's basement."
