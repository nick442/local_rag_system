> At some point we are going to have abused our global reserve status to the point the world doesn't want to extend it to us anymore. This will happen *as soon as there is someplace better to go*. This, in turn, will require: * Someone running sound economics * Those sound economics not being dependant on US/dollar hegemony * The US not blowing them up These are not impossible criteria, and absolutely will **eventually** be met, but I don't think it's unreasonable to argue that that point is a long way away at this point. We have a lot of time, and much of it will be tumultuous & uncertain in many ways- but the dollar & US treasuries will still be the thinnest kid at fat camp until it ends.
