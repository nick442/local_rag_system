Ignoring the wording of the article, what is the point? Taylor Swift, an establishment musician, doesn't change her successful formula in releasing information. What exactly would she gain by doing what the author suggested and changed the time of the information release. I would think that an out of the box approach would only draw negative attention. Taylor, you did the right thing.
