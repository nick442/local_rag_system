"LOL! Once elderly can live off social security alone, we can then talk about ""Universal basic income"". Just a reminder: Social Security was originally tax free and reasonable. Today, it's taxed, it varies depending on the age you claim it, it's gone if you have too much income, does not increase according to inflation, and this year they removed the ""claim and suspend"" option. P/S: by the time I retire, I doubt I will get anything form SS.. so I don't even count on SS when saving for retirement."
