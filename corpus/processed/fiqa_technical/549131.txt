"My wife currently works for a Bain-backed company. I've seen it more times than I can count: Bain buys US-based companies, keeps a fraction of the skilled-labor in the US, and ships mostly everything else to China/Mexico (more China at this point). I understand why they do this (keeps costs down, increases profits, etc), but it still angers me to no end. IMHO: Just because ""it works"", it doesn't make it right. Greedy fucks."
