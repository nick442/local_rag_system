I think it's just stratified. Most TV has always been lowest common denominator shit. Soap operas are only marginally better than reality TV. But now there are some channels that cater to only the lowest of the low. Also, I think Jersey Shore type stuff is more about looking down at the stupid Guidos than anything else. You aren't supposed to view them as protagonists. You are supposed to look down at them for being so trashy. The people who constantly trash the show Jesery Shore are basically doing the same thing viewers are. Getting entertainment by looking down at people for being trashy.
