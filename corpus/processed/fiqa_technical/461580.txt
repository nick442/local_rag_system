I know how you feel, but at least we are paying 40/month for two services instead of 100/mo for more stuff we don't want. I have a young kid and Netflix. And, well, the Netflix original shows for kids are just the worst. The Disney stuff is a major reason that we watch so much Netflix, and I'm well in their demographic crosshairs. I would switch, but I'm pretty sure that the Disney service will be just like I imagine, with the same level of shat out 'originals', no Darkwing Duck, the one or two most current out of theatres animated movie, stv sequels, and the entire back catalog of Dog with a Blog to round out the roster.
