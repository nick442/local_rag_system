I quit paying for cable in 1997. I couldn't even tell you what was on TV. I barely know what is in the theaters and that is only because I live in LA and signs are everywhere. I haven't listened to new music since metallica sued a 12 year old. So outside of techno (which you can find for free everywhere) my mainstream music is as cutting edge as Static X, Slipnot, and System of a down debut albums.
