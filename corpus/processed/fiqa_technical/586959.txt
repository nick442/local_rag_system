"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/is-there-an-ideal-amount-of-income-inequality) reduced by 94%. (I'm a bot) ***** > Inequality per se is not bad. Some inequality is inevitable, even desirable, in a free-market society. > How much more? In other words, at the risk of sounding oxymoronic, what is the fairest inequality of income? This critical question is at the heart of the inequality debate. > The Harvard philosopher Tim Scanlon argues that extreme inequality is bad for the following reasons: economic inequality can give wealthier people an unacceptable degree of control over the lives of others; economic inequality can undermine the fairness of political institutions; economic inequality undermines the fairness of the economic system itself; and workers, as participants in a scheme of cooperation that produces national income, have a claim to a fair share of what they have helped to produce. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/73kpw6/is_there_an_ideal_amount_of_income_inequality/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~219949 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **inequality**^#1 **percent**^#2 **income**^#3 **society**^#4 **system**^#5"
