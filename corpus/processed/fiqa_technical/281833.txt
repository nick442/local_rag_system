"The face value of the pennies is meaningless; the $80 didn't ""go"" anywhere. The metal in those pennies is still worth $180 (less whatever small amount was lost in the stamping/production process). It's essentially the same thing as asking where the $99.877 worth of profit is when you spend 12.3 cents to create a $100 bill. We shouldn't be saying that we lose [production cost of coin] minus [face value of coin] when producing a coin. But it certainly is correct to question why we spend such-and-such to produce a coin that many people don't want to use in the first place."
