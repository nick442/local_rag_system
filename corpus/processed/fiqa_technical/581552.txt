You assume that you'll be working at a bulge bracket, who have structured programs and are used to hiring globally. If you go work at a hedge fund, it could end up being a small shop who would rather not deal with any additional issues. On my campus - many companies don't hire international just because there are so many qualified domestic applicants. This is probably the most competitive and lucrative field out of any profession.
