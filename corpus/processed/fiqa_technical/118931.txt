China was the only place that I've traveled to where they had built in privacy screens as you're going through security. One person at a time through the metal detector and once you pass through the metal detector you're in an area that has complete privacy. Nobody before or after the line can see you. In a way it's good if implemented in the USA but sometimes it makes me wonder how that can be abused.
