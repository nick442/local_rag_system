The long term is a series of short terms and the best thing we can do for for it is to improve the short term. There is absolutely no benefit to self-imposed economic hardship in the present. I'm not saying there is slack of money, I'm saying there is *lack* of money. There is slack in output capacity. We are producing less than we're capable of and as a result, real resources and labor are idled. As policy, this is inexcusable. >People who are saving their money don't have it stored under their mattress. Instead they have it saved in a bank that is in turn being loaned out at the lowest rates in history. Savings are a demand leakage. They are *unspent* income. If that leakage isn't offset, demand falls and the effect on the economy is contractionary.
