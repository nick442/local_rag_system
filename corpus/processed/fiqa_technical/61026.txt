Your quote: There's about 10 trillion in gold and about 2.8 trillion of US cash in the world. Neither of these is anywhere large enough to be used for all the transactions in the world. So how was it commercial banks could lend like crazy for home mortgages?? M1 remaind constant throughout the decade and years , if frac multiplier effect was the cause for m2, why wasn't it until the 2000s that m2 became exponential? Commercial Banks able to create credit and lend out of thin air to customers thanks to deregulation that caused m2 to explode. They didn't need no FED. They didin't need no reserves. They were able to act regardless of the FED. The FED responded to them, instead of the other way around. Before deregulation banks didn't bother creating too much credit loans coz it was too dangerous, they were mostly utilty banks. After deregulation, creation of exotic derivatives, low interest rates, and high speed internet globalized digital trading, they went crazy creating credit out of thin air coz it wasn't dangerous because they could sell the home loans.
