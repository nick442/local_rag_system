No where in my comment I presented my opinion as fact. $76 dollars a day is account only for the Popeyes chicken job, not the 2nd job. There's no way she spent $348 on her sons living away with a friend. She's living the Hughes in the getho where prostitution, drugs, and crime are common place according to the article, so rental marion is paying the Hughes couldn't possibly be that high. A lot of the characters may not cook often , and they more likely to be frequent fast food customers. Fast food may appear cheap on the surface, but the numbers add up quickly to a large sun to frequent a buyer. Again, this is my opinion. Because she has children and living far below the poverty line, Her IRS tax refund should around $6000 or more, because this is what the refunds are for a few people I know very well in Florida. Once again, It may not the reality of the characters' finance.
