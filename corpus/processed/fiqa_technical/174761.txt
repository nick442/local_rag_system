Depends on what you are doing, in energy trading it is all about R and SQL, I still use Python for scraping and as a general scripting language though. In my opinion if you know how to program in one language you can likely pick up a different language without too much trouble, at least that has been my experience. So for entry level just showing that you can program in anything might be enough.
