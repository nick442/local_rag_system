EU and North America long term strategy is to tell Russia that it doesn't get to do whatever the hell it feels like (I.e. taking crimea). EU and North America long term strategy is to lower EU dependence on Russian gas, and possibly fond a way to increase imports of Canadian or US gas. Now, I'm not saying this whole thing isn't stupid. In many ways it is. Indeed Ukraine should have stuck with Russia (they are not in the position to join EU). However, due to circumstances it happened. I fully agree that it will hurt everyone, but it's going to (and has) hit Russia much harder than many Russians care to admit.
