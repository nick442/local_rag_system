"Balance transfer is a specific type of transactions where you use card X to pay off card Y. Assume you have a credit card Y with $1000 current balance. You open a new credit card X, and use the newly approved credit to pay off the balance on Y. You'll pay $30 fee (3% of the balance you're transferring). This doesn't apply to transfers from your checking/savings to the credit card to pay off the balance on that credit card. ""Balance Transfer"" is when you use credit limit of card X to pay off existing balance of card Y, nothing else."
