Retail is the operative word. Local retailers don't raise prices because they need to compete with uninhibited e-commerce retailers. I wouldn't be surprised if progressives tried to correct for this by increasing the tax rate on online purchases to offset the e-commerce advantage, which of course would hurt consumers even more.
