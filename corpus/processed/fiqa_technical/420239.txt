Easy to say from the comfort of of a middle class lifestyle. I'm happy to have achieved what I have. I make a a modest but sufficient salary, as does my wife. We have many comforts that we would not have if we made even $20K a year less, a comfortable but small house; boring, safe and reliable car; cell phones. My wife grew up without enough food to eat. She used to sneak into the kitchen at night and drink the ketchup because she was so hungry, which resulted in her mom putting a padlock on the fridge. Forgive me for wanting more than that for my daughter, I must be some kind of monster capitalist.
