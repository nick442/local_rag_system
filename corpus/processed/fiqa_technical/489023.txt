The pay for leave isn't, or rather shouldn't be a medical expense, but a EI compensation. The point is to take the pressure off the small to medium business owner and put it back on the government where it belongs. Even worse, in the US, mat leave is currently unpaid unless your company deems otherwise, though there are some state level exceptions to this.
