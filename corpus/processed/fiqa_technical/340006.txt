"Exactly. Some people hear the words ""collective action"" or ""collective bargaining"" and think that they these are right out of the Marxist playbook. However, unions are not anti-capitalist, they're just a way to make things fair, or closer to. It's not like a union allows for outrageous demands by workers to be met, or takes away the ability for management to manage. Employers have their lawyers and their economists to protect their rights and set prices, why shouldn't workers have similar experts on their side?"
