Everything on that Medium account is from posts and threads taken from other sites. Building a brand by having nothing to offer but stealing from other people makes me rage. I reported the Medium already. More people should. The thing about good content is that eventually, people are going to want to know who really wrote it. Well, the decent people who give a damn about things like sourcing and attribution anyway. Edited: Actually, it's pretty clear the OP (AristotleOnassis) *is* @SoldOutSupplier just by looking at their reddit history.
