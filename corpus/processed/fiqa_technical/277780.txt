"You don't think rent, gas, and utilities would go up? Seems like you're trying to suggest that this person is ignoring factors while completely ignoring the interconnectedness of our society. If minimum wage jumps to $15/hr, suddenly minimum wage workers can afford to live in places that only people who could make $15/hr could live in. Now those areas are overflowing with potential tennants and the people that own the buildings realize that they can charge more. Suddenly, rent goes up. People living at those places go, ""hey, if a burger flipper makes $15/hr, there's no reason for me to keep busting my ass at this rate! I'm gonna ask for a raise too!"", so now anyone working for the gas company also wants a proportional raise, driving up the price of gas, etc. etc. etc. ""Oh, well, we'll just do it incrementally over time and that will fix it"" Sure.."
