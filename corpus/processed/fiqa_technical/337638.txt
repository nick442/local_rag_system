Fluids, tires, spark plugs, bulbs, fuses, belts, and so on. If anything breaks on my car I can find a million places with spare parts, can get then overnighted or picked up. No problem. If I have a mechanical issue I can bring it into just about any mechanic and they can fix it. Not really something you can say about any Tesla vehicle
