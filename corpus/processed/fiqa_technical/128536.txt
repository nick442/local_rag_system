Ad-based business model is the hands down best way to go. Imagine an internet where you had to make micropayments to every website you visited. It is just not viable. The thing is, there are proper and improper ways to do ads. A banner ad? A text ad? Fine. Whatever. An noisy, seizure inducing ad? Gross. A 30-second video ad to watch a Youtube video? Disgusting. A website that is 90% advertising and 10% content? Worthless.
