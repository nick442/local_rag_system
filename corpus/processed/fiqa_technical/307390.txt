Just a quick reminder to everyone. Infant mortality rates are actually measured differently from country to country, and by measured I mean they have different metrics as to what constitutes as infant mortality. America has the highest degree of scrutiny, wherein once the baby is out of the womb it is now eligible to be counted if it passes (dies). In almost every other country (perhaps all), the metrics are given a leeway such as hours, days, or weeks after. Comparing country to country is disingenuous unless you look at how they are actually measured. Essentially, the data would be similar to looking at amount of deaths per county but not taking the per capita, so the more populous county looks more dangerous.
