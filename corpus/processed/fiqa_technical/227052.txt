I disagree. It's clear that the only issue, is that almost all governments run programs in an inept and incompetent way, or, those programs are not financially sustainable. Let's take the simple case of Social Security for retirement: not only that you can't live off the benefits paid, the program will go bankrupt because more people take out of it than pay into it. No AI or automated Economy can help you here. The only solution: most people, who are very responsible people, should save on their own for their retirement. This is done by certain portion of their income in life that must go into a personally controlled retirement accounts. The rest of people: - The true disabled who can't work and earn: they will be provided for off taxes. - The irresponsible unemployable, will get a miserable bare minimum stipend off taxes paid by others. And all this will force the government to make sure everyone is employed and paid well. Take the government out of the retirement business.
