I came to the comments feeling the same way, but a number of active sellers are saying this doesn't affect them that much. It may be a factor of threshing out casual sellers who generally provide a poor experience from professional sellers who are able to manage the policy change. Mind you, that's a very broad brush - I'd love to have access to numbers and do some analysis on how sellers are really affected. It might be that very commercial sellers do okay, while casual (but professional & responsive) sellers are hurt. Or perhaps there are certain types of products that will be hurt worse than others.
