If you are just starting out learning to code then really just pick a language. You'll learn some principles that can be transfered to other languages and with experience that becomes easier every time. Python is easy great for beginners since it is free, has a great community and support online, and is pretty well suited for data analysis. There are several books for using Python for finance (Google that phrase). Python is also quite popular for web development which might be another way to learn to code. It will require learning HTML and sql/databases besides python but even so might be more accessible rather than jumping into data analysis while learning how to code. Depends on the person though.
