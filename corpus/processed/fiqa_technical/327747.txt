> The state is so blue/democratic that Gov. Rauner is almost at a disadvantage by default. More complicated than that. Republicans have been governor of the state for 8 of the past 10 terms. The state is very blue in presidential elections, mostly red in governor elections, strongly blue in state house. The issue is indeed that the unions have too much of a stronghold on the politicians.
