Got the source for China asking for money? I would like to read that and educate myself. China put in more solar last year than the entire world combined. Never underestimate China, they are not bogged down by a bloated irrelevant government. They can just make a decision and go for it. Just walk around their cities and look at the infrastructure they pull off. It's staggering and puts anything in North America to shame.
