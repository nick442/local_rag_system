"If you intend to gamble, you should bring cash with you and turn your chips into cash at the end of the night. If the casino closes and you haven't cashed in your chips before docking, you'll be out of luck. Also if you use your ship card to get money for gambling, they will charge you a hefty fee. If you use the electronic poker table or a machine that doesn't take actual money, you'll have to use your ship card. Make sure when you leave the at the end of the night that you ""cash in"" your electronic winnings. This is really confusing, but the machines will debit your ship card, into a 'casino account' and if you just walk away thinking it will net out your other purchases (drinks, food, etc) you will lose all of that money. Summary: If you gamble, use real money and convert your winnings back into real money."
