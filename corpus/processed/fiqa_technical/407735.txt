My initial impressions (yes, its me whos starting next month) are mixed. Good because: >The company expects to use the proceeds from this transaction for general corporate purposes. Bad because a major stakeholder pulling out is not exactly positive. But as the tech industry goes, things can be fickle, so its very understandable. Just wondering what some of the veterans, esp in the industry, here think about this one and what it means for someone who's about to start there..or if it is kind of moot.
