"Having lived in a couple of coutries my perspective on this is ""Do apartments gain value or lose value in your area over time?"" I've lived in areas where the age of the building vs the inflation of home values has meant apartments steadily lose value and in other areas where they keep up with or beat inflation for most of the life of the building. Have your real estate agent take a look at the market and see how much a similar apartment in an older building goes for. If it seems like apartments rapidly depreciate then it may be a good time to take a win. If age isn't a huge factor in price then it probably doesn't make sense to get rid of a cash generator to put the money into other investments."
