So there's no extra money from your employer if you contribute extra to your 403(b)? My answer will be a bit different than most others, but I'd recommend not paying another dime into your 403(b). Pay your taxes now, and be done with them. Retirement saving does not need to be in a tax-deferred or tax-free account. Rent vs. buy is another question. Buy from a distressed seller at a heavy discount. You have time. Don't panic or rush in.
