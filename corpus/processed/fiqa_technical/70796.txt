So, the point of the article is that the taxpayers are making up for what Walmart isn't paying. But, walmart pays way more than what it's employees are using. Employees use government programs, Walmartpays more than double of the cost of those programs, so no cost at all is passed to the taxpayers. Walmart WOULD be evil if they didn't pay taxes. But they do. The article is nonsense. We get it. You don't like big business.
