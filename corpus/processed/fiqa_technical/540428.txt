I use to think there was something wrong with me because I always hated spending money. This hatred of spending resulted in me always saving quite a bit of my income. Since I don't enjoy spending it, why am I making and saving it (besides for an emergency fund)? I've come to the realization that I enjoy my free time more than I enjoy making lots of money. So I go to work for something to do - and pay the bills - but I am no longer trying to advance my career, or be the best at my profession, or climb some corporate ladder, or be some superstar. In fact, I'm considering a career change where I would make half of what I'm making now. What's my point? If having a lot of savings depresses you and you don't enjoy spending it then consider reducing your income.
