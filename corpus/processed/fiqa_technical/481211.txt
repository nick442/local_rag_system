Are you writing code for any particular platform? Can you say more specifically what your software does? I'm interested in software development myself, and do a little freelance PHP/MySQL development along with general web design (web design is putting me through college, but I don't want to do it forever.), and I'd be very interested in learning how I could tie that into a finance career.
