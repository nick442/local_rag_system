>A lot can happen to a stock's price in 1 hour A lot happens to the stock price in one hour because lot of trading takes place in one hour, not because of material news. If 30 days seems excessive, make the rule that the stock should be held for 1 day. Point is, 1 hour seems convenient to small investors because it facilitates day trading and 30 days seems excessive for the same reason. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. I abhor HFT and think the advantage unfair but am opposed to banning it for pecuniary reasons. Such is life in a capitalist economy. We pay the price for our freedoms.
