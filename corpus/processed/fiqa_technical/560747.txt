no way to consolidate the various outlets (other than money).. The best idea that the establishment has is to meter bandwidth which is patent laughable. Could you have predicted something like zerohedge or infowars getting as much attention as it does today 5 years ago? As much as you would like to write off the fringe, I think it's undeniable the force non-traditional, non-mainstream outlets have had over the past 5 to 10 years.. and it's going to get much, much worse for the mainstream mediocrity.
