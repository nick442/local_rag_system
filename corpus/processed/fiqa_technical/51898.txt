Boiler Room anyone? Cold calls all day long until you get someone (usually older people) on the phone and try to have them give you money to invest so you'll stop selling them. Ideally it COULD make money from the commission structure but usually people burn out fast. There are going to probably be better 'pure sales jobs' which pay more and are more legit then this. 2 cents
