"Basically if the execs in your company are too stupid to understand the concept of limited resources and prioritization, then the chargeback model is what's necessary to deal with the situation. Ideally, execs should back the IT manager, and once everyone's booked on an internal project, then when a new project comes in, the IT manager says ""Sorry - can't get to yours until October."" When PM of new project throws a fit and says they need it by July, then the IT manager looks at the portfolio of projects and picks one or two candidates. He then contacts the stakeholders for those projects and says ""Joe the PM says his stuff is more important than yours"" and escalate the two of them to a common executive to deconflict the mess (which, believe it or not, is one of the primary reasons executives exist)"
