>I'm always amazed when people come to the defense of large corporations. Here's the thing, Target hires employees, if Target were to shut down tomorrow (yes, I know it won't) then all of the people making their living through Target would be screwed. That's why I'm surprised there is so much hate directed at corporations. Sure, they do some nasty things, sure they're trying to make the largest profit possible, but they still pay thousands of peoples' wages, and if anything severely hurts Target as a corporation, those people are the ones will be affected the most.
