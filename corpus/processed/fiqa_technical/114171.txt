Nothing at the moment. The last moron did a great deal of damage as he and his economic advisers came up with Zero Interest Rate Policy which amounts to monetary heroin addiction. The out of control equity inflation we see in the stock market is merely a symptom of the monumental destruction quietly and insidiously brought on by the heroin addiction. Trump is merely the patsy and he knows it. So he lies to the addicts just like they want him to.
