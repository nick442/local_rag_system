"Ok, then I was not clear enough. I will preface my explanation with some ethos sounding pathos: I don't know much about cars in general, and less so about SAABs. I was interested in following the thread and what you wrote, but there was a contradiction so I couldn't. I listed the contradicting terms - including the possibility that the error was in my understanding of them (""Or am I missing something - am I wrong?""), and I addressed you since you through your husband has expertise in the matter and you are willing to share it here (thanks for that). Simply put, the premises were: From you: **Your car is well maintained.** Assumed by me: Your (spouse's) expertise means that **you won't buy a car that is known to fail despite maintenance.** **You bought a SAAB.** So it should follow that *you own a well maintained, non-failing SAAB.* But you also state: **Your SAAB is failing.** (I'm a bit insulted to be called a prick for asking about that. Regardless, if you can be more specific I can perhaps offer help on how to maintain electrical systems. I have a vaguely related degree and work/life experience, however it depends very much on the type of system, its circumstances and your circumstances. Unless you were ""trolling"".) The solution to the contradiction seems to be as given by redditor CC440, that I was wrong in my assumed premise, that you would and did buy a car known to fail. However, CC440 insinuated that your husband is an idiot, I did the opposite. It's the opposite of idiotic to take a good deal. (Apologies for before-the-fact labelling ""$1500 with heated leather seats"" as ""cheap funkiness"", it was unintentional, and I don't know if it is offensive.)"
