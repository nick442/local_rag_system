To be fair, if you actually read what he says (the headlines are not from him), he NEVER picks a date. He is one of the most successful investors of all time, and has very solid input on general market trends. I've personally utilized his advice to great success in the past, and if you actually look at what he says, it's sound financial advice. In this particular case, he IS calling a market crash by end of this year or next. I would heed his advice.
