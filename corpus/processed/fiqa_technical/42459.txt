I don't buy it. The evidence offered seems weak. Stocks are pretty high, but debt in the US has decreased according to the Federal Reserve statistics concerning debt. It's true there is a little inflation in prices because of low interest rates, but as the Fed starts raising rates, there will be a correction. Not a recession.
