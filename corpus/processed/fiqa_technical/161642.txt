I like TJ's. An old friend works for them and has been moving up in management. They treat him well and he likes the company. What I don't like about TJ's is that they're fussy about the demographics where they open stores. I live in a mid-sized city with a lot of ag, military and law enforcement. Big enough for a TJ's, but they won't open one here because there aren't enough college-educated types. (Of which I am one.) I'd sure like one here, though. Further, I think it'd do well. I've mentioned it to my friend, but he doesn't have much input there. Anyhow, I'd shop there if we had a local one. They have good deals and I don't mind their in-house stuff one bit. Some is better than others, but you can often find excellent products at a fair price.
