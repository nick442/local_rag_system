"I'm searching for a master's thesis topic in equity investment or portfolio management and I'd be grateful if someone could tell me what are the hot ""trends"" going on right now on the market? Any new phenomenons (like the rise of blockchain, etf.. but more relate to the equity side) or debates ( the use of the traditional techniques such as Beta to calculate WACC for example ..) ?"
