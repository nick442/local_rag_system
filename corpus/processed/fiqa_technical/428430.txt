"I make great money (especially for being a new college grad), have a great work life balance (if you spend much more than 8 or 9 hours at work you get some weird looks and maybe a sit down to discuss why you're working so much), but I don't have a nap room or a coffee bar or a dry cleaner at work. You can keep your ""culture"". I'll take my free time."
