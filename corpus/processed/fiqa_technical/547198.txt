Two parties will agree to pay each other's interest obligations. This is generally for one of two reasons: * One party wishes to swap a fixed interest rate (eg coupons on a bond) for a floating interest rate (eg: payments on a loan). If their counterparty wishes the opposite, and the rates are acceptable to both, they will agree to swap their obligations * There are two firms, based in countries A and B. Each firm has a branch in the other's country, and these branches each have a loan, denominated in that other countries currency. To reduce each firm's exposure to FX risk, they can swap their obligations, so A will pay interest on B's loan (which is in A's currency) and B on A's loan (which is in B's currency). edit: removed infuriating unterminated bracket.
