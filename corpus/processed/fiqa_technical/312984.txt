"In my company, we have custom Z reports + APO + Tableu + BW + BI + Cognos + Fico reporting tools + Hyperion + others. .. and there's still no company wide definition for Net Sales versus Gross Sales. This is all to show you that too many ""finance"" people who don't know much about finance are relying on tools to do the work for them.. and each tool gives different numbers. So I love it when I (in IT management) get called to explain why tool A gave a different number from tool B and when I find out, usually that both tool A and B have it wrong, you should see their faces."
