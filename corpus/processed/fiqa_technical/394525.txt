"> I really dont understand your argument man. Most people ""escape"" in alot of ways alcohol being the most popular why dont you find issue with this ? I have an issue with people using any drug everyday. But most people don't drink and get drunk daily. > Im assuming u live in the la area as do i almost 60% of this state voted for legalization and 60% of our nation approves of legalzation according to polls Yes, doesn't mean they are smart or right. Most Americans are retards. Honestly, I've seen and been around people from all countries and for as educated as Americans are, they are some of the dumbest and the easiest to manipulate and brainwash. You have liberals living at home and can't move out that are ready to give almost their whole paycheck in taxes to a government that wastes tons of money and is plagued with corruption. Yet they think its okay to give them more and more when its not necessary and it doesn't benefit us very often. > There is absoulety no compelling evidence that suggests that mj is more dangerous than legal substances like tobacco and alcohol in fact quite the opposite. So i honestly have to say your stance is quite baffling i tend believe people like just dont personally enjoy mj. Well if you open your eyes and see what is going on, this country has gone downhill over the past 20+ years. We are slowly heading in the direction of a 3rd world country. It won't be for a long time, but the people are getting poorer and poorer, everything is becoming more un-affordable, and people are being slaves to debt. In 3rd world countries they want you to be high all the time so you can't think, can't fight back, and keep quiet. I see that happening here and many people agree. But to reply to what you said, things like alcohol have rules. You can't drink everywhere, you can't drink and drive, etc.. There needs to be some rules for MJ. I'm completely okay with medicinal use, but most people don't use it in that way."
