The perfect conditions to sell a business are when it is very valuable (lots of profit each year) and you've lost interest in growing it any further. Also if you're in a particular industry when everyone is dying to get into that industry (like the dot com bubble) those are perfect conditions to sell. Other things like low interest rates and excess M&A capital might contribute to good conditions, but the two cases above are perfect conditions.
