Yes and No. See Q14 on this following Dept of Labor page: http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-consumer-cobra.html In particular, note: Coverage begins on the date that coverage would otherwise have been lost by reason of a qualifying event and will end at the end of the maximum period. It may end earlier if:.. After the COBRA election, coverage is obtained with another employer group health plan that does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condition of such beneficiary. The max coverage you can get is 18 months (under some circumstances 36 months), but make sure to review the limitations/possible reasons for it ending earlier that are described on that page. Your HR/benefits person can advise you - I'd certainly touch base with them.
