"That's true; if they could demonstrate that it's damaging to Twitter's growth, they would likely be able to have an impact though it's not clear why they would need to take a stake in that case. Companies are also a bit loathe to follow investor suggestions on principle -- as a CEO, the last thing you want is to be micromanaged by investors on every decision so going along would be a bad precedent. I imagine a straight-up social campaign, without the investor angle, would almost be more likely to succeed. I don't have a great sense for what the value of Trump's account is -- I just know it has a large positive value as I described and a large negative value as you described and I'm not sure of what the sum is but it's definitely not a ""low"" demand -- the value is probably a large number with an unknown sign :) What I do know is that reports about Trump's tweets led my parents to ask me ""what is this tweet thing?"" and I imagine for a lot of people of their generation, the news coverage was their first introduction to Twitter."
