dyslexia is tied into being good at math, music, and science. When nasa was in full swing they hired almost exclusively dyslexic people because they always ended up being better engineers. Aspergers is autism, just a sub in the umbrella. Again, makes them specialize at something so they end up being really good in a specific advanced job. Adult ADD (again talking about adults not kids) makes it so they can only concentrate on what they want to concentrate on. This makes them excel in a specific skill. ADD does not tie into engineering like the others though. One with ADD tends to excel in anything they enjoy, and not specifically the math, science, engineering, music, .. spectrum. People who are autistic are often more efficient when it comes to learning what they want. This is why above I mentioned geniuses being able to skip steps: They often can learn it faster and better than the average person. The only reason it is even thought of as a 'disability' is because people like that are less social than normal people. They would rather be doing something instead of watching TV and zoning out.
