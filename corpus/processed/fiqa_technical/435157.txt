"Yup, friends called us ""the web 2.0 power couple."" (That tells you something about when we got married.) When Thomas met me, he was world-famous and an awesome developerâ€¦ and part of a 3-person consulting firm which gave him a middle class lifestyle. With my design and biz sense, we've created an empire. I'll pass on your compliments. He always likes tweets too - @thomasfuchs :)"
