"I have to seriously disagree with this. Automated news analysis may have not worked for you for a variety of reasons (most likely all related to infrastructure/software inexperience), but it works and some shops and funds have made fortunes just doing news based automated trading. I have personal experience working in a Chicago shop which went through a few off the shelf solutions, like [Ravenpack](http://ravenpack.com/services/rpna_dj.htm) before rolling a custom news analytics platform which integrated with quantitative strategies to move a lot of volume. The whole premise of your post just seems very off to me. ""The problem that arises is that it is nearly impossible to make money off of automating trades."" -- an entire segment of the industry would like to have a word with you."
