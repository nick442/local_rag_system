"The biggest change is the the relationship between the content providers (newspapers, tv, etc) is becoming more and more *interactive.* For as long as mass media has existed, it's been a one-way relationship: content providers shovel content to the audience. The Internet has ushered in a change so radical that it's unlikely the centuries old model can survive, except perhaps in movie theaters. Who's going to suffer the most I think is advertisers. They are still struggling to figure out what to do, from all appearances. There's evidence that a few kind of get it, with heavy emphasis on ""a few."" Up to this point, their business has been built on smoke and mirrors. I mean, since I was a kid, I've always switched channels or got up and left during TV commercials rather than watch them, and I think that's common. In TV at least, advertisers have had to convince networks that most people don't do this but instead are watching advertisements, but really couldn't *prove* it. With more interactive models becoming predominant, the smoke and mirrors are disappearing. Advertisers who depend on elaborate analysis schemes to ""prove"" people are watching ads will too. I think it's a good thing. I don't mind content providers knowing *exactly* what pisses me off on the screen, be it a web site or TV show, and makes me skip their content. Advertising will *have* to change from the model of selling people things they aren't interested in to a model based on finding out that people are interested in and matching them up with products accordingly. Again, I welcome that. If I never see another tampon ad in my life, it's worth a bunch of starving ad execs asking for handouts on street corners."
