Stock markets have not been the cause of any of the problems. They display the symptoms of the problems, but they don't cause them. The problems have been caused by the corruption of government (lobbying and political donations), insufficient, excessive and inappropriate regulation, and ignorance on the part of those who vote (demanding more services and less taxes and worrying more about wedge issues than sound governance).
