CDS spreads represent the premium for insuring some specific bonds against a default (as defined by the ISDA). I'm not sure how you can arrive at the claim that they have little to do with the already issued debt itself, except if you were to assume that this debt is not quoted on any market. There is a direct relationship between the level of the CDS spreads and the price of debt.
