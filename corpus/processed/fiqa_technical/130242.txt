Mrs. Nahles also proposed to make god gender neutral back when she was family or female minister (don't remember), for equality. I mean really?? I'm not even faithful and can't stop laughing. I wouldn't take her word on the case to matter. Sad that my taxes go to such kind of politicians. Also she is in the SPD and elections are on Sunday.
