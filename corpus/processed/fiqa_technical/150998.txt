That explains the ridiculously shit customer experience I've had (I'm not originally from Aus). Energex sent 3 technicians 3 separate times to connect the power to my unit but I still had no power, and claimed I was lying..only for me to find out 6 weeks later they had hooked power to the wrong (empty) apartment! But it doesn't matter. We still have to pay them since they're the only distributor here in QLD :(
