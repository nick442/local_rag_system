>Many of you might think thatâ€™s not a budget issue because individuals pay the premiums. But keep in mind, we are subsidizing, either partially or completely, 25 million people under the Affordable Care Act. And rising premiums for those people will indeed mean an increase in the deficit. Within a few years that could add $200 billion to the deficit unless we figure out how to control healthcare costs. https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2016/11/02/thanks-to-obamacare-government-debt-is-worse-than-you-think/ That was the initial thought, it's turning out to seriously not be the case.. More people than the initial CBO prediction are being subsidized, and much more heavily.. It's no wonder that the insurance company's enjoy ACA, it's free money for them, they can raise rates, but their customers don't receive higher bills.. Just the government pays more..
