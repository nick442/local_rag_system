"Two things. 1. You can sue anyone for anything. You may not win, but you can sue for any reason. 2. You're confusing trademark and copyright. Copyright inheres at the moment of creation. You don't have to file a copyright to have it be enforceable. Trademark is a little trickier, but is for the protection of the consumer and use of a mark is part of what creates its value and the ability to defend it. However, you cannot copyright nor trademark ideas. Copyrights must be ""reduced to practice."" Broadly speaking, that means you have to have done something to create it, not just think about it. And trademark doesn't apply here. He could file for a patent, but that would need to have a specific filing and often takes a fairly significant amount of time in which case it's defensible even when some guy copies you. In short, guy is a moron."
