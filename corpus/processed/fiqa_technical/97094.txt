I'm a freelance programmer, reverse-engineer, and network engineer. I do quarterly 1099 filings using a cheap local accounting firm. I did them on my own at first; not that hard. You deduct from sum the percentage for that earning-tier issued by the IRS. $500.00 for writing algorithms on a timer? Yikes. I did topcoder once but it didn't pay much then it was only good for portfolio. No way I would race to do algorithms for third-world-rate capital.
