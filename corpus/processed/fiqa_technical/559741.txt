Nonsense! If there are no immigrants willing to work for cheap, then the natives will be paid more to do those jobs. Actually, more likely, the natives will work in jobs to automate work done by cheap immigrants. Developing automation is hampered by cheap labor because why bother to automate if you have cheap labor?
