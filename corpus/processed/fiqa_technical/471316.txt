There are so many things wrong with this it's absurd. But I will point out the three that stick out to me: * Licensing used to be about making sure someone knew what they were doing instead of letting just anyone perform a job. Now it's used as gatekeeping, a barrier to entry, and/or a revenue stream. * If your business model can't stand on its own and needs someone to ban another business model your business model is outdated or bad. * Using a license as a commodity to support a retirement plan is just a terrible idea. I have no better words for this. Why would anyone think this is a good idea? Seriously, I'm not even an opponent to regulation. I know that, in many cases, regulation is a good thing. Licensing to drive a 3500 pound death machine is a good thing. I like the idea of people having to learn how to drive and prove they know how to drive before they are given a license to drive. Licensing to drive a car as a taxi, however, is not. How hard is it to drive to a point on a map, pick someone up, drive them to another point on a map, and drop them off? The answer is: not very. In this case, the licensing involved is simply to keep the market from flooding and provide a pension plan to those fortunate enough to get in the game.
