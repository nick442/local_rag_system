I notice you turn to ad hominem instead of providing evidence. >Go for it, name an empire that purchased its own debt historically and survived. All current countries with a central bank purchase their own debt and all are surviving. The US is an empire. So there is one example. The Soviet Union was an empire until it failed, and it had a state controlled central bank. There, I named two. Now, please name a **single empire** that did not purchase its own debt, since you brought this up. I'll take it you cannot provide this since you are talking out of your ass and know nothing about it. It's sad that you make such absolute claims out of your ass and cannot provide evidence.
