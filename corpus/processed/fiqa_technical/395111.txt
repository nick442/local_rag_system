The 10yr bond pays coupons semi annually. The yield % is what you would get annually if you hold the bond to full term. The coupon payment won't be exactly 1.65%/2 because of how bond pricing and yields work. The yield commonly quoted does not tell you how much each interest payment is. You have to look at the price and coupon of a specific individual bond. The rate you see is the market equilibrium yield at the present. Example, I offer two different people two different bonds. Joe buys a 10yr bond paying 5% coupons semi annually at a par value of $1000. I charge him $1000. Bob wants to buy a 10yr bond paying 10% coupons semi annually at a par value of $1000. I charge him $1500 for this. The yield is similar between the two (not equal due to math details but lets assume). So at the end of 10 yrs, the two have roughly the same total amount of $. Bob's paid more each year but he paid more up front. This is why the federal govt can issue bonds with diff coupons and the market prices them so the yield rises/falls to the market clearing yield.
