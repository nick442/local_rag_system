"keeps telling me that she'll be in a difficult position if I quit. ""And she promised me that she will put me in contact with different people if I do well (she used to work in IBD)"" Let me translate. Your boss doesn't care about you and will do or say anything necessary to keep you. Sorry that's a bit blunt, but this is what management does. If you leave and pursue IBD, they will respect that and help you whether you stay or not..unless they don't give a shit. You need to do what's best for you. You can very easily say ""I don't think this is the best place for me to learn X, I need to go to Y company to achieve this. It took me Z weeks to learn this"" Of course this doesn't apply if you've known this person for years beforehand, but I'm 95% sure this is what you need to be aware of. Management sucks when you aren't in their ""club,"" (which it sounds like you're not) it's a part of life."
