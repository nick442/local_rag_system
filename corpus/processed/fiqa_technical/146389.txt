That's the clincher for me too. As the customer, I don't give a shit about a virtual separation between Best Buy the store and BestBuy.com. You've got ads for BB.com all over the goddamn store, in my eyes it's the same thing. Yet, the online store undercuts the physical store by hundreds of dollars in some cases, and forces me to go through another hoop of ordering it online then setting up in-store delivery to the store I'm already friggin standing in. How's about I just play on your nice floor model, and you either match Amazon's or whoever's price or I just order it from them and get it shipped to my house?
