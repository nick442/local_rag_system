> statement someone out of touch with reality would make.. someone who is either naive, or has had everything handed to them for most of his/her life. So absurd. I love how this is just the go-to excuse. As if no one can make it on their own. I must have been provided with my wealth. News flash! There are some people who don't accept the social class they were born into. They get up and they do something about it. They don't complain. They don't beg. They create. They innovate. They build. They make good decisions. > Not everyone has the time, people might have families, mortgages, debt to pay off, You act like all of this is random though. As if someone randomly wake up one day and has $40k in debt, a wife who doesn't work and three kids to feed. Those factors aren't random. That guy chose that life. What I'm suggesting is that we change the way we educate. Instead of corralling kids into over-priced institutions where they earn meaningless degrees for $200k a pop, push alternatives.
