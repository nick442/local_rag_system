Here is a less scientific view of why there is a focus on credit utilization, it is the easiest to control by doing something. The focus on utilization is coming from the people asking the questions regarding how to improve their score, some even have an obsession with trying to wring a few more points even though they have no immediate need for a loan. Look at the other factors: That means that for 70% the best advice is either wait for your history to get longer, don't open a new line, or don't close an old line. Therefore the only thing they control is to get their utilization score down. If they pay off balance that saves them interest, if they ask for or are award an increase in credit line that also brings down their utilization number. If it is the easiest to improve, it will garner a greater focus from consumers, therefore it seems that the credit industry focuses on it. In reality each consumer has to look at their situation to see which part of their overall score they need to focus on.
