The [parable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable), also known as the __broken window fallacy__ or __glazier's fallacy__, seeks to show how [opportunity costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_costs), as well as the [law of unintended consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences), affect economic activity in ways that are ""unseen"" or ignored. > --- ^Interesting: [^Frédéric ^Bastiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Bastiat) ^| [^Opportunity ^cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) ^| [^Broken ^windows ^theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjzyvts) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjzyvts)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)"
