"> and that is what's uncalled for. I think folks aren't reading this right. It's not ""you voted for Trump, which I disagree with."" Look at how a large swath of America views President Trump, and of more importance here - how a large number of folks view his supporters. Over 2/3 of Americans polled don't trust President Trump and think poorly of people that support him. If you follow the line of reasoning, you can get to ""anyone who supported Donald Trump is not acting rationally."" In that light, it would mean believing that someone who supports Donald Trump is doing so based on naked, unthinking politics instead of a rational evaluation of his policies and past history. In other words, Reed Hastings looks at ""voting for Trump"" as a sanity test, and this person (who not only voted for him, but advertised his doing so, loudly and proudly) does not have the kind of judgement he wants in a board member."
