> Show me clear evidence that a grocer is doing this, including references in their actual financial statements. Are you really that naive? If a company is doing this, it is not going to put that evidence on public display. This might be more of a local specific. My country had some very lawless years with high corruption rate - if you were displaying big profits there would be many people that would try to either take away your business entirely, or to extort money out of you. Usual preferred methods included operating entirely on credit (thus profits go to the bank, and not the owner) and using many short lived intermediates.
