I wasn't talking about college or university, which are severely overpriced, I was talking about tech schools or trade schools. I live in a city that has a lot of manufacturing jobs open but not enough people educated in the field to actually get those jobs. So there was a breakdown somewhere along the way in terms of the preparation for good paying manufacturing jobs. This is what we need to address, I think you thought I was talking about something else.
