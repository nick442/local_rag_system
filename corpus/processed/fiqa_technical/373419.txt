These are problems of crony capitalism. Most of our industries, especially healthcare and military are dominated by monopolies. More of the super wealthy have found that it is easier to make money having Republicans hand them monopolies with no regulation or oversight. This is why we have the slowest and most expensive internet in the industrialized world (other countries with government run internet have faster and cheaper). We have the most expensive and least effective healthcare in the industrialized world because of crony capitalism. The U.S. does not have a free market. It has crony capitalism.
