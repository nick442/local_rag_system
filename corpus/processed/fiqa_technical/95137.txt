I'm pissed off that I even have to type such a stupid obvious fact, but I'll do it anyway. Make a program that works like [steam](http://store.steampowered.com/). Have it not sell videogames, but TV channels. Let me buy Ã€ la carte TV channels, channels that come with NO ADS on the shows. You make up the lost ad money by my subscription. Better yet, offer a basic cheap package with commercials, then a pricier one without. If I'm watching it live and there's a commercial, just play music or something, do what CNN does for their live stream. (maybe tie-in some local weather or sports updates, run commercials for TV shows on that channel, people really don't mind that kind of ad) Now, when I buy a channel, let it also double as on-demand. I buy the HBO package, I can watch Game of Thrones whenever I want, as many times as I want. Hell, you could tie this service in with Hulu and let hulu be the On-Demand side. Instead of the 8 day wait, I get access to the show that same day. Throw in movies like we have on the on-demand and PPV and you can have a movie section as well. The first company to launch and implement this will corner the market. The first company to code this and get it bug free will be BILLIONAIRES at the absolute least. Facebook's IPO will look like pocket change, and this will actually hold its value. What I just typed out (and many have before me, I'm aware) is the final nail in the coffin of traditional TV. It's literally just waiting and ready for someone to swing the hammer down on it. We have the computer power, we have the bandwidth. We've HAD those things for a couple years now. Capitalize on it!
