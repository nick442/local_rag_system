The problem is, everyone feels pressure to grow. M&A is no longer just about cost synergies, but increasingly about revenue synergies and acquiring products or services that demonstrate growth with an ongoing runway. I see too many issues where acquires impede on the growth of their new acquisition, thus resulting in a huge failure. But today, it's a grow or die mindset (become an acquisition target or free full towards bankruptcy). Many are willing to overpay for growth so that they can continue on.
