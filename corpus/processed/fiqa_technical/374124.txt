I suppose you would support having the government provide all the wonderful pension and medical benefits that government workers, including legislators of course, receive? And where pray tell would all the cash come from? Just have the government print it up? Surely you can't be stupid enough to think that money created endlessly as needed without producing anything can retain its value do you? Government employees, including legislators and professional politicians, should not receive special benefits merely because they happen to be bureaucratic leeches on the public teat.
