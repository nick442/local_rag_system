Also, the city streets are not supposed to be a source of competition for their business. 17 states disagree with you. But they must have been simple-minded. How can brick and mortar restaurants factor in any kind of unknown competition - such as another brick & mortar, possibly a better or less expensive version of their own business? Should they be protected from anything they cannot factor into their initial decision to open a business? Where do you draw the line? I think that businesses should be protected from much larger businesses, but I don't think it's appropriate to use government to protect businesses from smaller/more agile businesses, or completely different business models. I think this entire argument is based on a logical fallacy: that mobile food is going to put restaurants out of business at a rate faster than they already do go out of business.
