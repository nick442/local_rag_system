"So basically, rather than spend money on upgrades to the existing 108 fighters, 'retire' them from active combat and switch them to the training pool, and just worry about fielding the new ones. An interesting point in the article: > ""We have actually had this dialogue with the F-16, we had this dialogue with the F-15, we had this dialogue with the F-22. We just haven't had it for a while."" Modern fighter jets don't really act much like planes anymore, budget-wise. The EOL cycle has really sped up - it used to be you could buy a fighter jet or a transport and use it for 25 years before worrying about replacing it with the latest and greatest. Now, the latest and greatest are still on the ground before they're obsolete. It might make a lot more sense to treat a fighter jet like a computer with an upgrade cycle of 3-5 years, roll the cost of maintenance and upgrades into the initial purchase for however long you're intending to keep the aircraft. I suspect a lot of generals would go pale if they knew the full cost of ownership of this generation of fighters going forward."
