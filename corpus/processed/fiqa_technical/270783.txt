">Average hours per worker has increased versus 30-40 years ago. That and better technology means we are more productive than ever. Production is great. Maybe it's too great? You really don't see the problem with this? More and more Americans (and other countries) are struggling and forced to work extra hours, if not two or three jobs, just to get by. The productivity and GPD (and cost of living) of the average worker has increased by an ENORMOUS amount, ***SO WHY HAVEN'T THEIR WAGES?!*** >If you slowed production, maybe you could prevent wealth from collecting in a few hands so quickly? >Wouldn't that be a ""weaker economy"" rather than a ""stronger economy""? No one's arguing that. Straw man. What people really want to see is policy reform to give labour better compensation. >Here's the crux of your problem. America got incredibly wealthy from WW2. This is why 30-40 years ago, there was a rich middle class that was stronger than it is today. This was not ""the economy's"" success. This was luck (or strategy, depending upon how much government planned it out). So where'd that wealth go? It just fucking disappeared, right? And the economy shrank? Fuck no. US GPD is [at ***record highs***](http://www.multpl.com/us-gdp-inflation-adjusted/table), but [***the compensation for labour has stagnated during those 30 years of prosperity.***](http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=773)"
