That is exactly the problem people aren't seeing. Automation. It makes things cheaper and more reliable than people. It also cuts the man hours needed down to a small fraction of what it was before. There haven't been enough new jobs created to make up for the jobs lost from automation. In a perfect world, we would all just work a shorter schedule each and still live increasingly better lives as time went on but we all know that isn't going to happen, at least not without HUGE changes to the whole world.
