I think the wifi connection was so that the juice dispenser wouldn't work if you use an off brand juice bag; they put DRM on juice. It wasn't for operating the machine via wifi. Idk how that would work anyways; you'd have to set it up and put a glass under it, then I guess use your phone to activate it later. But there wouldn't be any point, it takes a trivial amount of time to pour juice from a bag into a cup, unlike brewing coffee.
