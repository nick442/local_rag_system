>“That is the weather,” he said of changes in the markets. “It goes up and down, this and that, and that’s 80% of what you guys focus on.” >Dimon said financial journalists would be better off concentrating on the “bad policies” that are hurting average Americans. He's right, it is embarassing, however he's mistaken about what would be best for financial journalists. They aren't really interested in what's best for America. Their jobs demand that they publish content, and they believe that the easiest and best way to publish lots of content in a consistent manner is to focus on short sighted topics. Anywhere you see people trying to feed the 24 hour media cycle you see this problem emerge. It's difficult to blame them, they gotta feed their families afterall. We don't need this 24/7 flood of news. If every media outlet published on a weekly basis or less, they could focus on more important stories and they could take more time to investigate them. Their audience could focus on their own lives and bettering themselves. It would be a win:win. But that's not what we have. Because Americans are fools? Does anyone remember what sort of role JP Morgan had during the housing collapse however? Was this guy their CEO back then? I'm not forgiving any of them for that faux pas, and neither should anyone else. It's difficult to take seriously criticism coming from the most crooked industry in the world. At the end of the day money doesn't really matter. What matters is that people's needs are met, both needs for survival and recreation. In their greedy thirst for the second, the employees at all the major banks destroyed the lives of many people who were simply struggling to meet the first. Not cool.
