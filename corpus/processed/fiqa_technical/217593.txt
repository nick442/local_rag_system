"Economics is like religion. Every ""school"" of economics claims it is the correct school and the *only* correct school. So ""Austrian economists"" who worship Hayek say ""Keynesians"" won't get into heaven. But both have the audacity to call economics a ""science."" Everything you read, hear, and see about economics comes from [one of these biased schools.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_economic_thought) Watching this video is like asking a Catholic priest to debate Jesus vs. Muhammed. He may be able to compare and contrast certain points, but in the end, you know who for whom the priest is rooting. **TL;DR** The video is made by fans of Hayek."
