>Have these corporations taken away your ability to vote? What do votes matter if they have no power? To relate, in my home city, the local utility company is a monopoly. A Public Utility Commission (PUC) of 3 commissioners was set up to regulate them. The utility offers all the PUC Commissioners cushy no-show jobs after their term. The results of this regulatory capture? We have the highest electric rates in the continental US. The next county over with a less powerful company is less than half the price from the same powerplants. This is the same story for many such things including healthcare and insurance, internet, etc. We can vote how we want, nothing changes because the corporations swing both ways.
