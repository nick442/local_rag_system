On June 30 2015, the value of a key should be exactly the expected revenue from selling the chest contents, owing to the fact that the next day the keys become worthless. Looking at the steam community market, it seems like the value of a key is higher than this, but lower than 2.50? If that's true, then since the price of a key is higher than the expected revenue from selling the chest contents as you say, then you can see that at some point the value of a key will have to go down. And as you get closer to the cutoff date, the price will fall faster. It's not quite the same, but this pattern is usually what you see in the ticket resale market on say, StubHub. If there's something about keys that keeps their worth above the expected value of selling chest contents (some value to the flexibility that keys offer over other tradable items maybe?), then in the short run that won't change due to this distant deadline, just because it's so far off. People will still want the flexibility keys offer. Orthodox economics might suggest sell sooner rather than later, but certainly don't wait too long. Different people react differently though. If there are a lot of panicky people who sell their keys after hearing this news, it might be a good time to buy. Of course it's a gamble, but if you trust in whatever force keeps keys priced above the expected value of the loot they can buy, then that force should win out in the medium term and you could turn a profit.
