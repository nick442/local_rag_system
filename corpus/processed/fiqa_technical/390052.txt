To start, you should find someone in the field to give you IB advice. Also my numbering is unrelated to yours 1. Get on WSO/other websites, understand the job and KNOW TECHNICALS 2. Know that you can get an IB job from a non target, but it will take a lot of work and some luck 3. Getting the junior year internship is of the utmost importance 4. Networking is how you get interviews. Email every DePaul alumni you can find who's in IB no matter the role and get on the phone with some. Do the same for any person you know. 5. Have an amazing gpa 6. Did I mention networking already?
