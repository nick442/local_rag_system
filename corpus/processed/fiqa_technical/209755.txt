The thing is, this is not the same electrical system that Saab would be employing. I see you guys are saying but it's just not the same. Electric cars require a whole new level of engineering, not just the wiring looms and such. Since it'll be a main focus of the car, they'll be doing things differently than they used to. And yeah, reliability is going to be questionable up until the cars are released. Tesla motors is a good example of lofty electrical engine goals and unreliability. So I'm not saying it'll be a perfect car, I'm just saying it will most likely be handled in a different way.
