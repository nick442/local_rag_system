"There was a time when a new Aston Martin was an exciting thing. They once produced the greatest looking car the world has ever seen; the V8 Vantage. But it's all been downhill from there, with Aston designers being almost as lazy as 911 ""designers"", and all subsequent Astons being same-old-same-old. So boring."
