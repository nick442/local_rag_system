I hear that Google's counter to the Amazon/WF play is to push Google Express mass market. This would mean dropping the yearly membership and partnering with Walmart to expand available inventory. I don't like it for the reason mentioned above. I mean Google has the cash reserves to go after Target or even Costco, but they have a poor history of managing established brands post acquisition. Hello Moto? Still I personally spend loads of money at Amazon, Whole Foods, Costco, and Target.. hardly a penny at Walmart.
