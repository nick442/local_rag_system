I'm amazed anyone is able to airbnb honestly. I've stayed in about 6 of them, and most neighborhoods and apartment complexes are super butthurt about airbnb, when like half of the people living there are large families or have more people in a unit than an airbnb anyways. 2 people staying in a 3br when 1 or two people stay there normally is no different than 4 people living in the 3br yearround, except that the airbnb example uses less apartment and community resources anyways.
