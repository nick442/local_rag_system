"Well, okay, let's unpack that. Lying 24/7 is a pretty strong claim, even if it's a hyperbole. The problem is not false statements and ""fake news"", but that [MSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pS4x8hXQ5c) makes politics a [drama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fKsBj2M-T8), not a topic of research and reason. Also, what do you mean fake climate crisis? Do you think the warming is not real? Or do you think it's not dangerous? What do you mean NSA/CIA influence elections? WikiLeaks posted a lot of bullshit lately, is there something that you consider credible? Can you link to it? > State has the capability to hack and leave a ""Russian footprint."" Anyone can do it, but [attribution in cyberwar](https://medium.com/@thegrugq/evidence-guccifer-2-0-is-russian-intel-55f9f8b3f135) doesn't work like that. [APT28](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/google-knows-a-ton-about-russian-government-hackers-1c7f7efdebfd) (that did the DNC hack/leak) is attributed to GRU (Russian military intelligence), and the leaked NSA docs confirmed it. (You've [seen it](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-election-hacking-playbook/), I presume.) > Somebody is pulling all the strings for a world government What makes you think this is the case? > Russia is moot. Why?"
