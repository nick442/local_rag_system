"Yes, there is a financial benefit, if and only if you can live on 24/26th of your salary. Thus, bi-weekly is 12/13 lower than a bi-monthly income. However, you now get a so-called ""extra"" paycheck twice a year. (We typically get them in March and October.) You can either spend those extra paychecks on ""hookers and blow"" or spend them wisely on things like accelerated debt repayment, home/car down payment, property taxes, etc, etc. HOWEVER.. none of this really matters, since you don't control whether or not you're paid bi-weekly or semi-monthly."
