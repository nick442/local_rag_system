Thats a good question. You don't have any argument from me on that. However, I have friends who have done that and after a few years living like that, its extremely hard on them if they get sick, because the system THAT I AM TELLING YOU ABOUT, will ruin them *in a flash*. Its increasingly designed to take ALL of people's money when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are sick. And IT doesn't care. Single payer systems will just fix you up, you dont get a bill. They have to be free, which you can tell [by reading this](http://www.iatp.org/files/GATS_and_Public_Service_Systems.htm) - which explains why.
