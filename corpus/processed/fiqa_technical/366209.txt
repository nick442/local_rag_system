Is it possible for Saudi Arabia to create that much renewable energy to replace oil? Saudi Aramco itself is estimated to be a trillion dollar company. In terms of Solar energy, America just has more land to farm solar. Where will their edge come from? Maybe cause political unrest/financial instability of many middle eastern countries?
