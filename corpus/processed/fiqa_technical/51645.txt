Politicians report campaign contributions, people keep track of PACs, and the lobby groups regularly post policy recommendations on their sites. So there are cases where that recommendation went into law. http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/11/11/243973620/when-lobbyists-literally-write-the-bill Here are a lot of model bills from ALEC: http://www.alecexposed.org/wiki/Bills_Affecting_our_Water,_Air,_%26_Land And I don't know if any of them made it into actual law. But feel free to use sarcasm, that'll surely help your ignorance.
