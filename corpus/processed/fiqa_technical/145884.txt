Mark Zuckerberg doesn't seem to think we can or should isolate and alienate 50% of the population because of their support of a political candidate, which I, the author, and Hastings seem to share a criticism of. Zuckerberg misses the point. Support of Trump has always been unpalatable to most on the left but now it's unforgivable. Pressure from all sides to erode his support is exactly what we should be doing; Facebook is one of the most powerful tools available in this effort.
