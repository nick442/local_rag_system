Trains haven't been designed to conduct themselves. Yet. Busses haven't been designed to drive themselves. Yet. Subways haven't been designed to conduct themselves. Yet. Airplanes have been designed to fly themselves and do so for more than 90% of the trip. They also happen to have the safest record of all forms of travel. I never mentioned elevators but both airplanes and elevators are machines that move people from one place to another that used to be operated by a trained professionals and now pretty much run themselves. Both are still monitored by humans in case of emergency. Both still need regular maintenance by highly trained professionals. Both still have the potential to fail and injure or kill their occupants. I see nothing ludicrous about the comparison of the two in the context of automated people-movers.
