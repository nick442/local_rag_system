For those that are on the forefront of innovation and are passionate about their work, sure. But I'd guess that demographic only makes up about 10 percent of the workforce. For the rest of us, you have to ask yourself the question: is it worth it? The rest of us are mostly maintaining society and providing services. What if 2 people worked the same job that 1 person works, each putting in 3 days a week instead of 5. Unemployment would go down. Maybe people only work these long weeks because they've been told it's their only option. Also, we don't really have the choice. If I apply for a job and tell them I'd like to only work 3 days a week, they'd laugh me out.
