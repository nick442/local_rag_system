"A lower price is likely to be slightly more attractive to sellers than paying an equivalent amount in closing costs. The seller is going to be paying the realtor(s) commission on the higher ""sale"" price and will net slightly less money. It is common in my experience to ask for closing costs. The generic answer for your questions about how it is spent depends on the bank and type of loan. In general you will not be able to walk away with the cash if closing costs are less than the concession but they can be applied to funding escrow and points transfer fees etc. There is the potential to lose the concession if there aren't sufficient closing costs. I am fairly certain that there isn't any tax differences between the two in the US."
