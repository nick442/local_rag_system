I don't think this is a French thing. It's like this everywhere. Banks always want people to open accounts of every type. A person with a checking account should be easy to sell on a savings account at the same institution. Given that it does not appear that they will have any chance to recover the money they spend to get customers to open these accounts (there are no fees and they have to pay out the interests, even if very small) Oh, they recover it. Banks make money by having deposits that they can use to lend out. They do pay interest on deposits, but not as much as they earn on your money. If they persuade you to have a savings account in addition to your checking account, then you might find it convenient and then move your money out of a different institution into their savings account. Or you might stop hoarding it under your mattress. Or whatever. More money in their accounts means more profit for them. I don't know whether banks make more profit per dollar in savings or checking accounts. I see banks pushing for both. I think they simply view more accounts as a good thing because it can lead to more total savings in their institution. That's how they make money.
