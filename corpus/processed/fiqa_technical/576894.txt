"Having thought about it, I decided to start with another book by the same author : ""The Interpretation of Financial Statements"". I do not have a sufficiently strong basis to know what either ""The Intelligent Investor"" or ""Security Analysis"" are even about. Yeah, I might understand things, but I wouldn't grasp the essence, as I would be too busy figuring out what I didn't understand and miss the forest for the trees."
