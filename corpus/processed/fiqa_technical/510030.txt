"From what I understand, it involves a lot of screen capping facebook conversations and posting them to /r/atheism for a bountiful harvest of bitter karma points. :P In reality, it would be more of the everyday things they *don't* do. No ""God bless you"" when someone sneezes. No ""I'll pray for you"" when a negative event happens. The occasional atheist may rant IRL about how ""God is a magic friend"" or however that goes. Basically, acting from a belief that there is no god."
