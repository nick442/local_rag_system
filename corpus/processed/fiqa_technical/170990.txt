"Is productivity the ultimate measure of success? I know it is when it comes to competition, but fuck, extrapolate out this ""progress"" and realize that in some not so distant futurethere will be little need for any ""manual"" jobs, and even some ""high tech"" or ""complicated"" jobs will probably be able to be automated by then. What will we do? Unemployment is such a concern now, and unfortunatley, keeping unemployment low is directly at odds with increasing productivity."
