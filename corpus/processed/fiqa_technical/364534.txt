But a textbook liquidity trap means prices fluctuate. We've seen nothing but steady increases in every single possible measurable standard. Liquidity traps occur when there is fear of deflation. There is no such fear. Deflation would be a welcome remedy to today's currency crisis. Your paycheck would be able to purchase more and we would see prices fall, making it easier for the average American to afford their food, gas and housing. Plus, lending is down not because banks are hoarding cash. If anything, banks are trying to lend out more than ever. Standards for borrowing have plummited. Anyone willing to sign a contract can get hundreds of thousands of dollars at the drop of a hat. Lending is down because consumer and business demand for more debt is down. I stopped reading Krugman years ago, but if he is seriously trying to sell a liquidity trap right now, he is horribly misleading people and his advocacy of the Fed's printing and lending policies as of late is just flat out dangerous to the global economy.
