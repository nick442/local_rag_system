If you have a copy of the deed, or the original deed itself, take it to a lawyer and have them look it over with you and your other sister. Mention all the details you mentioned here - exactly what you want to do with the property, any correspondence you've had with your sister, and where the property is located. We can't give you any advice without being able to see the deed, and we're not qualified to give any advice outside of 'get a lawyer', because we're not lawyers. Get one, and arm him with as much information about the situation as possible.
