The particularly hilarious part was the conclusion: >What is to be done about it? The answer is that if the world is facing such an enormous glut of savings then they have to be taxed as fast as possible to prevent they imbalances they create. So we need higher corporation taxes. We need withholding taxes on dividends and interest going to tax havens. We need capital gains taxes at rates as high as income taxes. We need an investment income surcharge to increase tax rates on unearned income to match those including national insurance on earnings. And we need effective wealth taxes. Plus a continued crack down on tax havens, of course. >And I mean we may need all of these. The world cannot afford for its wealthy people to become US$57 trillion richer in the next five years. That would be a disaster for us all, including the wealthiest. So action is needed urgently. And now. We canâ€™t wait for things to get ugly.
