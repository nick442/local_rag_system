"Depending on how the check was made out, you may be able to file a DBA (""doing business as""), which would give you the business name locally. Then open an account under that name and deposit the check. Or simply go back to the customer and say ""hey, I don't have yhe company bak account open yet; could I exchange this check for one made out to me personally?"" That's how I've been handling hobby income under a company name. (I really do ned to file that DBA!)"
