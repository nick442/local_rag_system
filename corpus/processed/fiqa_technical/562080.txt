That's a rearrangement of the fisher equation; which is the correct way to determine real rates. However, people often use the approximation real â‰ˆ nominal - inflation; and if you're doing this for homework on software that is looking for exactly 1 numerical answer, they may be expecting you to use that instead. Real interest rate is less formal nomenclature and refers to using the approximation. Inflation-adjusted return is the equation. In the real world you will use the approximation when you're figuring out a real rate while you're talking mid-sentence during a meeting; and use the equation in spreadsheets/calculations.
