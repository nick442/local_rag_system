Merely restating their words in a mocking tone is not a counter argument. If you have no car you will have great difficulty finding and retaining employment unless you live in a relatively dense urban area, which you may be able to afford either. If you have no education you will similarly have difficulty finding employment, and finding employment that will afford you a stable life. If your choices are restained to relative poverty or debt, it's hard to argue that you are in charge of those choices.
