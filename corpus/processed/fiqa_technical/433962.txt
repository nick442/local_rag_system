"Wait, where did you hear that ""fable""? Cause the guy actually mentioned that he went to Harvard, Yale and Stanford, I believe, and at none of those was Marx studied? Aforementioned are stages in the development of the productive forces, formation of classes and respectively of the distribution of wealth in the society. It looks like you don't have a clue about Marx and have just aired some ""broad and sloppy"" meaningless opinion."
