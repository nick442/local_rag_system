"It may seem like you cannot live without this trip, but borrowing money is a bad habit to get into. Especially for things like vacations. Your best bet is to save up money and only ever pay cash for things that will decrease in value. Please note that while it is a bad idea to borrow money for things that decrease in value, the ""opposite"" is not necessarily true. That is, it is not necessarily a good idea to borrow money for things that will increase in value; or, will earn you income. False assumptions can cloud our judgement. The housing bubble and the stock market crash of 1929 are two examples, but there are many others."
