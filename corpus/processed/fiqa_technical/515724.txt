The USDA is a joke. Fertilizer companies have had non organic substances labeled as organic for decades. So basically you just have to use organic antibiotics and feed but nobody has to prove they did that or prove it's organic, so it's all bullshit. You CAN get audited but it rarely happens. There is absolutely no reason to think organic means healthier for you. The use of antibiotics really has nothing to do with organic vs non-organic. Antiobiotics can be made organically and plenty of organic shit is horrible for you. Periodic use of antibiotics should not be seen as non-organic. If anything this just further highlights the USDA is full of shit.
