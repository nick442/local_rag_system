"Having worked as a vendor at different Walmart I will say the Whole Foods deal is horrible business, on top of that why is everyone acting. Like amazon makes money on retail? They are yet to make money on it and the only thing that made amazon profitable was AWS and only a few years ago. Walmart actually makes money, and if they have a better chance to survive and beat amazon than people give them credit for. Amazon on the other hand never been in the physical store gig, it's a whole different ball game out there, they can't even compete on price. From a proven track record business perspective I say amazon is building their business strategy on hope prayer and a string if they think they can turn Whole Foods around from the business model disaster they operate on. And Walmart has slowly began realizing that to survive they need to become Kroger in their grocery business."", and they been pushing that a lot out there it's working for them. There's also the issue of market fragmentation, walmart doesn't operate in the same market segment as target or Whole Foods, and they have failed to push their business into places they would be successful. Walmart main competitor isn't target or amazon, it's grocery stores and dollar general."
