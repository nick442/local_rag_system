Not a problem because people in the US are all borderline braindead and ruled over by profit-crazed maniacs. In contrast with the unblemished Europeans who shit rainbows and prance around on unicorns smiting the rich and handing out money to the poor. If you think there is any fundamental difference in the way giant corporations do things, anywhere, you are beyond naive.
