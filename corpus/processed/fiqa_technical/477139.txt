There was a really good discussion with Arthur Levitt (former SEC Chairman) about this on Bloomberg Surveillance this morning. I'd post a link, but it's not up on [their podcast page](http://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/surveillance/). Basically, the argument was that it's pretty much impossible for the living wills to act as they should - trading books are far too large and complex for easily unwind in an emergency.
