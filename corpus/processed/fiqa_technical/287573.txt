"As with most things, you'll see a variety of agreement and adoption, including a fringe percentage of people who see all meat, lab cultured or otherwise, as unethical or ""wrong"". Whether they consider it ""wrong"" because it's GMO or ""wrong"" because it's cultured from actual animal DNA , we'll just have to wait and see. However, as far as I'm concerned, lab grown meat is the next proper step in human nutrition and sustenance. I've watched this company for a little while now, and I cannot wait for this (and other) company to grow and get their products out there."
