My Prediction: Expect to see a lot more automation of check out stands for big brand retail stores as employees are let go to save on health insurance costs and many brick&mortar stores will accelerate their extinction pace. The era of big online stores with huge warehouses fulfillment centers (again more automation will make its way here as well) will be the new and dominate trend when high volume b&m do not meet the ability to compensate this added tax burden placed onto them by Obamcare and thus unemployment will again surge. The big winner though in all of this will be health insurance companies who have figuratively been given a license to print money by this mandate.
