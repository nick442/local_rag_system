Good read. I do wish there were more stats on the issues associated with geographic concentration touched upon in the article. For example, how are the economic gains of being in an urbanized environment mitigated by the costs associated with traffic jams, urban poverty and crime? What would happen to the economy of the US if those inefficient small cities kept declining, how would it have to change?
