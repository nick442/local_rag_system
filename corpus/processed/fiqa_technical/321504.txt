This is true! On-line sales, mostly by Amazon, destroyed retail. And, while many people lost their jobs (new jobs were created, but much less), many people saved a lot of money. I don't think the Brick and mortar retail can be the same if you can shop and have huge selection on-line from anywhere were you live.
