The Roth is the mirror image of the Pre-Tax (traditional) IRA. The latter gives you a tax break now, the deposits go in pre-tax, and are withdrawn at your rate in retirement. The former lets you squirrel that money away now, post-tax, but never pay tax again. For young folk the Roth is a great way to go. My 12 year old has a Roth account, and paid no tax since she has her own exemption. At your level, you are probably in the 10% bracket now. Imagine investing that money and at retirement finding it's grown 100X (very possible), if it were in a Roth, you'd have no tax due. As BST noted, you are always free to withdraw the deposit, so if you decide this wasn't money you could actually put away long term you still have an out.
