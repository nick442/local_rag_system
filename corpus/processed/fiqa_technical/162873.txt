"In addition to the advice of @karancan, If you wish to stay strictly with GICs, there are better ways to find good GIC rates, than looking at advertising from institutions you are already dealing with.

Many of these institutions allow on-line purchases and transfers, requiring only a ""regular"" bank account as a source/destination for on-line transfers.."
