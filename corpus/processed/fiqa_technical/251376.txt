It takes a long time to bring these sort of cases to trial because of their complexity and the large sums of money that companies have to delay the process. It takes political will to go after these types of crimes. From the politics to building a case, it just seems to me that five years is a very short time frame. I don't know how or why it was set at five years, but due to what we know now, it might be a better idea to extend the statue, if the pros outweigh the cons.
