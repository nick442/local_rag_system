You are correct. It's using accounting to accomplish different goals. First, relevant costs should be considered when making the decision to buy internally rather than externally. Second, by adding the possibility for a cost centre to turn a profit, even if it is only an accounting trick, means that interest are better aligned (profit motive and all). Third, you are right that on the consolidated/group level there is no real profit. It can give a better picture of actual economic performance though.
