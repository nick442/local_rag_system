You make it sound like consumers literally have no choice in the matter. That's absurd. The fact that many people don't make an effort to be responsible consumers is no one else's fault. As long as businesses are not outright lying about their products or services, there's no reason for the government to be in loved. It's really not hard to control the impulse to buy a tabloid or a snickers bar.
