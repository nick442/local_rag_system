That's how you get lesser quality employees generally and less service. Considering the median income in that town is 160k I imagine the government employees are not the affluent ones. Pretty embarrassing actually that a town with that type of demographic would have to cut labor and you know it would be political suicide when people expect a certain level of government service.
