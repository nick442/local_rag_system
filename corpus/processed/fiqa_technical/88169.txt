How is that the wrong use of marginal? Its marginal in that it is small. Not marginal in the economic sense, which is what I think you think I meant. You operating on the premise that loans for advanced education is the right model. I disagree wholeheartedly. Make public university free and crank up the standards. Not that hard.
