"> The fields you listed are unrelated to the problem at hand The problem at hand - the problem, in fact, that you brought up - is the role of centralization in the downfall of empires. Sociology, anthropology, political science and history all inform that problem. > and your conclusion is a nonsequitor. My argument, where A is ""it is provably true that centralization is the root cause of failure of each empire and would-be empire"" and B is ""we can pack up sociology, anthropology, political science, and most of history and go home"", can be restated as: If A, then B. Not B. Therefore not A. You can argue with the premises, but it is most certainly not a non sequitur."
