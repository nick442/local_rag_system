I assume you're posting like an asshole because you've recently lost weight, and there's some sort of psychological consistency thing going on. Did you read the article, you should be aware that you're likely going to feel as if you're starving for several years at best. For example - many years ago I too lost significant weight (~70 lbs), and kept it off for a long time. Once I assumed I was in the clear a couple of years later and stopped tracking my diet, it slowly started creeping back (maybe +5 lbs/year, almost imperceptible). I find nowadays that if I don't log literally everything that goes into my mouth and weigh myself daily, I inevitably gain weight. That was a lesson that was not easy to learn, and is not part of any diet program I've ever heard of. Point is - you don't know what you're talking about until you've kept significant weight off for a couple of years. In the mean time, you should chill the fuck out, because when you have a better perspective your current attitude will seem embarrassingly stupid.
