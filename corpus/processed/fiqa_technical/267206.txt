"The text of the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act states (Section 14, paragraph a): A custodian may deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the minor's benefit so much of the custodial property as the custodian considers advisable for the use and benefit of the minor, without court order and without regard to (i) the duty or ability of the custodian personally or of any other person to support the minor, or (ii) any other income or property of the minor which may be applicable or available for that purpose. Unfortunately, it is pretty hard to make the case that giving the money to her siblings is for the ""use and benefit"" of your daughter. However, when your daughter reaches the age of maturity, any money left in the UTMA account becomes hers. She, at that time, could give money to her siblings, if she chooses. Perhaps you and your father could talk to her about your father's wishes for this money, and that would show her that she should do so at that time. If you don't follow these rules, then your daughter or your father could sue you at any point in the future."
