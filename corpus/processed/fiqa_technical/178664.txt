You understand that inhalation/smoking isn't the only route of administration for THC (active drug in pot), right? Pseudo-Pharmaceutical grade cannabinoid extractions are already used as medication for those with excruciating GI issues, glaucoma and seizure disorders. The only reason smoking the buds is the preferred method of consumption is because it's the base form and easy to come by. It's (typically) too expensive for one to refine the drug themselves, too risky legally or too dangerous without a controlled laboratory setting. Due to the length of its illegality, extensive research is prohibited to even determine what benefits it could even have in these forms. You have no idea what therapeutic dosing or high grade cannabinoids could even do because no one is allowed to do it. Especially not doctors trying to keep their medical licenses. Also I disagree that the benefits of opioids outweigh the side effects. That's why we're having the opioid crisis in the first place. Highly addictive and can lead to overdose. While there is no single case of THC overdose. (Forensic drug chemist here, not talking out my ass)
