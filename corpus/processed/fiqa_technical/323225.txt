Make it phase out slowly. Not unlike the EITC. First, Start with a flat 7% tax that's not refundable. That's 1.26-trillion. There's 325-million people are in America, but 75-million of those are children. There's enough money there to give a parent, for every child they have, $3500 a year, regardless of that parent's income AND give half the adults remaining(125-million) an average of $8000 a year. Have that slowly fade from $12,000 for the lowest earners to $4,000 for those that are earning the median income. $12000 is 102% of the poverty line. So a single person with nothing still lives above the poverty line With this model, 61.5% of households are receiving some kind of UBI aid, the most desperate are receiving the most, and the bottom half of earners are guaranteed to get something. For only 7% of GDP.
