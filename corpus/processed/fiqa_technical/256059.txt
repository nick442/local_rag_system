Here's the response that Josh James gives to this article: [Dave, Dave, Dave..](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkwilliams/2012/06/15/dave-dave-dave/) It's interesting to hear his side of the story. He's not all about hiring people with lots of experience, and he will make exceptions, but he does hold that as a good rule of thumb. Do you agree more with David or Josh?
