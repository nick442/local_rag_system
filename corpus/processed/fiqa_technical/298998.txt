"Just to clarify, In wikipedia when it says It is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year They are referring to the company which is asking for money. So for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an IPO, indefinitely. Meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year. The definition in Investopedia basically says the same thing Wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the ""for periods longer than a year"". For example Wikipedia uses the term ""business enterprises"" and ""governments"" while Investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector, in this context ""business enterprise"" is ""private sector"" and ""governments"" is ""public sector"" So in the sense of the length debt is issued yes, money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets."
