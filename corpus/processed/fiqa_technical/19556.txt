Disvestment activities tend to be misguided. In doing so, a fund/individual is not really taking money away from the companies in question (assuming they're not doing secondary offerings), and 'disvestment' doesn't imply that you're going to be using their products less (or boycotting them entirely), which would actually impact their financials. And in a convoluted way, disvestment could actually trigger further consolidation among coal companies, since it makes them cheaper and thus easier takeover targets. Funds that have the ability to do so should make 2nd & 3rd round VC investments in clean energy startups. It's been awfully difficult for clean energy startups to raise money lately, and funding those startups would have a lot more impact.
