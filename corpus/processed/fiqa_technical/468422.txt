Retail companies selling their real estate holdings isn't uncommon and is actually pushed for by shareholders sometimes (see Macy's and Starboard Value). The fact that the CEO bought them seems unique but not necessarily means there was an issue. I would think that type of transaction would get a lot of scrutiny so would be surprised if he could pull off any fuckery. The disclosure seems like it might be a pretty standard disclosure known as a related party transaction that again isn't in and of itself an issue
