***NO WEBSITE IS PERMANENT!*** Fuck, how stupid are investors? Websites have a popular life of a couple of years at best. Why pay insane P/Es when the expected life is so damned short? Why do stable companies with no horizon in sight have low PEs while extremely volatile, short-lived websites have high PEs? This defies all logic. Stop chasing sexy and go with something stable and long term. You morons.
