If this is the case then it will never get past the Senate. It requires 67 votes to be approved for ratification. Negotiators know this. Anything that they think will prevent passage by the Senate will not be in the final draft of the agreement. It's not like they can just sneak this past the Senate and the people. They can only keep the negotiations secret, the full agreement will be public and hotly debated well before it would be put to a vote in the Senate.
