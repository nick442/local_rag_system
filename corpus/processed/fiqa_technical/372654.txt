"What folks here don't get is it's generally in the industries interest to not mislead. As you may have noticed, folks don't like being mislead. Yes, it happens, but the large majority of companies consider it in their interests to label clearly. Are you aware that General Foods is strongly lobbying to mandate GMO labeling? Or that the pork industry is making a strong (hopefully successful) effort to change the rules about ""natural"" nitrites so that they're labeled like any other nitrite? I'm guessing you're not, and instead are just making unfounded assumptions."
