"not a fan of Taylor swift, but this article is pretty silly. her beef is with her promotion style? that she says she is going to announce something on August 18th, and then proceeds to announce something on August 18th? like ""you were supposed to surprise me! the way you have promoted your record is so unoriginal"".. never mind what the album sounds like.. her go-to-market strategy is so cliche!"
