Off the top of my head I can think of 10 prop shops in Chicago that don't require any sort of certifications. Most those certification requirements are there only when you are managing outside investor money. I was under the impression you are just trading the firm's capital, not outside investor capital, which is why I asked (which, to me, is the definition of a prop shop.)
