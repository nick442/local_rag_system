"Thanks for quoting the ""meat"" of the article (I agree with the GP, *I* didn't have the patience to make it to page 2), but this ""meat"" is still textured flavored soy protein.. > Well, one of the reasons there's no place to invest the cash is that wages as a percentage of GDP have fallen by so much that workers can't afford to buy anything any more. *What*? This manages to be both circular *and* wrong on multiple levels! ""Our workers can't afford our product so we can't spend all this cash rolling in on them"". > We kept profits to a minimum, because if we had high profits, we would have to pay high taxes. So at every opportunity, we bought another machine or we opened another plant or we hired more people, to try to build long term value through expansion because that was the way you avoided tax. Ah, ""Daddy had the luxury of operating in a non-saturated market"". Meanwhile, Google, Apple, and Microsoft piss away money as fast as they can on all sorts of basic research, and yet *still* have massive stockpiles. But then, I think that touches on the *real* problem with Hanauer's point - It's just plain *false*. We live in a world where the governments have become so dysfunctional that private industry is now funding things like space exploration, energy policy, education, transportation."
