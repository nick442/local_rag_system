cfa here what sort of valuation/modeling/analysis do you do? is it similar to the cfa curriculum? just because you're good at math doesn't mean you'll be good at cfa math. and do you have a good knowledge of econ, quantitative methods, and equity/debt concepts? keep in mind you only need to pass and not get everything right. for the most part i feel that people who come from a finance background in terms of education and/or work experience has it easier. ~150 hours seems to be cutting it close personally
