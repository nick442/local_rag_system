Yea, they seem okay with price variance. Here, the price swings a buck depending on which side of the county line you're on. It looks like they've made it as far north as MD with the full list of states being: GA, KY, MD, NC, SC, TN, VA. They are freaking moving fast. It was only a couple of years ago that they moved beyond the NC borders but what's wild is all the restaurants outside of NC I've seen have dine-in seating. I still get tripped up in NC and start looking for the doors to go in while the people in the drive-through stare at me in confusion. I wonder if they'll ever change that.
