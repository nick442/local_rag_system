"Yes. Your original fucking comment was that taxation and paying taxes is *moral*. Not that it is reality. If you had said ""We have to pay taxes as it stands now and if we don't we'll get thrown in jail."" I would have agreed. But you waxed poetic about how it's the good, wholesome, moral thing to do. That is what I took issue with. Do not make points if you refuse to defend them."
