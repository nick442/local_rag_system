Yeah, but industrial use of gold and silver is not what really makes it valuable. If people stopped viewing gold as status symbol or investment, and used it only for industry, it's value would drop rapidly. Same with diamonds - yes, they are valuable for industrial saws, but that is marginal part of therlir value. Also, it is not that money is illusory and based on trust. It is that *society* is illusory and based on trust. If people suddenly stopped believing in society and following social norms and institutions, there would be a chaos, and only *real* source of power would come from physical force and from weapons.
