There's a difference between funding and paying. We will build it and then either sell them the energy created from the solar panels or levy against monies being sent to Mexico. However the money is recouped it is a penalty for their failure to police their border towns and stop the influx of drugs along with illegal immigrants. The cost of social benefits for illegal immigrants alone will recoup the cost in one year. I can get you sources for that math too or you can just google it.
