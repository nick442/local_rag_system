Yeah it's sad. I read in the paper that their Finnish supplier company filed for bankruptcy because Nokia looked to Asia for suppliers. I like Nokia hardware, other phones feel flimsy compared to my N8. The Lumia hardware feels solid too, too bad I'm deterred from buying it because Nokia is going under.
