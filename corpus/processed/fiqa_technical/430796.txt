I am not going to source for you a number I pulled out of my smelly, hairy ass. Not worth the trouble. Also, I am at work. And I support not being strangled by debt. Free for the student. Obviously someone pays for it i.e. we all pay for it because we (or at least I) believe everybody has the right to a decent education. I guess you disagree on that latter poin, which makes you a luddite, if anything.
