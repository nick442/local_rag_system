"I don't doubt that. But the increase of OD we see here at the medical examiners office is unprecedented. Fentanyl cut heroin and fentanyl derivatives are making addicts drop like flies and has been on the up since 2014. Though I'm probably biased because I see it everyday with the cases I deal with and the damage it has already done. But if you don't think it's a problem, you're sadly mistaken. Not even bother with the attempt at the dig w/ the CNN thing. The ""talking out my ass"" quip was more in response to the ""take a hit"" mention from the comment before. And your response clearly only zoned in on the last potion of my response. As a clinical pharmacist you should know smoking wouldn't be the way to administer it anyway."
