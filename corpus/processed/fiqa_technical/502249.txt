The person I was responding to didn't say they aren't making a profit, and he didn't say they aren't generating any revenue. He said they don't make money, which is ambiguous. Saying a company isn't making any profit has a clear meaning. Saying a company isn't generating revenue has a clear meaning. Saying a company isn't making any money does not. It could imply the company is not generating any revenue at all, or that it's not realizing a profit from the revenue that it is generating. I'm not sure how you read my original comment and come away with the idea that I don't understand the difference between profit and revenue when that was specifically the point I was making.
