"GreenLight offers a paid service for $5 per month that requires an adult primary account holder, and then unlimited accounts, including minors, as part of that service. I saw no minimum age requirement (see section ""Minors as Sub-Account Cardholders""). https://www.greenlightcard.com/index.html Disclaimer: I haven't tried this service"
