We go for the lesser of two evils, which would be Obama. You may not think he differs significantly from Bush, but he *does* differ. Romney would be indistinguishable from Bush in terms of economic policy. More tax cuts, more austerity and more invocations of the Free Market Fairy to solve the economy through magic. In the meanwhile we start building support for a strong candidate in 2016, someone who actually represents us instead of the 1%.
