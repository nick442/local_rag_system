>I think the Fed should print $ and distribute per capita rather than do QE, which helps the rich more.. That I agree with, but I think it would be more straight forward at the moment to just increase the minimum wage first of all, and then look at printing money. Also not all subsidies are created equal, some are good at shaping desired behavior but too often they are inefficient and to the benefit of big business and the rich which doesn't need them.
