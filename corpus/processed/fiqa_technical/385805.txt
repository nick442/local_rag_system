"The drone business is going to do away with most trucking firms anyhow for larger areas. For the more rural areas they're investing heavily in self-driving delivery vehicles taking the human factor out of it entirely. Edit: Don't know why I'm being down voted but you might be clueless if you think self driving trucks aren't going to be ""the next big thing"" going into the 2020s. They're already here, they're already being proven, and they absolutely will be a job killer. Amazon is trying to do away with USPS, UPS, and FedEx, that is their objective, to inhouse all of it and save delivery $$$."
