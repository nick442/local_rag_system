(I'm a bot) ***** > In Daniel Aobdia&#039;s view, the program should be revamped to better serve the most qualified foreign employees-especially those who possess special, hard-to-replicate skills-and the companies who want to hire them. > The H-1B visa program, first introduced in 1990, was meant to allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers with desirable skills, to fill the gaps in the labor market and help boost the economy. > Whatever reforms the government makes to its H-1B visa program-an auction feature, a points-based system, or some combination of the two-Aobdia says the goal should be to create a situation in which American companies feel encouraged to hire the best and brightest, no matter what their country of origin may be. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6jhs7u/companies_want_to_hire_the_best_employees_can/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~152513 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **company**^#1 **visa**^#2 **work**^#3 **Aobdia**^#4 **system**^#5"
