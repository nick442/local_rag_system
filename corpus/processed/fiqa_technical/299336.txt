"This article reads like a puff piece for unions. With that, it makes one fatal assumption - that unions are good. It also provides cherry-picked ""proof"" to support the positions and spouts of numbers that make no sense - ""the largest 300 co-ops together constitute the ninth largest economy."" What a meaningless, non-supporting comment to end with."
