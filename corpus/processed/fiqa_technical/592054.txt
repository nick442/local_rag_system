As an actuary (health, not pensions), this is what we do. We spend years(5+) taking exams and learning about the best and proper ways to predict liabilities, probabilities, and other statistics that we use to forecast cost and return in the future. I am in health, not pensions, but I would check out [Actuarial Outpost](http://www.actuarialoutpost.com/actuarial_discussion_forum/forumdisplay.php?f=15) and /r/actuary. The subreddit tends to be a younger (see student) crowd but there may be someone who can better answer your question.
