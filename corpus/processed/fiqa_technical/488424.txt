Yes, I'm still kind of puzzled as to how they just seemed to have the world's money supply just given to them to dole out as they pleased. I owe a Rothschild, though. They actually had one, a Lord, on noon TV here. He was in town from England for a Toronto tea convention and gave a 5 minute lesson on the news on how to make the perfect cup of tea. The key point was to keep the interior of the POT clean. Worked, the tea was, and still is, great, thanks Lord Rothschild!
