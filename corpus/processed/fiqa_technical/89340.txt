"Ah, two things! First, there isn't a small state with capitalism. Capitalism requires LOTS of support from a state. For example, there needs to be a functioning judicial system to settle disputes and to enforce all sorts of laws that benefit capitalism. There also needs to be large investments in infrastructure, including infrastructure that would be impossible for a private entity to build and run. Also, capitalism has this thing called ""business cycles."" We have had two now in the past 80 years that required MASSIVE state intervention in order to save capitalism itself. You say you are in favor of democracy, but that doesn't extend to the enterprise? Wouldn't democracy also include workers being able to own and vote how a company is run. How is it democratic for the person with the most shares (and thus the most money) to have the most votes. Even in our political ""democracy"" capital has a giant corrupting influence. One only has to look at our current government to see that influence."
