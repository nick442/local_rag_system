This is dangerous as it is a typical a scam. Trudy convinces Bob to help her avoid an ATM free or some other pretense. She writes Bob a check for $100, but is willing to take only $80 to return the favor. Bob agrees. Bob deposits the check, gives Trudy the $80 and then later finds out the check is bad. In most cases Bob will not be able to find or contact Trudy. However, in some rare cases if Trudy feels Bob is very gullible, she will do the same thing again and again as long as Bob allows. Sometimes the amounts will increase to surprisingly high levels.
