"sure.i agree with all of that i'm sure theories exist and are valid, but what about utility - maybe there is value in tracking where money comes from, but right now all i see bunch of people shining shit and calling it gold and suckers are buying into it, maybe in the future it will result real innovation that adds value to people's lives more than just anonymity More importantly, I don't like how you answered this question, I expected pointers on how there is value for society in cryptocyrrency or me in it's current form; not propaganda about bitcoin Edit: added ""or me"" into 2nd paragraph and last paragraph; and blockchains/underlying tech is not the issue"
