"Of course people can change careers to something else and irregardless of their previous training. Everybody grow in their career to something else. But to be a CHIEF Information Security Officer, the Chief, you need to be an expert and knowledgeable person in your area. I very much doubt that somebody who showed interest in Music, studied Music for 7 years and failed in that area is ""material"" to be a Chief Information Security Officer even after 10 years of working in that area. (Susan failed in her Music career, otherwise she will not try something else like computer security). But with my doubts, yes there are few cases of somebody with one background and studies becoming a real expert and leader in a totally different area. It's rare!!! For lower level jobs, yes, a music major may become a descent programmer or project manager. I doubt they will become experts and best in the field. Let's concentrate on this particular case: Susan had no talent, and I gave you some quotes of what she said. The FACT is she is responsible for the biggest breach of personal data in the history of the world. Her becoming a CISO for Equifax is mostly due to her knowing someone or someone knowing her. And even if it's not the case, it's mostly due to her being like typical many clueless managers: expertise in political backstabbing of anyone in your way, being very ""social"" with the right people, etc. Do you want me to give a list of top managers and CEOs that destroyed successful and big companies. Trust me, in most cases, they did not have the qualification of even the studies to run a company or do their jobs."
