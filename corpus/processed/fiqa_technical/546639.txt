I mean the risk free rate on 100 year notes averages out to like 4.9%. The UST extrapolated to a 100 year note would be around 5.5%. 7.9% isn't a good risk premium for a country that just did a horrible job on the 95bn default - the whole country looked and behaved cluelessly in the proceedings. Argentina should try to sell as many of these as they possibly can, it's way too good of a deal for a country that handles default proceedings as if they don't owe anyone anything. I hate the way they act, it's like they expect everyone to bend over to their absolutely incompetence in running the country into the ground. The default rate has to be under 100 for them to make any sales so these are more like activist investor bait.
