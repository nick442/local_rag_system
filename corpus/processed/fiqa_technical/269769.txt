Hello All, I have a question regarding Stop-Loss Orders. So Bechtle AG announced it would be gifting bonus shares to existing [shareholders](http://www.nasdaq.com/article/bechtle-to-issue-bonus-shares-share-capital-to-double--quick-facts-20170714-00084) , in mid July. Everyone owning a Bechtle stock got a free stock, effectively owning 2. This brought down the stock from roundabout 120 to about 60 . I was wondering, if I would have had a stop-loss order on a Bechtle stock, would this [50%](https://www.google.com/finance?q=ETR:BC8) drop have triggered my stop-loss order?
