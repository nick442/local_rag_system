"> Ok, would ""a form supply -side economics"" make you feel better about the term? No, because this has nothing to do with supply side economics either. I understand that you don't like supply side economics, and that you don't like non-competes, and that you are morally outraged by both and want to equate them, but they are simply not relevant to each other unless you want to define supply side economics as ""any policy that benefits business"". Although in this case it doesn't even really benefit business. It benefits some businesses over other businesses."
