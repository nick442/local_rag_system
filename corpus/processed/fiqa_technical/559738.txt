"I've been saying for awhile now, social media is dead. You can't make money from social media. Why anyone thought you could make money from social media is a bizarre mystery. There are only two revenue models in existence currently, subscriptions, and why would anyone pay for service when there's a thousand free sites, and advertising. Advertising on the internet is dead, that means social media as a for-profit industry is dead. And good riddance. Social media is _stupid_. If you want to blog, make a blog. OWN your blog. People can still ""follow"" it using this amazing technology known as RSS which has been around for a really long time. Facebook and Twitter are both doomed. Neither one makes a dime from their core product, which is micro-blogging. Facebook only makes money because they're an umbrella company that owns a lot of other products. Twitter doesn't make money and is going to vanish in the coming years. I hope this is a lesson to everyone. The internet is not a magical ATM machine, just because you don't know how it works. You still need to create value to create wealth."
