>Someone remind WalMart this is not 2007 when they were the baddest, biggest company in the country But..they are.. Their revenue is over quadruple that of amazons, and in 2015 amazon had profits of 596 million, while Walmart had 14.6 *billion*. So yes, I'd say that Amazon is somewhat of a decent competitor, but Wal-Mart is still *very far* ahead of amazon in all metrics (including having a higher profit margin!) which means - more leverage against amazon.
