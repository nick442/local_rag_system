Not generally in my experience. It is no more difficult than giving up all the extras us Americans feel like we are entitled to. Just giving some of that shit up, internet, computers, cable/satellite/cellphones, can save an average person hundreds a month. Don't take long to get to 5k doing THAT. They choose to be unable to afford it, not that they aren't *actually capable of it* - there are outliers of course but not as many as the average of the bell curve.
