They hold most of time rental value for example if you rent car for 5 days and decline insurance offered at counter - they will ideally hold 5days x rental value per day + insurance x 5 days most of them round of this figure. if the card is issued from overseas like asia they hold extra $ 500 for collection issues. hope this helps you to plan - this is general thumb rule.
