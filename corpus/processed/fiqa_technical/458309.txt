I don't think Nokia is in *that* bad a position. They're poised for a comeback with Windows Phone 8. If Nokia really gets in trouble, Microsoft is likely to prop them up or buy them outright so that the investment in WP8 isn't sunk. MSFT have indicated willingness to enter the non gaming or peripheral hardware market with the new Surface after HP failed to deliver on Slates. Mobile Phones are just a logical next step. (They've partnered with Orange in France already - so are counting on Nokia to see that through) It's not the handset market that's in trouble, it's the mobile provider market that is in trouble - people are moving to prepaid/PAYG and not upgrading every 2-3 years, this flows on to the handset market but doesn't signify trouble per se. The smartphone market is a three way race, Microsoft (Nokia), Apple (Apple) and Google (Samsung + HTC, who aren't out of the game just yet in my opinion) HTC have awesome low end phones and are a serious contender against 'dumb' phones when you include markets with low or no operator subsidies. There's also emerging markets/developing countries where smartphones aren't even a consideration - there is a sizable overlooked market for dirt cheap phones that can just call and text, people who can't even get to power to charge their mobiles more than once a week. They're not as profitable, but if nobody else is servicing those markets there is plenty to be made simply in volume. It might not be profitable for 10, 20 companies to service those markets. But one or two could do it and ignore smartphones completely. Although Vodafone already produces its own through Chinese suppliers, so it might be a market consumed by vertical integration instead.
