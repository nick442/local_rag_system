Sure QNX is a good embedded operating system, but it's hardly the lack of a bulletproof real-time OS that's causing RIM problems right now. They were already known for making pretty reliable phones for basic telephony and messaging. Their problem is that the Blackberry OS interface and third-party application support is shit. QNX doesn't help them with that; in fact, it puts them even further behind.
