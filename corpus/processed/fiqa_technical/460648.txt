But there's a difference freelancing for your craft and managing people to so similar tasks. Sometimes you just want the flexibility of working for yourself and you enjoy mastering the craft. Not everyone's end game is more money. If marketing and sales are not your strengths, yet you still have a steady stream of future clients, or can pick some up when you need to..why over complicate things? When I first started out many moons ago, there was a contract programmer working at one of my first jobs. He worked 6-9 months a year, and then traveled and relaxed the rest. The summer I met him he was going to complete visiting every National Park in the US; sounds like a nice goal to me :)
