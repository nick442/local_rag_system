They have no standard of conduct, their review process is opaque and they are hostile to employers who ask for content to be reviewed. Unless you threaten to sue they take no action against slander or libel. We have had an unhappy employee flood the site with reviews using multiple fake emails, accuse an employee of a crime, etc and they did nothing but encourage us to buy their services. We used to advertise jobs on their site - never again. They are just as bad as Yelp.
