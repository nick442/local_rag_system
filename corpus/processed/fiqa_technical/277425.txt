"This is a pretty shit article I didn't know people got business advice from Slate.com's business blog. Jesus. Everyone in the industry knows that AMC is sour about this because they are trying to do their own thing. They tried it before with Moveipass and probably weren't happy with the split, and now they're not happy because this is undercutting what they were planing. They don't actually have a real reason to be upset about this and are going to have a tough time getting out of it. The article also doesn't mention Regal and Cinemark which are both excited about Moviepass and (I have heard) have expressed willingness to potentially share incremental concession revenue. These guys make 90 cents on the dollar on concessions, so I don't think they give a shit who is lining their customers up as long as they're there. Also if you don't see the obvious acquisition strategy here then you should probably stick to whatever it is that Slate.com regularly covers...looks like today's headline is ""Who Won the Eclipse on the Internet""."
