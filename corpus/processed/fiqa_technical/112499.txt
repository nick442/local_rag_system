Let Go App..good way to find awesome deals on furniture. Depending on climate find a nice bike, pretty easy way to get around & low maintenance costs compared to a car ( i.e. insurance, gas, repairs). Then depending on whether your work offers matching 401k programs, max that out or find a good index fund & consistently build that emergency fund. Chill for 10-15 years & enjoy the benefits of compounding interest my friend.
