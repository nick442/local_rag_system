Yeah, pretty much. Most hotels will have a long-term rate that's much cheaper if you're staying weeks, or months at a time - however it's not something that they highly publicize because otherwise normal hotel guests can feel that they're being overcharged. The weekly rate usually applies to bookings longer than three weeks, and the monthly rate for those more than three months. The place I stayed at also had 6 monthly and 12 monthly rates which were even less again - and I knew some people who had been living there for 2-3 years. Although I guess it depends on your budget, when you compare the rates of corporate/short-stay accommodation you can sometimes get a better deal from a hotel if you just call and negotiate something. There was an article I read about this a few years back on some dude who started doing this because it worked out cheaper than keeping a permanent place in London and a place in NY - but I can't for the life of me find it now!
