really don't worry about getting a serious financial internship after your freshman year, no offense but you don't really know enough to help a serious firm in a serious role. If possible try to find something close to home with any place related to the business world for any amount of hours. Any business experience is enough to apply for a financial internship your sophomore summer as it will just prove you are smart enough to work for a company and not fuck up. Take this time to do some of your own research looking at specific fields you are interested in. I've had friends have success in the past where early on they just called around and networked through some friends, and shadowed like 5 different financial jobs for a day or two that summer. Really gives you an idea on what the day to day tasks are for different positions, something you can't get in a classroom. Lastly don't stress about any of this stuff too much. No company is going to throw out your application because you had 2 years of finance internships instead of 3 or if your gpa isn't perfect. if you focus on learning these next few years about something you're interested in, you'll be not just good but great at what you do and you'll be successful.
