"I mean, I guess you could technically call it that, but that's pretty stretching it I would say, considering we're in the comments section for the article. Under such a definition, calling someone else out on ""moving the goal posts"" with the intention to return to the original goal posts is itself ""moving the goal posts"", which just gets a little silly, plenty pedantic. And in the end, misses the point, which is to have a discussion about the article."
