In March [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721634-how-it-shaping-up-data-giving-rise-new-economy) did a feature on data and had an interesting take on antitrust rules. As with other laws, including tax, the statute is woefully behind the market. I think the implications of big data require the concept monopolies to be rethought. As companies can gather data across the multitude of platforms you're ok with, they are able to better understand consumers. The threat is if everyone uses google maps or waze (owned by google), Google could create a monopoly on traffic/driving/human habits data. An analog to this is thinking about insurance. Large insurance companies can rely on huge amounts of data to model out their risk/reward on policies. This will allow them to make better decisions and price themselves better in the market than smaller competitors without this data. Some governments require large insurance companies to share data with smaller ones as a form of antitrust rules. I agree that sheer size isn't an issue. However, I think more thought has to be put on the monopoly of data.
