They are the largest non government employer in the country. They have an absolutely massive consumer base. They made that profit while constantly lowering prices for their customers. I bet you use them on a regular basis. It is kind of funny watching your faux indignation. Isn't Apple your product provider of choice? One of the most expensive over priced producers currently on the market. With one of the lowest paid work forces on the planet. But well paid for their market. You just ooze hypocrite. Like most Apple social warriors. Its funny listening to people like you speak for others you would never be caught mingling with.
