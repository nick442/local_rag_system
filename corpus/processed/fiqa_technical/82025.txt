"First, one would 'not' want to be the guarantor as it would likely appear as a debt on their credit. In some cases this can be good, but not always. I'd suggest a homeowners meeting. A reverse auction where you say ""Would anyone like to get the condo fee waived for 12 months in return for guaranteeing the loan?"" If no hands go up, you have an issue. But if even one hand goes up, you have the guarantor. Then you ask if there are any objections. Anyone who objects is welcome to bid fewer, say 10 months. Ideally, you see a dozen hands go up, and you just count down until one one remains. When I lived in a condo the fee was $250. If I were one of the older residents who planned to stay, I'd do it for one or two month's fees."
