Disgusting. But its obviously not news. This is what, I would reckon, 95% of China’s wealthiest (above 1mil USD) are all about: Chronic nepotism, corruption, in short favoritism which is not based on merit. It truly makes me sick to read some of those stories simply because it disadvantages EVERYONE else, not just the few who were in direct competition with those, favored. This is unfortunately the very big and ugly side of Chinese culture, its only a question of time before the next revolution will ring at the door, only to repeat the same cycle all over…
