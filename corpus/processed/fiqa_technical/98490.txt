"You can be a great CEO without knowing anything about technology. However, right now, there are a lot of businesses going through Schumpeter level creative destruction due to technology. In those contexts, you *need* the technological expertise *as well as* the leadership. You wouldn't seriously suggest ""a CEO doesn't need to know anything about finance, because that's what their CFO is for"". In this context, technology is just as vital. The strength of the team will definitely fill in for missing skill sets. If what it was just about understanding how technology works or even understanding statistics, I think you can totally rely on the team to fill that in. However, CEO's do need to understand their business. In this context, it is a need thing, not a want thing. If the business weren't transforming in some massive fashion, they could lean on understanding the past of the business and use it to extrapolate about the present & the future. That isn't the case here. Certainly, I wouldn't expect the CEO to match their CTO for technical understanding/skills (if you can't lead people who are more competent then you, you've got no business with the job). It's about the understanding of the business."
