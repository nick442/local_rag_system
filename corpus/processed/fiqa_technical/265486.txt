"was in the same flurry.. wasn't that before AWS? I thought AWS was effectively a result of an AMZN overload (black friday or something) and bezos saying ""buy enough servers so this never happens again"", then realizing that they're sitting on mostly idle servers and saying ""fuck it, let's just resell the unused CPU as cloud computing"". in that case, it'd take some sort of firesale of tickets away from some cataclysmic event causing 99% of the country to be using their servers at once. And even then the AWS auto-scaling would add more servers and resolve the delays fairly quickly. no, I don't expect to see amazon.com hitting any performance load issues any time in the foreseeable future."
