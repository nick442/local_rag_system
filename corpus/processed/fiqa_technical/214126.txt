"Based on your information.. The house is $130,000 all in (this might not be the case) Your payment term is 30 years. Your interest rate is about 7.35%. Your payments are about $895.66 Your total payments will total $322,438.95 That's not a very good interest rate for a mortgage, but this might be due to poor credit or limited credit history, too low income, or too much home value being financed (or a combination of the above and other factors). Northern Alabama may not specifically be higher interest rate: it might, honestly, just be you. The reason that you're paying $320,000 is that you're taking $130,000 from a bank and promising to pay it back with interest. Keep in mind, that's over *thirty years.* That's a LONG time. And the bank needs to earn enough interest to combat inflation (roughly 2% annually, generally). During that time, the bank *can't* invest that money elsewhere, return it to depositors, etc. A good rule to keep in mind is the ""rule of 72."" It's a simple trick to determine, based on an interest rate, how quickly the value of something will double (in this case, the value of your loan payments). If your interest rate was exactly 7.2%, this method would calculate 10 years until doubling. In your case, 72 / 7.35 = 9.7959 years. Now, you're paying off your loan simultaneously, which lowers your interest over time, so your payments total 2.48x of loan value at origination. That still sucks, but remember, it's over a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time."
