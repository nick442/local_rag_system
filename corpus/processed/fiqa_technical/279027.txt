"Reich is trying to highlight the disparity between the market price of a person's labor and the real social value of that labor. But while the former concept has a standard definition in modern economics, the latter does not, and Reich does not offer one. That is why I found the article dissatisfying. It's clear he is lamenting the disparity, but he gives no clue about what the disparity actually amounts to. Case in point: > Does anyone seriously believe hedge-fund mogul Steven A. Cohen is worth the $2.3 billion he raked in last year, despite being slapped with a $1.8 billion fine after his firm pleaded guilty to insider trading? I would wager that whoever paid Cohen the money believes it pretty seriously. By rhetorically asking whether *anyone* so believes, Reich assumes away the existence of whoever pays Cohen. His tone throughout the rest of the article is similar. Yet this is precisely where Reich could have stepped in with a definition of social value, e.g.: > Stephen A. Cohen raked in $2.3 billion last year, despite being slapped with an $1.8-billion fine because of insider trading by his firm. Yet the social value of his work is far lower than $2.3 billion. Here's what I mean by ""social value"" and a way to approximate it.. Here is something Reich does say later on that is probably true and worth emphasizing: > Most financiers, corporate lawyers, lobbyists, and management consultants are competing with other financiers, lawyers, lobbyists, and management consultants in zero-sum games that take money out of one set of pockets and put it into another. Of course, this is also true of many government officials, athletes, and social activists. But the concept of a socially wasteful zero-sum game--and its implications for welfare--ought to be much more widely understood by the general public. Reich should be praised for calling attention to some examples of it, but it would have been much better if he had dwelt on it a little more instead of just ranting."
