haha, what now? They are constrained by Panasonic. If Panasonic can give them more batteries, they can make more cars. Their NUMMI plant is 370 acres and most of it is currently sitting empty. I suspect that they worked in some language with their new battery factory deal with Panasonic that also included Panasonic getting off their ass and making more batteries right now.
