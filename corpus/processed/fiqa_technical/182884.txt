Correct, kept orange demand in a microcosm to simplify. In the example, ~1 or 2 people would have been highly paid to build the machine, and the house would have created temp jobs for 2 or 3, or the money would have flowed to another tree owner and put into a bigger house. Point is the new inflow of money hasnt cycled through the economy fast enough to have an effect on consumptive demand. New money has a slower velocity with net effect on inflating asset prices up.
