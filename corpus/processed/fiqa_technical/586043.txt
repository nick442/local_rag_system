If they are making that flight all the time they are probably using airline miles to get the free upgrade. Government employees earn airline miles like the rest of us, but they are not allowed to use those miles for anything other than upgrades for themselves. They cannot use the miles for anything personal. As long as it does not cost the government anything, they can use their miles to upgrade. Since many flights are billed at a higher flexible fair and then discounted, the airline miles really rack up because they are generally based on the class of fare, not the cost of the ticket. (some formula of miles x f which is a percentage based on the type of ticket. Flexible, refundable fares are a higher class of fare even though the airline then chops 40% off for the gov discount)
