"Steve VanWieren, VP of DATA ""it bothered me how much access just about any employee had to the personally identifiable attributes. I would see printed credit files sitting near shredders, and I would hear people speaking about specific cases, speaking aloud consumerâ€™s personally identifiable information."" TL;DR - Pretty much a majority of employees were LAZY, talked to each other about the files, made fun of the scores, printed them out, and did not give shit."
