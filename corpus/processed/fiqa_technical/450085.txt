I teach just north of the border in Ontario. It is incredibly hard to get a teaching job here (close to any urban centres anyway). If you are lucky, it's 3-4 years of supplying and part-time before you get your own full-time gig. Applications to get on the supply lists far outstrip the availability of positions. This is entirely because teachers are well paid here.
