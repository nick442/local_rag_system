> what an awfully-written, rambling article. Why is this always the top voted kind of comment whenever a blog post is submitted on Reddit? The entire point of blogging was to get viewpoints outside of professional journalism. When that happens, when non-pro-writers write with no pro-editor, then (surprise) you get at-best a second draft. If you want to only read polished, editor-reviewed works, then stick to the mainstream media. Furthermore, your counter-point about trying to get the best contract doesn't really contradict what the blogger was writing about: being sold a false dream. Reddit loves negative and dismissive comments though so enjoy your karma.
