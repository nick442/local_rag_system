Not limiting.. I just would not excel at that. I learn socializing a lot slower than others, I like being honest and straight forward above manipulating people with psychology. Heck, I'd say I'm on the spectrum. It goes against what I am to be managing people. It goes against what I believe. It is a shame the world thinks such paths are superior.
