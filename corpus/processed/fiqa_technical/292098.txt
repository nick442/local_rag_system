KUCHING: While China Mobile Ltd (China Mobile) has been reported to have held talks to buy circa 20 per cent stake in Axiata Group Bhd (Axiata) at an undiclosed price, analysts say this deal is unlikely to happen. According to the research arm of Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd (Kenanga Research), the stake would be valued at more than RM11.9 billion based on Wednesdayâ€™s closing price of RM6.95. No agreement was reached as Axiata and its largest shareholder Khazanah Nasional Bhd (Khazanah) were unwilling to sell that much equity stake and also considered the indicated offer price as too low.
