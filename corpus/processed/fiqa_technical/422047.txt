I do have an agenda. Or at least a question: Is the apparrel industry in the US dying? Is it being sent overseas thanks to 'free trade'/globalization laws? >A recent study released by IBISWorld identifies ten dying US industries. Among these top industries is apparel manufacturing. http://blog.zintro.com/2011/04/12/is-the-apparel-manufacturing-industry-in-the-us-dying/ I am against globalization. It puts all the eggs in one basket. We are seeing again and again when one country has a crisis it threatens to engulf, first, all of Europe, then the US, then the world. This is the price of globalization, which mainly profits the very wealthy. Aside from my objection to who profits, I think it's stupid to..put all our eggs in one basket. Let different countries do things differently, then evaluate which works best for the greatest number of people. Don't just make every country to everything the same, the neoliberal/neoconservative policy.
