"I think it's a good idea but you can't just say ""we're interviewing some of the biggest crowdfunding successes"" and not really have any proof that you have some big names to interview. Maybe you should think up your own questions, get the first interview out of the way to prove you can get the big names, post it to reddit and then get people involved for the second interview."
