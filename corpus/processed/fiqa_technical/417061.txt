Agreed - I noticed some of the materials seemed legit, but like you said, all of the good stuff is other people's work. I listened to the CD speeches from the founder and I was just completely turned off by much of what he said. I will most likely try and turn folks off if anyone ever asks me about it in the future. Thanks again!
