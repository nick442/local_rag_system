"That is such a rediculous argument. If your ideas and beliefs were as ideologically superior as you claim, you should *want* to have people argue with you. Shutting down the free speech of your opponents does not do anything positive for propelling intellectual debate. Anti American behavior is burning the flag, something we only see by those who oppose Trump. Anti American is wanting the federal government to control and distribute everything in favor of a real capitalist financial economy that has little to no government intervention. If a business fails, another one is always there to take its place. Anti Americans dont mind allowing the politicians from across the sea to interfere and play such a huge role in how we perform politically. That is *very* anti American. Lifting useless regulations of off small business creation and profitability is American behavior. Building factories and having companies work and relocate to to the USA is better for the economy, and for the planet. The factories here have to be much more air friendly than a factory in China or India. Win win. There are many instances not listed here bc im on mobile that are very anti American, and it only comes from those against Trump. So thats why some people get the nickname ""fake American""."
