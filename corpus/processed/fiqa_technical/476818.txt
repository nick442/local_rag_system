This. People say on Reddit pretty often 'Oh, you should buy a new fridge to save your electric bill'. Meanwhile, old fridges are built like tanks. You will never make up the cost of electricity when you factor in longevity and cost to purchase a new fridge, and I'm sure the manufacturing process and pollution from making a new fridge is worse then continuing to use a functioning one. The same holds true for other appliances as well.
