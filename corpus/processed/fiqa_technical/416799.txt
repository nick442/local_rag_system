Yes but you must agree that driving a horse and driving a car are two different skills. People learned those skills. Did every single horse person become a car driver? No. But people learned those skills for a new paradigm. Now there are zero horses on the road. The same could be said for fast food and factory workers. We are talking about jobs on the same level - entry level and not even really what you could call a career.
