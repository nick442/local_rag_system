How is this not criminal? How is it possible that all the chief executive faces is a lost bonus? You see poor people going to jail for stealing a trivial sum of money, yet these guys have done something hugely fraudulent on an international scale and are able to keep their jobs and their freedom. How can this ever be fair or just?
