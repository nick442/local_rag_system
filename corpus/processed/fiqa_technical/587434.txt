"They can't work forever, despite some of these folks ideas to the contrary. Eventually their health will make it prohibitive to positively contribute to the work environment and companies won't want to deal with these higher risk employees. The saying ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks"" plays out a lot more than I'd like each week. Something as simple as e-mail or Excel turns into a fiasco because these folks don't know how to use it effectively (or at all) yet refuse to allow people to take the time to teach them (I've offered many times). It's more efficient to get people up to speed ONCE than it is to have your office phone ringing off the hook because you're the guy who knows how to use a PC at an elementary school level and thus become the defacto help desk technician. It cuts into my productivity considerably when I'm asked to do this stuff for people. That's why we have an IT department, not that my IT department is particularly savvy."
