This isn't including revenue for SP3, it's probably including operating expenses for production of SP3, and Microsoft also overproduced SP1. It's not a terrible loss and probably looks worse than it is. Xbox division lost far more too, but it's a necessary cost to break into new markets and work towards their vision. I'm not a fanboy by any means, but I think Microsoft have hit the money with the *idea* of the Surface Pro, and Apple are going to be playing catch up, which is going to look dire. Especially if iWatch is their upcoming innovation.
