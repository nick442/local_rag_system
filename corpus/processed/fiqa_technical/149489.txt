They don’t grind down profits because they don’t want to pay taxes. They have no need to turn a profit because the premium people are willing to pay to amazon for their stock is so high that their cost of capital is essentially negative. In amazon’s world, any retained profits reflect a lack of investment in growth or willingness to take risk, and because their capital is so cheap, this essentially means that turning a profit is a lack of investment in growth. You could make an argument that tax law has not kept pace with the reality of the technological revolution, but to argue amazon’s primary driving motive is to avoid taxes is just silly.
