I like Bernie. But when people say Bernie is crazy/stupid they mean his solutions aren't good. For example, raising minimum wage to 15$ an hour will increase unemployment by the millions and cause automation to grow faster, causing even more longterm unemployment. Hell, even basic income is a better idea. But he's right, there's a lot of income inequality and we should think of better solutions.
