"I appreciate the time and thought you put into your comment. I, however, disagree with much of what you said. I don't think you understand the ""anti-business"" mentality at all. In fact calling it antibusiness to me sounds just horribly slanted. The wrongs that are commited by the business community should not be dismissed because they are ""hard to track"". Even if the statement is true, it doesn't matter. There is no excuse and frankly statements like that sound extremely apologetic. With that said, I agree with you 100% that a lot of the discourse on this subreddit is not conducive to discussion/learning. I certainly don't want to discourage you from posting. The frustration the ""business community"" feels by being misunderstood is certainly shared by the other side. If you would like to hear my thoughts on anything specific feel free to ask."
