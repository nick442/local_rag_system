It was easy to get my first job out of college, but I had pretty direct experience from working at a job during college. To give more specific detail, my first job was doing marketing on the digital side (CRM, website, analytics, etc.). I was able to apply what I learned in economics (multivariate testing) to marketing. So, while there was a little learning curve with the marketing side of things, working with CRM in the past and understanding how to apply my economics degree to marketing allowed me to get the job. Like I said, you can do anything with an econ degree.
