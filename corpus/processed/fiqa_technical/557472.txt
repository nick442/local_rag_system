I do disagree. You're representing marketing and advertising as a form of deceit (you referred to it as manipulating), I see it an example of framing. Making M&Ms colorful or making commercials about anthropomorphic candies, or putting them in front of people doesn't strip those people of the ability to walk by without buying. I also disagree that there is such a thing as the common good. That idea necessarily implies that there are innate human needs that are objectively knowable. There can be a *probable* common good, for example, the idea that doing drugs is harmful, but that isn't guaranteed to be the case. There have been plenty of bright and productive people who have used one substance or another (Steve Jobs, Michael Phelps, Sigmund Freud, and many others), but not a *certain* common good. When we start talking of forcing people or companies to behave one way or another, but cannot be certain that the course of action to be enforced is going to be beneficial to 100% of people, we have to address the ethical issue of who is responsible for any harm caused to innocent people in the process. Will the scientists who published the studies take responsibility? Or the legislators? I doubt it.
