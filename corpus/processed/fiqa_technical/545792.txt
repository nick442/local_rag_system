I agree with you. I have many liberal viewpoints but over regulation is definitely not one of them. I work for a non profit health insurance company and a lot of the Affordable Care Act is something I am truly behind. However many things within it, I believe, are going to increase costs across the board for all of us. I hate to sound like Romney and say that regulation is of course needed but too much of it truly is doing more harm than good.
