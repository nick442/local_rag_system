I started investing in Robinhood, I'm 18 and just felt like it would be a good move. Bought 2 stocks of Nextera and 1 LIT. The stock prices both grew today, but very little as expected. But should I be concerned about the day to day growth of these stock or just leave them and let them sit for a couple months. From what I hear and know you sell when you're up and buy when it's down.
