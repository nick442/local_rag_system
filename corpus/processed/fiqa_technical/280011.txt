Honestly, I'm not going to argue with some of the insane bullshit some companies pull - but if you've ever needed medication in ANY form, a pharma likely created (even for yeast infections). Frankly, thanks to these companies and decades of blockbusters - they're starting to address the real niche diseases out there (plus, how else will they make money - patents are running out). To pull a blanket statement like that is well, misinformed. The world isn't black and white. As much as you might lambaste the industry, there are a LOT of good willed people here that are seriously trying to eradicate horrible, horrible diseases.
