I believe they were for the government's future plans for transitioning into a more consumer-driven economy, preparing for their growing middle class and increased domestic demand. It could end up being a smooth transition, but they have inflated a massive real estate bubble that makes our recent one look pretty small in comparison. They claim to be able to manage the bubble as well, but it will be interesting to see. To my knowledge it would be the first successful management of a massive bubble. What's sad is that another reason for the empty cities is that the government's plan until now has been to support its export-driven economy, through devaluing the yuan (lower purchasing power for citizens) and keeping labor costs (wages) low. So the future middle-class hasn't been able to afford housing in the new cities. The government has been actively keeping their workers' standard of living artificially low for the sake of propping up exports. It's disgusting.
