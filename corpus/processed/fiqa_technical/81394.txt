"Here is where I am confused. On the income statement I am looking at it has a line item in cogs that is ""change in jobs in progress"". Change in JIP = (Starting raw materials, wip, and finished goods) - (Ending raw materials, wip, and finished goods) for the accounting period. From what I researched cost of goods manufactured is added to cogs: ""The formula for the cost of goods manufactured is the costs of: direct materials used + direct labor used + manufacturing overhead assigned = the manufacturing costs incurred in the current accounting period + beginning work-in-process inventory - ending work-in-process inventory. A manufacturer's cost of goods sold is computed by adding the finished goods inventory at the beginning of the period to the cost of goods manufactured and then subtracting the finished goods inventory at the end of the period."" So it isnt wip that is in the income statement it is change in inventory. Why do they include the ""change of inventory"" in cogs? Wont this just be material and labor that should be in for the next accounting period cog calculation?"
