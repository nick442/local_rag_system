In this case, she had claimed that remaining in Bosnia would result in persecution from Serbs because her husband had hidden in Serbia rather than join the Bosnian Serb Army; in fact, he had served in the Bosnia Serb Army. But the point here is that this was a lie made during the *immigration* process, not the *naturalization* process. During the naturalization process, she claimed that she had never given false information to a government official during immigration proceedings. Of course, this was *also* a lie, and hence a crime under 18 U. S. C. §1015. But now there’s a question: Does having lied about lying constitute procuring naturalization “contrary to law”? The Supreme Court says “not on its own.” Specifically, >[18 U. S. C. §1425(a)], most naturally read, strips a person of citizenship not when she committed any illegal act during the naturalization process, but only when that act played some role in her naturalization. > .. >When the underlying illegality alleged in a §1425(a) prosecution is a false statement to government officials, a jury must decide whether the false statement so altered the naturalization process as to have influenced an award of citizenship. Now, it’s entirely possible that the lie in this case meets that requirement. The Court’s decision, however, is based on the fact that the Jury did not make such a determination. Rather, they were instructed that *any* lie would be grounds for a guilty verdict. Hence, the Court determined that >Maslenjak was not convicted by a properly instructed jury of “procur[ing], contrary to law, [her] naturalization.”
