I think your casting most Best buy employees in a bad light. While that may be true for some of the larger stores(with equally as large employee turnover) it is most certainly not true for all stores. I work at a community store(smaller store) and I most certainly do have an interest in customers needs and wants and I enjoy helping people. Please don't cast blanket assumptions because its cool to hate best buy.
