Do NOT use the same LLC. By default he would own 1/2 of the DBA so you would have to hire an attorney to section it off. Then you have to worry about him changing his mind later and suing you if the DBA is sucessful. Not to mention the EIN controls the cash and tax flow and the DBA would be using the same EIN so it gets really murky. Don't even consider it, just create a new LLC.
