Impossible to unwind. Its a monetary roach motel. They will try to raise rates and unwind their balance sheet until there is another financial crisis, to which there will be another round of QE that dwarfs the previous rounds. Unwinding has the real possibility of triggering another financial crisis. If the bond market turns bearish after a 30 year bull market I wouldnt want to be holding dollars.
