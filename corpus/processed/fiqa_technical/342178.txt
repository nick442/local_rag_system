Hey, While CFA is a great course in terms of the curriculum, it is going to be tough for you to actually land a job since CFA doesn't conduct any centralized placements. 25-26 isn't too late to start a job - jus make sure you mention your role in the family business as work experience on your resume. An MBA may be a better option to get ur career going , but it's expensive and getting admission into a good school is ridiculously tough.
