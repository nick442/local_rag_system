Does your friend have a preference? Why does he have that preference? Is his reasoning sound or can you make better suggestions. That's all that matters in a Mac v. PC debate. I'm assuming your friend is going into an undergraduate program. In which case he most likely won't touch any finance courses until his third year and even then they won't require macros or VBAs. Companies that he interns at will provide computers (usually) and when he graduates he'll be shopping for another computer anyways.
