Part of the magic of the Traditional Pretax IRA is that money that goes in saves you your marginal rate, say 25%. It will grow tax deferred for the decades till retirement, and when withdrawn, you have the Standard Deduction, Exemptions, and lower brackets to fill. So it's withdrawn at your average retirement rate, which for a single this year, $4991 is the tax on $46250, just under 11%. (the $46250 adds the top of the 15% bracket ($36,250) the STD deduction ($6100) and Exemption ($3900)). I recommend Roth if at 15% or lower, and move to pretax for 25% money. This is the simplest approach to describe.
