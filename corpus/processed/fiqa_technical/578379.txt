I understand why you say that but I assume that there is another financial shake out in the next 5 years. As they are not profitable and do not have a plan to get to profitability. I think they will die. You can not bleed money forever. They can not IPO (escape??) do to the stolen IP problems. The moment they expose their finances and management problems to external their valuation will be closer to $10 Billion not $60 Billion. A real valuation might be $1 Billion. They will disappear as fast as they arrived. Uber will be as famous as Pets.com or Webvan.
