That's a nice thought. But I doubt it would happen. I sell on EBay and I was on the phone every day for a month over some scammers and ne'er do wells. They didn't do anything special to help me. Lost a lot of money. Just think of the millions of cases like that every day. They're better off having a blanket rule, even if it screws over the seller.
