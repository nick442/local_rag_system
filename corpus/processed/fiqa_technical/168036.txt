In 2011, General Re (owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet's company) reported over $28 billion in investments and cash, over $20B in underwriting reserves. That's one reinsurer. They'll sell investments, and hand out cash, and somehow that cash will end up in investments again. In a country with $15T GDP, it's not like the cash just isn't there. Also, given the financial high cost to human cost ratio (billions in damage, few lives lost) they may play hardball on claims.
