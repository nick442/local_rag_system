I agree with you. But I think you are missing my point. It is the affect on other CEOs and how they respond to fixing their own security messes. Because they will want to avoid a nearly 1/3 drop in their stock price. I actually work in the security related industry and at a company were security was actually something we sell. We were breeched a few months back. It was in the news world wide How we were breeched was well known and even brought up as a risk for several years by the engineers including myself. It was ignored because it e didn't deliver immediate observable benefit or differentiation to the customer. But once it happened oh boy. Affecting the CEO's pocket book directly is the best way that these security holes get addressed.
