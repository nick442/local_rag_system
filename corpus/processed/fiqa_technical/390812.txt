Revel tried to scale-back on the casino focus. They initially barely talked about it and tried to play up the resort aspect of it, and it failed. They then scrambled to advertise it as a casino and it just didn't work. No one wants to go to Atlantic City because it's a dump. Anything off the boardwalk or the outlets and you're in the ghetto - the casinos were the only thing AC had going for it.
