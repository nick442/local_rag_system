> Isn't the whole point of a private flight that you don't have strangers on it? I've never flown private buy have been invited to a few times. The biggest appeal for me would be avoiding all of the bullshit that comes with flying commercial. Gross and uncomfortable seats, annoying delays, getting felt up by the TSA, having to get to the airport two hours early at times due to significant lines at security. If I could avoid all that crap and just had to deal with a couple I didn't know also on the jet, sign me up.
