"Would my (new) landlord even be aware of the fact that I'm his guarantor? Does that show up on a credit report or would there be another indication of it somewhere? It may come up during background checks, and it may not come up. You're expected to disclose material information on the rental application, and withholding it may lead to voiding the rental contract and eviction. But the problem is slightly different. Can you afford paying two rents? By being the guarantor you take the responsibility of paying the rent ""in the case if.."". You need to treat it as a real liability that you will be expected to pay. With all the respect to your brother, if something unexpected happens - you will be on the hook. You have to account for that."
