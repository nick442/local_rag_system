"For starters like some other people have said, just talk to someone in IB and get some advice on how to break in, and what it's really like. I've spoken to people in IB and learned that it's really just not going to be for me..In response to your four questions, 1. Get your degree at DePaul and wait a few years to get your masters. You don't need an MBA for IB and it'll be a lot harder to go to a prestigious grad school without significant work experience and a solid network 1. It definitely wouldn't hurt for you to double major in CS, but if you do, you're going to have to keep your grades up, and still stay sharp in both majors. You don't want to have a 3.0 and have both, it'll kill your chances. You're going to need at LEAST a 3.8, if you're under that it's gonna be a lot harder to get anywhere. 1. If there are other industries you want to turn to then sure! I used to be interested in IB but now I'm leaning more towards private equity, and working with Reg D. clients, 1031 exchanges etc. 1. NETWORK!! If you aren't already, seriously get out there and network like hell. But don't just cold call random people, you really need to make meaningful connections with people, and continue to stay in contact with them. You can also learn a lot from WSO and various IB books, guides etc, I have a bunch of that stuff on my google drive from a friend if you want it. And some general tidbits **Don't stress about the school you go to**..going to a prestigious school really does help, but if you work hard enough, make the right connections and are good at what you do, you can land a role in IB. I know several people that have gone into IB from my school and I would consider us maybe a Grade C state school. It's possible I'd also recommend looking more at a boutique and middle-mark companies rather than your Bulge Bracket banks, it'll have less competition and could be easier to break into, and like some other people are said you really need to get that junior year internship if you want to make it into IB. But if you can't get into IB right after school don't fret, go somewhere, get some experience, get your certifications (Series 7, Series 63 etc) and try again. **Know your technicals** you need to be able to walk through a DCF, an LBO and all of the financial statements in an interview. There are billions of guides on how to do this, but you need to know this. **Stay on top of current events** Just be well versed in how the market is doing, which industries are hot right now and what's not, and WHY! **Know your story** Believe it or not, but your story and how that aligns with a companies culture is really important. I have a friend that didn't make it into a certain firm solely because they just didn't think he was a good enough fit for their culture. ""I want to make a lot of money"" won't work, instead think more along the lines of ""I want to challenge myself"" Good luck man"
