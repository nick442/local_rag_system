I typically only purchase $10-$20 for each of our phones yearly as we do not use them very much. The first year, I purchased $100 for each, but after that, any amount will continue service for a year and you keep/roll over any unused minutes. Can't beat $$20-$60 per year for two phones..I just wish their coverage was much better in rural areas. I wish Verizon offered the same deal as their coverage is superior in Ohio.
