"> Well if you weren't such an entitled prick, you'd know that it just flat out isn't as simple for some as ""find a better job"" or ""make more money"" or ""improve your lot in life"" as you have suggested here many different ways. Yes, true. Life is harder for some than it is for others. Welcome to life? >There are countless reasons why that just simply is not possible, and hence why there is, in fact, a need to require a living wage, no matter how hard you cover your ears and scream ""LALALALA"". If you weren't so self important, maybe you'd see that. How does acknowledging the facts of life make me a self important, entitle, prick? You know absolutely nothing about me. How I grew up. What I do now. Nothing. You're just mad because someone told you you are responsible for your own life and that just sounds too difficult for you. The fact that you think a minimum wage will solve the poor problem tells me you know *literally* nothing about economics."
