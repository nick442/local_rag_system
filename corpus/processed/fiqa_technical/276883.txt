Personally, I have been in that situation too often that now I am selling at the first tick down! (not exactly but you get the idea.) I have learned over the years to not fall in love with any stock, and this is a very hard thing to do. Limit your losses and take profit when you are satisfied with them. Nothing prevents you from buying back in this stock but why buying when it is going down? Just my 2 cents.
