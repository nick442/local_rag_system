The article doesn’t show Obama targeting big cable specifically (at least in the parts that I can read, as the rest requires an account). Secondly, I have been personally involved in this expansion of high speed to schools, which I know from vast personal experience need the speed badly. Some have had only 1.5Mb/s to feed a school of 100 students. Now the main internet companies out in our rural areas are getting competition because of these subsidies, by providers who are wliking to do the work to get high speed internet to these more remote location. I happen to be on the front lines of this situation, actually. What this is doing for the schools is rather amazing and sorely needed. What it has done for competition in my area at least was also sorely needed. So . . . I’m not really seeing the same issue from This particular subsidy.
