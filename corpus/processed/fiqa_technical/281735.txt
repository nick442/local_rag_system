There is empirical data to suggest deregulation in healthcare would drive down prices. https://thinkprogress.org/how-one-oklahoma-hospital-is-driving-down-the-cost-of-health-care-by-thousands-of-dollars-f507cdf32111. In a free market where prices are transparent, prices go down. As to your pharmaceutical example, that is a form of protectionism regulation. The reason why epipen is able to charge that price is because they have a patent protection (protectionism) that lasts through 2025. https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/09/epipen-lack-of-innovation/. There is no substitute. If there were a reform in pharma laws that made pharmaceutical company have to share their patents for licensing costs (similar to how cellular providers must provide access to their networks for a fee) then the price would go down. Market forces do reign supreme. It is supply and demand. As simple as that. If there is a market with a lot of profit, in a free market, participants will enter the market until the profit drops down to zero. That is why you cannot charge 10 dollars for a big mac in the same city where a McDonalds 1 mile away charges 5 dollars.
