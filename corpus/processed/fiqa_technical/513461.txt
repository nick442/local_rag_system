"> If you're going to build an AI, you won't make it very far without a definition for intelligence or what it is to think (this turns out to be hard.) But turns out, we don't exactly know what intelligence exactly is, or what a thought is physically like (an electrochemical signal shooting somewhere in the brain? ). That's why the best we can do right now attempting to recreate the results, instead of actually ""emulating"" intelligence or how the brain works."
