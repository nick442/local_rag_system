I'd bet good money that you're right on the button there. I can foresee a cottage industry for local part replacements easily cropping up in places with a strong DIY-nerd presence. If parts in some certain area break with enough frequency, you'll get customers chomping at the bit to pay what it would have cost to buy and ship, if they can instead get the replacement part printed in a couple hours. Screw waiting for the auto parts store to ship from their warehouse 5 hours away, when I can just get that distributor cap printed, to spec, *with customizations*, in half that time. This is so much of a game changer that you won't even know critical mass has hit until it does. At the same time, I can also see some company trying to make an example of local print-a-part shops to protect dwindling part-supplier profits by calling in the fuzz to bust printing joints with narcotics-style closure raids, subpoenas, middle-of-the-night warrants, and that sort of thing. I don't think that stage will last long because customer backlash will be deadly, but it's well known that the last stage of a dying business model involves denial and desperate legal thrashing-about.
