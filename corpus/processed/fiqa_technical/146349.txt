"At least a snake oil seller would admit to being a snake oil salesman eventually. You're right - they're everywhere. These people (99% are women) are so earnest, totally humourless and indignant. I'm disabled so they buzz around me like flies. Collectively they are so annoying, so misguided but, unlike the snakeoil guys, these people believe it all. ""Wellness"" gurus, I-can-cure-cancer-eating-salad f-wits and, my personal favourite, the people who blame me for getting (and keeping) my condition that started when I was 12. It's all my fault. Sanctimonious hippy arseholes - I know where they should shove their crystals."
