Ok, now Disney wants to endorse silly fanfics.. Damn it, I feel a little sick after reading this. I do hope it's trolling and I'm too dumb to see it On the business side of things, I do think overusing characters can be harmful. I know sales are great NOW, but these franchises need to have some time to rest and mature for a few years after such a great exposure. I get that intertextuality is Hollywood's new currency, but this has to be tied up carefully, like in the first Avengers movie, otherwise we get a rushed mess like BvS.
