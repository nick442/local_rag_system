No need to apologize. I'm wrong many times too. Africans are incredibly entrepreneurial. They have to be. With zero government safety net, they don't have a choice. But corruption is so endemic and engrained in their culture, progress is not just stifled, it's impossible. The trillions thrown Africa's way over the past decades has not trickled down. It's a bit like the bank bailouts in the west. The ordinary person hasn't benefited at all.
