You will be best to cancel the original instruction first, as you will have to wait for any pending payments to be received, as the banks will not entertain multiple refunds. After this can be confirmed the account will simply show a credit which you ask for. Many lenders/banks process these type of transactions after a period of time ie 30 days and there will be no way to speed this up, so the sooner you act the better. When you contact the bank have bank details for the payment(they might transfer externally fingers crossed), or you may receive a cheque in the post. Try to avoid complicating the matter with changes of address and ringing before you have cancelled the instruction etc if possible.
