Now this is a really interesting one, so a Canadian guy who's ex brother in law was in Guantanamo, gets married again and decides to take his pregnant wife on a Back packing trip to Afghanistan and gets kidnapped by the Taliban, who allow him and his wife to have 2 more children in captivity, because they don't know how white people fuck, all the while US intelligence is tracking them, but doing nothing till they cross the Pakistani border where they inform the Pakistani Army to free the hostages but do nothing all the while they traveled through Afghanistan, and the family is rescued, after a fire ight but refuses to board an American aircraft in fear of being arrested and Donald Liddle' Wick thinks he is being respected more. Fucking Moron is an understatement
