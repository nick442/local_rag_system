I did this about 8 years ago with a buddy in Chicago for the reasons specified in the original post. As other posters have suggested, we discussed a lot of the same questions listed above, figured out the possible scenarios, and then had a lawyer draw up a contract. We bought a 3 bedroom house, and rented out the 3rd bedroom. Overall, it was a great experience. We both built equity while having a renter pay a third of the mortgage. Plus the property tax and interest on the loan were tax deductible. Compared with renting an apartment, it made us a lot more money. In the end, we sold the house, and split the profits. Assuming you have the personalities to make it work, I say go for it.
