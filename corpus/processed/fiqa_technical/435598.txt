I'm quite aware. Nevertheless, the situation I'm describing is a little different. It's the transition phase from order to chaos. Currently, there are lots of well-off kids in universities around the country who don't have bodyguards on them 24/7. That's because there is an assumption of general security. If things were to go downhill suddenly, there would be a severe lack of qualified people willing to dive into a population center to escort some kid out safely. Time would also be of essence. Desire for safety of one's children, when paired with a severe real or perceived threat, would thus make these types of services spike rapidly, if for a short period of time. It's not dissimilar to what happens with fuel prices when a hurricane cuts of supply. And, of course, perhaps I would start a company which would cater to the expanding group of people who wanted private security over the long haul. Opportunity abounds! The point is that, if one is a resilient, flexible, and capable person, then the macro-scale doesn't matter all that much. I prosper now, in this serene and stable environment; I will prosper in a world where labor is overtaken by automation; I would prosper even more in situation where society goes to shit. There is no situation, short of absolute apocalypse or immediate failing health, in which I would not adapt and prosper.
