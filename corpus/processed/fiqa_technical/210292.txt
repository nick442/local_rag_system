To get the company to change their behavior for future people? To help foster an environment in which companies in general won't behave like this? Presumably also to compensate the guy for not getting the job when he should have been qualified to get it had they not acted illegally? From another direction.. what's the point of making something illegal is there is no enforcement? Why would anyone sue a company for not hiring black people if they that was just going to lead to a hostile work environment? Because it is meant to change things, not perfectly resolve that one particular incident.
