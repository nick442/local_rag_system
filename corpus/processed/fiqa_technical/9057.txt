u just dont understand how money works. u think u do, but u dont. u dont even understand the problem. the govt printed over 7 trillion, where is the hyperinflation? explain to me what caused the inflation from 2001 to 2007 up until the bubble collapse and financial collapse of 2008. and don't say fed 'money printing' coz it ain't true. don't say fractional reserve multiplier effect, coz that ain't true either. see u don't even know. if u keep arguing with me ur gonna get embarassed. if u ask nicely, maybe i'll tell u.
