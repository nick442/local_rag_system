"Not only is this a marketing gimmick masquerading as an article, but the principle survey question it cites appears to be pretty stupid (I say ""appears to be"", rather than ""is"", because nowhere can I find the actual wording of the question). Compare the following questions: ""What would make you happier, a better boss, or a pay raise?"" ""What would make you happier, exchanging your current boss for the best boss you've ever had, or a 50% increase in pay?"" In the first case---the question apparently asked in the actual survey---the responder is left to interpret the relative sizes of the proposed improvements to their job. There's no reason to believe they're considering changes of commensurate size, and in fact there may be systematic bias toward a more significant envisioned improvement in their boss. Frankly, I would expect this bias, since a person's attitude toward their boss is often colored by the dictator-subject nature of their relationship. Let's be honest, we are predisposed to dislike people who have authority over us. When survey respondents are envisioning a ""better"" boss, they may very well be thinking about a boss who doesn't exercise that authority. But that's not a very realistic alternative, since such a boss would not be effective from the company's standpoint. In the second question, the respondent has more concrete alternatives to consider. Their alternative boss is at least now confined by realism: this alternative boss had to have at least existed. Furthermore, the pay rise is well-specified. Finally, any survey question on this matter suffers from the cheap-talk nature of surveys. If actually faced with this choice in the real world, would people put their money where their mouth is? I would hazard to guess that, as long as the pay increase was of a reasonable size, more than a few people who indicated ""better boss"" would ultimately take ""pay raise"" given the actual choice."
