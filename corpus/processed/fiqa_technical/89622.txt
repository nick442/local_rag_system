There's some really questionable advice in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. The one that I always thought was bad advice was when he wrote that people should always pay themselves first and worry about paying down debts later. So if you've got big credit card debts, you should first allocate money to saving and investing and pay your debts later. He says that will inspire you to come up with creative ways to get income to pay off that extra debt because you're under pressure. I don't buy it though. It's something that sounds good, but if you apply it, you end up broke quickly.
