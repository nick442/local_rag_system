Itâ€™s a great concept. You skip the whole margin disaster in retail. Clothing etc. is mostly at a 200-300% and more margin because of risk nobody buys it after a while so hey can go down with the price for discounts. If you yourself sell it to the customer those 200-300% are now your profit. I only would run my own stores. The profit difference make it totally worth it setting up a store and hiring 20 people.
