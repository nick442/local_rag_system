JP Morgan didn't need a bailout, but was forced to take it. It used those funds to buy out two other large banks, and Jamie Dimon helped save the US economy. He basically took on the role of the original JP Morgan. JP Morgan was the least complicit of the large banks, and had very little exposure to the bad mortgages that led to the crash, nor did they profit off of shorting it like Goldman did.
