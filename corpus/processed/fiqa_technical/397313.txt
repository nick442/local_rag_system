As a dutch guy having lived in Canada for some time, and went down the the states a lot; I was extremely surprised how outdated your banking technology is. A lot of mutations require me to physically visit a bank (often my specific branch), and I couldn't believe it when I saw that people still use cheques. Before I moved, I just remembered them from my very early childhood. Get your shit together North America :)
