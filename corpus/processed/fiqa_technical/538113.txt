"Former WFM team member here (about a decade, and still have a lot of store management staff as friends). WFM has always wanted to be the ""tech company"" of grocery stores, but their implementation strategy has been absolutely worthless, haphazard, and piecemeal due to their method of expansion in in the 90s and early 2000s, where they would buy up regional organic grocery chains across the nation and pretty much just integrate them into the company as a separate entity. Imagine WFM as really 7 different companies that have almost ZERO in common with each other, from policies to product selection to buyers to computer systems. So they've never been able to get the IT part of their business to be effective, even though they've desperately wanted to, because every region has had different IT that wasn't entirely compatible with the others. On top of that, they tried to upgrade the current systems to a perpetual inventory system. That did not work. You can't just modify current systems to be fundamentally different from what their original intended function was. With Amazon coming in, hopefully they can gut the system and start over fresh, using WFM's current regional distribution as a hub for expanding their own product offerings. Honestly, I think Amazon was looking at its seattle store with no employees as a prototype for what they could achieve with an actual chain. A lot of what's holding WFM back on the price of their products is that they huge distribution costs. They're relying on UNFI, which is (in my experience) not exactly ""great."" If Amazon can utilize what they do well (inventory management, shipping, technology, and business support services), I think they can decrease the cost of their products by the 20-25% target they need to hit to remain competitive in natural and organic foods. Because, right now, they're getting absolutely slagged by Kroger, Trader Joe's, Walmart, Sprouts, and so many others."
