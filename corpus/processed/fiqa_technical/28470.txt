As a counterpoint, I don't think it's totally necessary to do 300 hours per level especially if you already have a background in the material from school. I did ~100 hours of legit studying for 1 and ~175 legit hours for 2 and passed fine. Had a solid number of friends who did the same amount. Then again YMMV depending on your school, how well you did in school, your courses, and your work experience.
