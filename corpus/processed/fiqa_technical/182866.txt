"When I deposit my paycheck in CapOne I have an email before I am out of the app that they received my check. I have access to some portion of the cash now and the rest the next business day, however they put things in order to NOT overdraft me. For instance, if I am overdrawn $150 but the charge is ""pending"", putting the check in they will deposit the check before posting the charge that would overdraft me. Plus I can use Apple Pay with it. My local CUs have app deposit, but it takes DAYS for a deposit to just show up. Plus, no Apple Pay."
