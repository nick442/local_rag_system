Capitalism has become a religion and laze faire capitalism is a fundamentalist death cult within that religion. laze faire capitalism is to Capitalism as ISIS is to Islam. Wealth has become people's God. And I'm glad the Pope is challenging them. There's too much idol worship and dogma and fundamentalism when it comes to Capitalism. And people need to stop acting like regulation and redistributing wealth are blasphemous in all circumstances.ï»¿
