"> IT will never make Home Depot or Lowes profit because they don't sell IT. It is a cost center. Really? If I buy from their on-line store, who should be credited for making the sale and profit? The Sales department? The Marketing Department? Or the IT department that provided the system, web-design and artwork to make the sale? What's next? Research and Development is a cost center too? Maybe we should outsource them to cheaper researchers? How about the Buyers and procurement department? Does any sales somehow connected to their effort? **Top management wants you to believe that everyone is ""Cost Center"" except management. Ask them, and they will tell you that even the customer service and sale people on in the store are also ""cost center"".** If anything, IT and only IT reduces costs, reduce the manpower, reduce the overhead and bring more sales opportunities with the new digital frontier for sales. If you don't think so, then, fine! Hire the cheapest IT people, or, why even bother? Stop any new development in the IT department."
