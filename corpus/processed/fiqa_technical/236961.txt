There's not quite enough to answer the question in full. For the two years of non-payment, were there any penalties, or just accrued interest? If no penalties, this is a 3 step time-value-of-money calculation. First, take the terms of the loan and figure out the balance after 5 years. Second, for two years, increase the balance by the monthly interest rate. Last, calculate a new payment with a 13 year duration. Excel or any business calculator can handle this.
