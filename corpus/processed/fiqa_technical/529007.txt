You're on the hook for the nominal value of what you hold. A single ES S&P e-mini future contract is leveraged 50x, equivalent to $60,000 in stock, so it should be treated the same. The problem is that trading is done with only a fraction of the value as margin, so people can and do end up owing more than their account. Some markets are extremely illiquid and volatile as well. Similar to forex, the industry has made it easy for small traders to get in the game in an entirely overleveraged way, and the vast majority lose.
