this is true for any kind of business deal, not just book to movie deals. You might be the employee of a company and be given to generate income based on the revenue of said company. you want gross or net? Or say you're helping a small business start up and you're giving them some startup capital. NEVER sign a deal saying that you want to receive a percentage of their net income. you will never see your money again.
