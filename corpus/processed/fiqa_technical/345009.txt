"To be honest I haven't read any studies but I just left an IT group that ""attempted"" to operate this way. It did not work, not one bit. It caused a constant waste of time redoing chargeback models that never really got implemented and it created a huge rift between management trying process the hell out of everything and people like me who just wanted to come to work, do a good job, and help our coworkers."
