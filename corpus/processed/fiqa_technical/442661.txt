"On 3# - My company is constantly complaining about saving money, cutting costs. Then we have these events, and banners, and trinkets and bullshit about our new ""mission statement"" - everyone here just sees them pissing away money (millions) while bitching about money. That's a fucking drag on company morale. Then again, #8 - my job is being phased out, so it's not like I really like this place anyway."
