I think you need to study the history of industrialization. First of all, these people arent losers. They work honestly, dont commit crime. Second, minimum wage laws come out of the history of industrialization. The only reason we have any middle class whatsoever is because of the labor movement. Ill allow you some time to look up, as an example, coal miners strikes, or *The Jungle* by Upton Sinclaire. Second, please take an econ course above 201. Regulation, yes, brings more business if it is correcting a market failure. A market failure is when the private market does not produce maximum social benefit. When MPB !=MSB that is a market failure. Pb being private benefit. Then entire field of economics is dedicated to discovering proper methods to correct market failures, since most industries have at least some failures, in the most efficient way possible to where MPB=MSB. Yes, regulation can bring benefit to the economy. One great and obvious example is the regulation of lemons. Without regulation, there would be no restriction against selling disfunctional products. With widespread sale of dysfunctional products, the economy would suffer as users demand lower prices even for perfectly good products, because they cannot know whether it is a lemon. This is just one example of a regulation against business benefiting the economy. Once you have done educated yourself, Im happy to continue this discussion on a rational footing.
