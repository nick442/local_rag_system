"Actually sounds like an interesting concept for a business, potentially! (grin) You know, depending on where you live and how big the market is, you might see if there's a local ""concierge"" service. These are companies that will act like personal shoppers/assistants for you in all kinds of ways. I can't speak to the quality of their services or the pricing they use, but it would be a great place to start. I'm sure you can find listings of them on the web."
