I find this pretty sketchy, personally. From their investor opportunities page: > Wall Street, Social Medias and Real-estate investments aren’t working for many investors. Stocks in the beleaguered social media sector keep heading down. Shares of FaceBook, Angie’s List and Groupon, etc. have plunged as investors continue their retreat from the formerly red-hot sector. In this present day economy investors are looking for the next early stage Apple. LifeSaver is the answer. Reads as way too much of a sales pitch to invest. Also, I don't think there is actually any way to invest in the company outlined on that page. I'm not saying this isn't a good idea for a product, I just would expect a medical device company to have a somewhat more professional website/investor relations page, and i'm slightly surprised to see you post this, especially with this title.
