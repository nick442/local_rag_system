I agree that it was poorly implemented, but putting a deeper divide between their DVD business and their streaming business with the idea that the DVD business could be sold or killed when appropriate off was good. It was poorly handled, yes - bad branding and *too much* divide between the products when even as separate businesses they should still be capable of *talking* to each other.
