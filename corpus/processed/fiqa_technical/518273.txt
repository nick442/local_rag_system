"If you dig deeper and look at the original study, what's being measured is ""retirement-plan participation"": specifically, money in 401(k) plans and IRAs. This omits every other possible source of retirement money: things such as general savings, non-retirement investments, property ownership, pensions, etc. As an extreme example, I know someone who's retired with property worth a million dollars, another million dollars in stock, a pension providing thousands of dollars a month plus health insurance, and not one penny of what the study would consider ""retirement savings"". Yes, the average American family is under-prepared for retirement. But it's nowhere near as bad as the article makes it sound."
