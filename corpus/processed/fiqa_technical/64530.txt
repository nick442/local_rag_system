Show me the data. If you’re going to make a claim. Back up your assertion. How the fuck do you know that the Chinese are clamoring to come here more now with Trump. Trump is a racist and the whole world knows it. That impacts people perceptions of America. That impacts their decision to come here. As far as I’m concerned the jury is still out on China, because we don’t have any data. But we have data for India and many other countries. I showed you the data for India. Indians have a worse view of the U.S. under Trump. Along with Koreans and Japanese as well as most Europeans (Russians being the notable exception). You trumptards are ruining America. Congratulations you wanted a white America that means fewer brilliant minorities coming here. That’s what you assholes voted for.
