>Ebola doesn't discriminate by social status. I'm not so sure about that. Were a member of my family to die from Ebola, I am going to pay someone to prepare the body and then bury them. In poor West African communities, Ebola has traditionally been spread by people handling and burying Ebola victims themselves, without the proper preventative methods that would be found in any embalmers lab. So while Ebola doesn't discriminate, your likelihood of contracting it is definitely related to your social status.
