"Soo.. I guess you are out of arguments? FWIW, I would like to see the cost of medical services become so cheap that people don't need ""health care"". I know Universal health care proponents hearts are in the right place, but the data is showing me a different story. I know I am a minority here and we will probably end up with universal health care, and that it won't work and we will see a bubble just like sub prime when they tried to provide greater access to housing, just like college tuition where we tried greater access to education. A lot of people will be hurt when this market crashes and I don't want that. Maybe then we will learn that market forces and competition aren't evil? Or maybe It will just be blamed on rich people again. 'Till then I guess I'll just be your token heartless bad guy. But Really I am not. Good luck."
