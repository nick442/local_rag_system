Sooo the ones that knew how fucked up the system was but had essentially no say in the matter are the ones that Amazon are taking down here. Seems that in no way is big pharma taking any damage here whatsoever. Perhaps if Amazon then gets into production of these pharmaceuticals and decides to lower the wholesale price then big pharma would be in trouble, but neither of these things are likely.
