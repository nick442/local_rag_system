I flew almost 80 times last year. Unless you're flying Spirit or one of those other garbage airlines, it's not nearly as bad as you make it out to be. Yes, there will be flights where the person in the middle is taking up some of your seat. Fly with Virgin, Delta or American and it's not that bad. Not to mention there are plenty of Economy Plus seats on airlines now that provide extra room but also aren't 2x-3x the cost like First Class is.
