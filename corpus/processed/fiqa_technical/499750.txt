Not asking for any societal benefits. Just to pay for the services I need and want and not a penny more. If you can't offer a service I want I reserve the right to shop around without leaving my home. Just asking to pay the exact same price as everyone else without the special pricing for some. I already opted out of most of the services your claiming I use by leaving the cities where those things are offered. But you keep arguing to steal from me for things I don't want and that can be provided by other providers.
