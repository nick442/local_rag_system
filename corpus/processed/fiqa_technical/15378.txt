> Well, you still have to pay to ship & store paper, ink, binding materials, and book-binding printers & parts. Sure, but now you're storing and shipping raw materials able to be used in any of the books they print, so you need much less of the raw material to be able to handle the demand of all your printed books. You don't have to estimate so closely exactly how much of each specific book you need, or worry about ordering too many or not ordering enough. You just need to order 50 gallons of ink, 100 reams of paper, and so on, and if you miscalculate you don't need a shipment from back east or overseas or the distributor's warehouse 200 miles away to resupply you, you just walk across the parking lot to Staples and buy some more paper and ink.
