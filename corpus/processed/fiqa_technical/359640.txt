">""retail investors did not sufficiently research and think about the company, invested poorly"" A million times this. I wish I had sufficient funds to open a brokerage account at FB's IPO. I wanted to shortsell the stock with every fiber of my being once I saw that imaginary $38 price valuation. Facebook, IMO, has minimal growth prospects and is tapering off in popularity. Within 3 years I figure they'll be on the downswing, with the only new users being companies who foolishly use it as their website for a movie or product launch. (and 8 year olds)."
