Conversions are done on a pro-rata basis. If you haven't yet paid tax on the money, you need to do so in the process of converting. Let's say you have a total of $50k in your account: If you decide to convert half of this to a Roth ($25k), you'd owe tax on $20k of that, because 80% of your holdings in the traditional IRA have not been taxed yet. The non-deductible contributions have been taxed, so you don't need to pay tax again on that part. More information is here.
