I agree I made my example very simplistic and other more sophisticated methods can be employed. I was just trying to create simple illustration that these laws can be (and are) abused. I don't believe BK laws were originally intended (the Spirit of the Law) for these mechanisms. While not illegal I do think it's unethical.
