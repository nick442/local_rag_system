Maybe he's someone's kid, maybe he isn't. But Kraft-Heinz is a 3G company and anyone who understands their philosophy and methodology wouldn't be surprised by this. 3G is all about meritocracy. They don't care how long you've been at the company or how old you are - they'll work you to death and people that deliver the best results get rewarded handsomely, no matter their age. It's not unlikely that this guy is one of those people. 3G companies (e.g. Kraft-Heinz, RBI: Tim Hortons/Burger King, ABInBev) have at least a handful of VPs in their 20s, it's not just this guy. From my LinkedIn stalking and exposure to 3G companies, they also promote people (who I assume are high performers) very quickly, and will often take their incumbent talent and move them to new regions with big responsibility post-M&A (e.g. they'll take an HR Manager from Brazil and move them to Canada with Director or C-level responsibilities). EDIT - here's a couple examples: [This guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardookamoto/) was a Manager for Kraft-Heinz in Brazil, then made CFO for Mexico [This guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-szlak-659b2319/) graduated from a 4-year bachelor's in 2010. He was made CFO for Latin America in 2015, so he was actually a younger (27?) CFO, though probably with less responsibility, than David Knopf.
