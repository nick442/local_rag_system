It depends on what you're trying to measure, PPP is a far more accurate measurement of a nation's industrial and military power. If you want to measure the might of a country's financial industry then nominal GDP is more accurate. China doesn't pay its soldiers or scientists in nominal currency, it doesn't pay for its tanks, ships, roads, bridges, high speed rail etc in nominal currency, it pays for it in local currency. This is why the CIA uses PPP to measure a nation's real industrial power.
