"I don't know. Chinese purchasing power has been steadily advancing. I think that it's a ""total cost of goods"" thing. The total cost to manufacture, package, ship, warehouse, pay import/export taxes, etc.. all of that must be at a tipping point such that US is now the cheaper option. Just because we can spend more wouldn't by itself force the relocation of a factory, the input costs would have to be reduced to make the economics work. It's the exact opposite wage-driven circumstance that resulted in factories being off-shored in the first place. To repatriate manufacturing jobs, the only thing that would have changed in any dramatic way would be the direct manufacturing wages."
