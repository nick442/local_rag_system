"In 2007, Samsung was accused, and their chairman implicated, in a bribery scandal involving US officials. They placed their lawyers in front of it as scapegoats. But you go ahead and keep saying that bribery and dishonesty pay, and i'll just never do business with you. In 2007, former Samsung chief lawyer Kim Yong Chul claimed that he was involved in bribing and fabricating evidence on behalf of the group's chairman Lee Kun-hee and the company. Kim said that Samsung lawyers trained executives to serve as scapegoats in a ""fabricated scenario"" to protect Lee, even though those executives were not involved. Kim also told the media that he was ""sidelined"" by Samsung after he refused to pay a $3.3 million bribe to the U.S. Federal District Court judge presiding over a case where two of their executives were found guilty on charges related to memory chip price fixing. Kim revealed that the company had raised a large amount of secret funds through bank accounts illegally opened under the names of up to 1,000 Samsung executivesâ€”under his own name, four accounts were opened to manage 5 billion won."
