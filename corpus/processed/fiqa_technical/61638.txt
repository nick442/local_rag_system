Patent Attorney here. Unfortunately obtaining a patent can be a long and expensive process. With that being said, you will have to do your research to see if this will be profitable or not. I've seen too many people spend a lot of money to obtain a patten and never follow through with selling their idea because of the costs involved. I wish I could tell you more, but I don't have enough information about what you hope to achieve. Feel free to PM if you would like to discuss further.
