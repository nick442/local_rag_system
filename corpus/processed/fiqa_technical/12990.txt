Middle class taxes are about as low as they have ever been. They are certaily much lower than most of the industrialized world. >So proportionally the middle classes end up paying the most tax and gets the least for it. No, the rich pay the largest percentage of the tax dollars and they pay more per dollar earned than the middle class. You can check this easily from IRS tax statistics. A person paying a million in taxes a year doesn't use the roads 50 times as much as someone paying 20,000 a year either, and most other services scale similarly. So I'd say the middle class actually gets more use out of their tax dollars than the rich.
