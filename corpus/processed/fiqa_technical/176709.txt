I'm not sure what Tim Cook being gay has to do with anything and considering the fact that he hosted a fundraiser for Paul Ryan it's kind of a moot point to make. While he may not be a fan of all of President Trump's policies he is openly willing to work with the organization. Zuckerberg, on the other hand, has personally and through his organization actively work against the president. He also skipped an earlier tech meeting at the beginning of the year sending, if I remember correctly, an executive assistant instead. So again, no surprise that he skipped this one as well.
