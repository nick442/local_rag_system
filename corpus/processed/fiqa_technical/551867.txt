This is why I didn't bother to read the article. My neighbor is a robbery detective and he says that they are almost all for drug habits. To get drugs they can either steal from a dealer or get cash from a bank then buy drugs. The dealers are armed, the banks aren't. That's the thought process. He says it is sad how easy they are to catch. Review the bank footage, get their plates then drive to their house and arrest them.
