Yes, it was. Just in my group of friends, we have had about a 50% job placement rate so far, and we were the overachievers in the program. On top of that, I grew up in a home with technology. I was on dos when I was 2. There were some people who studied for hours, but couldn't understand subnetting to save their life, let alone routing protocols. Their brain just didn't work that way. I mean, don't get me wrong, I worked my butt off and I'm proud of it, but I am super lucky that I was able to land a job 2 weeks after graduation. And if anyone understands luck, it's a god of chaos.
