"Amway is the quintessential multi-level marketing business. It's the legal equivalent of a pyramid scheme. Basically, you put up a bunch of your own cash (or a little, depending on the current market) and then essentially become a sales force of one for selling their crap. The kick comes in when you realize that there is little money in selling amway products but instead in setting up and recruiting people to do it for you. That's the crux of multi level marketing, you constantly foist the sales work onto other folks and move higher up the ""pyramid."" Plenty of other companies like Mary Kay, doterra, thirty-one, pampered chef, etc. do this crap."
