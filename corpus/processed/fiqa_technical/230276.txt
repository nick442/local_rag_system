"Capitalism is supposed to be tolerable because, it is claimed, that, overall, it helps most people. Many people would question if that is true but that's the justification. But Romney's activities helped, maybe a few dozen or a few hundred wealthy people and hurt everyone else. So there is no justification for his ""business"". It is like slavery made the lives of a few people nice and the lives of everyone else, slave and nonslave, much worse."
