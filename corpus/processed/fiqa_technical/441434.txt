The main point of the article from my perspective was that Uber should have fought the laws, rather than blatantly ignore them and operate illegally.. and it's too late for them to do that. That's why the author mentioned how the Uber CEO initial attack on Lyft was a claim that *they* were operating illegally. Although I think the author is wrong for claiming all the 'tech' was coming to the taxi industry anyway (yeah, right). I think the primary conclusion is that Uber's competitive advantage was mainly operating illegally.
