"they seem to do this with or without an eclipse. their customer service manager told me that it's up to each location to decide which if any online reservations they want to honor. it ""hurts"" doing business with Hertz in my experience. I would like them to communicate in advance if they are not going to accept a reservation so people have a chance to find something else beforehand."
