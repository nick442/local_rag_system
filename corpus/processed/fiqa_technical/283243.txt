It is really sad in the US. The government has not really set any meaningful standards to call yourself a college, and offer a degree (there is accredited, but it is a low bar). So many colleges pump out useless degrees. The poor students sucked into these institutions get a degree that is near worthless, and then move onto menial jobs they probably could have gotten without the college debt. High end institution degrees are still enormous value. But lower end colleges are not worth the money. Far better paths to follow.
