Lawyers etc are upper middle class yes, but in general you are going for teachers, the higher degree nursing, non super specialist it workers, hr workers, middle management, etc. There is a point that we severely underpay K12 teachers. But the jobs you listed are working class. It used to be in the past that working class job could provide enough money for middle class existence eg car manufacturing union jobs. But that ended up being unsustainable, the companies uncompetitive and TBH the populace uneducated.
