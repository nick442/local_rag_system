Interesting, I wholeheartedly disagree but have upvoted you anyway. I'd love if you expounded on that statement. Would you hate to work with him because he insisted his time was worth getting paid for? That he works to live and not the other way around. The question is laid out directly; Is your job worth $20/hr or is it worth $10-$15/hour? How much is your job worth? Not how much do you get paid, but what do you feel would be an appropriate rate of pay for the work you do?
