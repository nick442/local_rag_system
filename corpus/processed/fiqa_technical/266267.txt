nah there are some where its safe to do, but they suffer the same issues as cars. yeah its all on one track. seems so simple but you got to deal with shit like objects on the track and trying to stop. They are either way full of people or way full of goods. It sounds good to think its unions but its mostly not. its mostly humans are still needed to brake if the track is broken or something on it or w/e we can START to do the full auto trains that drive the general service tracks. But its going to be just like trucks and cars and everything else. while 99% of the time, they on a nice long straight clear track. once in a while they have to deal with the same shit as cars. something unexpected in the way.
