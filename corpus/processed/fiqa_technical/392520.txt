>We Gen Xers are losing our highest earning years of our lives while the Millenials are losing the lowest. That's not how it works. You don't just magically start making more because you're older, you make more because you have more experience. Millenials are losing more because not being able to find jobs now prevents or delays their reaching those higher earning years.
