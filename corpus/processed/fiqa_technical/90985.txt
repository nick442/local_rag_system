"I really like the author/speaker making the ""diamond"" analogy -- that there is no shortage of diamonds, you just have to be willing to pay the asking price. Seems like in addition that that (the desire for a ""bargain""), AND again as the author speaker highlighted, the fact that managers want everyone ""fully trained/experienced"" -- combines with the idiotic use/abuse of badly designed pseudo-expert applicant screening software (apparently implemented on the same ""idiot manager/HR"" model that I saw in practice a decade or more ago already) that makes them (stupidly) claim that there is no one to hire. *Which really just all comes down to BAD hiring & BAD management practices.*"
