The thing is that employment is a part of a loop, not an end in and of itself. You work to make money. You make money to spend it. Other people work to give you what you spend money on so they can get that money etc. If your problem is that there isn't enough production to meet demand then employment will rise and people will meet that demand. On the other hand if something external disrupts the cycle and you get mass unemployment for some reason that will depress demand since all those people don't have money to spend anymore. Thus there is lower demand for services since there is less money to pay for those services. This is the downward spiral of a Depression. My worry is that if we keep supplanting all the manual labor jobs (eventually including most retail in this) then who's going to be buying those services?
