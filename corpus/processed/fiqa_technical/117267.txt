There is only a catch if you swallow the hook. The hook is that the bank hopes you will use the increased credit limit to buy more stuff, and not pay what you owe before the interest-free period expires. This will allow them to charge their high interest rate on the outstanding balance. Now if you don't increase your spending, and keep paying your balance in full, nothing happens.
