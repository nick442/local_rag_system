consultant here. i've worked at some of the companies you've listed. what about finance and consulting are you interested in? unless you're in a fairly specialized group, your first 2 year will have very little to do with anything finance. you sorta just get tossed round where people need you until you find a network and find your own niche. anyways, if you want finance . . . don't do consulting. go do equity research or banking or asset management.
