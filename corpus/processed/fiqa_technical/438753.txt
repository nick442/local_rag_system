"You have to understand something, first. The selling point of ""Oh, just pass a test and get a raise"" doesn't tell the whole story. Those tests are HARD. You'll be studying your ass off everyday for MONTHS in preparation for it. My college roommate, whom I would consider to be one of the smartest people I've ever met (for what it's worth) is studying for the first actuarial exam, and he's struggling. He already took the test once, and failed. I'm not trying to discourage you from going for it. It's definitely an excellent career, and you'll be paid a LOT of money. However, it's a TON of work in order to become one, so be prepared to work your ass off for it."
