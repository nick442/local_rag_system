Make sure you have a smart phone w/ a good battery and decent internet plan. If your job is anything like ones I've had, you're going to need something to do when you're sitting around for hours at a time bored out of your mind. Go slow at first. small mistakes can have big consequences in finance, decimal over a point, formula wrong in excel by one cell, etc.
