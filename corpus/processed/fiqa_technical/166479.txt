Would a rose smell as sweet if you called it a stench blossom? Excerpt on gifts from an LBMC article: The payment must be in the nature of “something for nothing.” It is not a gift if the payment is a reward for services rendered. With regard to payments made by an individual to a service provider, it is difficult to argue that such payments constitute gifts, even when the amounts are paid at the holidays. You can pretend it's a gift, but if you got it at your place of work after performing a service for the patron, it's a tip.
