I wasn't making an argument to shutter the PO but that they are in a declining market and have to adapt. They can't meet their pension obligation and they will have to prune their urban services and curtail their most costly routes. Tax payers will not tolerate an antiquated business just for the sake of tradition or the convenience of a minority. I live on a rural route and can live with once a week mail service. I can also live with a half day post office. Let the cutting commence.
