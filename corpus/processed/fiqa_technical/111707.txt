">or just plain useless job skills. Not that commenter, but I honestly think the focus of college as jobs only has been one of the biggest downfalls. It's caused a stigma to trade schools and to not going to college. Additionally, for people who are there, the focus on STEM at all costs seems to be leaving us with people who are less able to think critically, analyze information, and write coherently. The former two, at least, are hugely problematic for an informed society. An uninformed (or wrongly informed) society can have tons of negative repercussions. See: current political climate. Also, there have been reports laying out the math that offering ""free"" college would currently be cheaper than the system of loans we have, chasing down defaulters, etc."
