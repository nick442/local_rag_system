I personally don't agree with a currency union. I'd rather follow Ireland's example when they gained independence and created the Irish Pound and peg it to Sterling, which they did for over 70 years before transitioning to the Euro. There isn't any debt to reject or default on.The UK treasury has already assured the debt market that it's 100% responsible for it. Scotland has no responsibility for taking on any debt, but might/will in response to negotiations and in return for something. Debt markets will be far more receptive of a country which has 0 government debt. We're not talking South Sudan or a tin pot south american country, we're talking about a mature northern european democratic state. I should also note, that oil is a bonus, but not a required export. With oil, Scotland has higher revenue per person than the entire UK, but if it disappeared tomorrow, we're only slightly below the UK average.
