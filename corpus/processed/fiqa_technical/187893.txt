"As the OP expressed their thought it seemed to me they were suggesting anyones (or rather anyone who is ""Rich"" however *that* is defined*) non-invested money be taxed at this high rate and that strikes me as hopelessly naive. You don't think they would leave the country or ""invest it"" in a savings account earning .05% (or most likely spread across many so it was FDIC insured)? > I bet the rich would find something to do with that idle cash overnight if it was taxed at a 75% rate or so. They were basically suggesting the US government sieze the savings of wealthy people. The question of whether the highest effective tax rate **on income** should be raised is a completely different discussion. Personally I favor a higher tax rate and some new tax brackets for the very highest earners. I don't really think it's necessarily *fair* in a progressive system to treat the rich as a ""piggy bank"" but it is what it is. They benefit the most so they are called to contribute the most. I think I'd favor some kind of Alternative Minimum Tax for rich people so they had to pay a minimum of 30ish% of their income above some sort of cap (5 million per year? 100 million per year?) and capital gains applied. This would close the Buffet loophole. My biggest reason for this though is not because I don't think they *deserve* their money. It's because bottomless coffers basically guarantee that the legislation will be written for them and by them. There is always this tension between the poor and middle class that want more services and the upper class that wants to pay less taxes. I am starting to get to the point where I think it might be better to have a smaller government (and less services) because they abuse their power (and our money) so much. ACTA, SOPA, NDAA, warrantless wiretaps, Afghanistan and Iraq wars, etc. I *do* like the idea of social safety nets but perhaps those should be more local. Anyways, sorry for the wall of text."
