Much like everyone else in 2011 I almost invested $100 in bitcoin and was almost going to go all in as I had $1000 cash on hand. Not sure if I would've sat on it as my bank account is a rollercoaster. Kinda cool that that mindest almost netted me 400,000-4,000,000 USD. Edit: I'm now in my early twenties lol would have been cool
