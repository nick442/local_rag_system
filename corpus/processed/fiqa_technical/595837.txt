One of the bigger issues facing the USPS is the fact that a couple of years ago they were forced to prepay on some of the benefits for retirees which is somewhat unprecedented. This kind of requirement, and the fact that the USPS is fighting other technologies to provide the same service. There shouldn't be any worry about privatizing or getting rid of them though since there would be too much blowback from any kind of policy trying to do so.
