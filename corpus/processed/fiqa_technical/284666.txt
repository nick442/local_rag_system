"I did read it. ""He's had some amount of privilege in his life and he's aware that's his success could be attributed to that."" By privilege I meant that he had opportunities that he describes as luck. I feel like he has some guilt over his success but I just wanted to point out that he wrote a great book and the words didn't print themselves. He's a talented guy, even at 28, and he ALSO has some great connections that made his path to success easier."
