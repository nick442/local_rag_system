Wal-Mart? How are they going to compete with this monster. Grocery shopping is also a kind of social experience that it seems humans need. I'm no fan of walyworld taking out almost every small grocery store they can. Don't know,might get interesting. Hopefully get a price war going and then the customer will benefit.
