Long term, student loan debt is a huge damper on the economy overall. When a generation is paying the equivalent of 50-100% of rent or a mortgage on debt, you can't get around it. At best, it will delay things like homeownership (which is what we're seeing), but at worst, it will be crippling for an entire generation of Americans (which we might also be seeing, but it still has to play out). I think the biggest problem with debt is how it changes your risk tolerance. Meaning, we Millennials are well-trained and well-positioned to be employees. Not inventors or entrepreneurs. As cheesy as it's sounds because of pandering politicians, small businesses are— or were— huge drivers of innovation, jobs and growth. Not the growth that only impacts the 1%, but the growth that boosts wages and creates good jobs for everyone. On one hand, it's an inefficiency, but a good inefficiency. Meaning, if you have 100 small business, they all need sales guys, accountants, payroll, stock guys, cashiers. They all use dozens and dozens of suppliers, and are more likely to use local, domestic labor. Consolidated industries and reliance more on larger businesses means those 100x accountants and sales guys are replaced by a fraction. Fewer jobs, fewer opportunities, smaller salary growth, less domestic labor used. This, to me, is the real danger in not only student loan debt, but even uncertain retirement conditions. Our money is paying debt and dumping into 401ks, not starting businesses and generating meaningful economic activity.
