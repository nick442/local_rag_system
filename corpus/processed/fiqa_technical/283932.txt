Not to mention, nobody who's any good wants to be maternity cover. Plus nobody does any work once you give them notice so you have to wait for the original person to come back, then pay the mat cover to job search for a month. Companies below a certain size get hit disproportionately hard by this because they're run with very little fat and there's nothing to pick up the slack.
