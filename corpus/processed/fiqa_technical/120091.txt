"Yeah not anymore. Also I urge anybody who has been in their career for a while to try out an inflation calculator on the internet. It can be a bit eye opening. I remember around 2002 when I was getting close to the end of school and talking to people ahead in my career. The figure ""80k"" was mentioned a lot for people who worked hard and stuck it out etc.. I was excited about that. It sounded magical and unatainable. I thought it would be cool to achieve that by my 30s. 80k is now like 112 (buying power conversion). edit : BTW in my industry/career the 75-90 range is still talked about like the 80 was back then. Though a lot of senior pros are easily 6 figures."
