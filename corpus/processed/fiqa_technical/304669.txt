> If a crook standing behind me in line seems me enter my pin Easy to prevent with a cover over your fingers. Hey! Do you mind giving your credit card to the waiter.. who takes it to the back of the restaurant.. gods knows what he does with YOUR credit card. writing down the number.. scanning it.. copying it.. I am sure the waiter has a clean background.. never ever ex-criminals get hired as waiters.. high standards for waiters.. and then the waiter give the card back to you so you can tip him? Don't forget to sign the receipt.. so the waiter also have your most recent signature. Or, do you prefer the card in your hand, while you scan it and then enter a PIN on a mobile device you hold in your hand? How much fraud with ATM cards versus credit cards? > If he sees me sign my name he's less likely to do that. We already determined that nobody even care about signatures or check them. Have you EVER have a case that your signature was questioned? No? Well, try an experiment in the next week: always sign with a totally new and made-up signature. Then, let me know if even one transaction was rejected.
