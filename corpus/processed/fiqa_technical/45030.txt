Social Media needs to die. I thank God social media was not around when I was in HS, college. We wonder why bullying is rampant? Kids are not mature enough ( many adults for that matter) to deal with the consequences social media has. For those that think your snaps disappear, its bullshit. They are stored in some computer room in Arizona.
