"I think this is a point that most tech geeks miss when they start yelling ""Luddite."" Before I even graduated, the stuff I learned in lower division was outdated. A year out, and much of what I was taught is outdated. They are trying to automate news stories now and paralegal work. I wouldn't be surprised if there are projects out there to computer generate works of art. Not only is the rate growing faster than can be kept up with, but there are few places left that can't be automated."
