My understanding is that BD is on the block b.c it isn't meeting financial targets. Masa is a big picture guy so maybe he doesnt care. I expect his new fund to snatch up a bunch more of these types of companies because he is willing to take the risk. I dont see how he actually adds anything to BD or any other company besides cash. But his strategy has not been the home run, it has been to hit the ball into orbit.
