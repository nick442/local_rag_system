> If you accept the thesis that White people are better nation builders than Black people you must accept the idea that White people and Black people are fundamentally different. And if you accept the idea that black people are statistically better sprinters than white people, does that make you racist, too? Or just somebody who has looked at an Olympic sprinting lineup in the past ten years? If we're to be consistent, shouldn't we be enacting affirmative action in the NBA until the demographics match the general population? If not, why is that behaviour acceptable, desirable and lauded in other fields? Maybe it's just a stupid word that a political special interest group have tried to turn into a weapon to use against anyone who doesn't pay sufficient homage to their agenda?
