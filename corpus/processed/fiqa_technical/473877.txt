"What other cities can offer in a tight package, Detroit can only offer if Amazonians are wiling accept major compromises and hour drives. Detroit proper is exceptionally weak on the talent Amazon needs, so you have to include the suburbs. Even then, it's nowhere near the most educated metro. So, then, you have to start saying, ""..but Ann Arbor.."" That's close to an hour away in traffic. Detroit can offer land, but there are all sorts of issues with it as locals are well aware: high taxes, high crime, remediation needed. Plus the schools are poor, so many Amazonians would end up living deep in the suburbs and driving to work, rather than walking or riding transit. The airport is another issue. It's an OK airport, but it's about as convenient as Denver's (it's not convenient). Transit, as you mentioned, is another issue. Transit in Detroit is absolutely sub par. No matter how you weigh the priorities, Detroit always ends up weaker than one or more of the alternatives. Add to that the reality that many people do not want to move to or live in Detroit.. >we'd be on par with most other metros This is what locals want to believe, but many also seem to be of the wrong opinion that Detroit will be up to the level of Seattle in a handful of years. Detroit is nowhere near competitive at this point."
