When I went to the Audi dealer to talk to them about the A4, the guy was surprised. He said that most people in the US would rather have an SUV than a sport or performance wagon. He totally got where I was coming from when I said an SUV wouldn't perform like an A4. The A4 is a wonderful machine, but it's a bit out of my price range at the moment. If the Buick turns out to be crap, I'll save for a few years and get a proper performance wagon.
