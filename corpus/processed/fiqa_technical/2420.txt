Your reasoning has completely broken down now. So if I have this straight, given that shittiness is a constant in people, your solution is to give a few people all the guns and unlimited power over everyone else? Have I got that about right? Man, never go full retard. That flies in the face of everything this country was built to be. Do us all a favor, catch a flight to Venezuala and stay there. At the very least, the private sector is policed by the government according to the rule of law. Who polices the government when the people no longer have any authority or power over it?
