"The title requires shreds of evidence to justify, first what are ""machine learning funds"", and what determines ""failure"". When I click this title, I was hoping to see a list of ""machine learning funds"", are they mutual funds, or is the author talking about private equities invested in this field? Who are they? Nothing in the paper made this clear. For most of which to fail, I was expecting some statistics to indicate at least 51% of the funds liquidated due to massive loss of AUM. Again, no information on that. The takes? Finance is hard, idiots like Marcos Lopez de Prado have no chance to master."
