"I would start with VBA for 2 reasons. - Easy to step through and see what you're doing. - Most financial data is in .xlsx or .csv format already. VBA will be your friend for a long time. Even ordinary Excel skills will be highly useful. Once you have the basics down of VBA start exploring other languages based on need. If you are constantly pushing and pulling data maybe SQL will be the next logical choice. If you are running out of options with the Excel statistical analysis packages then learn R. Web development? Javascript. Algorithmic trading? Python, C or C++. what's more, I find learning another language really helps develop your VBA skills. I never really saw the value of ""Do"" loops until I started learning Python where it is necessary."
