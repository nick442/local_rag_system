Wtf. as a small business owner's son this pisses me off where the woman injures herself and NEEDS 9 months off because of her pre-existing condition and it all comes out of the company's pocket? It is ashame she needs help from anyone but it should come from social security, not the pockets of business owners. Sucks he waited to fire her only because he had a vaca coming soon and wanted it worry free without training a new employee.
