1) Financial Analyst in a way is a big title but that is the way it is with anything to do with Finance like almost everyone is a Vice President in an investment bank. Take it slow. Consider and know that you got to swim thru the ocean and learn with every stroke and you may be coming out better than many. 2) First job is always very critical. We all have an image of that real life before starting it. It happens many times that what we imagined was very different than the realities and those cracks in the illusions may make us think that this is just the first step and the first block to give a shape to the resume to get the next better job. That is something which may prove to be suicidal at times because then we just try to learn the macros and not the micros as our objective is not to sail thru it but to use it as a sail to move to the next boat. I always feel that take the job as you are going to retire with it and learn all the details, the micros.. that really adds better value to the resume and yourself.
