"Well this is a bit of a shameless plug.. but you could always check out the TaxQueries website. The site is ""similar"" to this one but geared more towards accountants and tax preparers. Looks around for someone who seems to know what they're talking about and check their bio. If you're REALLY having a problem finding a good accountant, email me directly. I have over 700 of them connected to my Linked-In profile. ;-) Andrew Smith andrew@taxqueries.com http://www.taxqueries.com"
