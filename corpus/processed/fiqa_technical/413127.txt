You need to step back and accept the real truth that she was a TERRIBLE candidate. In my immediate family I have five brothers and sisters. Four of them voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. None of them voted for Hillary last November. Same story with so many people I know at work and in my community. They wanted to vote Democrat but not her. Anyone but her.
