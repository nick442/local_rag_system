Its much less likely for that to happen now as it was 20 or 30 years ago. See [the link I just posted](http://ideas.repec.org/p/iza/izadps/dp1938.html). The positions of Europe and the US have to some degree reversed. Looking at the bright side for wealthy people, the US is a good place for wealthy people to live because the chance of them getting poorer than their parents is substantially lower than in other countries. On the other hand, if you are poor, you have a better chance of moving to a higher income bracket in most Western European countries than you do in the US. Of course as recently as the 80s, the situation was reversed and it could easily reverse again. The statistics in the US are much better if you are an immigrant, For some reason, this income stratification doesn't seem to hold as true for immigrant families as it does for American families that have been here for several generations.
