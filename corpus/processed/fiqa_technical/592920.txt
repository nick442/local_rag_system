I was also disgusted that the Dems decided she was the chosen one, but she is not mentaly off the rails like Chump. What worried me about her is she blows with political winds and may have tried to prove herself tough by being a war hawk. I don't think she would have been nearly as dangerous and reckless, and certainly not as mean, absent and expensive as Chump.
