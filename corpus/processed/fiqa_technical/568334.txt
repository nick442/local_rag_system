I'm a SEIA member, the organization that authored this report and have been following these reports. The costs mentioned include everything required for development: Panels, inverters, BOS, labor, racking, permitting, engineering and margin. They do not include land (which is rented and paid by cashflows) or subsidies (which are used by developers, not EPCs who are quoting these prices). There are no subsidies in any of the listed items, there are however tariffs on the modules depending on their origin.
