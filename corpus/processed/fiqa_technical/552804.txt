That's an excuse. During the 50s there were plenty of women in the workforce and nothing changed. If that's the case the income should have halved but in reality it's been reduced to about 30%. More to the point companies today couldn't afford to pay people the amount they paid in the past. EDIT: Why am I being downvoted. Every I have said is 100% factual.
