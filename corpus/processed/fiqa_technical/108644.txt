> An aging population with a massive segment of the population preparing to retire and begin collecting social security for an average of 13 years each (benefits begin at 65, average life expectancy is 78). Population is growing through immigration, this is a non-issue. >Staggering levels of national debt that is only growing due to continued budget deficits. As it stands now, the national debt stands at over 100% of annual GDP, and that figure is only growing as the deficit remains huge. As long as we can make the interest payments with a little more we're fine. Truth be told it wouldn't be that hard, just re-allocate funds from other areas and increase revenue. Military being the most obvious cut, redo the entire tax system to raise revenue, which would only require political will. <Pfft.. only> Infrastructure is just a resource allocation problem. >A population grown completely accustomed to a resource-intensive, globalized lifestyle relative to that enjoyed by almost any other country on Earth. This would require a shift in culture. Not as hard as you'd think, but it would take a good long time. >And finally, the combination of the game of economic dominoes unfolding in Europe and a slowing Chinese economy. There is a way out for this, again, political will will be required.
