"I think you are giving Jamie Dimon too much credit for actually having his thoughts together before making these kind of comments. When he emphasizes ""business tax scheme"" he means low corporate taxes. His call for ""regulatory reform"" is just the usual banker B.S. that they desperately need to be able to gamble with other people's money to make bad mortgage loans and other such crap. The connection to very high *personal* taxes to pay for infrastructure would need to be explicit for me to believe Dimon was making it. Really, at least in these public-facing statements, Dimon is pretty stupid compared to what you might think a CEO of a major bank would be. Maybe Dimon is brilliant in some other way, but putting economic analysis into words is not it. If the 2008 crisis taught us nothing else, it is that there are a lot of really stupid billionaires. https://medium.com/bull-market/digital-locability-and-interocular-trauma-973397192975"
