Skinny Body Care offers a single AKA Skinny Fiber and makes many claims as to what it can do for you. - Lowers your appetite by helping you feel fuller - Increases your metabolism leading to increased fat burning - Raises your energy levels and mood (sex drive) - Flushes toxins and harmful waste from your body. I did find testimonials of Skinny Body Care successfully helping people lose weight. Most of these claims are from agents building the business. I would rather like to see unbiased results from non- rep customers. One strong point is that Skinny Body Care is affordable. Priced at $60 w/s and $90 retail (monthly cost). However, they do have major competition from similar products in this competitive market. The Skinny Body Care pay plan is somewhat unique. They have a forced matrix structure that they claim anyone can earn $1618.50 per month without personal sponsoring. Although this may appear promising, I doubt anyone will make this income just by signing up. My opinion, if you just want to make $500 to $2,000 a month this may be an ok company to join. However, due to the low commission pay structure it will take a very large downline to make walk away residual income.
