It's a similar case where you are basically choosing to forgo negotiating price on your own. In the case you describe neither you nor the business are in any way forced to accept the terms being offered to you and presumably you would not if you had certainty of a better price somewhere else. The value being added is that you now have another choice you can consider that you may not have known about and may ultimately be cheaper than each continuing a search on their own even with the lower/higher rates. If continuing to search causes you lost wages or the business lost productivity then the value is in reducing the amount of loss.
