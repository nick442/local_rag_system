Yeah, there are a lot of things that 'poof' you into existence with them. Their whole business model is that they claim to have dirt on *every* established business. And they basically do. Attempting to get a number with them is really only an issue for brand new businesses. Regardless, they will send you very misleading spam and junk mail. And a lot of it comes off to me as threats/extortion. They also listed my home phone number for one of my businesses for years. When you call for assistance, they really only care about tricking you into buying some package, and don't care about being helpful or correcting their records. I know I sound mean, but honestly their entire sales method on me was to trick me into buying something I knew I didn't want or need. With multiple salespersons there. It's really scummy.
