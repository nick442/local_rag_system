> Instead we give money to banks, tax breaks for the already wealthy, and then deregulate finance when the problem seemed to stem from deregulation and non-enforcement. What deregulation? There is no deregulation in the banking sector. The fact that the banks got bailed out with taxpayer dollar is proof that the market is far too regulated; failed banks are not allowed to fail! You cannot possibly have a *more* regulated market than that. We need to deregulate the market, therefore letting shitty banks fail.
