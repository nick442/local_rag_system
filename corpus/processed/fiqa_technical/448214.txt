(1) The value of the MBA is in the network (2) You don't know anything when you come out of an undergrad and an MBA isn't going to help you there. (3) Entry level jobs are not requiring MBAs no matter how much you think they are. Jobs that want 4-5yrs exp want MBAs, but not ones that require 1-2 years. (4) I mentor undergrads from my alma mater - each one of them has landed a financial analyst role and none of them have an MBA. (5) I view the MBA with no experience as a negative not a positive. I got my undergrad 10 years ago my MBA 4 years ago. Further, let's look at some job reqs that support my stance: (1) https://www.tesla.com/careers/job/logistics-financialanalyst-53725?source=Indeed (2) http://schwabjobs.com/ShowJob/Id/1303833/Treasury%20Analyst,%20Corporate%20Finance (3) https://jobs.lever.co/wish/1020acab-423b-44e9-a1d5-9c10515ef7a2?lever-source=Indeed (4) https://www.upstart.com/careers/114362/apply?gh_jid=114362&gh_src=ue0b8m (5) https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Ubisoft2/743999656810009-financial-analyst?codes=1-INDEED (6) https://wholefoods.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/wholefoods/job/CA-Emeryville---Northern-California-Corporate/Financial-Analyst_Req-20170705304-1?source=Indeed (7) https://chj.tbe.taleo.net/chj04/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=NATUS&cws=1&rid=7263&source=Indeed.com This literally took my 3 minutes to find 7 roles that have ZERO mention of MBA anywhere on the job req. You really don't know what you are talking about and you shouldn't be giving bad advice.
