I could see it being upper-middle class for families that make $100k a year or a little more, but not individuals. An individual making $100k a year has a lot of extra money if they don't blow it on stupid crap. That also probably depends on where you live. The Uber driver in the article lives in San Francisco. Cost of living is huge there, so I'd say that a family making $100k a year there is definitely middle class.
