Hell no. You're better off networking/job searching or even doing a part time internship. Pick up the phone and cold call homie. The CFA will never seal the deal for you unless a firm is choosing between 2 identical candidates. Plus you don't even know if it'll be relevant to your job. The CFA is something you do while you're a senior or once you get a job, not after you graduate and looking for a job.
