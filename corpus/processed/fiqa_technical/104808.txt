I have more book recco's that would be useful than you could consume in a year. The goal is to find books written by practitioners who actually did what you're after. My favorites are Made in America by Sam Walton and Pour Your Heart Into It by Howard Schultz. Happy to recommend more but don't want to dilute these two.
