"I would aim for 10% or less, because I believe 30% is where you start to get dinged on your credit score. No one will know for sure, as there are many models, but 30% is brought up by radio host Clark Howard pretty often. Close annual fee cards or one store only cards. Normally I would suggest ""leap-frogging"" your credit cards so that as you open a new one with no fees, you then close another that does have fees. However I do not think opening lines of credit with an upcoming home purchase is a good idea. It will reflect negatively that you are opening credit all over then place. I would shoot for such a low percent to make sure that the time it takes for reporting to happen will happen. Also, as you gear up to buy a house, make sure your credit report is clean looking with all of these balances and cards you are considering closing."
