To be more technical the Eurozone. UK is in the EU, but it's currency is fine. I hope you're not getting downvoted for the technicality. Greece can't print money, it makes default more likely and that's a result of the Euro. That's the core of the problem. Europe wanted a shared currency without a shared budgetary process, this was going to happen eventually.
