"Most of the new cars should come with the following in the basic model: The rest of the features will be extra and usually a part of a ""package"" (like bluetooth comes with the ""connectivity package"") that is offered when you buy the higher trim levels. For example the first trim level above basic might come with a nicer stereo with sound system, but you might have to buy the 3rd or top trim level in order to get leather seats and/or sunroof. Typically you can pay extra to get the Bluetooth with most of the trim levels, or have it installed for cheaper after you guy the vehicle. (One note if you are buying a Chevy, if you don't buy the factory Bluetooth package and want to put in an aftermarket one you have to disable the Onstar system in order to be able to run the Bluetooth though the car sound system) Automatic Transmission is typically $500-$1000 more expansive than getting a manual, although many vehicles do no offer a manual option these days."
