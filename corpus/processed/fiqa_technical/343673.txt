">The existence of outsourcing doesn't apply here. You can't outsource a walmart cashier. You haven't seen automatic checkouts yet? My closest Wal Mart has 8 of them and only one staffed lane most of the time. This shipping facility is also a very likely candidate for a ""lights-out"" automated remodel if they raise wages. You might not be able to outsource but you can sure as shit automate."
