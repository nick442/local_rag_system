I had this in the 90s, when it was called Sega Channel. It was a big cartridge that went in the Genesis and plugged into your cable. Several dozen games a month came into the thing and the switched on the first of the month. I stayed up thinking it would swap at midnight because then it would technically be the next month. I never really considered it probably didn't switch until the morning when some guy came into work and switched it. I crashed around 4 am reseting the thing ever 10 minutes or so.
