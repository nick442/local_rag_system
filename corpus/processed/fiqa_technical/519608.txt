I think that some asset classes should be better protected from arbitrage. Its not possible to prevent either greed or information asymmetry so high market volatility will continue to get worse. However, secondary transactions directly or indirectly involving assets of a protected class: * Food - agriculture futures, farm land mortgages, seed licenses, etc.. * Housing - Resales, mortgages, any mortgage derivatives * Medicine - Insurance policies, drug licenses, medical debt * Education - Debt and derivatives Should be heavily taxes to discourage destructive arbitrage. This will not hurt investment (in the capitalist sense) because such transactions are purely speculative.
