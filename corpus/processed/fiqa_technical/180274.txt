My point is that investors can assume whatever they want, it doesn't make it a fact. If I think Apple should be selling at 1,000 a share because the I assume the US government will pass a law giving them a huge tax advantage, does that mean that there is now a government subsidy in effect? Until the government explicitly states that they will not allow a systemically important bank to go the way of Lehman, there is no government subsidy.
