What does this have to do with capitalism? To me, this seems like the obvious move when the corporate tax rate is much lower in other countries. Politicians can only steal from you for so long before you start realizing you have other options. Maybe nike doesn't want to fund neverending war in the middle east? I know I don't. Yet my money is taken from me every year to fund it.
