"Funny you mentioned ""the protestors are here already,"" since they're cause is already a lost one. As you mentioned, everything will be on sale; those that already have excess income will be able to gobble up discounted assets, while those that are already in financial trouble (a la OWS protestors) will be left in the dust asset-wise, and if/when they recover the discount period will long be over. Hence, the wealth gap will continue to widen, despite the OWS movement's passionate--yet uninformed and fruitless cause. Also, I liked your ideas on guns. Arms and ammunition are--and especially will be in case of a tumultuous future period--a precious commodity in themselves and prove to be a wise investment, even if they only end up being used as a hobby only."
