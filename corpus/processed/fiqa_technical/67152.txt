Yep, I agree, and that has basically been my point in this thread. Without the Orca shows there just isn't a real point to SeaWorld. People that say they'd go there more if not for the moral quandary are full of crap - without the Orca shows, no one is going to go out of their way for SeaWorld. Just like Ringling Brothers without elephants, they're a dead idea.
