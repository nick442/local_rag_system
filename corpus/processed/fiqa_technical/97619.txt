To clarify something: FB did not inflate their share price, Morgan Stanley did. Every company on the IPO wants a billion dollars a share, but thats not possible so they take what the market will give them, FB played their cards right. MS didn't disclose that their analysts (not auditors) changed their minds. For fun stuff: read up on ETF arbitrage with HFT, this kinda stuff happens everyday on a micro scale.
