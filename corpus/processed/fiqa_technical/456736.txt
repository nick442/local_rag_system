There are tons and tons of evidences, both empirical studies and anecdotal to support this. I don't see how you can read that website you posted and come away with an indication that cancer rates are static or somehow diminishing, when the exact opposite is the case..as it says on that very same website multiple times and even in the quote you posted. I'm boggled that you've somehow found a different conclusion than the obvious one. Yes, statisitcs are wacked.. I know, I get it, but the incidence rate of cancer is definitely on the rise.
