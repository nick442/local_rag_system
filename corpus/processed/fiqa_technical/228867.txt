I am an mba and a top IT manager for many years for a medium $3B company. What they teach you in business school is many times either theoretical or not what happens in the real world. So, yes, many mangers think IT=costs with no returns. My company, who used to be only $200M 10 years ago, thinks and knows the correct thing. And we are not a software company.
