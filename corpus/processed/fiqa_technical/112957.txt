> What government is more likely to default: > A developed, relatively transparent European government with mature industries and an educated populous. Honestly sometimes I find this really weird. it would seem to me that an educated populace (like iceland?) would realize how large of a dick is being shoved up their ass and how many decades they'll need to be in slavery to pay back their enormous debts.. > Or a developing, relatively opaque SouthEast Asian government with a large amount of its populous uneducated, living in poverty. While this type of country would have elites ready to fleece the commoner, push the country into debt for their own profit, and keep the uneducated poverty-stricken peasants slaving away for the benefit of said elites, including continuing to pay down the enormous debts incurred in the process. But maybe I'm wrong and the market is right.
