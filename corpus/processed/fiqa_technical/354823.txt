Icahn also bought a substantial amount of GM in the early 2000s.. They were bankrupt just a one short recession later. (Though by that time I'm sure he had cut his losses) Icahn's fund's track record over the last few years hasn't been great either, as they've consistently underperformed the market. Point being.. Having Carl Icahn invest in your company doesn't mean it's a good company and it's well documented that your chances of getting rich by selling Herbalife are only slightly better than your chances of hitting the lotto. The FTC ruling spared Herbalife in the short term.but I think it's inevitable that they'll run out of steam at some point. Though without having a good idea of when, it's a very risky short.
