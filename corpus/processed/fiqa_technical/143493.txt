My mistake, a *reformed* audit of the fed. Right now the GAO cannot audit transactions of the Fed with foreign central banks or foreign governments, securities credit and market operations, or communication between the Fed and Board of Governors (which you linked to). The fact that the Fed refuses to tell who receives bailout money and loans at interest rates well below market rates is unacceptable. This is not a crazy right wing issue, either. Plenty on the left feel the same way, including the (arguably) most liberal American Senator Bernie Sanders who introduced the Senate version to audit the Fed bill a few years back. The fact is, the Fed deals with MASSIVE amounts of American taxpayer money (and perhaps more importantly, future American taxpayer money), so we have a right to know exactly what is going on in it. It's not the CIA where knowledge of its inner-workings could be a threat to safety, it's a financial institution that deals with monetary and financial policies.
