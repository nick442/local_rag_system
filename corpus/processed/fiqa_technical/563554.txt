Well in 2006 they tested the1999 samples for EPO. There wasn't a test in 1999 so cyclist could take it with impunity if they wanted to. Of the 20 samples that came back positive, 11,were from Armstrong. This is the point - while others were cheating , Armstrong was cheating on an industrial scale. Other riders had to look elsewhere for doctors who would help them dope. Armstrong had the team doctor to do that.
