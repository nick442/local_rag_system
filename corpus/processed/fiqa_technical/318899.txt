I don't see this as an issue with obamacare, but an issue with employers that have profits-above-all mentality. Healthcare as a means of compensation was invented back to attract talent in the 30s when salary and wage were frozen during the depression. Now employer tied healthcare has outlived its usefulness and become an impediment to people who want to find better employment but can't afford to lose medical coverage. While obamacare is no single player, i think it's a step in the right direction. not to mention that single player was a political DoA that no congressman who hopes to be reelected for another term would support. It's disheartening but healthcare form to the likes of single payer will be unsettling for many powerful, wealthy industries that would fight it with tooth and nail.
