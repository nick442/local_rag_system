Can you elaborate more on what you are referring too? No where near an economic expert, but by 'demand side subsidization' are you referring to the fed gov giving people money for their health care costs? Excluding the erroneous spending, such as a patient only willing to take a brand name pharmaceutical drug instead of a generic, that health care will be needed regardless, correct? So if taxes fit the bill, why would costs for the care received go up? Is it just because the provider knows they'll get the $$ almost no matter what if it's gov $$? Or something else besides, to put it bluntly, greed that would directly increase those costs? Serious question btw?
