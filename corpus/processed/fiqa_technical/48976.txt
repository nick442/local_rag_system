Checking accounts can't pay interest, according to the bizarre and outdated Regulation Q. Under the even more bizarre and outdated Regulation D, you can only transfer money out of savings accounts six times per 4 weeks. Your HSA account is probably set up the way it is because the bank wants to be able to tell people they'll earn interest on their savings (although I'll betcha the current rate is something like 0.000000000001%). As far as I know, there's no reason an HSA couldn't be a straight checking account. You wouldn't get interest but you would get more than 6 withdrawals per month. Or, you could do the transfers yourself from savings to checking just keep enough money in the checking part of the account so that the automatic transfer doesn't kick in.
