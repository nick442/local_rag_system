That's because our financial sector is mainly an instrument to aggregate cash rather than a way to foster innovation and growth. They already have so much cash in their control that other sectors are starving. Some worthwhile endeavors are not the ones that are going to make the greatest returns, some will not show returns for a very long time. Typically these are are undertaken by the government, but the government is being reduced to a blunt object used to secure resources and markets and to protect investments. So maybe we need a second-tier investment sector that works with longer time lines, and low immediate returns and perhaps even domestic micro-loan/grants. /ramble
