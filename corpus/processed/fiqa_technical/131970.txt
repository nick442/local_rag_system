Damn Qdoba :P Knows they just lost their only edge with queso coming out. Seriously though this has been my pet theory for a while now. Wouldn't even have to be some crazy conspiracy, maybe just some local restaurant owner whose cousin works at chipotle and had a shitty manager he hated. Hears about it happening before and figures maybe he can boost his business with a copycat crime.
