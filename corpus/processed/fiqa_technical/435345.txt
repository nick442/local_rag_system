I can see three possibilities: * The money was illegally transferred and used for operating costs when they started having trouble. * The company was playing Enron-like accounting games, and were reporting imaginary profits and gains. In that case, the money never really existed. * The money was outright stolen, and is in somebody's offshore bank accounts. Or some combination of these.
