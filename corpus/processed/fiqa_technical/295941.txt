As far as I can see, it misses the most important point (from the perspective of a private person), for most derivatives: It's marketing. There are a bunch of derivatives out there which are ONLY traded by (and actively marketed to) retail investors, no instutional investors or companies. They are complex and, in terms of the combination of risk and reward, inferior to plain-vanilla classic derivatives, which gives the bank a better margin..
