"Ah . I don't know Chicago very well, but several classmates ended up there and report that real estate + tax are expensive. Here in Philadelphia, several marginal neighborhoods are in the middle of a real estate boom (some say bubble). People are demanding new construction, but don't care where it is. 600k for a row home is pretty common in Kensington. Same old gentrification story . first the artists moved in for cheap rents, then coffee shops and then the developers. For those not aware, those parts of Kensington was ground zero for the 1980's crack/crime epidemic . only the most marginal of blue collar workers couldn't afford to leave. Sounds like Gary, Ind got themselves on the wrong side of that line. Maybe in a couple decades it will get ""rediscovered"". Kinda sad, but we do have a history of letting places fail (eg. Wild West ghost towns)."
