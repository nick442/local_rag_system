But look at how TV programmes, newspapers, radio stations make their money from advertising. Social media is a great business model in the advertising world because you have total control over which demographic sees your adverts. Even better, the people who use the social media site also make the content - for free. I do think it's a bubble and has a very fickle user base but if they get it right there is a huge amount to be earned without charging to view the content. So I don't agree that it's a bad business model as such, it's just hard to get right.
