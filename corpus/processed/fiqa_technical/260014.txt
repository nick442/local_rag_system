"There are some people that don't have the cognitive resources to move into management (or to successfully branch out into a new career field independently). That might sound harsh, and it is harsh, but that is a harsh reality. During my education I was surrounded by what society would call ""intelligent"" people. Advanced classes and so forth. It wasn't until I entered the job market that I started really interacting on a deep level with people who would not have been the kinds of people who would have been in advanced classes in grade school. I don't know how much experience you have with people that don't have great cognitive resources, but from what I have seen most of them are capable of having better-paying jobs, but they have a difficult time appraising opportunities. Let me put it this way: I've got a fat-burning pill that will help you lose the water weight; this is a debt- consolidation plan that will allow you to make your credit score higher; become a phlebotomist, the pay is great after a quick certification course; the energy market is great right now because consumers have choice - we're going to give them the best value because we are a nimble company that is locally based. Which of the above are scams? Without researching at all do you know which one is legit? How do you evaluate which ones are scams? Suppose you're working 14 hours a day. How much time will you give to that question? Suppose you don't have the internet at hime and only use it for confirming you got paid (and you might not even know how to do that)."
