The Federal Reserve is a Government Corporation. They profit off of selling currency to everyone, they literally get paid to print money. It could cost them 14 cents for a dollar. This huge profit margins is why they dont mind making the penny. Other countries got rid of small currencies bc it costs the government not a corporation.
