I can't believe anyone in their right mind would put US health care above most 3rd world healthcare. The lowest quality care I ever receive is in the US. It feels like hospitals are constantly trying to upsell me, and doctors are trying to squeeze treatment into my insurance coverage, instead of doing what is most medically appropriate. In the developing world, I can go to the best private clinic, typically full of western educated doctors, and pay cash for first class medical treatment. Then pay cash that is less than a deductible in the US.
