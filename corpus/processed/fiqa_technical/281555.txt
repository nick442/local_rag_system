I can't see Sony doing this, seeing how their last subscription based streaming model went under due to lack of support, and I don't think Microsoft would really get involved too much because they have enough as is and are slowly adding onto the backwards compatibility. But hey, Nintendo is always down for the less popular and more risky ideas.
