"There are a few things you are missing here. These appear to be penny stocks or subpenny stocks. Buying these are easy.. selling is a total different ball game. Buying commissions are low and selling commissions are outrageous. Another thing you are missing in this order is.. some trading platform may assume the ""AON"" sale. That is All Or None. There was an offer of 10k shares @ .63. The buyer only wanted 10k what was the broker to do with the other 20k? Did you inform the broker that partial sales where acceptable? You may want to contact your broker and explain this to them. The ALL OR NONE order has made plenty of investor a little unhappy, which seems to be your new learning experience for the day. Sorry, school of hard knocks is not always fun."
