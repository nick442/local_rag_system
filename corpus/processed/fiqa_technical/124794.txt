> Then at what ratio of debt to gdp There is nothing particularly special about that ratio. No point where it becomes a problem per se. Try a different version of the *same* question: at what ratio of your savings to your income.. Same concept. >will we have to pay all our interest bills with monopoly money For the government, it's *all* monopoly money and always has been. This isn't a bad thing, it's just a description of the system. The government is the monopoly issuer of the currency, spending it into existence and extinguishing it with taxation. >(assuming that bank reserves from the fed have less intrinsic psychological value than cash circulating in the private sector, and that if we start paying our interest bills with monopoly money it will drive massive speculation against the dollar) You can only win speculating against an entity that can *run out* of money. That risk doesn't apply to countries spending in their own sovereign, floating rate currency.
