Pro sports prices are too high, anyway. Going by yourself, it's easy to drop $100 or more for the ticket, parking, food, and maybe one beer. Ridiculous. You can get a high-end meal, *far* better than a hot dog, then go watch the game at a bar for half the price. You can get a better experience for much less money. No wonder ticket sales are declining. The reason baseball became America's pastime was that it was accessible to everyone. Common working people could afford to attend games regularly. If you want to attend regularly today, you better be earning over six figures.
