I wasn't thinking about flipping, just knowing when to call it quits before you get yourself in too deep. Where I live, 4/5 new businesses fail in their first year. It's important to know the risks and to know how to land on your feet if and when it happens. I've seen a lot of people lose their homes, their retirement funds, their everything..worse than that, I've seen people lose friends they've had since forever because of bad investment promises and so on. I just think it's a good idea to have a strategy in case things go sour. It's a lifeboat thing. You don't have it because you want to abandon ship whenever you please. You have it because, even if you're about to lose the ship, you want those on-board to get out with minimal loses.
