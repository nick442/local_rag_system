>They're not really that expensive I have a Whole Foods and several other health foods stores around. Most of the produce is easily more expensive than my local Sprouts. For example, one bunch of kale is $1.99/ea at Whole Foods and &0.99/ea at Sprouts. But my favorite one that I've noticed is the Navitas Naturals brand hemp seeds are regular $9.99 at Sprouts and was on sale last week for $6.49. At Whole Foods, it's $14.99. I still shop at Whole Foods for some things, but will make the extra trip to Sprouts for everything else (especially since it's right down the street from each other).
