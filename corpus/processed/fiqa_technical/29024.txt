"As with many questions here, while littleadv is correct, the real answer is ""each bank may handle this differently."" In my case, I was experimenting with my balance to see the impact of utilization, and I overpaid the current bill before the bill was issued. The prior balance was paid, but then I sent a payment to bring my account to a credit balance. Further down the statement appears the line - Your account has a credit balance. We can hold and apply this balance against future purchases and cash advances, or refund it. If you would like a check mailed to you in the amount of the credit balance, simply call us and speak to a representative. You can also see that the ""revolving credit available"" is above the line of credit, implying that someone with a $5000 credit line wanting to charge a $6000 engagement ring can send a higher payment to the account and then make that charge."
