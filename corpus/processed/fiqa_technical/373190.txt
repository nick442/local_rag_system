>You know there are things that are out of your hands right? Yes. >Like the choices your parent's made, choices others make that have impacted you, etc. Can't control everything in life and your nativity to those complexities shows that you've never met or heard of people who are themselves left without many options in their life to just up themselves and find a job that actually pays a living wage.
