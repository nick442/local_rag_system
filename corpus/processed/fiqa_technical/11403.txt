Can confirm. I work in one such office in India surrounded by IT support people, but doing investment research myself. I swear these guys are so horribly bad that I've fought with my boss to just let me get the updates etc done on my own. He hasn't agreed because he's very computer illiterate, but even he can see how crazy incompetent the IT here is.
