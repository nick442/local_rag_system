No, you can not use Schedule C for a Corporation. If you treat the business as a sole proprietorship, i.e.: not a separate legal entity and not a separate financial entity - then you can. If that's how you treat your corporation, then you can continue using Schedule C, but there's no reason whatsoever to continue being a corporation either since the corporate liability protection veil is likely to be long gone. Generally, corporations file form 1120, S-Corporations file form 1120S.
