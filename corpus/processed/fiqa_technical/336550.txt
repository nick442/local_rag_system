"I don't think this is a good model to sell cloths - very costly, slow and a lot of returns. Clothing and fashion stores could easily fight this and sell more than they do now. I say ""could"" because they should have done it many many years ago. To stuck in their old-fashioned way. I would prefer to go to a Showroom (not a store) that has huge selection on display, possibly fashion expert who can help select/suggest for me, try/touch the cloths there, and what I like will be ordered and shipped to my house exactly to my size. (the old Service Merchandise mode of selling, but for clothing and fashion)."
