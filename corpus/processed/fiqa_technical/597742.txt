Activists generally take stakes larger than 2% and have a lot of experience in influencing boards; there's also a self-fulfilling prophecy where successful activists are known to be successful and so, other investors tend to support their suggestions. Furthermore, activist investors often fail to advance their policies and give up. In any case, making shareholders happy only matters as far as preventing them from actually putting together a solid proxy challenge -- professional activist investors with solid economic arguments can make a credible threat of that whereas activists with non-economic goals present a much less credible threat. Additionally, you say the demand is so low but IMO, Trump using Twitter keeps it in the news and prevents it from sliding even further into irrelevance. I suspect the value of that one account is greater than their whole marketing budget. Think not just of Trump but of people retweeting, rebutting, arguing, etc -- that whole ecosystem is huge! I'd imagine that if Trump announced tomorrow that he's no longer using Twitter and instead will post on Facebook or Instagram or whatever, Twitter's stock would slide by 10% at least.
