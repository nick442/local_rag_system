I'm not sure you can call this socialism, but I hold the belief that the world at some point will be socialist-like. This will take progress of automation and energy advances and capitalism will be the catalyst in this advancement. At some point people won't have to work. The only thing we will need is the power to run the automation. I think that by the time we get there, it won't really matter, as there will be no jobs needed. The bottle neck of course, is creating the energy cheaply, if not freely, via automation. We should be able to produce or run everything automatically at some point. From food production, to gadgets, we can and I'm sure will make everything automated. The only thing needed will be the raw materials which can be harvested through automation. The world will be weird and awesome 200 years from now. Assuming no religious cult takes hold and people don't banish or burn the advances made, which have historically happened.
