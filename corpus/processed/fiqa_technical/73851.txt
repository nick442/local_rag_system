There's already a budget deficit and national debt. Obama doubled the national debt in his tenure from ~10 Trillion to ~20 Trillion (more than any president in history), yet we still built infrastructure. We will with Trump too, one of his goals he's stated was infrastructure. I hate to say it, being fiscally conservative, but the debt would increase a small percentage compared to what Obama did. To me, any time you can get more tax money into the hands of all American citizens and companies is a win in my book. Sure the rich will benefit from this, but the poor and middle class will as well.
