Dow will not exist in 100 years. AI computer trading will remove all faith in the current system and companies will find new ways to raise equity capital that won't necessarily involve traditional exchanges. Even if exchanges are still strong the concept of the DOW is flimsy even today. I love Warren but he is not tech sophisticated enough to understand the shitstorm that AI will bring to financial markets.
