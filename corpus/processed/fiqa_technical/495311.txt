"> but if a big box store were delicious and did not support people I would wager it would not survive for very long. Good observation - not necessarily true, but it sounds good. :) I understand what you are saying, and generally agree with most of it. None of it actually has to do with the intent of my comment, but does fit the situation in general. My comment was addressing his specific statements about the fact that doing something illegal/unethical gives him pleasure, disliking society (not Target, but society in general). But, not knowing anything specific about Target, I can't really say that they are so evil that they deserve to be targeted (sorry); I think that is usually just a rationalization for doing something that a person knows is wrong. Same as doing harm to a person who you feel deserves it - if you look hard enough at any person, place, or thing, you can probably find some ""reason"" they/it deserves to be harmed. But the simple fact that something needs to be rationalized makes me suspect that the rationalizer knows better - else, why rationalize in the first place? I don't really know if big-box stores are evil or not. I'd say there are positive and negative aspects, but I don't know about good vs evil. I know that, for example, I don't particularly like Walmart, but I don't try to harm them, I simply avoid them. But if they had something I wanted for a lot cheaper than anywhere else, I don't really know whether I would stand on my principles or not - how about you? Edit: Oh, about your first sentence, ""The justification for an act typically comes after the decision is made"". I think that mainly applies to doing something questionable. You don't need to justify eating your dinner, but you may need to justify eating someone else's dinner."
