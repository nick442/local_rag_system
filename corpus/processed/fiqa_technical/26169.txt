The signal to noise/nonsense ratio in all of Taibbi's articles is absurdly low. It doesn't belong in r/finance. There will always be a better article on any topic he touches on (such as this [outdated one](http://www.bondbuyer.com/issues/121_73/muni-ge-unit-exec-bid-rigging-trial-1038622-1.html) I just googled which gets to the point of what happened far more quickly).
