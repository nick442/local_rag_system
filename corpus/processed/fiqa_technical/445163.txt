"In the short term what does it matter if she has poor credit? Just let it ride and focus on the important things. In the long term the most important part is ""completing the divorce"". That is separating all parts of her financial life from her ex-husband. This might mean she takes possession of the house and has him off the loan, or she gets off the loan and this may mean forcing a sale. If there are children or alimony involved she needs to build her income to the point that paying child support or alimony does not impact her budget. If she is on the receiving end, then she should budget so those items are bonus money and not counted on. She is flat broke and does not need to worry about borrowing money at this juncture. In this case a low credit score is a blessing."
