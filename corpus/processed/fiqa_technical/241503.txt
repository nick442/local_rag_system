Part III of form 8889 is applicable only if we have taken advantage of last month rule -had high deductible health plan (hdhp) on Dec 1 of the tax year. The advantage we get because of the rule is -we can contribute maximum amount to HSA for the tax year even though we had hdhp for just few months and not the entire tax year. Now there is one limitation to that advantage - we have to maintain 12 months of hdhp in the next year (after tax year). If we cannot maintain full 12 months of hdhp along with tax year's Dec 1 to Dec 31 hdhp then we fail glorious testing period. Such a failure would require us to pay taxes and penalty that we report on part III of 8889 form. These taxes and penalties are applied on last year's (tax year) contribution except dec month.
