Maybe a proxy war . Iâ€™m thinking a war between the first and second largest economies in the world, both with nuclear ICBMS would be world ending, not to mention dunking both economies as they are very heavily interdependent. Word case scenario the US pulls an Iraq in Saudi Arabia with results 3x worse as Mecca is in KSA. Litterally would create a super ISIL.
