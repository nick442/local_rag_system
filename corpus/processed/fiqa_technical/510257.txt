That's a simple overhead calculation. For secretary how much time is this person going to potentially save verses how much time I spend on those tasks. If secretary pay rate is near, equal, or less than what I spend in my own hourly rate it makes sense to hire. If it is not, do not hire, you don't want to loose money on overhead or have people sitting around doing nothing. Brand Manager is more complicated because it involves speculation and projection. I would want some kind of trial solution before a more permanent solution was decided on. For example, if brand manager is renewing my brand image what do I anticipate that new image will bring in additional revenue, or alternatively, what new markets will my product now be able to tap into that it was not able to tap into before. Then I would do the simple sales calculation of how much revenue would I need to expect to cover the cost of the overhead and project to justify viability. Then simply ask the question of if it is reasonable to expect those kinds of returns from this person or project. In business there is risk. There's really two ways to look at risk, big risk = big reward and screw the consequences if we fail, or make sure that risk is diminished as much as possible before making a decision. I would say most start-ups begin with big risk = big reward and then evolve into diminishing risk as much as possible. Both have many good and many bad examples. Most involve businesses dead before they figure out how to diminish risk, or in extreme examples wall street people diminishing risk by cheating the system, but we aren't discussing ethics.
