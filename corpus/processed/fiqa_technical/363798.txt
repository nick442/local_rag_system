"I don't understand why he couldn't just log onto his account online, see the ""current balance"" and pay that? I've got 4-5 credit cards (2 of them are Chase) and they *ALL* have an online portal which will show you a daily-calculated ""current balance"" right on your screen.. you can then enter in your checking account and transfer over that amount to pay the whole thing off virtually instantly. Does Chase continue to charge interest even after the balance goes to $0?"
