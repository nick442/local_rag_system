"It's easy to sell things when you have a panicking misinformed and ignorant viewer base. The sky is falling because obama is a socialist muslim fascist commie, the dollar is going to collapse! Now a word from our sponsors cash for gold and investment companies. Ads really do work though http://news.illinois.edu/news/12/0119junkfoodbans_KathyBaylis.html They don't make the sale, but they plant the idea. The next time you need, the first thing that comes to your mind will be what you've been given more exposure to and sounds familiar. The brain is not great at remembering ""source"" information for things that are not of interest but it still remembers. When you have a choice between product A or product B, you will choose the one that sounds more familiar. You will not remember if you think it sounds more familiar because of a friend recommendation or because of an Ad you heard passively 3 weeks ago. Incidentally, this is how politics work as a whole. The most familiar candidates almost always end up being the last to battle it out. People don't even consider or research the ones they hadn't heard of."
