> I'm a pleb and had healthcare before the Obamacare disaster. I'll bet that your company realized they could provide insurance cheaper if their employees used the exchanges. So they dropped their business plan and paid you additional money to buy your own through the ACA. You refused, pocketed the extra money, and now claim the ACA took your insurance.
