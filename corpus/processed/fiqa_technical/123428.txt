"The companies with the highest level of costumers that are able to stay under the limit for fuel will be able to draw the larger Revenue/Expense ratio (or what Obama calls it Profit to Earnings Ratio). This will make it easy for medium size companies to make the most money. Larger companies will still make money but will be ""pushed down"" because they have to pay that extra tax because they will reach the Cap of the Cap & Trade policy. This doesn't mean Companies with the lowest emissions will have to lowest prices. The larger companies will still have the decent prices. A company may have horrible engines but they don't fly so much they will not hit the cap in the cap & Trade so they wont have to pay that extra tax the larger companies do. So a company may start and grow very fast but once they get big enough they will start slowing down because of the government. Edit: last 2 paragraphs"
