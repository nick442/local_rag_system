Assuming there is actual competition that is what will happen. If MS offers M&A advisory for $3 MM, their operating expenses for the project is $2 MM . DB has greater technological efficiency, cutting down on analyst and support staff costs. Their operating expenses is only $1 MM, their best choice of action would be to undercut to $2.5 MM. This allows them to boost their operating margins and ROE while the client saves $500,000. Obviously if they are a monopoly, any technology gain just means fatter margins since they have all the pricing power.
