I have a loan that was picked up by BofA, too. They required escrow, but there was a problem with one of their checks to my insurance company where it evidently got lost in the mail. My insurance company contacted me, and I called BofA, who said it had been paid and may just be taking the insurance company a while to credit all the individual accounts (they send a check for a lot of customers at a time). Well, since the check wasn't received, my insurance company contacted me again, and I finally straightened it out with everyone. After that, I complained that it would have been much easier for me if I paid it myself instead of being a middle man, so they canceled my escrow, refunded the money to me, and now I pay the taxes and insurance myself. I prefer it that way, as it simplifies things. I've been a little surprised that BofA has been really nice whenever I contact them, and always seems willing to make me happy. Maybe it's just because I pay on time and have paid a lot of extra on the principal so that there's no danger that I'll default.
