"I'm not sure how legitimate this idea is, but when I see something like Airbnb coming into play in hospitality I think it opens a lot of potential doors. You need to realize the full scope of staying at a hotel. Its not just the room you sleep in. There are toiletries, concierge services, taxi/rides if they flew to the area, theres a lot out there when you think about it. Now imagine you book a place with airbnb. If i go there will they have toothpaste? Imagine just some kind of company that provides basic toiletries for a fair price for someone who is managing a listing and provides travel items etc whether the person wants to buy in bulk expecting a steady flow to save money, or buy in set packages in smaller sets. create some kind of ""basic bundle"" including necessities etc. This is just an example."
