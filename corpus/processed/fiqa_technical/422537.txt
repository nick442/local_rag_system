>The starving man has no means with which to attain a million dollars because he is incapable of contributing to society on that scale, the same would be true whether he was cast out to antarctica with a million dollars in a suitcase or put out on a curbside with nothing. You failed to ask any necessary questions to establish context. You made your assumptions on his value based on the notion that a starving MUST not have a way to contribute to society. That same man may have been a scientist studying in the Antarctic when circumstances created by a storm caused him to lose sight of his base, and unable to make contact with anyone via his satellite phone. The storm lasts for 5 days, the last 3 of which he is starving. He survives and makes it back to base, but during those last days, he would have given anything for an egg. This is caused circumstantial value. His circumstances, no matter how temporary, added value to that egg that would not exist otherwise. He was and is still a valuable asset to the world. But he was economically dismissed by /u/rdrptr because of shortsitedness. Tell me again how a mother’s love has no bearing on economic systems? How can my system be more flawed than yours, when you fail to recognize influences that shaped your own perceptions of economics, values, and life in general? I’m not tossing out age old, established, economic theories. I’m disagreeing with your interpretation of those theories.
