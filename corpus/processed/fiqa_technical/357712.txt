"Ok. You also had a wife/girlfriend. What about the single parents? I guess in your eyes if they can't juggle raising a child, holding down their full time job, taking public transportation, and going to school full time, they're just not working hard enough. Or clearly not as hard as you did. Sorry man. No. I guess we just disagree, but many people really are just in a position where they are unable to better their lives. Simply saying, ""this is important to me"", sadly, is not always enough to ""make it work""."
