Have you not noticed how the price of things like milk and beef in the grocery stores have been going up? And for a lot of other things, if the price has not overtly risen, the portion/package size has gotten smaller while the price has remained the same. Maybe somebody else does the food shopping in your family so you are just oblivious to it..but trust me..food has been getting more expensive for a while now.
