Eh, the violent carjacking attempt on Dad, the neighbor's cars getting their rims stolen three different times in one year, and then their car itself getting stolen and stripped, the phone call from Detroit about an old fluorescent shop light someone stole from our house because they could, the hooker squads we used to sit on the porch and watch.. Y'know, list goes on and on, but I think you're right.
