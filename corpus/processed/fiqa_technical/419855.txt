Yeah, infinite - or 8 years (whichever comes first). So, not infinite at all. By any stretch of the imagination. What a dishonest policy. Tesla should be ashamed. The word 'infinite' is in there - ONLY - to mislead people. That's shameful. Of course, everyone here has a raging hard-on for Tesla - so I expect that ***I'll*** be the one to get your downvotes (not Tesla) for this disgusting act.
