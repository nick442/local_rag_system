Idk why the comment before this got -10 and this one got +30 when it's all in the same vein.. Anyway.. the truth of the matter is, regardless if Trump is correct or not, finding good solutions isn't about democracy. Democracy is about mitigating the risks of concentrated political power and granting the people a chance to influence the nation. However.. effective problem solving and finding the truth is about placing powerful people in their respective positions while considering their qualified opinions. Not everyone's opinion should matter.. believe it or not.. democracy of capital causes misallocation. Democracy of information causes misunderstanding. And why? Because we have unqualified opinions. A doctor has a qualified opinion on health care and in a way so does a patient and perhaps an insurance company. But a plumber who spends little time with his children doesn't belong on the school board, and a teacher doesn't necessarily know anything about the coal industry. In the end.. our country is operated like a giant sub reddit where swarms of people upvote this and that just because they feel like it. We get a lot of important things right.. but we get some critical things incredibly wrong.. these stack up and produce problems of immense proportions with seemingly no answer.. for example health care and the government's recommendation for diet in public schools (as obvious examples with simple solutions that no one likes or agrees with.) Anyway.. the whole nation is sick from head to toe. And the remedy is not democracy. Democracy is an inanimate tool. It is neutral. How we use it is how we benefit from it.
