"I've seen ""temp to hire"" once, and that was with a large gov contracting company after they realized they kind of messed up the contract and would have to let me go if I didn't switch to working direct for them, and they really really wanted to keep me. For the most part in tech what I've seen follows this rule if you're a contractor your a contractor, and temp to hire just means they want a cheaper contractor and will not hire."
