>I sense latent hostility in your phrasing, but I hope I am wrong. It feels like you are accusing me of making a profit, No hostility intended. I just know that if an incremental dollar is to be made from an investment, a business will venture into that increment. Now yes, you have to look at ROI. How long is the payback period on my investment? Higher taxes make make the payback period take longer. Perhaps the risk/reward payoff just doesn't make a risk worth while any more. but at the end of the day, if investing in a new machine means you can improve productivity by 10%, and it means a 10% increase in net income before taxes, you're going to do it regardless of whether there's a 2% increase in taxes or not. Some choices in business are more cut and dry than others. All I'm saying is that business is really driven by profit, and if an investment will yield you more profit, you're probably going to make it.
