> I'm not so sure that performance measurement of students is all that difficult You assume that student performance is a good proxy for teacher performance. One of the bigger influences on student performance is parent engagement (particularly the parent engagement that happens prior to school age, but also the engagement once they're in school). Often these differences run along socioeconomic lines, and schools are generally divided on neighborhood lines with students attending the school closest to their home. If you judge based on student performance, you'll likely assume that the teachers in the richer neighborhoods are better (students perform better on standardized tests, students are more likely to graduate high school and even go on to college, etc). The fact is, there's a lot of good teachers who take the hard jobs because even a little improvement can go a long way. Put those same teachers in the richer neighborhoods and you might judge things differently.
