My UPS guy said that Amazon and UPS are basically merged at this point. Their major hubs work in the same buildings. Sometimes Amazon doesn't even touch a product, it goes right into the UPS system. So all amazon really needs to do is push inventory down to the existing local UPS centers which really only requires some more warehouse space at an existing site. With some intelligent data mining Amazong could figure out which products to offer with same day shipping, which with 1-day, etc.
