Just an observation analysis of what has been going on and what the media buzzwords are. Also all of the people who I know that are doing well or are not complaining take care of there health/body, didn't divorce, work hard, educated and are not stressed because they live within there means. Plus I truly believe that our capitalistic society is designed to keep you in debt or keep you needing government/charity help if your poor/uneducated.
