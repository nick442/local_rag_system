"As a financial advisor, I certainly don't regret it. However, I do see it as a stepping stone being that it's my first real job out of college. Even though the job is extreme sales of insurance and investments, I feel that I've developed a plethora of people skills and worldly knowledge just by meeting with so many different peopleâ€“whether existing or new clients whom I've ""brought onboard."" My true passion is trading currency. I'm currently working on branching out into that field."
