I'm having a difficult time understanding how Chevron is avoiding taxes through party related loans. From my understanding, Chevron is providing loans to its Australian subsidiary at interest rates higher than market benchmarks. Does this shift profits from Australia to the U.S. and how does it help Chevron avoid taxes even though the corporate tax rate is higher in the U.S. than in Australia? Wouln't they want to be taxed at the the lower tax rate in Australia than in the U.S.? The more description the better, thanks! Edit: I think I understand that Chevron is giving out large loans with high interest rates to its subsidiary in Australia and I think the Australian subsidiary is converting its revenues to pay back the loan thus looking like profit in the corporation's books in Delaware. How is the money to pay back interest being raised if not from revenue? And how is that revenue not being taxed?
