1. Government grants patent rights to Mylan for Epipen. 2. Epipen goes off patent. 3. Government puts onerous restrictions on generic alternatives, rejects several company's formulations because plastic autoinjecting syringe isn't foolproof enough for morons to use. 4. Mylan raises prices given government granted monopoly. 5. Government shocked that government caused problem is a problem, recommends more government. How about no. Abolish the FDAs ability to approve generics and get government out of the way. These drugs have already been scrutinized, they don't need to be again. Even better, abolish the FDA altogether and let the market work properly.
