To be fair, it could go completely tits up, so don't buy more than you can afford to lose. That being said, I'm a huge crypto evangelist, but I tend to stick to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Ethereum is trying to solve a problem that isn't there by adding the programming language to the base code. I think Bitcoin has a better approach by leaving the base code simple and adding layers like TCP/IP did. But Ethereum is the #2 crypto in the world right now so maybe I'm wrong.
