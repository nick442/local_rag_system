"This is a funny article. This kid is riding around talking to people who don't want to sell. If they wanted to sell, they'd call a realtor. Sounds like he can't afford what's already on the market. 23-year-olds typically don't own. This is the flip side of the ""wealth effect."" The middle class housing has appreciated so much, millennials can't afford to buy them. I think there's quite an overhang, and prices should fall as the boomers need to sell, and millennials have more resources."
