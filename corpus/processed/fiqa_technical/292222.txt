Or we could allow market forces to work: My suggestion woudl be to outlaw price descrimination (charging different people different rates), force providers to disclose prices publicly, and discourage patients from paying everything through a middle man type insureer and purchase more services upfront. We coudl then institute a national catastrophic insurance to trigger in life/death situations and we could then reimburse lower income people later with a government program; *but the amount of reimbursement needs to be hidden from the service provider,* because if they know how much the patient gets reimbursed, they will just charge more.
