"Well the whole book was founded on an factually incorrect thesis: HFT front runs retail orders, so I'll start with that. But to be a bit more detailed, the basis for Katsuyama's ""journey"" into better execution was based on a completely incorrect model of how the markets work, that his trades were being ""seen"" by HFT firms before he placed the order is absolutely stupid; singular parts of his multi-exchange order were being executed before they hit other exchanges and HFT firms rightfully reacted to changes in supply and demand."
