The only legit criticism of this that I can see is employees are not compensated for wear and tear or gas. That's such a tiny thing though, and extremely common. I'm not sure this is really a wise business move, but no need for pitchforks (or rather, no additional need for pitchforks over the standard level appropriate for Walmart employee practices).
