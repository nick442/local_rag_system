My wild ass guess is that it will be a pair of voice controlled, connected headphones. *smartphones*, if you will, that aren't dependent on a phone in your pocket and targeted initially at sporty types and others who don't currently have a great way to listen to music and stay connected while keeping their eyes and hands free to do other things. It's utility will grow over time as voice and natural language processing improves to the point where we'll be having casual conversations with our devices, but in the meantime so long as it's good for music, calls, texting, and monitoring vitals people will want it.
