"It seems like you don't understand much about what you have a strong opinion about. Most public employees who fly do fly coach. Senior leadership and executive class employees - the kind responsible for tens of thousands of employees and/or manage federal budgets worth hundreds of millions or more - you put them in business class so they can be productive. It's not about comfort; it's about productivity. Secondly, neither you (as an owner) nor the public pay the costs for union reps. So no one needs to or should care what uninformed opinion you have. That would be like me disctating how you or some other business owner should be able to spend their operating budget. It's statements from ignorance like this that really undermine the argument that ""business owners"" are the backbone of the economy or that they would have any advantage managing public affairs."
