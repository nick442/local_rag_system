I wasn’t disagreeing with Trump’s plan. I never said I did. I don’t agree with Trump’s methods, though. No irony here. I want to come up with a solution everyone can agree on. But what I’ve heard from Republicans and Democrats is a refusal to work together. So I am trying to find solutions that bring people together. What does Trump’s agenda have to do with it? His agenda isn’t my goal set. Edit: Also, that link you posted was as one sided as everything else! It was not what I am trying to accomplish! You don’t work together by ignoring criticisms and proclaiming how great you’ve done.
