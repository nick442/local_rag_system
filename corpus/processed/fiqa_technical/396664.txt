Puerto Rico isn't Algeria. Lending to Algeria is relatively simple as they live and die on the price of oil. Puerto Rico is far more complex and doesn't have a basic resource export economy. Lending to Algeria is a pure oil play and is far less dependent on credit ratings. If Puerto Rico's debt investors take the hit, there isn't a line of lenders throwing money at them.
