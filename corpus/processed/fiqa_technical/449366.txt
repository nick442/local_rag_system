I'm an independent rep and believe that what I sell actually gives back to the community. If the government would get out of my business a bit more, I could offer more to the community business-wise. That said, I donate free time to help out at soup kitchens, toy/clothes drives, etc.. And that is fairly anonymous. I just do it because I like where I live and the people here are nice. If they're down on their luck it isn't their fault. And if I'm down on my luck, I'd take some help.
