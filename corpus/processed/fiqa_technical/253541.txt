I think we should re-think about paying taxes. If they don't have to pay income tax. It is just one way: to minimize the revenue and maximize their expense. As you know, profit (or loss) = revenue - expense. If they want to reduce their income tax. They have to do this. We can't say anything about the income tax that G.E must pay. They maybe have some rights to encourage their business by being decreased some kinds of taxes. It's very normal. If you have some knowledge about tax and accounting, audits, You will have a clearly point about it! I'm not native speaker. I might not understand your tax rules. But they have all general standards all over the world. If I use wrongly grammar or misunderstanding, pls forgive me. Thank you!
