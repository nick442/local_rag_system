The car created tons of jobs. We have already seen one robot replace hundreds of people in factories. Automation with robots and AI will not create more jobs than it displaces. What need is a human when you have a robot doing the work? You seem to be confusing the anti technology people of the olden day with the vastly more intelligent and technologically minded people of today. You are mischaracterize the student loan debt issues. A baby boomer leaving doesn't mean they're replacing them. Do more with less is a corporate motto. Btw if you think serving of these robots will make a ton of jobs you don't know how the servicing industry works. It won't. You're also ignorant about healthcare costs. Market forces can't fix this nor will they. If I held a gun to your head and told you to pay x you will. That's basically the same as you have cancer now here's your bill. For a millionaire you're not so great at reality.
