(I'm a bot) ***** > U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System Cost Benchmark: Q1 2017 shows PV system prices falling roughly 30 per cent in only one year for utility-scale solar, to an average price of $1.03 per watt-DC for fixed-tilt systems and $1.11 per watt for systems with tracking. > NREL has estimated that this translates to levelized costs of electricity from $50-66 per megawatt-hour for fixed tilt systems and $44-$61/MWh for tracking systems, excluding the effect of the U.S. federal Investment Tax Credit. > NREL found that prices for commercial and industrial systems fell a still-impressive 15% over the last year to an average of $1.85 per watt-DC, while prices for residential systems fell only 6% to $2.80 per watt. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/717qx9/us_solar_plant_costs_fall_another_30_per_cent_in/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~213287 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **System**^#1 **price**^#2 **Cost**^#3 **solar**^#4 **U.S.**^#5"
