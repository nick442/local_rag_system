"No you brought up aluminum as an issue. I simply pointed out there is nothing unique or unusual about aluminum body panels. Insurers have known Tesla has aluminum body panels since day 1. What they did not have was sufficient statistics to determine how unsafe Teslas and their drivers are until now. Once they had data to prove that Teslas have a substantially higher accident rate they raised insurance rates. If the accident rate was low they would not have raised the rates. The new information is not ""aluminum body panels"" but that Teslas and their drivers have a mich higher accident rate."
