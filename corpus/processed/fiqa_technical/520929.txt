Because union busting and deregulation has been the key to success? Deregulation helped exacerbate the 2008 meltdown. No one was lending to each other because no one knew how much toxic assets anyone carried. Unions are about workers realizing that they ARE the corporation, and demanding a more fair share of end profits earned. They aren't going to run the company into the ground and those that would, you can rightly call idiots. You can call expenses legacy costs, but there are no legacy contracts or legacy people unless you can talk about the legacy profits they generated.
