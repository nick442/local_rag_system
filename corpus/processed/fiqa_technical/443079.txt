I think this thread got a bit off topic. The point is that we've decided as a nation that we want to guarantee a basic level of healthcare, as established by government programs. Companies like wal-mart take advantage of that, paying low wages and assuming employees will utilize the government assistance. The take-away, is that that's a little goofy and we should just fix our fucking healthcare system. As for wal-mart. It's complicated. They've accomplished huge gains in efficiency, arguably accomplishing more for the environment than any other company, not to mention their moves towards sustainable fish/etc. At the same time, the lawsuit alleging gender discrimination seemed not without merit, the folks in charge are occasionally aggressively socially conservative, and their march to the bottom for prices has induced quality suppliers to provide lower quality products specifically to be sold in wal-mart, corrupting their brand-name and commoddifying[sic] their products after being suckered in by the big sales numbers.
