"Thanks for disagreeing in a classy way. Seriously - as you can see, it's not that common! Two points: 1. You wouldn't trade the (bad) experiences. People say that about being paralyzed. I said it about the douchebag ex-bf who stole my car. Doesn't mean you would recommend people do it, right? In fact, you'd probably steer them away from it. That's why I write what I write. 2. ""do something big, or fast, or perhaps manufacture something… these types of business need outside funding"" I don't disagree with you there, in principle. But the vast majority of startups who want to ""do something big, or fast"" are in fact not businesses. All the big high-growth startups are losing money -- pretty much EXCEPT Facebook. Groupon, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Angie's List, Yelp, Twitter… these are not profitable years later, they are not businesses, they are the essence of gambling. It's just another part of the con. Some of them have or will go public, spreading their lack of profitability around the stock market… just like a package of sliced up bad mortgages. Others will get sold to a bigco who bought them for some OTHER reason, but not because they are a profitable, smart business. And the rest will shutter. It's part of the con."
