>if they got paid for the household chores and family care they provide, it would add an additional $10 trillion to the global economy. This wouldn't add anything to the global economy; the value is already there. It would just artificially inflate gdp/gwp measures from them paying themselves instead of being a representation of value created through trade. If I invoiced myself for my household chores, and then had my first bank ACH my other bank account for the invoice; I haven't created anything in value that's not already there.
