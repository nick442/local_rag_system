Actually nearly the entire western world is following in Japan's footsteps. A decade from now debts of 200%+ / GDP will be common place, why because populations are ageing & older people tend to spend less & western economies are consumer driven. Meanwhile, as happened in Japan, people don't want to pay more tax or lose entitlements & politicians don't want to take them away for fear of losing votes. However, in the new normal of constant volatility and low interest rates and few growth opportunities western countries with their own currencies will probably get away with it for quite a long time. But watch Japan, because they're a decade ahead and if they collapse or even somehow solve the problem then the West is probably not far behind
