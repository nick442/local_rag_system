I didn't like it very much, because he's confusing money with credit. Money is accumulated work, not debt. Suppose the farmer has apples and wants meat, but the hunter doesn't want apples. The farmer exchanges some apples for the miner's gold and barters that gold for the hunter's meat. All three of them have already worked to produce what they have. There's no debt involved, only the accumulated product of work. An economy cannot function on credit alone. The existence of accumulated work that somebody did before is essential for the existence of credit. Suppose the farmer promises a bushel of apples to the hunter and the hunter promises to get a deer for the farmer. Now the farmer needs a barrel to collect the apples and he promises to give some apples to the cooper. The cooper promises to make the barrel for the farmer. All we have up to this point are promises, but no one has done any work yet. Things won't start happening until the cooper does the work needed to make a barrel. The economy functions on work, not promises. The farmer may promise a million bushels of apples and the hunter may promise a million deer, but that's just fantasy. Now suppose the cooper dies. The farmer will have to get barrels from the neighboring town, so now he must give some apples to the carter who brings the barrel. The hunter will not get his full bushel of apples, he's experiencing inflation, the cost of apples has gone up. No matter what the farmer and the hunter promise to each other, the fact remains that the barrels must be brought from the other town. Economists like Paul Krugman seem to believe that everything can be fixed by increasing demand, but they totally ignore the costs of production. There exists plenty of demand in the US economy right now, but the cooper has died, the barrels must be brought from China.
