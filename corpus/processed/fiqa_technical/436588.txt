This. I rarely buy anything on Amazon anymore, and if I do, it's from a third party seller (never had an issue). I ordered a health and beauty type product last week..it was on Amazon for 22 dollars, and I would have to pay shipping as I don't have Prime. I went to the manufacturers website..$18.free shipping. Amazon is a great place to discover new products..but then I just go search and find the product for either less money, and/or free shipping elsewhere.
