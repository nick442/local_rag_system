"Piggybacking on this, the best thing you can do is ask current analysts for help. You're new and people expect you to ask dumb questions at this point. So ask them now while you still get a pass. With that being said, there's a strategy to it. Before you ever ask a question, spend at least 5 minutes trying to figure out the answer on your own. OP did a Google search, which is great. So many people won't do this. Finally, the way you ask the question is key. I would go to an analyst and say, ""[Boss] asked me to get a list of all US apartment flooring companies. I looked on Google to see if I could find anything there. If you were doing this, where would you go to find the information?"" They'll usually even walk you through how to do it if there's something special with the service you have for the task. You'll also make them feel important. And you'll get the task done fast. Also, if you run into trouble with the boss after presenting it, you can always back yourself up by saying you asked around the office for what tool to use and people told you to use that. But be strategic with how you say it because you don't want to throw anyone under the bus."
