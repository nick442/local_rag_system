Just saw him on pbs this week saying that 99% of his wealth will be sold, liquidated, within 10 years of his and his spouse's death. He probably is getting tax breaks but I imagine the koch brothers get similar breaks while actively fighting to get rid of the estate tax to pass all of their wealth on not just most of it.
