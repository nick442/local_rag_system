>The USA and China are about as close as siamese twins when it comes to preserving the dollar's value. The dollar should float in reflection to the strength of America's economy. I am not concerned with artificially strengthening the dollar's value. China artificially increases the dollar's value by soft pegging the yuan to the dollar through purchases of currency reserves. I do like that they are inextricably linked to the US economically, so tensions can't escalate. I'd rather not have them able to use the debt as a bargaining chip though.
