I can't speak authoritavely about enforceability. I've done some work on arbitration clauses for a client and worked on a major litigation case where we were trying to invalidate some arbitration clauses and arguing duress (but we ended up settling before it went to court). I believe common some law concepts would work (they are contracts after all), but the FAA is usually read to preempt some typical defenses. I also know in some jurisdictions the enforceability of an arbitration cause is put to arbitration itself, which is a barrier to getting some sort of collective action going and effectively cools a lot of litigation. It may very well be that Uber's arbitration agreements are unenforceable, but there is a lot of rage on Reddit over Uber's use of arbitration clauses, and I only wanted to bring up the fact that companies use them all the time
