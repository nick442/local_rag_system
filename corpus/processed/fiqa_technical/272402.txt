Top Gear (~~or was it Grand Tour~~) did a [special on chinese cars](https://vimeo.com/40226173) a few years back. In ~2007, the first domestic chinese cars were worse than Model Ts, then they started stealing IP and by the early 2010s the cars were knockoffs of western brands. Perhaps, they've improved since that time, especially since intentional negligence in manufacturing will lead to a death penalty over there.
