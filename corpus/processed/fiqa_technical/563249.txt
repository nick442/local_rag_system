I don't understand why Apple's laptop and portable displays are so, so much better than the competition considering that they don't actually make their own shit. The iPhone 5 display is easily [the highest quality](http://www.anandtech.com/show/6334/iphone-5-screen-performance) (in terms of color accuracy, gamut, viewing angles, and display temperature) of any portable screen ever. Who makes that screen and why don't they put an equivalent quality screen in their own device? The Galaxy S III screen is, quite frankly, pretty shit, which really bothers me as both an Android user and a display snob.
