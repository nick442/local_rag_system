Heh, I was a recently unemployed mechanical engineering graduate, and gotta tell you, there weren't many positions open for the little bit of experience I had. I've had plenty of friends who decided to go to grad school for this very reason, and no they weren't the bottom of the barrel, and yes they had some experience as well.
