> If my memory isn't too bad, they were aiming to cancel 80% of their new shows after one season. Your memory is off. Netflix renewed 93% of its shows, and had to defend the rate of renewal. They keep the majority of what they make going. Probably smarter to do that as creating a new show is more expensive than more episodes of something you have sets for.
