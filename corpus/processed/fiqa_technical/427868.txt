People are just spoiled by shitty burgers off the Dollar menu at McDs that taste like cardboard and are only beef in the strictest academic sense of the word that they complain about constantly but when given the option for a superior burger from Five Guys or Culver's that might cost a few bucks more, they say it's too expensive. People don't know what they want. That's why the advertising industry exists.
