"That's not very correct math. It should be "" +household savings -spending + business savings -spending + imports -exports + government surplus -deficit = 0"" And then it seems like comparing oranges with apples? How can you compare savings, spending and surplus of various instances? If it would be + income - expense it would be more understandable. Then it's just about money, not about value. It's possible to circulate a fixed amount of money around to various instances. If those instances are doing valuable favors to each other while circulating money, they generate wealth. However it's better to assign more money into the system to represent added value in the system. Price of money usually is something like ""total value in the system/amount of money in the system"". If you just add money, you can't add value."
