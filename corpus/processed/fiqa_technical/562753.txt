I've worked extensively overseas and I can say America is one of the most miserable places I have lived. But, it isn't even the poor, but the middle and upper middle class who are the most miserable - always thinking they are just about to turn the financial corner, trying to keep up with their in-debt neighbors, and never socializing. I wish it was mandatory for Americans to live overseas for a year or two.
