How many more? This is like the problem Canadians have when people say there's no famous Canadians so we all rattle off the same 5 to 7 but it's really just a way to prove the insane discrepancy between America and Canada. Everyone can rattle off like 5 famous women, I can probably find 3 black hockey players too but what does that mean in context of the overall conversation? I work in marketing and the majority of my bosses have been women and I work around mostly women and I can tell you for a fact there's huge differences between female dominated companies and male dominated ones, I think it's something we all know but nobody wants to actually make a value judgement based on it.
