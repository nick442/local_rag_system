With the current models, yes. With the upcoming low-cost Tesla it would be a real boon to people who drive constantly, especially for taxis, transplant delivery companies, city-to-city messenger services, etc. Tesla needs to be very careful and perhaps exclude commercial vehicles/commercial use or they may wind up paying for repairs for a lot of taxicabs.
