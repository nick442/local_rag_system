whether the consecutive wins have any statistical significance could yield a whole reddit thread imho (same with MaxDD). if you bootstrap your OS results, or just randomize them, the observed out of sample MaxDD or the Max consecutive wins could be very different from what you experience in real life..maybe we should work on some particular algo examples.. test them out here, compare and criticize. scoring/utility functions are an interesting thread as well.
