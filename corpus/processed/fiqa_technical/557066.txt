It's already happening. The effectiveness of ads is dwindling, even with laser-focused targeting of which users to harass. Ad blockers are commonplace and idiot-proof. The whole business will simply fade away. The web will find other ways to keep sites up. There will be sites that leverage WebRTC to host themselves, sites that mine crypto or whatever, sites that demand payment for entry, sites that privilege paid users, etc., etc., etc. P2P is the obstacle that people will notice the least. There's no overhead for conversion or profit motive. It simply makes hosting cheaper. Nothing new is required.
