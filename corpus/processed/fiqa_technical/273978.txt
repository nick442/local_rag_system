Re-invest it in the business, invest it long-term somewhere. It is a very bad business practice to have too much cash lying around. That cash could either generate a higher profit % used in the business or it could generate more money long term being invested somewhere. It seems apple has now done the latter, up until now it's been largely invested in cash-like things.
