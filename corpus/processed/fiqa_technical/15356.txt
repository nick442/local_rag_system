On last nights episode of The Profit Marcus made an offer to the owner of a coffee company. The owner said up front he has 51% with the remaining 49% split between two early investors. Marcus asked for 40%, said the owner will have 40% and the investors will be reduced to 20%. Question is how can the owner agree to that deal and take equity away from the investors? It's not his percentage to sell.
