An article came out today saying Amazon asked those four for a level 2 proposal. I don't know how accurate it is or not. I'd also assume somewhere in California would work too but there are a few negatives for that area like taxes. That being said they already have a large presence in all of these places. DC would make sense for the Eastern tri state area and the federal government. Nexus to customers is another biggie but they're mostly covered there. Then you have appetite and capacity for new tech for drones, space and driverless vehicles among others. Employees and customers in this context are interchangeable. Their top customers would be their best employees and vice versa. Amazon will need to continue to shift the paradigm if they want to maintain momentum. They're not really limited in where else they can build so as I think about it HQ2 needs to be somewhere that has something nowhere else has.
