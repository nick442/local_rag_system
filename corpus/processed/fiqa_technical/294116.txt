"Don't know if it's due to internet or due to reality tv shows turning people off. Survivor (Started the major reality tv trend, the ""Real World"" wasn't anywhere as big) started in mid 2000 which ironicly is when the chart started to noise dive. I'm surprised the report didn't even mention how badly reality tv is effecting us as TV stations are loosing viewers which means they have to put on more commercials to make up for lose of money and then they put on more reality tv because it's the cheapest kind of tv show to make without needing to hire stages,actors,casts,techs,crews,whatever. They then cut back on decent/experimental shows because the tv watching demographic are now a bunch of reality tv viewers (idiots). Catch 22. Prime example of this is now that MTV has pretty much gone full reality tv and even other once respected channels like Discovery and History now have a crap load of reality based shows."
