I think it's more of a supply issue than anything else. Lots of people want Surface Pros, but actually finding one in a store, nevermind accessories etc. is a chore. At least that has been my observation. This is entirely based on the month or so I worked at Best Buy over the holidays, so take this post with a grain of salt. All I know is that we had a shit ton of customers asking for them but we just never had them in stock because Microsoft would only send us like 5 of them in a shipment. Meanwhile iPads consistently sold very well and we always had enough of them in stock.
