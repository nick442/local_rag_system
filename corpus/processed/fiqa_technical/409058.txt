"Until we have full automation for needs: my point stands. The government is currently run by people, they should also get as well as corporate governances. It's a problem when the CEO of GM or AIG can pull down millions a year while putting the entire economy in the dumps. All while the president makes $400K. You get strange candidates as the norm. Nobody has defined ""basic needs"". Even when it comes to ""basic medical coverage"". Is there a dollar cap? A service cap? It is very hard to draw a line in between unlimited and anything else. Service X is covered, but Service Y is not. Why: Cost? Efficacy? Above Basic?"
