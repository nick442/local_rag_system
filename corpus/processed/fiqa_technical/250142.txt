I think this has more to do with bad parenting than low wages. Think about it, who are these people that can even answer this question. If I were asked it, I'd say that I have no idea because not working is not an option, but I make sure that I am always able to make a good income. To me the only people who are able to do this are economic outpatient care recipients. Or people that can lie off of mommy and daddy's money. If I don;t work, my family and I go hungry, I lose my house, and everything fails. Put in this situation I'd take the low paying job and work up to the better paying one. People need to suffer through a shitty job or two to develop character.
