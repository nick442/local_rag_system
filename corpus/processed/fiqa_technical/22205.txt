"I mostly agree. However, I also recognize a redditer ""type"" who is impervious to any logic. When your point doesn't fit within their world view, they most often retaliate by downvoting, or downvoting AND posting an angry, curse laden rant. I believe the guy above was just saving time by preempting their initial response. Of course, you also risk putting off those on the fence who might have been willing to consider your point, but now will not."
