">So you're telling me you can't commute upwards of one hour away from your work to find affordable housing? That is what Californians do. Because everyone can and should spend 2 hours commuting every day. Or three or four, ""if that's what it takes."" Hell, why don't we just cancel nights and work through until it's time for sleep; that will save on commuting while allowing the same (near-zero) amount of seeing friends and family. Fallacy of the Argument to Sufficient Extremes: ""You can fly unaided if you're determined enough. You just have to put up with hitting the ground from a great height shortly after beginning your flight."""
