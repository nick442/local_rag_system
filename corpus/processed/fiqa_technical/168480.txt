>The EOL cycle has really sped up - it used to be you could buy a fighter jet or a transport and use it for 25 years before worrying about replacing it with the latest and greatest. Now, the latest and greatest are still on the ground before they're obsolete. I disagree with that / think it's the other way around. The F-35 for example is currently programmed to continue flying until 2070, with each jet lasting >30 years or >8000FH without any life extensions (the F-22 was also overbuilt and is good for over 12,000 flight hours and will serve at least into the 2040s); previous jets were generally only built to (originally) last 4000 or 6000 flight hours, equating to 15 or 20 years of use. They've since had to receive service life extensions as the Cold War ended and a bunch of their replacements failed to materialise or were delayed (the A-12 Avenger was cancelled because it wasn't as stealthy as planned and was massively overweight, the F-22 was delayed and had its production run cut short, the F-35 was also delayed, but has yet to be cut back). OP's title is (unsurprisingly considering it's Russian state media) incorrect - out of the current 250 or so F-35s, about 108 need upgrades to bring them to their final setup. The Pentagon is considering not giving them upgrades, not due to cost (it's only a few million per jet on average; way cheaper than buying 108 new jets), but because the depots and factories that would perform the upgrades are at / near capacity pumping out new jets. *If* the Pentagon decides not to upgrade those jets (like it decided not to for early F-16s, F-15s, F/A-18s, F-22s, etc) then they'll largely be staying where they are, continuing to be training or test aircraft (the jets in the actual combat-ready squadrons are already upgraded); at no point have Pentagon officials suggested actually retiring them.
