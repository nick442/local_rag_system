As opposed to a minor, which is worth fuck all? And if we are going to talk about wasting ones time, I think majoring in finance is a good place to start.. I suppose if you're shooting for some BS job at a big bank, you're right. Your education is more a ticket to the club than any useful knowledge. Seeing as how a finance degree gives you exactly zero knowledge, it fits well.
