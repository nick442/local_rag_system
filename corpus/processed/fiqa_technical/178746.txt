Generally speaking: 401k good. Whole life bad. You'll come out ahead if you buy term life (which will cost like 10% of what whole life costs) and invest the other 90% that you would have paid in premium. The only merit that whole life has is if you're estate planning and and want to leave your kids a ton of money, tax free. If you're thinking about saving money for yourself, whole life is not a good choice.
