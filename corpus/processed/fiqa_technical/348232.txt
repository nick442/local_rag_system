Every Town has corrupt politicians and gangsters. /U/Fricken is right. Gaming caused the mega-rush, the billion dollar resorts and the 1,000 room towers. They bet big that gambling would be forever contained to Vegas and AC. They were wrong and now they're paying for it, the beach-side city will go back to moderate hotels on the Jersey shore. No different from Sea Bright to Cape May. Regardless, I have my bachelor party there in a few weeks and am giving it one more go.
