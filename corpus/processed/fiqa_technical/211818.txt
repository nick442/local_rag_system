WOW . . .really WOW! They grew the Fed balance sheet from 800 Billion to 4.5 trillion by buying up every bad debt and funny money contract that the banking sector had fraudulently entered into . . .in spite of the fact that every economist in the world told them that socializing the debt was bullshit . . .they gave their banker buddys trillions of dollars of tax payer money . . .this money never entered the real economy and remain tied up between the Fed and the banks . .the real economy never grew, inflation never picked up and the wage and income gap grew and the Banks got richer and everybody got poorer and now they are going to unwind US 4.5 trillion . .whatever the fuck that means, bcause nobody is buying those toxic assets because they have no value . .not then and not now. If the banks buy it back they are right back where they started with 4.5 trillion of bad debt. So all it could mean is they are going to write it off as a loss and that would mean they have been lying to the American public about what great profits and have mean while transferred US 4.5 trillion free money at tax payer expense to the banks.
