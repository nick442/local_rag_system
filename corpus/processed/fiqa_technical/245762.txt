Google loses money on each sale of a Nexus. Apple doesn't lose money on hardware. That is the one thing Apple is not inferior, and to analysts, the one thing that matters (profitability). I am thinking about purchasing a Nexus, but you make a large assumption in that statement. From my brief play time (planning to do more before making a purchase), Android seems to have a steeper learning curve than iOS. This goes a long way toward attracting a large market.
