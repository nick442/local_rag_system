I agree. This is far worse than Wells Fargo and Tylenol. Their core business is data. That is all they offer. Data must be secure and accurate. They failed on the secure part. The hackers may as well start offering credit scores to vendors for free, they have the data. Why would any customer (we aren't customers, credit providers are), use Equifax moving forwards? There are 2 perfectly acceptable replacements. Only way Equifax survives is rebranding. Senior management at banks across the country are having meetings with their legal departments to discuss liability concerns of continuing to use Equifax. What if there is another breach, could the bank be sued for leaking consumer data, after they knew Equifax hires Musicians to manage data security?
