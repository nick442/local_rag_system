I've sometimes wondered this. It seems like something your agent would deal with and surely be familiar with. If any of my screenplays get filmed though, I'm going to try and get a cut of the gross if I can. I wonder if some are mad because they didn't fully understand and didn't fight harder for a cut, since .001% of the gross is better than 5% of the net.
