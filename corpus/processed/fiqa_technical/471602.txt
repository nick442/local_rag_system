"Agree 100 %. Nothing drives me more batty than when I hear a health food nut complaining about GMO food or ""chemicals"". I ALWAYS challenge them on it. RE GMO: ""Do you eat apples and bananas? Did you know farmers have been gene splicing apples and bananas since the 1800s? There has literally not been a single apple sold in stores since the early 1900s that is not spliced. All of those Apple"" varieties"" in the store are a result of splicing over the years, including your overpriced ""organic"" ones. RE ""chemicals"" like ammonia: ""Ammonia is 100% natural. Your own body produces ammonia all the time, as do all other mammals. You can find ammonia residue on most fruits and vegetables in the grocery store that haven't yet been thoroughly washed (read: almost all, including organic) Most all chemicals are found in nature. Water itself is a chemical and can kill you if ingested beyond normal guidelines. When consumed according to guidelines there is no difference between one chemical and another, like water. Show me the science behind your concern, don't try to frighten people with the word ""chemicals"" which is meaningless."
