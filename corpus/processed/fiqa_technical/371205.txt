"Alrighty. So your question is, how confident are people that FB stock will close above a certain price at a certain time. A ""call"" option contract allows you to buy shares in the future at a certain price. FB calls are available for March of 2013. The number in the ""strike"" column is the price you can buy FB stock at on the given date. Let's take the ""33.00"" strike. This allows you to buy FB shares at $33 each next March. If at that time it turns out they're worth $50 each, you can buy them at $33, then immediately sell them on the open market for $50, making money. The person selling you the option knows that there's a chance the price will be above $33 in March, so he's going to charge you a few bucks to cover that possibility. In this case, he's charging you $5.30 (as of me writing this). So, you can have the option to buy FB shares at $33 each for $5.30. This means the guy selling you the option is reasonably confident that in March, FB stock will be at or under $38.50, otherwise he'd lose money when you exercised the option. Therefore, $38.50 is the option market's best guess as to the highest FB stock will be going for in March."
