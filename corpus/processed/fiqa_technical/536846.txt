Quite interesting. Personally, I have been against gender quotas.. or quotas for any specific demographic. I have always had the impression that by making 50/50 rules, you may change what the most apparent outcome looks like but you won't affect the underlining problems. Therefore we should focus on the individual competency and work from the ground up instead. That said, I'm finding more interesting evidence that gender quotas have much deeper effects in reforming institutions and replacing unfit politicians. I have also stumbled upon other different working papers lately that support this notion. I may have to reconsider what I thought.
