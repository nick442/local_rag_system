I think that's actually by design. I mean, of course it's by design, but I think they're deliberately trying to look like 'normal' cars. I imagine the first thing people think when they see a flashy car is 'expensive'. Also, at the moment they're probably trying to appeal to sensible people who are looking at what the car offers practically - the sort of person that would buy a Kia. In the future though, I'm sure Tesla will really start producing some interesting looking cars - their different structure could afford them options not easily available to normal car manufacturers.
