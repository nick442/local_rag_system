I've heard from friends in high paying companies that the norm is under 4 hours: you can upgrade yourself. Above 4 hours: business. Sounds reasonable to me. Usually people that fly business aren't flying one or two times a year. They're doing it a couple of days per week. And these people are usually in high demand. If someone doesn't offer this as the norm, they can probably get a job someplace that does.
