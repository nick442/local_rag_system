Are the topics of phone calls getting logged? If you have a list of the top 10 most popular phone call reasons, then you could start with those. Sit down with someone who is currently answering phones, and ask them how they resolve issues for the most common call topics. That's what I've done in the past, and it went pretty smoothly. Of course, if there's been no trend tracking, it makes it difficult to retroactively gather that information.
