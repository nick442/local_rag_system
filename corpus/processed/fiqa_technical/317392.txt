"You get a fat pile of cash. The federal law prohibits the employer from asking certain kinds of questions^*. The way this is enforced is that if they do ask any of them, they have to pay a lot of money to the person they asked it from. This is not really done because the recipients of the money are deemed to deserve it, it's done to make asking such questions scary and potentially expensive. ^* Interesting aside, the law doesn't really prohibit discrimination in general, it prohibits discrimination against ""protected classes"" that are fully listed in statute. As such, discrimination against, fe. gay people is perfectly legal in most of the USA. Getting sexual orientation listed as a protected class is a major objective for the gay movement."
