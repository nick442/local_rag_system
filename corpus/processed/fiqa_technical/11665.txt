There is not a quantified set in stone amount of pain that must be endured for this situation to be resolved, and it is my belief that Germany stepping up and doing their part would help minimize the overall pain that must be endured, to say nothing of it being the right thing to do. Additionally, I do believe it will result in the greatest amount of economic growth overall.
