> Seriously, though, fuck Vegas. Never visited and never wanted to. I can't imagine why people want to live there. I can't fucking stand Vegas, but at least I've been there a few times and have enough experience to have a valid opinion. Have you considered going outside and experiencing the world around you instead of just parroting whatever opinions you read on the blogosphere? How do you even know Vegas exists if you've never been there? For all you know, it might be a big internet joke!
