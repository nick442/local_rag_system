Zero economic profits will occur once the the rest of the industry acquires the same technology. If, as you say, the other firms cannot acquire the new tech but the technology is transferable, the other firms will go out of business and new ones will eventually enter the market which use the new technology. Once enough firms reenter the market, increasing the aggregate supply to equilibrium, economic profits will be 0.
