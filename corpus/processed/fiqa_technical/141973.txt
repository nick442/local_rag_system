Couple of thoughts.. Opposition research is valuable to campaigns. They spend millions of dollars developing it. So it definitely has value. I don't believe it has to be cash or equivalents to be illegal. Foreign governments could just buy air time for candidates. It's the same thing. Don Jr may *not* have actually gotten anything of value. That is uncertain. No one knows what happened in the room. He *did* demonstrate an intent to get that thing, and collude in the process. We don't know, so that's why you investigate. It's entirely possible that Don Jr tried to collude, but failed. I also think there's reason for suspicion about the content of the meeting. First it was about adoption. Then it was something else (I can't remember the exact timeline of explanations). If it was innocuous, there would have been one unchanging story.
