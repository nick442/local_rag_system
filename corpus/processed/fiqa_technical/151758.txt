"PayPal offers a service called ""PayPal Business Payments"". Instead of charging a percentage, they charge a flat fee. For US-to-US payments, the fee is fifty cents per transaction. For Canada-to-Canada payments, the fee is five dollars per transaction. You need to use a third-party invoicing service and choose the ""PayPal Business Payments"" option. FreshBooks or Zoho Invoice might work."
