Is this for the US? Or does it apply here in the UK in a general sense? Obviously I think we are using different terms, but this is just a general run down of the different business types really right? I'm wondering if the use of a name thing matters here in the UK or not. I'm happy to trade under my actual name, but would prefer a name for the business that is separate to my own name.
