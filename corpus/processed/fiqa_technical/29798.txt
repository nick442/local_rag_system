Something tells me the people buying Tesla aren't doing it because they care about the environment.. It's more of a side effect. There's definitely a subset that do but everyone I know around DC who's on the list (and it's at least a few dozen) want the status symbol. Tesla is an icon at this point and if it was a $20k, 500mi range econobox, I guarantee none of these people would be buying despite how much better that would be as a car.
