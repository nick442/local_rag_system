>will probably know better than you when their current business model is about to fail I seriously doubt it. Industry leaders who have (semi) monopolies rarely see the new threats, when they do it's when they are being passed by. Microsoft, Nokia, and GM should have seen Apple/Google, Apple/Android, and Honda/Toyota, respectively. Fox came in the 80's and the big 3 networks laughed. They also ignored CNN and other cable networks, at first. The TV networks have been steadily moving to live, variety type shows that are cheap to produce and require real time watching. Japanese TV pioneered this format a decade before the US networks moved in on it. The epitome of this is morning TV 'news' programs (in Japan) that post newspapers and read from the articles and comment on them. It's got to be the cheapest production possible, but ratings are good enough so now all the Japanese networks do this (more or less). The broadcast networks will keep cutting production costs until they become the AM radio of TV. Cable networks will either become content producers or wither away, too. Internet distribution with its on demand and interactive capabilities will take over in the next 20 years. Costs will be shared between the audience being interactive with the commercials shown and advertisers. No commercials, pay full price; do surveys and click along as you watch, pay nothing.
