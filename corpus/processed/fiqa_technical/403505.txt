According to the New York Attorney General's Tenants' Rights Guide: Landlords, regardless of the number of units in the building, must treat the deposits as trust funds belonging to their tenants and they may not co-mingle deposits with their own money. Landlords of buildings with six or more apartments must put all security deposits in New York bank accounts earning interest at the prevailing rate. Each tenant must be informed in writing of the bankâ€™s name and address and the amount of the deposit. So you have to keep it separate, you can't spend it, and if you own more than six units, you have to put it in a bank account. (The guide goes on to explain that the interest should be paid to the tenant.)
