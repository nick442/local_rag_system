"Ahahahaha..you've contributed literally nothing in any of your comments, except of course for the comment about being too much of a coward to short the stock, and yet think that you're somehow making great points while pulling numbers out of your ass and making things up whole cloth. And you think your ""pretend to be macho"" comment is a ""debate."" How funny. And it has worked out *extremely* well, thanks. And comments from extremely stupid individuals like yourself just show me that there's still more upside possible, since there are apparently some people dumb enough still not to get it, so double thanks for that. It's interesting though that you consider me an Elon fanboy, though, when you're the one thinking about sexual acts with him. I'm interested in the company, which is thousands of people, not one person"
