What you've expressed is the heart of progressives and socialists, and why they so often lead to tyranny and totalitarianism. The minute you think people are stupid and need to be told what to do, you are corrupted. Why would you think *other* people are irrational and evil, but you are rational and good enough to see the error of their ways? This thinking only leads to tyranny and things like forced sterilization, institutionalization, and a vast police state. If a society is good, then minority Y won't be screwed for long. If society is evil (as you believe), then minority Y is screwed anyway. Legislation doesn't help, and frankly giving the government power to legislate morality is just going to end badly when the *wrong* government gets into power. Haven't you people learned from this Trump debacle? Why would you double down and give the government *more* power?
