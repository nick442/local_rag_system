Haven't been in Target, but Best Buy is kind of the opposite to the extreme. Walk into Best Buy and they'll jump on your back, ask you what you want, point to the most expensive product, and won't shut the hell up. I don't want to be manipulated. I just want honest truth. If you tell me the $2 stuff is the same as the $10 stuff or tell me of a work around, well you just earned my business. Good chance that when I want to buy a $200 item, I'm coming to you. Here in China, it seems like a lot of folks don't understand that :( Hell, even in the States a lot of people didn't understand that. They will lie their asses off for an instant 10% gain.
