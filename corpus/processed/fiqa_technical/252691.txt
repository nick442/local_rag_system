My point was that we have the safest debt for **right now**. I agree that we can still afford to spend money to fix the economy. The problem is that the spending we have been doing so far isn't doing a whole lot considering what we are investing. We have spent trillions and our GDP growth rate is two thirds what it was over the last 70 years. If we were still at the beginning of the recovery that could be acceptable. But it's been three and a half years now. We are going to need to start getting some bang for our buck to turn this around. If we are still doing the same thing two years from now, investors may not have faith in the safety of the United States anymore. They will realize we have taken on 30 years of deficits and then taken trillions more to save the economy. If we are still stagnant, the world will start to question how great our economy really is and whether we even deserve the world reserve currency. So yes I agree that we currently have the safest debt in the world and can try to save our economy through deficit spending. I did off on a tangent, but I think it was a necessary point. We need to make sure that the deficit spending we do from here on in actually creates real value for the economy and gets real GDP growth. The reason I am sick of the argument is that many people seem to have this idea that the U.S. will always have the reserve currency and the world will always consider it to be the safest debt. We can keep going this way for now, but if we don't back up that claim then sooner or later they won't buy it anymore. I agree with the government spending but we need to spend in areas that are going to generate real GDP growth rather than randomly building projects and hoping for the best. edit:so in other words, I think I agree with you. I just want to make sure people understand how perilous things can get in the future and we don't all buy into a sense of entitlement that we can spend whatever we want forever.
