Yep. I had been struggling for years with wearing out the elbows of my dress shirts. It turned out the real issue is I have long arms, which was causing the elbows to pull too tight. So now I order my shirts online, with an extra inch in the sleeves. It's a size I've never seen in a store, even though it's only an inch difference. Now my shirts last three times as long, and cost less.
