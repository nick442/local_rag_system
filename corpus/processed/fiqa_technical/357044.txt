> pay in your own country is probably better Totally untrue. Depends on your country, obviously, but I personally know several dozen H1Bs who wanted to stay here because they can make way, way more. Agreed that the system is busted and needs significant reform to bring in a lot more qualified workers. But our situation is very, very different from that of any European country, so you can't make a direct comparison.
