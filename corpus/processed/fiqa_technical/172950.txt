I know IT makes more than that, my point is that if higher skill jobs like IT are being outsourced for the sake of saving money, you can bet your ass that the lowly unskilled labor positions will be the first to go. as far as the human replacement by machine, I never said it's not going to eventually happen regardless. But a doubling of the minimum wage will make that eventuality become instant.
