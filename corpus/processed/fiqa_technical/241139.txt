Being a trades and manufacturing based economy didn't hurt us too badly on the innovation department for the last 100 years or so. We vastly generalize the value of a college education in this country, and people end up going for the sake of going because that's what they were told to do. If we moved away from that, we wouldn't lose any innovation really because the people who are going to innovate while tapping into a foundation of higher education are going to go that route anyway. We just wouldn't have a large portion of the population playing beer pong for 4 years at Western State A&M when they could be more productive elsewhere.
