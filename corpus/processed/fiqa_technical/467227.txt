From a tax perspective, it doesn't matter whether what you are doing is fraud, illegal, or perfectly legit. If you make money, the IRS will want you to pay taxes on it. Drug dealers, pimps, hobos, professional gamblers, extortionists, coupon collectors. The IRS doesn't care. They want their taxes. Now, where do you pay taxes? There are two likely options: I'm not a tax lawyer so I can't say which would be more correct. My expectation is that the IRS would be fine with either.
