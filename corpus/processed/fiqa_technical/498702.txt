China, the worlds leader of carbon emissions, is now going to be the leader of renewable energy? In the Paris accord China wouldn't have to cut their emissions in the near future. China wouldn't have to dish out billions of dollars to other poorer countries, like the U.S. would have to. Can someone please explain how making a better deal is a bad idea?
