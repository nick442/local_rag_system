Probably, but that would probably have been better for Blockbuster than to let it kill them. I think it depends on how you see the situation: was Blockbuster's demise inevitable, or was Netflix a special organisation that achieved things others couldn't? If Netflix is something special, then buying them would have given Blockbuster a few years of breathing room at least, and they might still be alive.
