That's 100% correct. There is a long anthropological legacy of Chiefs destroying wealth as a display of power. The famous example for us American folk is potlatch ceremonies where Cheifs burned of buicks (cars). It was used as a rationale for Congress/department of Indian Affairs to renege on signed treaties. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potlatch
