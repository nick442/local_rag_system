"You get to determine who gets help and who doesn't and how much. Even if you are a perfectly benevolent person and have never shown favor to one person over another because of how you felt or any other reason. That does not mean all of your co-workers are just as benevolent. I bet you know at least one ""questionable"" person related to your office. At least one ""favor"" for a friend or a co-workers friend."
