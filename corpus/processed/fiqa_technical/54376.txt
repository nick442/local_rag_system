The author could have done a much better job of explaining it. Maybe this will help: * Thanks to Hillary (and Bill) Clinton, it is hard as fuck for companies to get visa sponsorship and hire foreign workers * Because of this, foreigners have a much tougher time finding jobs - and employers can pay them less - BUT, they'll be loyal as hell to the company because job searches are so difficult * *BUT, in order to GET that visa sponsor privilege*, employers have to demonstrate that they can't find any talent in the US * Company posts job with super-high qualifications for laughable pay * (*Imagine..*) the only people that apply: the bottom of the barrel, underqualified people, and maybe one desperate candidate * Employer complains to the government that there's not talent in the US to fill their job * ..and gets allocation for their visa sponsorship **tl;dr** - the 'skill gap' is a slimy game
