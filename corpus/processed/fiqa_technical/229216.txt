The stock market is not the economy you dimwit. Also, it takes several months for economic policy decisions to take effect, as others have pointed out, so current economic situation is largely the effects of the previous administration. This doesn't mean Trump is doing a bad job, it's just too early to tell for the time being. So stop being a stupid cunt and sucking Trump's proverbial cock, the man doesn't even know you exist and he's not an emperor and you shouldn't act like a peasant grovelling to get his grace bestowed upon you, you fucking dirt farmer.
