>You can sound very intelligent by denoiuncing ideas that challenge the status quo, not do much when it is clear that the status is about to fall off of a cliff Except all those ideas, ending the Fed, going on a gold standard, are returns to *old ideas* that have already been shown to have significant problems. These are not challenging the status quo. These are ignoring well established knowledge and the pain it took mankind to understand *why* these ideas are worse for us than the current system.
