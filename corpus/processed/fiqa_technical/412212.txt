You have it in your head that regulation = good and deregulation = bad which is why I was trying to stress why it is situational. Regulating taxi industry was bad for consumers and taxi drivers. Deregulation through uber/lyft was shown to be good for the drivers and consumers. You should think in terms of outcome. We should regulate to encourage free market practices and deregulate to encourage free market practices. In this case, it would be prudent to regulate Idaho to make sure employers cannot force noncompetes so that free market reigns. In New York its prudent to deregulate the taxi industry so there is no artificial constraints on supply. Regulation and deregulation are neither good nor bad. Whether they constrict the free market or not is what makes them good or bad.
