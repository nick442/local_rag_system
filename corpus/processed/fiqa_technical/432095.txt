"I wish you were right, but sadly, ""we the data"" have pretty much *no* ability to have any effect on Equifax; **That's** the real ""fuck you"" of this whole situation, *we* had zero choice in whether or not they tracked our data. Now, more to your point.. Can we *maybe* get the *actual* customers (banks, loan brokers, etc) to favor TransUnion over Equifax? *Maybe*. But you're missing the point entirely if you go that route. The problem here isn't Equifax. The problem here is that Equifax (and Experian, and Transunion, and LexisNexis, etc) is *allowed to exist* under US law in the first place. Don't lobby your bank, lobby your **senator**. They won't actually *care*, since Equifax pays them more than you do, but that's at least nominally ""more effective"" if we want to play pretend that our elected officials actually care what we think."
