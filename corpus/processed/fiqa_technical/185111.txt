I don't have a problem with Wal-Mart, except in certain situations. They just got caught bribing Mexicans despite advice from their American counsel. That is extremely illegal and goes pretty high up in the corporate office. I was just pointing out there's a big ass denominator, so it's a bit difficult to interpret any raw statistics about Wal-mart without taking that into context. The article linked does this without remorse regarding Wal-Mart employees on Medicaid.
