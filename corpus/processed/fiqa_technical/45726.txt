I've pulled back in recent weeks from Amazon purchases and prime, in looking at the big picture I've come to realize I can't support a single conglomerate when it comes to retail, price isn't that important to me, I want to see real people, interact with real people and believe my purchases help them make a wage for what ever purpose they need that money for. Amazon is a monopoly in my view and I can't any longer support monopolies.
