I don't have a smartphone, so when I was in San Francisco, I used a cab driver. He was really friendly, took me to where I needed to go and I called him back the next day to take me to the airport. He said that he was going to protest at the state capital against Uber with some of this fellow drivers. He said that they didn't require any sort of driving tests or insurance, and that made them extremely unsafe and unfair. I'm all for disruptive business models, but I'm really unsure what separates these people from traditional taxi companies other than having a cool app. They may live and die with regulations.
