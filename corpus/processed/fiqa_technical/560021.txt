I don't think you're stupid, evil, bad or anything like that. I'm sure in fact that you are an intelligent, nice person who only wants the best for everyone. I just think that you are in a willful mannor refusing to understand the difference between insurance and healthcare. It's not that you are incapable, it is that you simply refuse to do so. You are doing so to justify making the bad guy out of an industry whose goal is to make health-care accessible to as many people as possible by spreading out the cost of health-emergencies over time, which is mis-directed anger. I fully appreciate and understand that most health-care is payed for via insurance. However, this is entirely an artifact of business-tax deductions which make it cheaper for individuals to accept part of their compensation in the form of health insurance benefits. Health care and insurance aren't intrinsically inseparable, they are bound together in the US due to the tax code. So what you should be arguing for is the removal of business health-care tax deductions, and direct financial assistance for the poor. This would make insurance and healthcare a more competitive market, which would in turn drive costs down, and by giving the money directly to the impoverished more of the benefit would reach them, rather than creating some huge bureaucracy that it has to be filtered through first. But instead you are choosing to vilify a industry for not handing out free health-care, which is misguided at best.
