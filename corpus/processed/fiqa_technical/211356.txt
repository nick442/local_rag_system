"I just found out my financial advisors are not fiduciaries. they manage a very large fund and have a board of trustees. they have a 30-year track record of great results. I asked why would the wealth managers not be fiduciaries if they will only ever act in the best interest of the clients and was told ""I would assume because they don't have to be, the assets aren't theirs, they belong to the fund"" Should I run?"
