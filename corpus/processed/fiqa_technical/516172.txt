I was aware that sets are calibrated differently for show vs home use, but the Samsung looked just like my monitor. Apart from the lack of artifacts, the Samsung accurately showed subtle colour graduations without any visible boundaries whereas with other sets you could sometimes see the colour boundaries. And the skin tones blew me away too. Like I said I went in with no preferences outside of a Panasonic plasma and but it was no contest. Also I carried it out the store myself as it was one of the newer really thin models whereas with the plasma I would have have to get it delivered and set up as it weighed 3x what the Samsung weighed. Just go and do a side by side comparison.
