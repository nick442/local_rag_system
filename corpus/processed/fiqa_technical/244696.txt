"I work with a lot of C-suite executives from medium sized companies to large $4billion+ sized companies. I cannot imagine a single one of them ""opening mail"". Many that I know have an assistant go through their mail, toss or re-route anything that doesn't need the executives attention and then they create a bullet-point summary email that addresses anything the executive needs to know or take action on. Same goes for most executives I know with regards to their email. Many of them have a ""public"" email that is filtered by their assistant and a ""direct"" email that is used for internal use that goes direct to their phone/laptop."
