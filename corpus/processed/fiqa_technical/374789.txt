"It would depend on how you look at those three companies. Each has overwhelming market share in its core business (search, social, and online shopping). However, if you define them more broadly (like Google and Facebook as ""online advertisers"") they overlap. Also, some of their less-central business ventures overlap (e.g. Amazon and Google both sell cloud compute stuff, they all do Machine Learning)."
