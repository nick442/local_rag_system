Why is it the Ted Cruz young-republican creepers come in waving debt numbers like all of a sudden debt is not some kind of established financial instrument used by governments of all sizes? I said QoL and GDP. Congrats on your red shithole for having smaller arbitrary numbers on your Excel sheet. It won't matter much when most of your populace dies from being underinsured, undereducated, unhealthy obese smokers. But hey at least they're not confused by the bathroom signs right? ;-)
