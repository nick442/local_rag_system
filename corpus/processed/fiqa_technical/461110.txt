> Also, the link at the top isn't the same as the one at the bottom. You're right. The link at the bottom points to the actual article seen at Medium, first posted at Reddit, which does point to the original original at reddit. Both those posts were written by the same redditor u/tapesit who was just seen three days ago. Paging u/TapesIt -- is that you on Medium, or has some scoundrel absconded with your posts? (If so, we should probably ask the mods to remove this post and/or ban the Medium user @SoldOutSupplier)
