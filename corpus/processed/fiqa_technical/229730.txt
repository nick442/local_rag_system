"SOS is Secretary of State. SOS number is the number the Secretary of State office assigned to your entity. You can find it on the LLC application form that you submitted (assuming you kept the copy of your application returned to you), or by searching for your entity on the SOS site here (the first column, ""entity number"", is what you're looking for)."
