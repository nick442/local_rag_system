If you are assigned a US Social Security number, you can apply for credit while you are here. Making small purchases and paying them off will help with your length of credit history, which is a part of FICO, but inactivity will eventually lead to those accounts being closed. Additionally, many revolving credit companies will charge you annual fees to keep your accounts open, and will require you to maintain a US address, and most want a residential address, not a mail-drop or PO Box. TL;DR: you can do it, but it will likely require an investment of both in time and money that won't make it worth it. Footnote: If you plan on opening US banking or investment accounts, there are regulations that make it difficult for foreign nationals to maintain accounts due to IRS categorization of US Taxpayers vs Foreign Nationals. Unless you have a lot to invest or deposit, most firms won't want to bother with Foreign taxpayer certification (see w8ben).
