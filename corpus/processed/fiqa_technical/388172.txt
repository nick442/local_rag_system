With SurePay, the recipient has to register in order to receive funds. They will select where the money is deposited. If you are both the sender and the receiver, I don't know if the system will get confused or not - If it will work at all though, you'll ultimately need to enter the information for the receiving account. The point of sure pay is to avoid the receiving party needing to give the sender their account information. The banking system still gets the account information explicitly from both sides. EDIT: This post also provides relevant and more detailed information: How does Wells Fargo use my phone number to find my Bank of America account?
