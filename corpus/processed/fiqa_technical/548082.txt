">'Consent' is socially created No it isn't. I don't care what society you are in. If a girl says no to sex, and it is forced upon her, it is rape. I don't care what society says, that is rape. There actually are preventions from leaving the state, I have to pay to get a passport. The state actually has to accept my passport. Another place in the world that I actually want to go to has to accept me, etc. I can't just go willy nilly wherever I see fit. And you can't walk into my house and set up camp because it is my private property. There are such things as natural rights not given by society or government. It is what makes it immoral for me to shoot you. Unless you think that is up to society to. I can't just say, ""I don't consent to you living"" and shoot you. You have the natural right to life. However, if you want to play this game then fine. You are born into a state that teaches you the way that ""society works."" Here are the only laws: On your 18th birthday, everyone in society votes on whether we should kill you or not. It's fair because it is determine by democratic majority If you want to leave the country because you don't consent, you can only do so if you leave the day after your 18th birthday. Oh that stinks. I guess you have to stay here and take it. Besides, it isn't like you would want to go to the other states anyway. All of the other states take their votes earlier. So as it looks, this is your best option, doesn't make it moral. I don't want to leave the US, I think it is the closest place in the world to what I believe in. However, just because society deems it as moral/ethical means that it is. That is a whole new level of mental reification my friend"
