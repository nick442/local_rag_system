You can’t say low buildings are popular if constructing tall ones is illegal, it doesn’t make sense. Unless you’re a civil engineer, you’re not qualified to speak on whether or not it would be a good idea to build taller buildings in NZ. If supply is artificially restricted, prices will rise. That’s econ 101. It’s the same reason prices are out of control in San Francisco.
