"I was thinking the same thing, which is why they were for January, but I got nervous. I bought them for 1.20 (strike price of 15) and sold them for 2.35. I know it isn't sound financially, but I have a separate account for wallstreetbets style gambling apart from my ""main"" investment account, and I treat them very differently. I also won't dip into my main investment account to pay off my ""gambling"" account, so that SNAP position actually took up a majority of that smaller account, which is why I got nervous. (On the other hand, if I made the same investments in my real account that I have in my gambling account, I'd be well on my way to a million right now, the gambling account is up 300% in the past 2 years, ""real"" account is up like 25%)"
