First thing that popped into my head was tanning salons. You can be a member at differing levels of service (for different qualities of tanning beds) and you can also pay a one-time fee at an inflated price. Basically, for the price of three (services) you could have unlimited access (to beds of the same type) by paying up front for a month. All memberships in this arena come with pages of legal contract to sign, so having training in place for the documentation of this is important. Enrolling individuals during peak business hours can be labor intensive, so prices insentivize individuals to 1) return hassle-free for more services and 2) pay all at once for said services.
