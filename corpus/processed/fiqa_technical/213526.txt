"The way I read that is that he's arguing for further tax cuts for corporations. He is a huge shareholder and would be paid in options or shares. If a big corporate tax cut happens, profits go up, the share price goes up and thus an incredable amount of money goes directly into his own pocket. You can read his motives by the statement ""driving capital earnings overseas"". That is code for foreign countries like Ireland winning because their corporate taxes are lower."
