"> no one knows because a QE program of this size has never ever been unwound. The Japanese know. Admittedly, they're not the Fed, but they're targeted to compose ~8% of the SDR through 2020 (down by way over half from their pre ""lost decade""s). The Japanese ended up with their central bank directly participating in the stock market. When central banks are the arbiter of market efficiency, you end up with distortions, a la Kobe Steel. Good luck with that, America."
