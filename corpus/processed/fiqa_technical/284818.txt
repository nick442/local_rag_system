You sound like you're in enviable shape. This is good. Look for deals. There are tons of people in over their heads (unlike yourself) and they'll be foreclosed on if they don't get out. You're in a position to buy from a distressed seller. Assuming your credit rating is good, you can get a good loan for the balance. Time is on your side. Don't rush. Look for a great deal. My feeling is that the deals will only get better for the next year or two.
