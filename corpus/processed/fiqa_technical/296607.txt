To add to @bstpierre's answer, you should automate all your loans except for the one with the highest interest rate. Leave that one manual, and pay the most you can afford each month, to pay it off as quickly as possible. Once you finish that loan, move to the next highest interest rate. Ultimately, this won't be quite as convenient as just having 1 loan. The differences are: You need to set up all the automatic payments. This is probably comparable to in complexity of consolidating your loans. Each time you finish one loan, you need to turn off an automatic payment, and start doing the next loan manually. If you organize yourself well initially, you'll know exactly what order to do the loans in, so this shouldn't take too long. However, unless your consolidated loan has the same interest rate of your cheapest current loan, you will likely save money over-all by using this method.
