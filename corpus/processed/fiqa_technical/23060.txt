"Trump called it ""controls"" rather than owns. He is firmly remaining as the CEO and is the largest shareholder so that's a moot point. That is still $85 billion in shares. If Trump wipes off only 10% in stock price with his constant threats of taxes and breaking up a monopoly, that would cost Bezos $8.5 billion. If Trump does break up Amazon then Bezos may lose much more. Trump explained to Fox News, ""This is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos who controls Amazon. Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed,"" Trump said. Trump added that he read somewhere that Bezos was worried Trump would go after him for anti-trust violations."
