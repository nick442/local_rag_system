I would like to know what others think, but for now it looks like the market thinks they'll be able to compete in online content distribution, not solely hardware. The stock was priced at the upper end of its valuation range and it still went way up today. I myself am skeptical about their long-term profit potential given how much disruption is going to hit the streaming market over the next five years. Tough to know with high probability who the winners will be at this point other than probably Netflix and Amazon.
