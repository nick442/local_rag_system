"So are you only sexist once you do something about it? If you looked at a black applicant and thought the word ""nigger"" are you not racist just because you didn't say it and still hires him? And this isn't me trying to be thought police, or a SJW (despite a few accusations of that in this thread). But if you automatically assume that a woman will behave a certain way, just because she's a woman, how are you not sexist? Hiring her doesn't change that. But again, I find it odd that people state beliefs that are objectively discriminatory but shy away from admitting that they happen to be prejudiced. If you truly feel that men are better workers, less prone to gossip and drama then don't say ""I'm not sexist, but.."". Say ""I'm sexist, and this is why""."
