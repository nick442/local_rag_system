Yup, people pretend like it is some huge conspiracy but gasoline won because the alternatives just weren't as safe/convenient/clean (in ways that people can immediately notice). Even now, electric cars have the same issue, the range and convenience just aren't there yet. Safety seems to be OK, but that might just be because there aren't a lot of them, yet (I honestly don't know).
