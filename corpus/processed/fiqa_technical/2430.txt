I love how our society has spent the last few decades removing risk from everything. It starts by not allowing kids to play during recess, everyone is a winner! Now we have a lot of people who are coming of age with this up-bringing and they simply can't understand how their own actions and work can cause them harm. People assume that risk isn't something they have to be concerned with. When I was shopping for homes they wanted to approved me for $350K. Even if I spent money on nothing else I wouldn't be able to afford that. One minor bill and I'd be fucked. The stock market is the same thing. People make big investments and when they go bad we need to bail them out because it wasn't their fault..really? They didn't play a part in their own going under? I simply don't buy it. We need to stop allowing this behavior and let companies and people go under. It's not my problem that you have no self control and don't understand the basics of trial and error. People need to learn their actions have consequences and maybe we'd live in a slightly better world.
