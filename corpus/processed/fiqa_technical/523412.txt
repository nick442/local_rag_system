Doesn't work like that. You're taxed on the lower band until 32ish and the balance is at 40%. Use this link below to calc your tax http://services.deloitte.ie/tc/ 30k = 25,310 after tax // effective rate of 15.5% 40k = 31,170 after tax // effective rate of 22% So you're gross raise of 33% will be worth 23% net to you. You also have tax credits/USC/PRSI to think about - you seem like you haven't a breeze about the Irish tax system so I'd type PAYE & Citizens Information into Google and start reading up on it.
