I feel like as millennials rise and become the next round of CEOs they'll already have more core knowledge than what a current traditional CEO has around concepts of technology. To me this is just the natural evolution of the CEO. As far as current CEO's, ya great learn some tech stuff, however it won't really skyrocket them in my opinion (don't get me wrong, if you're CEO of Apple or Google, I'm going to guess you know some tech stuff). However for non-tech industries, if current CEO's want to learn more about tech I think that's great but, most of them still won't get it, they'll just say the normal buzzwords and enough to get by. Then a CTO/CIO will step up. Also one risk here is, you get a CEO who wants to learn tech or gets a wild hair and then they think they know everything and then the backsliding begins, I actually worked at a company that went this direction because a CEO learned about a new product that would replace our backend processing software and wanted everyone to start converting to it, then the CIO had to come in and take reins.
