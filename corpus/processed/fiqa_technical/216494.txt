Exactly. A fundamental principle of economics is that purchases are only so valuable, and when the price increases beyond that value, they are no longer needed. If someone has calculated that these people will costs millions, while only returning thousands, there is clearly no point in hiring them. It is exactly like considering private jet in the millions, when thousands of dollars of commercial airfare would do. There is no real reason to own the jet either. It is still fun to dream about owning a private jet. You might remark about buying one if they were cheaper. But, realistically, it is not needed given the costs. It is also fun to dream about growing your business, and tell others that you would grow your business with cheaper people, but it's not needed given the costs.
