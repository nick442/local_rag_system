Drop shipping is the term your looking for. Stay away from anything overseas, drop-shipping from anywhere other than where your primary market is located can be a nightmare. Research the company your going to use pretty heavily. Try to talk with someone on the phone and ask them questions. Ask them about pricing, billing terms, shipping procedures, returns/exchanges and things of that sort. Remember, even if your not physically handling the merchandise you are still responsible for the business. It doesn't need to be complicated but it does need to done responsibly. It is a business after all!
