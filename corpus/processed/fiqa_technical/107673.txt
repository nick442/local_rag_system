> The main purpose of a corporation is to increase shareholders' wealth. Neither the workers, nor the CEO deserve anything from the profits, their pay has already been deducted as an expense. This is the modern interpretation, yes. It is NOT the correct interpretation. It used to be that the purpose of a corporation was to CREATE something - a product, a service..The profits were merely an incentive and a method to *continue* to create something. It is when that definition got corrupted that this whole mess started snowballing. Shareholders were supposed to be supporters of this creation - who were then rewarded for risking their money by having it repaid with a 'bonus' percentage of the profits. Now that everything is ONLY 'for the profit' only, the creators (not the idea person - the actual, physical *creators* of the product or service) that started the whole thing in the first place are getting screwed. And, yes, they DO deserve some of the fruits of *their own* darn work. Again, I reiterate: attitudes like that are why the economy is in the crapper. When you put profit before all else and run around screaming 'Mine! Mine! Mine!' about them, then you are engaging in the slash-and-burn policies that are the cause of the whole mess.
