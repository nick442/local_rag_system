Not really, but it's not hard though. If you have a gmail account though, go to the top where it says 'more', click it, then go down the pop-down list and click Reader. I think they give you instructions right there. Once you're set up you'll have notifications for new articles on all the sites you want to keep track of (assuming they do RSS, which most do). It's really handy.
