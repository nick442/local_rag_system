I disagree and see it all the time. Here's one example: people who grow up in towns where business has died off and don't move because it's all they have ever known. Sure there are legit reasons to hang around (family obligations, etc.) and not leave, but many just don't take the initiative to go where they can earn. People did it all the time before the New Deal but afterwards are more content to draw off the government and stay poor.
