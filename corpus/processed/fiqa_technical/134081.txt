You're missing the point. Moral agency is still a factor in everything above. When the state imposes taxes on you directly and indirectly you rob the individual of making the choice to be charitable. Think of it in terms of contract law. You cannot enforce a contract that was agreed to under threat of violence. Similarly, no Christian will ever say you're going to heaven because you were forced to act according to scripture in every detail at the point of a gun. Therefore you cannot call a Christian a hypocrite for not supporting every government boondoggle simply because it is labeled charitable. Nevermind the fact that it a is highly questioanble Obamacare will ever fulfill any of its promises and that alone should be grounds for its repeal.
