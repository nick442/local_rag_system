I wager Amazon could do a better job fighting scrapers auto buying tickets like they do with Ticketmaster. Tho the one main game change I can see is Amazon being able to handle massive loads of traffic on their site. As Ticketmaster has loads of problems here, but Amazon yet to show any real issues in handling loads of traffic all at once. So imagine able to get tickets without issues.
