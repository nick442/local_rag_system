Why doesn't the paper industry step up and take on the printer industry's exorbitant ink prices? Blank paper is most useful for printing on, but if that's too expensive, then that's less paper used. The post office could offer an e-mail-to-delivered-print option, especially for people with (esp. elderly) customers that don't have internet (ie, you e-mail the USPS, they print and deliver the bills/records, just like I believe they already have a similar thing for advertisers). Paper isn't dead, but the best thing the paper industry can do is push for paper where it makes sense, push for a hybrid of tech and paper where that's better, and not try to shove paper down anyone's throat.
