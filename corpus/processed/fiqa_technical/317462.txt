Chicago has several neighborhoods going through that same gentrification cycle. There are several more city neighborhoods that will probably see that kind of rebuilding before Gary, many of which you pass through traveling between downtown and Gary. Transit between Chicago and Gary exists, but it's not as good as transit to other suburbs because of the lack of cooperation between Illinois and Indiana.
