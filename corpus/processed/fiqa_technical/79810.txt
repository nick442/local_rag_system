I love progress. What I don't love is man's greed and quest for power. The powerful NEVER willingly give up power without a fight. This time around the automation revolution will not be the same as previous tech revolutions. It will permanently displace jobs with NO jobs created to place the vast number of jobs lost. So it's either a universal basic income or a revolution. I predict the latter as the greed of man will never leave until beaten out of them.
