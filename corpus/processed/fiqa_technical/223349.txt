No it's really not, I have no illusions that private school is any better than the public schools around here. The problems with them differ, but one is no better than the other. Our education system in Florida is broken, the voucher system they instituted created broken schools and soon to be bankrupt private schools. Every state that's done so has or soon will have the same problems. Even states that aren't screwing their public schools with vouchers, are screwing them with poor funding at every level. Shits broke, and getting more broke every year. Eventually it might get fixed, but I'm not going to play 'maybe' games with my kids. I'd rather move them to a country that isn't supporting the most expensive military on the planet.
