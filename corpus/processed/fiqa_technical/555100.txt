"Holy shit, man. I'm applying to graduate school for Organizational Psychology right now and that's the kind of thing I want to prevent. I like where your head's at, going with the hourly wages. The past four months I've had more work piled on me because my boss quit and I won't be seeing anything close to a raise for another 8 months because I was temporary for the first six months then was technically only ""hired"" in April, meaning I'm not eligible for a raise until my ""one-year"" which was *actually* this month. Fucked up things like that are happening all over the country. At Microsoft, staffing agencies get paid $30/hr for their employees' work (who are working AT Microsoft but are staffing agency employees) and the employees see about 30% of that. The agency doesn't have to do anything but rake in the cash, it's absolute bullshit. I'm very happy that you were straight forward with your boss, because people need to hear that. UNFORTUNATELY, it's going to reflect poorly on you, and that's also fucked up. I have a coworker who spends half the day screwing around on various websites, but since he stays late, he's seen as more dedicated. It's ridiculous. God, I'm so proud of you. Sorry boss, *fuck you,* if you want 50 hours pay me for 50 hours. It's a business contract. You wouldn't sit there and watch a plumber unclog your toilet for 30 minutes then ask him to go unclog your shower too but not pay for that service, would you? Apparently some people would."
