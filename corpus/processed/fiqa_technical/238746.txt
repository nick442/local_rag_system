"The larger macro funds, the ones struggling in this environment, need there to be a""normal"" amount of volatility in the market to make money. They need price action to provide buy/sell points, and to help them spot trends. The one way market we have been in for a long time makes this difficult/impossible. And then when we get two days in a row like we just had, it can really fuck them up and will lead them to take positions of at the worst time. And the loses are larger because all the macro funds use leverage, so a dollar loss could really become $3-6. The index funds are winning right now, no doubt. But they will have thier day off reckoning too, we just don't know how that plays out..yet. everyone put active mutual funds in the trash two years ago, and they are having the best year they have had in ages. It's all very cyclical. (Sorry for one paragraph, I'm on mobile.)"
