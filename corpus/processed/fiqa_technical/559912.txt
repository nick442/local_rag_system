Well basically a lot of dot-com companies that had no real plans for having actual profit's, self-destructed. I had worked for a company called VarsityOnline.com which was depending on endless money from investor's, and had never really made any kind of profit, for which it had ample opportunity. People lost sight of reality, that just because it wasn't a real brick and mortar store, that common sense, good service and good products didn't matter. We were so clueless back then.
