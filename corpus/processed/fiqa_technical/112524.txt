I'm suspect of the claim too, but my university let me take 25-30 hours+ after I threw a stink. Since I didn't take summer classes and the engineering workload was immense, I have no interest in doing a 5-year degree. It was/is a credible university. That being said, some people are more unlucky than others, but many don't take advantage of their luck. There's a reason foreigners often compromise a lion's share of the new millionaires in this country and dominant in education despite the fact they often have depressed economic situations. Yes, yes, model minority blah blah blah. THAT being said, everybody gets help from somebody at some point in their life, even if it's parents or a friend. Very, very few people get *no help ever*.
