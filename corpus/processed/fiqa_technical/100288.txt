Well, this is their last attempt to fix it anyway, so it better be good. Because you better believe Democrats will pass universal healthcare without so much as a look across the isle for input and there's no taking back that from people. Isn't it curious that Obamacare started sucking right around the time when GOP started defunding it and all the uncertainty of the markets made insurance companies leave? Let's not kid ourselves, this tax cut bill is not really healthcare reform. But like I said, it's for the best.
