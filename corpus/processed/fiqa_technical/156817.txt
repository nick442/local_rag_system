ACA has market stabilizing mechanisms like cost-sharing reduction subsidies. Republicans have been blocking that in recently, causing many insurance companies to pull out of some states. I imagine repeal will just be a continuation of that until there is less competition and insurance companies make higher margins to offset the risk of unprofitable quarters. So maybe they make more money because of higher margins or maybe they don't because they lose subsidies.
