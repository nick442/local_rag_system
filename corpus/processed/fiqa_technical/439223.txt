I used to get the same shit working in telesales. Unlike my comrades, my team leader or the office manager I knew our product from the wheels up which means when I bumped in to a customer who knew their stuff we would talk properly. One particular call a guy made it quite clear he didn't want anything early on so I asked him what he was using and it was an unbelievably obscure model with an even more obscure fork attachment so knowing the details I made a flippant comment about the wheelbase and the turning circle and he responded which lead to a LONG drawn out conversation. I eventually arranged a meeting with one of our sales reps which lead to a sale all because we talked properly. Nobody there could have nailed the call like I did but what thanks did I get? My first strike because of the length of the call :)
