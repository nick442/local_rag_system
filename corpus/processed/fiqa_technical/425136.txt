Trump keeps pretending taxes are a problem for corporations, but he has never paid any. In fact he said that NOT PAYING taxes makes him smart. So this idea that the US is the most taxed country in the world holds no basis in fact. Guys like him have methods tp dodge taxes. To create further tax cuts, is irresponsible when he already hardly pays any. Who will pay for the armed forces? Trump voters, because it wont be Trump or his cronies. This is the biggest highway robbery of his tenure. EDIT: Trump has recieved more handouts and tax breaks and debt credits for missmanagement than any businessman in history.
