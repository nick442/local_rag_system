I have come to the conclusion, taking into account the Mining aspect of Bitcoin, that it is the biggest coordinated brute force attempt to try and Decrpyt something. Yes . .I know, a hash cannot be reversed, thats what they said about MD5 and in the absence of true random, anything is possible. So they get everybody excited, woohoooo . .bitcoin is $4000 . . .get everybody to buy systems with 5/10/15 high end graphic cards. spend US $ 1500-2000 to make US $7-8 a day and all that processing power goes where? When the Hash for a piece of data will never change and always remain the same.
