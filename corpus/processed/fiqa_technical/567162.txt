As a lifelong boxing/mma fan I can tell you there is about a 0.000001% chance of that happening. This isn't a brawl that he's walking into, it is an extremely technical sport where gaps in skill are easily exploited. People want Mayweather to lose so badly that every time he is fighting people are saying they know this is going to be the one. I was convinced Canelo was gonna beat him but here we are today. There is no way Mayweather is going to lose to by far the worst boxer he has faced in his career. McGregor has nothing Floyd has ever seen and this whole fight is just a massive cash grab and an easy way to get a record of 50-0. Please don't pay to watch this fight.
