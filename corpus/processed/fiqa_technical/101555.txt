"The government program to keep the unemployed from gaming the system that they mention isn't really what the article is about. Most of their complaints are about internships, apprenticeships, and unpaid overtime for salaried employees. The sectors that are most notorious for these sort of things are those that are often over-saturated with qualified candidates. I work in graphic design. The for-profit colleges in the US churn out graphic design graduates is disgustingly high numbers. It's an easy program to sign people up for because is sounds fun. ""Art is fun, computers are fun. Make it a career!"" However there really aren't that many graphic design positions available. Lots of unemployed or underemployed graphic designers means that more of them are willing to work for cheap or free to beef up their resumes. Cheap freelance options means companies are getting rid of in-house designers. Those of us that are left can no longer earn what we're worth but to keep doing what we love we have to suck it up and work the long unpaid hours for less pay. similar things are taking place in a lot of sought after professions like finance, law, advertising, public relations, government, and various non-profits. It's not terribly ethical, but it's hard to blame employers for not paying interns then they're salivating for a chance to run coffee just to get a foot in the door. TL;DR: People want their long term career choice worse than they want to get paid immediately."
