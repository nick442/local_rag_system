oh those darned hippy liberal economists! LOL great reporting fox! (/s) i know this because i've read you're other articles, and those were [shitty] propaganda as well, so because of that, then this must be another attempt to brainwash in your quest to supply misinformation through another one of your asymmetric propaganda statistics. (am i doing it right?) after fox read the first chapter of their macro 101 textbook, *Basics: Supply & Demand* ; they've come to the conclusion, that with little to no regard to the labour market, the primary indicator (and only) for the wage increase was due to deporting [illegal] immigrants. im just curious what the financial standing will be of some of these companies and if they will be able to afford such a substantial increase in wages? effects on R&D? how will productivity be affected when we see a shift from workers who are fighting for their family's lives, sending money back home, to less competition for workers with a falsified sense of job security? what if the economy is just in a boom? some questions i'll leave you with, would love to hear the other side and start a discussion on this topic!
