America is a big place, you have areas that purchase certain things heavily and other areas that will not. Living in the north eastern and south eastern part of the US, I can not say they are dominant at all in the market, as dominant would imply their brand is available at a majority of stores at various price points (I.e. Farm fresh, food lion, Harris teeter, Kroger, wegmans, piggly wiggly, Trader Joe's) sorry if this didn't help.
