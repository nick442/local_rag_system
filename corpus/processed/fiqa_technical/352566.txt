I think it's a bit dependent upon the individual locations. The ones near where I live, for example, are absolutely atrocious, with some being obscenely greasy or salty, others having little more than mush. The one near where I work, however, is pretty decent, and the burgers usually aren't disgustingly greasy and the fries aren't over-salted. It's the exact opposite for Burger King, though: The one near where I work is so bad I've simply stopped going there, but the one near where I live is pretty decent (the salads, especially, are a key issue for me: near where I work, most of the lettuce is wilted, but near where I live, it's usually crisp).
