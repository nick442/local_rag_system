Your logo and slogan mean very little at this point. Don't waste too much time on them. Have him spend his downtime going door-to-door. He should introduce himself as a new plumber in the area, and hand them a $100 coupon for free plumbing work, good once per household, for one call, not including parts. Most plumbing bills are well over a hundred bucks, so he'll still make money on the call, and I'm willing to bet that people will tell their friends about the plumber that's offering a hundred bucks in free labor, partially because most people naturally feel indebted when they get something for free. Not only that, but one of peoples' biggest fears in calling a plumber is the bill -- getting $100 knocked right off the top is a great way to get past that psychological barrier. If he does good work, that leads to recommendations. I'd avoid offering referral bonuses -- you want people referring him because he's Jesus with a wrench, not because they get a Starbucks gift card. That said, make sure he follows up with clients a few weeks to a month after doing work for them, and checks in to make sure they are still satisfied. Happy clients are clients that refer you to other people. He can also give those coupons to gardeners, maids, or other people that do in-house work. Those people want the referral bonus -- figure out a sensible fee structure. Alternatively, he can offer to refer them to his clients when they need gardening and so on. Register on Google Maps, Yelp, etc. Plumbing is location-based, so going too broad on the 'net side of things won't help hugely at this stage. See if your local hardware stores, supermarkets, and so on will let him put fliers or business cards next to the Drano and toilet parts.
