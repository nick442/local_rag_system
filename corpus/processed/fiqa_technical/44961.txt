I don't know if I ever plan to retire, and I am fine with that. However, I would like to be financially secure enough to be able to do enjoyable part-time work or freelance work instead of having to worry about maintaining a career into my golden years. I just want to keep working to keep my mind and body sharp and not be isolated from society.
