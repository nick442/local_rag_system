I wouldn't say that this is specific to student loans. I think nowadays debt is just becoming a bigger and bigger thing. Partially due to the increasing wage gap, as the standard of life moves up way faster than wages move up, debt becomes necessary. Also debt is a very appealing thanks to the interest rates people will pay, so more banks want to give them out, and more people want to take them to be able to go to good schools, own a nice house, etc. We've gone from a generation that expected to be able to earn and save up for everything within a reasonable time to one that normalizes debt as something that everybody just gets into to have a normal standard of life.
