You know what scares the shit out of giant militaries? A single person with some code or a goat herder with an improvised bomb. Do you know what keeps individuals safe? A well armed population that is capable and willing to defend themselves and their neighbours. Instead of a government that works hard to make it illegal to defend yourself.
