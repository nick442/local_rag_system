You guys seem to have forgotten the most important part of this equation .. i work for a bank and I can tell u this as a painful fact .. every business is governed by its paperwork .. articles bylaws operating agreements amendments and minutes . if a companys paperwork says that the 51% owner can fire everyone and move to Alaska and that paperwork is proper (signed and binding) it is with minimal excavation law.. case in point every company is different . and it is formed and governed by its paperwork.
