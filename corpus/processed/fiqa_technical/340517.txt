Look for communities such as Indians (folks from India). And this may be true about others as well, but if one guy hires you and you do a decent job, just a matter of time, before your calendar will be loaded with requests from others in the community. How to reach out to them? As for indians, ask a local hindu temple about sponsorships, quite affordable many a times. Also take a couple of boxes of indian sweets and distribute them around if you happen to go to the temple. Could yield sweet results. All the best. ~~~~~~ EDIT : Edited for clarity
