I appreciate the reminder of demographic issues, but the argument is weak. There are structural issues like low wages, increasingly part time jobs, student debt, automation, Boomer asset selloffs/deleveraging, and energy headwinds. Houses are not sold just because a large cohort shows up. It's when they have the money. And the last crash dug so deeply that we are poised for another recession sparked by shale peaking within 2 years, just when we climbed out of the hole.
