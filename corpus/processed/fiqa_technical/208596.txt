>The idea of self-regulating free markets is every bit of a naive utopian idea as anything Karl Marx ever wrote. Right because the idea that a government could be not-corrupt isn't naive OR utopian. >People who wish to limit the government have the best interests of corporations at heart. Because corporations don't already own & control the government? >There will always be corruption in government, just as there will never be truly free markets. So get rid of government, and watch how much freer markets become. >Things are broken right now because the American people have lost faith in our government. Or perhaps things are broken because the concept of government is flawed and inherently broken.
