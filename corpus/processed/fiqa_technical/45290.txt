Outside of Boston is closer to the city center than where they would put a campus in most of the other cities. Where would they go that they would be closer to the city center than if they were in Peabody or reading or even Billerica? Those towns are only a 20mile drive to the city center and there is a train into the city from there that would take 40 minutes. People get hung up on what people call the city. But Boston's metropolitan area is just a bunch of areas that are different towns rather than burrows.
