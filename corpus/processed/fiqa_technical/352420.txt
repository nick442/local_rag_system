If your skills are at the level of a McDonald's cashier than you should be compensated for that. You should NOT be compensated for a lifestyle which you WANT. Having a kids and a wife is a choice, no one is putting a gun to your head. If your skills are at the minimum(which is 2% in the USA) than you should not be supporting a family, it's simple. The kid with a father/mother at that level will have a terrible life, lazy parents who are not willing to work to better themselves.
