">However, businesses should make the most of new international opportunities, Prince Andrew said. What ""new"" international opportunities that are not already there? This I find so silly about those British brexitters, they seem to believe that the world is going to change once they leave the European Union and a whole new world of opportunities will open up for them. They do not seem to realize that all the benefits of being part of the EU will disappear and that this will cause life to get a whole lot more expensive for them. This whole brexit was fueled by racism and bigotry and will turn around to bite them in the ass."
