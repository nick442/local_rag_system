Those guys and ladies bust there asses 12 to 18 hours a day of never ending work from the time they were little kids you won't find to many people that work that hard . I should now I was one of them but never made it. All that work for nothing it's a big risk to dedicate all your time and effort. I should have became a doctor and a lawyer. It would have been easier and I would have something to show for it. The price of chasing your dreams.
