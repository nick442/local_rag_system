">Basically interest rates are near 0 and the banks are very risk adverse right now, so they sit on reserves instead of lending them out. There is a very significant reason (actually a couple) that the banks are ""sitting on reserves"": 1. The large banks have HUGE derivative exposure and HUGE potential losses (and anyone who denies that has apparently been hiding under a rock and missed the news of JPMorganChase) -- while the reserves held are not enough to cover ALL of those potential derivative losses (nor do they have to), the bankers are uncertain of what their REAL exposure is, and so they want to (and indeed are probably being told to) hold onto enough to prevent a catastrophic ""insolvency"" situation. 2. The Fed is paying interest on excess reserves (likewise, this is no secret). This serves a two-fold purpose of making the banks *appear* to be solvent (even in the face of potentially HUGE derivative exposure); and secondarily it is a way to ""gift"" the banks with money -- known as ""recapitalizing"" them. What Krugman is engaging in is simple misdirection. Now whether this is because he actually believes his own bullshit, or whether he is being intellectually dishonest.. is anyone's guess. (Hanlon's razor would tell us it is the former, rather than the latter; but that isn't really dispositive in a single case and is rather a general principle. Occam's razor doesn't tell us anything in regard to this, since either is a fairly simple and straight-forward explanation; and given the history of ""economists"" as being professional apologists & apparatchiks in service of the financial & government establishment, the latter is at least as likely as the former.)"
