Thats because I'm a tax accountant. I handle things on the tax side. There are other accountants that handle books and financials. I hear how they handle certain things, but I don't know specifics. I've been in meetings, but it doesn't spell out each and every detail. I've actually heard about that purchase. I think I read that on Reddit, but other than that, I have not heard of those cards.
