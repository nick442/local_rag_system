I wonder if Home Depot price drops are just a product of capital outflows from retail ETFs, as investors leave the sector en masse. I think Home Depot is defensible against online intrusion, at least for now. If Home Depot is taking a price hit because investors are conflating it with other obvious retail losers (Barnes and Noble, Target, etc) this might actually be a good time to buy.
