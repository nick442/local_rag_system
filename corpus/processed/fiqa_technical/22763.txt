"NO, IT ISN'T. You would give my economist friend an aneurysm with this article. If you remove yourself from the labor market why should you be counted as unemployed? That's like calculating the odds of the lottery by including those who stopped buying tickets because they lose too much. It's nonsense! It may be unfortunate that you've become discouraged and given up but by bowing out you are no longer technically ""unemployed"" by the official numbers."
