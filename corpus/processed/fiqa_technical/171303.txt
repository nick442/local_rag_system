"Actually, I'm less of a fan of the American tax and hyper-spend system than I am of Burger King. I'm MORE likely to go to Burger King based on this news. Dutifully paying your taxes without question is the most immoral activity you can engage in. I worked for/with the government for 20 years and the amount of waste and fraud is absolutely appalling. ""Close enough for government work"" is no longer a joke, it's become a disgusting mantra. Every government ""worker"" is defrauding you every day they go to work and do 5 minutes of actual work then spend the rest of the time surfing the web and socializing. It's sickening. Hurray for Burger King!"
