"Credit is a racket. What is a ""YouTube prank channel""? Because that sounds dumb. Not trying to be negative, it just sounds dumb. If you're thinking something like that TV show ""Jackass"" Aren't there like 1000 of those on Youtube now? I doubt any of them are making any real money. I bet you can think of something better to do than acting like a fool on camera. looking for an investor sounds like a sound plan but you need to have an idea first. The best advice I've heard is try to find a problem in the world that needs solving, and find a solution for it. If it's a good solution people will buy it. And then you've done something you can feel proud of."
