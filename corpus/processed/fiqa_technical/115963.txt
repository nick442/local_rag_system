Let’s try the more straightforward approach again: The current state of Economics doesn’t take into consideration the human condition. As you have done yourself, it refuses to even admit that the human condition should be a factor it considers. But when humans are in dire straights, we find their economic position is pitted directly against their human condition. Which of these two will win? Hint: Not the current economic system, unless it starts accounting for and being tolerant of the human condition. How could I possibly know that? Humans created the economic system. It is not an innate part of their condition, contrary to what many would suggest. When faced with two opposing forces, humans will ALMOST always destroy the weaker of the two, to end the conflict. Humans can not destroy the human condition. Feelings DO have an impact on the economy. Trust and loyalty, love and hate, all impact it. When we let the economy lead to suffering, we design its own downfall. If the economic system could, instead, be seen as ONLY a trade structure that backs off when other influences come to bear, it could survive. But the current Capitalist structure tries to place money above all else. So of course it is seeing problems.
