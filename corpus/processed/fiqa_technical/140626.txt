Read your post again and look at your own reflection. So much hatred, disdain, disgust for your fellow humans, who are just trying to get by and support their families. Do you really believe that people have no intrinsic value save for their ability to unquestioningly labor for the profits of others? You've built a wall between yourself and the rest of us, I hope for your sake and our sake that you find the courage to tear it down.
