I quit my job 8 years ago with a wife and a new baby to start an agency. We aimed to do client work to pay the bills, and meanwhile work on a portfolio of products which we could sell. We had around 5 years of extremely tough times, sometimes not enough money to buy food, and the revenue breathing down our necks. It was highly, highly stressful. The next 3 years were a little better, still stressful and a lot of hard knocks and lessons to learn. This last year has been wonderful. Creating a startup will teach you things you never realised you needed to learn. It will break you down and remake you. If you decide to go for it, make sure your wife is on board. Maintain an emergency fund, and don't eat into it. Save for tax, even if that means you can't eat. Don't expect to go on holiday for at least 5 years. Cut your expenses down to a shoestring. Get really good at finance. Practice envelope budgeting. Don't eat out. Work hard, talk to people, network. If you and your wife can get through the pain it will be worth it, but don't expect anything like an easy ride.
