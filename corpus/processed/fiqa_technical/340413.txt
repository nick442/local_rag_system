"I personally think the ACA will be left alone until it collapses. Nobody from either party wants their name associated with it or anything like it. Depending on the ""deal"" that you get (based off of income or provided by employer) the ACA collapsing will be a great thing or an awful thing. Regardless of how you feel, its financially unsustainable. From an NYTimes article from June 9th, 2017: > For the First Time, 45 Counties Could Have > No Insurer in the Obamacare Marketplaces also > 1,388 counties with one insurer https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/09/us/counties-with-one-or-no-obamacare-insurer.html In addition to all of this I also think that the whole thing was a ploy to boil everything down to a 'single' insurer and therefore have single payer insurance by default. Before you downvote me for serving up a Failure Burger (ACA) wrapped in Failure (GOP not acting on it) please respond with an argument as to why this is financially sustainable. I get that it helps poor people and *""wont somebody think of the children""* but this timeless ploy of feigning consideration for the old and infirm is about to have the whole country careening off into the great unknown. Also, shame on Obama for passing this to begin with and shame on Obama for being at war *every single day of his two terms*."
