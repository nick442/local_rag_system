Wow. Must have been too close to the truth? Lawl. Sorry to tell you, it isn't globalism. It is your low cognitive ability that's the root cause for your crappy situation in life. You say this. >They are not both collectively called America. And change topic back to. Once I prove that American refers to both continents. >.. Yeah, the United States of America are colloquially known as America. Pathetic >Venezuela is 18th on that list. It is still below India. Quote: Except, I've never brought up Venezuela. We were discussing Argentina. Lol. you are thick even for trumpet standards. Also, if their tariff burden is high and economy is shit, then it only proves my point. >there's protectionist countries that are doing just fine >Russia, America, Canada, China. **also, still no proof that those countries protectionist.** As for Russia, Still LAWL. you think their economy is good. What a trumptard tariff low as 1-3% and thick trumpers calling them protectionism. LOLOL. No wonder you keep changing topic and desperately want to talk about anything but. Your cognitive dissonance is too deep that you cant even face main topics. Keep Running!
