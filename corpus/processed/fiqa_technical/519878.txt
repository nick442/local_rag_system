What the fuck are you talking about. How does religion personally insult you on a daily basis? Do they insult you by serving you free food because you're homeless? Do they insult you by running orginizations that pay for peoples gas or electric bills in the winter seasons so they don't freeze to death? Seriously people, what the fuck are you doing in your daily life? You're doing fucking nothing with it and you're just on reddit all day making shit up to bitch about, right? I work at a Catholic run non-for profit hospital which treats many children for free even from money we make at fundraising events. Is that so fucking terrible? That children are living because of money this hospital makes through the help of the archdiocese in my city? Know what's funny? I can manage to be agnostic and not be a judgmental prick just because someone is christian, as long as they don't take it in their own right to attack my own beliefs or try and push their beliefs on me (which has never happened to me in my entire 21 fucking years).
