"I am not referring to grafting.. grafting does not even modify genes in any way, all it does is make a single-use plant that has two different fruits growing on it. I am referring to human-guided pollination and human-guided hybridization to encourage selective traits, something that botanists and farmers have been doing for thousands of years, long before genes were even known to exist. Every single apple commercially sold is a result of human-guided evolution, there are no ""virgin varieties"" anymore and haven't been for hundreds of years. The same is true of bananas and cotton and many other cash crops. The difference between human-guided evolution thousands of years ago is not safety - any single plant hybrid created by traditional means could just as easily be the ""apocalypse crop"" as one created with modern gene manipulation methods. In fact, modern gene manipulation methods are FAR SAFER as one can computer model the expected outcome of what is going to happen, instead of simply crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. And part of participating in organic food production is a discontinuation of petrochemical fertilizer. Yes, we use vast amounts of petroleum product to fertilize farmland. If you want to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, organic production is part of that. Actually studies show that the incredibly reduced yields and efficiencies resulting from organic farming INCREASE the carbon footprint of organic crops, and that organic is actually the most environmentally un-friendly way to farm.. so you're dead wrong. http://appliedmythology.blogspot.ca/2013/04/six-reasons-organic-is-not-most.html"
