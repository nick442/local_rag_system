">I tried to like /r/Anarchism, but the mentality portrayed there is that of a statist who is pissed that they aren't the dictator, and are willing to use violence and theft to achieve their goals. Try asking /r/DebateACommunist, then. Despite the name, almost nobody there is any kind of statist. Everyone's either anarchist left or proprietarian right. But of course, this is the ultimate in neofeudal ""anarcho""-capitalist claptrap. ""Anarchists? THOSE STATISTS!"""
