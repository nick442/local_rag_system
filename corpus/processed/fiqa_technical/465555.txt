I'm from Canada, so your going to have to take that into account when reading this, as things are done a little differently here. I wouldn't go the accounting route, as it's going to require more education on top of this. Id there is a program that focuses more on the management of finances that would be ideal. There are many mid to entry level positions that deal with the flow of cash throughout the company. From there you work your ass off and see where it can get you. Sometimes they go as far as hiring someone with no experience, but a certificate and a some educational knowledge will go a long ways in helping you. You probably could, if you went to the right sources, gain similar knowledge by learning things yourself. But it won't look nearly as appealing to potential employers. Hope this helps. Also, it blows my mind, the difference in cost of tuition. I spent 12k over 3 years(just finished). Those kids in Montreal have no idea how good they have it.
