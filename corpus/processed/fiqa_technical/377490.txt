If this happens, the solution isn't to force people to use sidewalks. It's to take the approach of London and make crossing at any point legal, and have it be the drivers responsibility to not hit people. Laws in many cases are better when they reflect reality (and thus ease enforcement) rather than trying to shoehorn something impractical into place.
