Ah, yeah the way you worded it made me think you were asking the job applicant for their Facebook password. Nevertheless, I think what I wrote could help other employers avoid lawsuits. Ideally, we should pass a law to prevent employers from asking for a Facebook user's password so we can protect employers from discrimination and frivolous lawsuits that could result from a employer asking for a user's Facebook password. There really can't be that many people who have public profiles, but in that case you are okay as it's fair game with people who have public profiles as it's a sign they have no expectations of privacy. My facebook profile is friends only and I removed my name/information from the search/cache Facebook has.
