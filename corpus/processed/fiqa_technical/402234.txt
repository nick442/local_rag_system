Here's how this would happen: * We elect someone who cuts the TSA budget and relaxes security protocols so lines still move. * People who own, benefit from, or live off of government contracts for airport security lose money * Same people stage a terrorist attack that's an inside job, ensuring that it sparks outrage at the TSA and security budget cuts. * Everyone blames the person and they resign. * TSA budget is back in place, and government/corporate corruption reigns supreme. EDIT: The shoe bomber was an inside job to get full body scanner contracts. Look it up.
