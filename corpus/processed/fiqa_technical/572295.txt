The Dow at 1,000,000 signifies a totally fixed, working, economy. Once we reach the holy grail of Dow 1,000,000 we can finally start addressing the societal problems that continually take a back seat to economic issues, and there will finally be the money to pay for the general societal well-being that we're so sorely lacking here at Dow 22,000. It will be an economic nirvana.
