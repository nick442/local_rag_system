Ok what part of this conversation would have you believe that I would be ok with any theft funded endeavor? Khan Academy is already a viable replacement that is not funded by theft. There are also many other's like it. The ends do not justify the means. Institutionalized theft is wrong no matter what the excuse you think justifies it.
