Don't feel bad man. I have a finance degree and an information systems degree a 3.5 gpa, speak 3 languages, competent in several programming languages, helped run my family business for 3+ years and I had to take a IT internship role at an insurance company through co-op. Did that for 16 months and just sat for CFA L1. All that on my resume I got 0 love during recruitment. Passed up for even Back office positions at banks for kids who have goofy degrees and lower GPAs. If you're a non-target like me this is how it is. With hard work and intelligence we will get what we want though. I suggest looking into the CFA program.
