That will depend on what area of finance you're interested in. For some sectors you shouldn't focus on programming as a skill to learn outside the classroom (for example CRE, iBanking). Personally I think VBA, Python and R would be great places to start (and useful in sectors such as risk management, trading and possibly even the insurance industry). Just pick one, the first one you learn will take the longest after that you'll realize learning more isn't that hard.
