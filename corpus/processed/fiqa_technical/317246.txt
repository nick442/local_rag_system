It is creepy how wealthy companies always get these tendencies to change their structure and functioning to pay the least possible taxes and get into all kinds of this shady shit. I once heard that if you study the behaviour of companies as if they were people, many of them would get diagnosed as psychopaths, and this kind of behaviour is an example of that. Why does the most profitable company on earth have this perverse urge to increase that money in such shady ways? Why not live up to your honour and pay taxes back to the country that gave you the chance to develop and grow?
