"I 100% agree with you. I didn't want to steer the conversation down that path. I am in no way disregarding your comment here, but in the spirit of keeping this conversation on a linear track.. What I am trying to get across is ""in many cases, Corp BK laws are being used in a way that was not the original intent of the laws"". Now I agree that Copr and Personal BK laws have been legislated and morphed in part due to lobbyist and corporate interest - but I wasn't even going to even open that can of exploding worms."
