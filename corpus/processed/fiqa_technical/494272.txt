Here in the DC area, we have MetroAccess, which is subsidized by WMATA (the organization that runs DC's Metro and Metrobus system) and offers rides to disabled folks almost like a personal taxi service. If New York doesn't have something like that now, if they're willing to pay for it, they could implement a public option to address any possible failure in the private market if companies like Uber are unable to do it.
