>Money is accumulated work, not debt. I think you're slightly missing the point, but I do think the post does deal with that indirectly. Loddars are a store of value (they store current and future value of work). By promising to pay X loddars I've promised to do X amount of work. Similarly, the number of loddars I have is proportional to the amount of work I have done, or am expected to be able to do. Which is why >The economy functions on work, not promises. The farmer may promise a million bushels of apples and the hunter may promise a million deer, but that's just fantasy. Slightly misses the point. The farmer, the hunter, and the cooper can promise the sky and that's fantasy. But that's not really a criticism because it's not a realistic possibility. The farmer, hunter, and cooper can also promise feasible things, like 10 sacks of potatoes, 5 deer skins, and 12 barrels to be delivered ten days from today. Because these promises are feasible (barring someone doesn't die) and because they've reliably delivered in the past, we can assume that their promises are good. Their promises are valuable because they are reliable producers. And if a meteorite falls out of the sky to strike the hunter dead, we can actually measure the impact of his death and price it. If we know the hunter produces ~100 deer skins per year, and he dies suddenly, we could actually have planned ahead for such an eventuality. On the basis of their past performance, we can reliably price the value of their future promises. And if they don't perform, we can price that too. How would we do that? Maybe each producer pays, as a premium, a part of their output into a central pot that they/their heirs/society can draw from if one of them dies, or under-produces. We can value this pot in loddars, and maybe this pot can even underwrite a few loans of loddars to others. That being said I'm not sure I understand your bit about Krugman and how it relates?
