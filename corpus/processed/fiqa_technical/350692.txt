Yes, I think you will be able to withdraw from your 401(k) without penalty. Normally, you need to be age 59½ before you can withdraw without incurring a 10% penalty. However, an exception to this rule is described in an IRS 401(k) Resource Guide: Exceptions. The 10% tax will not apply if distributions before age 59½ are made in any of the following circumstances: What this means is that if you leave the company that you have the 401(k) with in the calendar year that you turn 55 (or later), you can take early distributions from the 401(k) without penalty. This year is the year that you turn 55, so it appears that you are eligible for early distributions under this rule.
