What it doesn't say is how many were opened, also how many were opened in the last 2 years thag they're closing. Every new suburban development comes with an Applebee's or applebees like store. They do great at first but most sizzle out. This could be over opening stores, or it could be the fucking scum millennials not going out to eat. I believe it might also have to do with a change in consumer habits toward restaurants. I don't see Applebee's or chilli's doing well in the future. They just don't offer what people want anymore.
