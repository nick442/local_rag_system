Yes. The most complicated software most bankers use is Excel. From my limited perspective, success in banking is a function of who you know and how big you can convince everyone else your dick is. Breaking in is the hardest part, but once you're there you won't get kicked out for not being smart enough if you play the game. You should know accounting really well, also.
