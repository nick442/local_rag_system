"I always have mixed feelings when I read articles like this. On one hand I object to this idea that folks with these diagnoses are fragile and have to have ""special treatment"". On the other hand speaking as someone with some of these disorders who has worked in professional environments for a few decades, it's absolutely clear that working environments are designed for certain kinds of people (who are loud, insistent, and in the majority) and for them there really are substantial benefits. That being the case, I think it's important that companies make an effort to optimize the work environment for all their employees, even if that environment is radically different than what some folks (like H.R. folks) would like. It's amazing how much the quality of my work and my life in general improved when I could work in an environment designed to suit my needs."
