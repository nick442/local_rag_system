Smartphone? GPS? If you have really absurd rules, your enforcers might require you to put up several signs to notify others about your policing of absurd acts like possessing dried plants in public, or whatever. Humans, being smart and reactive (not passive) animals, will naturally gravitate towards the most reasonable rules and perhaps change their own to match the prevailing norms, because those who had absurd rules would not be dealt with much. Perhaps package deliveries would not be allowed to any house that allows murder, rape, theft.. and nobody would want to do any business with someone who allowed violent crimes. They'd be ostracized. If humans can establish a complex internet system, complete with tubes and kitten pics, we can establish a way to let every property owner establish their own rules and then innovate from there with social and trade consequences for those who have stupid rules. The basic premise is that, if you own your own house, you should have control over it, but you must pay the consequences if your rules make others not want to come or do any business with you. No monopoly should be able to apply their own rules against you. A texan like George Bush should have no power over a New York City resident, and vice versa.
