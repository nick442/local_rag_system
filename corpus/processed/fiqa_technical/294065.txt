As long as we're just making up formulas, I may as well just throw some numbers at it. The position at the forensic accounting firm would be paying 50-60K likely starting salary with maybe 5K bonus if he is super busy and busts his ass. Whereas a position in Banking would be paying about 75K base, with around 40-60K in bonus (let's assume this is a boutique or mid level bank). So after year one, he makes about $60K more on the banking route after year 1 post graduation, whereas he forfeited 10K in summer salary plus the 5K loan with interest (which ohbytheway is tax deductible). Pretty sure that it works out in his favor that way, and that's just after 1 year. Yes I understand this simplifies things and assumes that he gets a job in banking solely due to the internship, and couldn't have gotten it otherwise. However, if the internship significantly increases the likelihood (P as you put it) from .3 to .7 it's still wildly in his favor to do it, given that the wage gap will only grow over time consider his base will be 85k+bonus in yr 2, and 95K+bonus in yr 3, whereas he's looking at maybe 10% raises in the forensic accounting. Look, you can make up formulas all you want, all I was saying is that in certain industries, it's absolutely legitimate to have unpaid internships. In this case, $PAYOFF is a fairly high value, and P is increased a significant amount.
