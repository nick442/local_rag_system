The idea that you should pay $5,000 up front to convert your shares and sell them to ultimately receive some larger amount is crazy. If in fact the shares need to be converted (unlikely), they should be able to deduct the fees from the proceeds of your transaction, and you would not be out-of-pocket anything at all. You didn't provide much in numbers, so I will make some up: For example: If you have 2,000 shares valued at $10 each, your account should be worth $20,000. If the liquidation cost is $5,000, they should be able to sell everything, deduct the liquidation cost, and send you a check for $15,000. You should NOT have to pay money up front to get your own money, and that is a sure sign of a scam.
