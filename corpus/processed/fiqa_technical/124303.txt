Me too. The guy who wrote this article is the same as me. I never watch commercials, and it's extremely rare if they ever cause me to go buy something. I really don't see the point in commercials anymore. Any commercials I do remember are the funny ones and I'll remember the characters better than the actual product. If it wasn't for Comcast bundling cable with our internet for a low price we wouldn't even have cable. EDIT: I understand that commercials want brand awareness as well. My point is that this really doesn't apply to me because 95% of the products I buy(food, clothes, and electronics) currently don't have any commercials on TV, if ever. I'm a frugal shopper and if a commercial resonates with me, it's because it's a great deal and not because it's a brand name.
