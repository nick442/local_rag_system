Regarding some major holes in The Atlantic article.. **One**, Longwall mining became the norm underground rather than advance-retreat mining. It massively advanced the productive output of the industry, and required far less workforce. This was THE central cause of the precipitous drop to the coal industry workforce before the 1990s. Thereafter, a confluence of prices, competition, attacks on the working class/unions, of new energy sources, etc and other factors were the mixture which reduced the workforce. **Two**, strip mining (and lignite-type coal; lower workforce necessary) in the Western coal region also played a role rather than the demands of underground mining (mostly bituminous, but also anthracite-type coal, concentrated in the East; higher workforce necessary). Key to remember that this move from eastern to western coal production, while reducing the workforce, was a **major drive** by the **coal bosses in the 90s through the 2000s.** A major aspect was that this was a campaign by the owners/bosses seeking to side-step the UMWA and unions/labor costs/health/dental. The eastern mines were dominantly Union, but out west, the union movement in the coal industry unfortunately never had broad modern success. Moments of greatness occurred in the western UMWA organizing battles (some great Navjao nation unionists, some good locals in Colorado too, a few valiant UT battles â€“ one in particular which was lead by miners who were originally from Mexico), but no where near like east of the Mississippi. **Three**. Anyone who worked or even lived near the industry (lived in Appalachia or Western Coal), could have told the young Atlantic author, or the Stanford Institute fellow just about all of this. Driving around rural West Virginia, PA, or Kentucky you can occasionally see the old advance-retreat Joy 'miner' machinery littering the countryside. Old-timers often times are glad to share heaps of the proud labor history of the region and this industry. Much easier to make a buck via The Atlantic by reading a couple academic reports, check Department of Energy, MSHA, and BLS statistical websites.
