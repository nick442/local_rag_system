Sounds like a trick question. If it's hired for a limited time, equivalent to an operating lease, then you only pay a running cost as it's used, and it's neither an asset or a liability, but just a running cost like salaries. If it's hired in a way that fulfils the criteria for a financial lease, i.e. you treat it like it's being purchased, then it's both a liability and an asset. It goes on both sides of the balance sheet. Just like when you buy something on credit and recognize the liability to pay as a debt, and the item owned as an asset. edit: presuming the relevant company is the one paying.
