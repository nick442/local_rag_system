You might spend 30/45 minutes a day sitting in traffic, but those towns are all so centrally located you can definitely shop around to try and find an affordable living situation. In Laurel you could live in Anne Arundel County, Prince Georges County, or Montgomery County and not be too far from work. Germantown and Temple Hills would be a bit more of a hellish commute, but you still have options if you don't mind sitting on the beltway everyday for a little while.
