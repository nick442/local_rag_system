I'd say $1M is a reach and not guaranteed in any way. A friend that goes to a top target has said the upper end is about $100k including bonus first year in IB, and sticking in banking might get you to $500k after about 5 years. The pay advances a lot better than it does in engineering/tech. Your major doesn't really matter as long as you have a solid GPA and can answer technicals.
