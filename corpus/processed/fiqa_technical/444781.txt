The fed has $2 trillion m0, and they loan out $1.9 trillion which then is eventually makes it way back to their banksagain, which they loan out another $1.8 trillion. The money goes to whoever they are loaning it to. The m0 is determined by the treasury directly printing 0's and 1s, and putting it into the Fed's bank which then they loan out. That's last part is what quantitative easing is. In short, the treasurys at the top, then the fed, then the branch banks, then corporations then the executives then the middle/lower class. Generally. When the treasury prints the money it trickles down. Problem is the higher up in the tree the more purchasing power you have, the lower the less. Comparing it to the spanish inquisition wouldn't be far off. Perhaps someday the government will let the people choose their own currency.
