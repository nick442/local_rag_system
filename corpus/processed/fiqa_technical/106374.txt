"I agree, this is an great discussion. I think I understand your position now - Black-Scholes is an equilibrium model because its a model that in effect says, ""here's the price of an option if the underlying follows this stochastic process"". I guess my question is then - what would a strictly ""no arbitrage"" equity option model look like then (e.g. one analogous to Hull-White)? Does such a concept even make sense?"
