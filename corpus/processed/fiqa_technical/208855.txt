Ofc it's for cost. Either better cost but lower talent or better cost and same talent. That's my point for Ricardian theory. At 4 percent, its hard to say many are out of jobs. Perhaps they are holding out for higher salary than what market thinks they deserve. Regardless, there is nothing wrong with companies looking for lower cost. That's capitalism and that's what allows you to have better breakfast than kings did pre industrial.
