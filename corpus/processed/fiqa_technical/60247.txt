"Investors aren't ""job creators"" .. they're job *haters*. The top folks cannot think past one business quarter, so they hate wages and increasing wages to get their jobs done. It will only change when someone realizes they are losing the race because they don't want to buy the gear they need. And they do need it. Companies don't need better investment advisors or magic business consultants to worship. They need workers. Sadly .. they are told by the expensive consultants that paying for the latter is always the problem."
