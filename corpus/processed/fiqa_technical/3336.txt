"Yes, kinda. Talk to local banks about a business account, and tell them you want to enable certain employees to make deposits but not withdrawals. They don't need to know you're all the same person. For instance I have a PayPal account for business. These allow you to create ""sub accounts"" for your employees with a variety of access privileges. Of course I control the master account, but I also set up a ""sub account"" for myself. That is the account I use every day."
