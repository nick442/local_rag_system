> If you can come up with a way to make super cheap healthy organic food that can be prepared by unskilled labor in less than a minute, then I'm sure they'd love to hear from you. How much time have you spent cooking? Because it isn't exactly rocket science. It isn't too difficult to make large quantities of inexpensive quality food. You do have to spend some money on kitchen hardware, but the skills aren't too bad. Short-order cooking can be picked up quickly. Baking bread isn't difficult, either. Considering that McDonald's wants $7 for a combo meal, I could do simple breakfast foods (eggs, pancakes, biscuits, etc.), bread, rice, beans, burgers and other easy stuff, for that amount or less and do well. That's not just speculation. There are probably a couple million small restaurants who do this. It isn't hard.
