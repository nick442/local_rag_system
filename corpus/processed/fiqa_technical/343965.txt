Very unlikely to get 200k out of college, but not out of reach of as you gain experience and if you live in a high CoL area. 200k and higher is about right for all-in comp (base + bonus) as you reach IT management / specialty / sales roles. This is why talent is a concern across finance right now. Grads are going to tech instead of banks because the pay is about a wash but work environment is better. They're not wrong.
