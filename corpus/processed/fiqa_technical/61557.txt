"My only issue with the whole ""Comcast and TWC are in cahoots to set prices 10x higher than what they should be"" is the fact that Comcast and TWC are hardly the most profitable companies in the US. I mean, they are large companies with decent revenues, but they aren't making much more than other companies of their size that are in different fields. If they were really a monopoly setting prices crazy high and exploiting nearly a hundred million Americans on their monthly bill.. Wouldn't Comcast have like, crazy have profits that rival the oil companies? I mean, Comcast has 120,000 employees and a 10 billion USD income. That's perfectly in line with other companies of that size such as CocaCola or P&G. And hell, TWC reported a net *loss* of 2 billion USD last year. People think they are a monopoly that's overcharging for services.. When they aren't even making money?"
