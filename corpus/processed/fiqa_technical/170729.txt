"I said nothing about a preference for either system. All of the internet TV utopia stuff is a projection you put on me based on percieved ""reddit sentiment"" (for which I think your perception is pretty accurate). That's just the way I imagine the market going, regardless of what's ""good"" for American Culture and jobs, etc. The biggest thing I'm tempted to disagree with here is the idea that those big shows' funding will keep TV around. My main objection is that I don't think we have a reason to believe that these high-budget shows need to exist in the future. I agree that it would suck to lose these types of shows, but I think they are a product of the arrangement of business less than they could ever be a driver of it. It seems totally feasible that cable would lose subscribers to people pirating their shows and to internet TV services, and that we'd just end up without shows like that. Be careful to keep value judgments separate from what you think the market will or could do."
