Most of the people I know who started doing that shit did it because they knew they were just cheap labor and didn't need their wits about them. It comes from a lack of respect of the job and the fact that they don't want to be there. Habits like that happen because they get started and change jobs and keep bad habits, which means that on some level you can assume someone coming from a long time of blue collar work may have habits that affect their productivity in a white collar job, which is opposite from the point you're trying to make.
