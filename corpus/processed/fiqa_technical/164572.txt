working full time for low wages, does force a family to take government assistance. It is a way my business and others who pay a living wage while still paying our taxes subsidized the mega businesses destroying america like walmart. Sorry but if you have a family cant get another job with better pay and have to work 40 hours for min wage, you are going to use government assistance.
