"Mission is easily the toughest item on this list to get right and not look like a corporate douchebag. Especially since *Office Space* lamented ""listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements"" 13 years ago and it really stuck. It seems mission and strategy are somewhat interchangeable, and strategy isn't as tainted with meaninglessness. Either way, to me the important point here is clarity of overall vision for the company from the top and communicating that strategy all the way down the chain. Other points like 1. Target, 5. Expectations, and 8. Future fall out of that if it's done right. And plastering some branded version of that strategy on a bunch of trinkets is *definitely* not right."
