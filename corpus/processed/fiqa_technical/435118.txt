"The goldbug crowd over on ZeroHedge's comments seem fond of reminding everyone that, while they might have bought and owned some gold in the past, they don't have it any more because they actually lost it all in a lake in ""a tragic boating accident"". And who's going to prove otherwise? For that group, who are convinced cash (""fiat paper"") will at some point be worthless, the stockmarket will evaporate, the highest grade bonds will default and bank accounts and other personal assets will be subject to confiscation and ""bail in"".. general bug-out apocalypse in other words.. having a ""secret stash"" of high-value physical assets is obviously quite important and reassuring and presumably totally ""worth it""."
