I'll agree that some variance in wage between city and rural makes sense. The whole, more restaurants are now closing because of hikes in staff wages is pretty misleading. About 60% of hospitality ventures fail in the first three years and that's across the board before any wage change discussion. Requiring workers to be paid more, requires the employer to make adjustments to the business model. This added level of operating complexity is sure to adversly impact some folks but presenting it as a major contributing factor to increased failure rates is a stretch.
