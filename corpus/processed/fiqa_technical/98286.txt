Is there a way in bloomberg to calculate the total return if one purchased $100 worth of 10 Year US Notes at time X and perpetually rolled the principal once the bond matured until the present? I've been able to historically use the COMP function to compare equity and ETF total returns, but curious if this function can be expanded to measure returns against commodities, treasuries, and other debt products. Unfortunately im having trouble pulling in the appropriate continuous commodity and treasury tickers.
