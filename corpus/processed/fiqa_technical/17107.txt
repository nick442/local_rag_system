"Monkey, Big four accounting firms have FRM departments. Maybe you could apply to one of those. FRM is mostly about Credit Risk (Loans, advances, receivables) and Market Risk (IR, FX). I'm trying to ""break into"" credit risk myself, but materials are difficult to find. It's about modeling portfolio default probabilities and losses given default. You'll impress with basic programming and advanced prob&stats. Can you ask your professor to recommend a book on Credit Risk? For Market Risk, I know that a lot of the work guys do is pricing IR and FX swaps in Bloomberg. Take a class in derivatives, if you can."
