I'm with several of the others answering the question in that it isn't about opportunity cost so much as the value of the time savings. For example: I'm sure I could re-shingle my roof and save a ton of money on labor, but the marginal cost of having someone do that for me in the 100+ degree Texas heat makes it worthwhile to outsource that job. How much I could have earned at my job for however many hours it takes doesn't really play into it unless I am specifically giving up an opportunity to earn money instead of working on my roof. For example, it might tilt the balance more towards outsourcing the roof job if I had an offer for contract work at $100/hr that I wouldn't have time to do if I worked on the roof. Also, considering the time I'd probably take off from work to do the job is paid vacation it isn't like I'm giving up some of my paycheck to do that job. The real variable is how much value I assign to being able to NOT work on my vacation days. The bottom line is this: What your time is worth is variable and depends on the REALISTIC opportunity cost of using that time on a money making endeavor instead of the option you are considering.
