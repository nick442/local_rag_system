I still think it will be a wrist device (possibly neck). Apple has some patents related to heartbeat identification (something that is pretty much impossible to imitate - but doesn't work for people with pumps replacing their heart). Combined with the secure enclave I see this as the solution for a secure payment platform - fingerprint reader for authorization, and heartbeat for authentication. If your heartbeat is elevated you won't be able to authorize payments (so won't go through if you're being held up, or just finished a cardio workout).
