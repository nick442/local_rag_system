No one can make this decision for you. Involve your wife and truly value and heed her thoughts on the situation. Succeeding in such an endeavor without her full support/consent will bring an unwanted undertone into your marriage. I am personally more reserved and in your situation I would stick with my job until my start-up can stand on its own. I know it would require more work but at least it wouldn't put my family in an all-or-nothing situation. It's tempting to reach for what you don't have but sometimes it worthwhile to stand back and be truly grateful for everything you do have.
