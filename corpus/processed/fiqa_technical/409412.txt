"My simple rule to avoid impulse buys is that if you see something you want, you can get it.. but not today; go back and get it tomorrow (or wait even longer, for big-ticket items). This way you'll have time to think about it rather than just doing it. That won't address all your wasteful spending, but it's a good way to avoid ""why did I think this would be a good idea?"" type situations."
