Dude, don’t worry what people are saying. Get the books, statements, or a lawyer. You have every right to the books as the other owners do. As the saying goes, if they have nothing to hide why are they afraid of you looking at the books. You can also demand a 3rd party audit, trying to come up with a business solutions with out knowing the finances what fixes you can afford, etc etc. come on man, MBA teach you it’s all about the money, and the stats. If you don’t know the money knowing the stats don’t help much ;)
