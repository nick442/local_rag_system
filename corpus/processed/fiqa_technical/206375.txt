To anyone who has doubts about this type of service, or is curious about it, I've used it before using Spirit Airlines. I actually lucked out by using mine, because apparently this Airline likes to charge people carry-ons ($40!) and since I self checked myself, I didn't pay for my laptop bag, and my duffle bag. However, my friends who were on the same flight didn't use the self check out (they arrived at a different time btw) did have to pay for their additional bag. Also, it only took about 3 minutes, then I was in line to have my balls felt up.
