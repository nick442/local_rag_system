"Good for them. Look how much time different countries spent competing over the Blue Riband (awarded to the fastest trans Atlantic crossing) before the Jet Age took over. Fixed rail infrastructure for passenger transportation in anywhere other than highly dense areas is a money loser.

Wasting any more money on passenger rail isn't the way to go."
