You're insistent on the concept that scientists cannot perfectly predict what future weather will be. However, we see the global climate trend. It ties in with the production of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. We know that greenhouse gases are called such because of their effects in trapping in heat. We are also aware of the output of natural greenhouse gas producers, such as volcanoes. By magnitudes larger is man-made greenhouse gas production. Man is the DRIVING force behind current climate change. You're not seeing the forest for the trees, no pun intended.
