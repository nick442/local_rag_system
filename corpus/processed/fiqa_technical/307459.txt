"Fighting poverty is akin to ""fighting drug use"". No matter how much money is raised via taxation there will always be a bottom percentile of individuals who are not ""wealthy"" in relation to others above them in society and especially Bill Gates. If he really wants to make a difference then he should support rational and reasonable economic propositions which raises the standard of living and lowers the cost of living, but I suspect that would not bring him any sort of feel good press as his ""Tax the rich, give to the poor"" proposals."
