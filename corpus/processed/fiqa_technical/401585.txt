If there is a plus side to American healthcare it is that the huge wealth it accumulates funds a lot of medical research and facilities. I've explored many American cities and the healthcare system is often a huge empire that keeps expanding until a large part of the city is consumed by the hospital and countless associated facilities. A college campus also grows into an empire of real estate. In some cities the healthcare empire and the higher education empire expand to border each other and then there is a battle for the remaining real estate. ;) But often there is nothing else going on in these communities. No restaurants, no retail, no theater, no housing. It is all service related economic activity.
