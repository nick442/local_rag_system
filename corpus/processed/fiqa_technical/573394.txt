"Depending on what you mean by ""High-quality health insurance,"" it is part of the problem. If you don't care about price (because you are using your insurance pays for everything), providers will charge as much as your insurance will pay. Health insurance in this country turned into a poorly built health service subscription business because the government made it cheaper for your employer to provide you wages in the form of health insurance than in money. There are new health service business models popping up that are built as a health service subscription. Providers charge a flat monthly rate and you get to use as much as you want. The doctors and other service providers don't have to deal with insurance, and get to keep everything. Unfortunately, they are illegal in some states. Get the government out of the health services sector. End the subsidy for health insurance paid by employers, or provide the same subsidy for health services purchased by individuals. Allow any group to negotiate group coverage. Why is your health insurance tied to your job? Allow communities, extended families, or any organization to purchase group coverage. Stop requiring purchasing insurance services you don't want and will never use, like a gay men being required to purchase maternity insurance."
