"First of all, it is absolutely **not** constitutional for any branch of the US government to outsource its primary functions to a private corporation. But, more to your point, the constitution provides that ""no state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts."" They will argue that Federal Reserve notes are unbacked, that taxes are voluntary, that Washington D.C. is not a state, that the FED is not private, or even (sometimes) that the gold standard is still in force. But each of those is contradicted by their actions."
