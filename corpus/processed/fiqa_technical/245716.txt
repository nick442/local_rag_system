Depression really does steal your future, stole a little bit of mine. I had all the resources available to me to get ahead but due to a conglomeration of events I fell into a downward spiral. Im further out now than I've ever been from that hole but now im 27 and trying to finish school when many people I know finished 6 years ago. I know it could be much worse but like you said, depression steals away your future if you let it.
