I suspect this is done at least in part in response to [this review by Edmunds](http://www.edmunds.com/tesla/model-s/2013/long-term-road-test/wrap-up.html) and a [similar one by Consumer Reports](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/08/consumer-reports-tesla-model-s-has-more-than-its-share-of-problems/index.htm) where they describe the number of problems Tesla had over 1 year of ownership. Esp in the Edmunds review, if you scroll down part way down the article, you'll see the number of powertrain part replacements that were done; it's quite substantial.
