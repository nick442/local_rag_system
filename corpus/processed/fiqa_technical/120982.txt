Yes, but Americans know how to respond to my answer, the Indians just repeat what you said because they don't understand you. I had to call Pfizer for information about a product this summer and the first call I got an Indian who had no fucking clue about what I was asking. Then I got a clear English speaking American when I called the next day who helped me rather quickly.
