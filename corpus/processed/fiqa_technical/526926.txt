"I used to work in finance for a number of years and I believe some of the use of these cliches are context-relevant (as others have said), but I also think they are often used as a placeholder for an actual thought or point, when one is lacking. It is also quite jarring to hear these phrases for the first time, as I had when I first started working at an investment bank. I thought they were sealing themselves within their culture. I found it limiting and really suffocating. My (least) favorite was ""it is what it is."" I always wanted to say: ""When isn't it?"" In any event, I have been collecting articles like this for a while. I have an idea to write a short story about a newly minted undergrad (or MBA) joining a company and all the other characters *only* speak in these phrases and sentences. And the main character is forced to deal with his/her initial confusion and then struggles to decide whether to assimilate (drink the kool-aid, if you will) and then realize his/her ability to think and identify as an individual is being challenged, so he/she ultimately abandons that company/job/industry."
