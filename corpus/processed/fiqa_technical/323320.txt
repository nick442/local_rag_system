Coffee is much popular and cheaper here. I can get a can of coffee for under 100yen (about 1 dollar) if I buy it at the right place, a little more if it's from a vending machine or convenience store. Monster is twice that price, and red bull is 3 times (the size of drinks are smaller too). There are many brands of canned warm and cold coffee. Many cans are in a bottle shape, and have a screw top lid. Really convenient to carry around.
