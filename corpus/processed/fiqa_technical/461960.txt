Maybe, I'm confused too..but I would have to disagree, the numbers wouldn't be the same. Also, they are not the same thing. * NOA = Operating assets - Operating Liabilities * IC = Equity + Debt Example: Company has $1000 Equity, $1000 Debt, $2000 Assets * Company's NOA is $1000 * Company's IC is $2000
