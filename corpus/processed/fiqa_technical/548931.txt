I thought that for a while, but then i actually got it with a groupon. Once in there, I liked it, especially since we were going through a move. Because people pay to get in, the reviews are a little better actually. I was pleased. For a company that does work on houses/etc., such as plumbing, it is a necessity to establish a positive presence there.
