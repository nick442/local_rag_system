"> Defense counsel even made an issue of this at trial, implying to the jury that nobody would be dumb enough to commit a crime by phone when ""there was a big sticker on the phones that said all calls are being recorded,"" as Grimm's counsel, Mark Racanelli, put it. In fact, Racanelli argued, the conversations on the tapes hardly suggested a secret conspiracy, because ""no one was whispering."" >But the reason no one was whispering isn't that their actions weren't illegal â€“ it's because the bid rigging was so incredibly common the defendants simply forgot to be ashamed of it. That last conclusion is very oversimplified and sort of speaks to the lack of vigor in the article. The point is that companies being sued in this case, had their legal and compliance departments fully knowledgeable of the business. Yes, the customers were knowingly being given a price lower than what they deserved. ..but that's hardly criminal."
