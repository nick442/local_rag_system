Who depends on you? I personally wasn't insured until I had a family. Of course I had the required insurance policies like auto, but no health until I was 29 and had a kid who needed me. Now I have health, dental, vision, life, auto, homeowners and renter's insurance. I can't let an accident or disaster affect my baby's future.
