I’m sure you wouldn’t say that conflicts of interest are ok? This is obviously one. Is your argument just that we don’t have proof bezos explicitly ordered this article? Or we don’t have proof that there is pressure, direct or indirect, on authors to write pro amazon stories (pressure is new or old)? To be clear, we will never, ever have evidence that such things are occurring, getting evidence for some of things is basically not possible. So I don’t think we should sit here and say “well we don’t have proof”. Instead we should say “this is an obvious conflict of interest, and that should be seriously considered when evaluating the content of this article”. Soft power is hard to prove.
