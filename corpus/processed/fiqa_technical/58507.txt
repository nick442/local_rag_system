Just like many other industries, entertainment is becoming a commodity of convenience which means that it also is getting far less profit margin. It won't die, but the money that keeps the big named companies in the black is slowly petering out. They are going to fight this tooth and nail just as past companies in other industries that have paved the same path have tried. Any sense of success on their part only makes their fall much harder down the road. We are moving into a world where entertainment is more plentiful and cheap, but the cost will be that we see fewer big budget offerings.
