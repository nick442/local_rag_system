Really, the only way to develop meaningful relationships of any kind (personal/business/etc) is to interact with people directly in a shared context. If you don't have any professional interaction with them through your/their business, then you're left to social/personal things -- play tennis together at a club, golf together, work out at a gym together, meet at charity events, attend social gatherings, etc. Executives are people too. Think about it -- how would you want someone to approach you? Some random guy sending mail/email to a bunch of people with your same job title hoping to make a contact for entirely selfish reasons (i.e. getting a job, selling a product/service, whatever) is not going to look attractive to you -- you're just going to ignore it because there's no personal connection, no reason to care. For all intents and purposes, you may as well be talking about an unsolicited ad from Comcast for TV service you don't need. In general, I'd go back to the drawing board. What exactly are you trying to accomplish here? Are you trying to sell a startup/project you've been working on? Are you trying to find a shortcut to a high-paid job? Revisiting your objective will give you the recipe to more effectively approach it. **TL;DR** -- Sending spam to executives is not an effective way of networking. It is a good way to identify yourself as an undesirable contact, however.
