Ha! I'm not calling you out here, apologies if it seemed that way. Disagreements over the Internet tend to feel like attacks. My experiences with mental health have shown me that the path toward success is far less linear than for healthy people. And because everyone is brought up so linear, many end up lost. But that's what makes mental health sufferers all the more interesting. 18 months ago I was bussing tables and thought life was over. Alongside my partner, we now employ 3 doctors and 7 other staff, treat mental health issues, and we have 2 clinics with an aim for 5 by year end. I'm in my mid twenties- life finds a way. And you're right to avoid excuses at all costs.
