"Synergy is when a relationship makes its members stronger. ""Relationships"" doesn't cut it. Results and [ROI](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) are very different. If a subordinate brings an insignificant problem to their manager, ""be realistic"" doesn't have quite the kick that ""deal with it"" does, IMO, but I'll give it to you. I'm not sure what you're getting at with ""Expectations? Goals?"", but managing expectations is conveyed in neither. Your terms do not suffice, and your lack of understanding leads me to believe that you're either really junior or not in business at all."
