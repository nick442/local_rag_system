NYT has no authority to report on the credit card account. The introductory offer you accepted likely had a specified duration, like a 1 year commitment from you. It doesn't matter that you used a virtual card, or a credit card, or check or any other form of payment. NYT can, if it wants, send your NYT account to collections and/or report your delinquency to a reporting agency. But this reporting would be your NYT account, not the credit card.
