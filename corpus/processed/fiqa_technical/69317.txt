One of the most time-consuming activities performed in the Finance function involves the processing, categorisation and cost allocations of expenditure items. In a larger department this is a regular process requiring dedicated staff, and increases in intensity at period end, when it can often absorb additional resource. The key objective of this process for the business is a fair and correct distribution of expense allocations for each business unit, so that true costs may be recorded and profitability accurately assessed. It is also important to be able to compare actual expense allocations with budgeted values, on a monthly and year-to-date basis, in order to spot issues and trends early and to support efficient cost control. https://www.accountagility.com/solutions/cost-allocation-and-expense-allocation/
