"I didn't say ""not at all available outside of work hours"". I said ""not checking work email"". If something urgent comes up at the office when I'm out where it makes more sense for someone to call me and ask for help, sure, they can call, and I'll answer if I can, or get back to them when it's reasonably convenient to do so. I'm not going to waste my non-work hours looking for work to do, though; if it's not urgent, it waits until the next time I'm in the office."
