Unfortunately economics (and accounting for that matter) won't help much with being an entrepreneur. The main thing you need to focus on is cash generation - you need to maximise this. There are 2 aspects: revenue and costs. You need to plot these over the last 5-10 years to see trends. What is happening to revenues Are they growing with inflation? If not, why not? Is it because people are buying online? Is it because the products are not fashionable? Is it because people simply buy less jewelry these days? Have the cost of the products gone up but the shop hasn't increased prices (i.e. gross margin contraction). Decreasing gross margin could also be an indicator that someone is stealing from the business. What about the overhead costs of running the business? What has happened to rent, salaries, insurance? Look for any unusual trends. In summary: first you need to identify where the problem is, and to do this you need to look at the trends of revenues and costs (break costs down into categories).
