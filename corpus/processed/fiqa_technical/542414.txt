"Given the income level of my family (married filing jointly status), IRAs aren't really an option. We're past the Roth IRA limits and get no deduction for a regular IRA. There's something called the ""backdoor Roth IRA"". You can contribute to a Traditional IRA and then immediately convert it to a Roth IRA. Assuming that you don't have any existing money in Traditional IRAs, this is exactly identical to a Roth IRA contribution."
