That's nice and this perspective frankly what I'd expect from an economist, but as a political scientist, I know that military power is a function of platform capability even more than cost effectiveness. China is several generations behind on many of its combat platforms which means theyll just die in greater numbers. Equating Chinese military capability to American on the basis of GDP-PPP is just stupid. Or more specifically, is misses how we measure power. The day they've got a dozen fully operational carrier battle groups get back to me.
