I will start making food that people love. 1517 is old. Food should be old too. A good market for launching new varieties of food. The advantage is that I can experiment whatever I want; free to do anything. Every time I launch a new dish in the market, chances are very high that people would pay special attention to new tastes. The money wouldn't be a major turning point there. Feeding people with different dishes would bring in reputation among the community. That's all I want for my business to expand smoothly.
