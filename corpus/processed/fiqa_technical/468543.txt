As someone who took the reverse route that she did academically, MIT Sloan first and then Wharton, and a rather similar professional trajectory, I really did try to further develop my finance skills and learn new marketing skills but an MBA isn't really catered for that. With all due respect to these academic institutions, most MBA programs are factories. If you fall in the average that the program is targeted for, it works out great for you. But if in any way your needs are a little more niche, it is much harder with the onus significantly on you to make it a more rewarding experience academically. And I tried to that, it involved engaging professors more than in just the classroom, trying out new ideas like trying to understand product development or online marketing, but nonetheless it's much harder to make it truly rewarding from an academic point of view.
