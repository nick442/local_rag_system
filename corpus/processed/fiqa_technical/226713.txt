[You seem to be a little out of the loop](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/germany/articles/the-10-german-fashion-designers-you-should-know/). Germany has never seized to be a big fashion player, they harbored people like Hugo Boss, Karl Lagerfeld, Wolfgan Joop, Jill Sander, Escada, etc. When the French fashion company Chanel has a German head designer and creative director I fail to see how Germany would not be a big player.
