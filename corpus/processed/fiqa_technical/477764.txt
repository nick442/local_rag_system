Incorrect. As a given product or service becomes more complex to manufacture or support, the cost of entry into that marketplace increases. Any aspect of technology automatically tends towards increased barrier to entry even without regulation. Increased barrier to entry requires larger investment, means more risk, means increased difficulty finding investment. Consider computer processors - in the 80s, creating a processor that can compete in the fledgling marketplace against similarly available chips would cost maybe a few million. Today, creating a processor thousands of times more complex, requiring much more complex chip fabs (of which there are a mere handful), and bringing it to market to compete against CPUs that already have the infrastructure and programming history to support them would be nearly impossible and require billions. Or, you know, you could look at the whole Microsoft and Intel locking out their competition from PC manufacturers by means of economic incentives or disincentives, leading to a de-facto monopoly that they can then abuse to force PC manufacturers to deal on their terms, all possible without regulation.
