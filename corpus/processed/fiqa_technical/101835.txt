"Your interpretation is *reasonable*, yes. But I think the author -- here, at least -- has an alternative interpretation that applies just as frequently. In a large and/or public company, especially one that is not in a strong growth period, there is an *incredible* incentive to not get blamed -- and therefore, fired or undesirably transferred -- if something goes wrong. The CYA approach may lead to a better decision by seeking best practices, or it may not. A given situation may be better served by some variation on best practicies. But the author is right in that CYA is top-of-mind in decision-making for many. If something fails, but the decision-maker has done sufficient CYA -- ""We followed best practices but we hit a perfect storm of headwinds.."" -- then failure doesn't matter."
