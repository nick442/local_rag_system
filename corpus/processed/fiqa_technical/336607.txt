Well as someone that comes from a rural area where political opinions sway clear left and right regardless of the stereotype that has been created for them. The economic and social plans that are created and supported by people that come from urban backgrounds Do. Not. Work. Out. Here. Don't get me wrong I wish they did but the economy out in the rural areas can not support the plans like rural areas can and thats why is shrinking and dying. So how else are we supposed to get our option across if it wasn't for the decisions made by the people that founded this country. The majority can rule but he minority will have rights. Take that as you will but I take you as a ration person so you have to know that in urban areas there's more collective opinion.. and if I'm right farming isn't a dying industry. at least I hope not for your and my sake.
