I imagine the F-35 is the front runner, followed by the Eurofighter. The cooperation with the US military in South Korea and the history with US defense contractors will definitely weigh in compared to the Eurofighter. The benefit of a stealth fighter is definitely beneficial in the Korean peninsula. South Korea and the US remember vividly how hard it was to control the Air Space over Korea with the North Korean's better jet technology for the beginning parts of the Korean War. The SK want that advantage, especially if China eventually sells North Korea the J-20.
