Of course for severe acute pain opioids make sense, that's what they are for. But marijuana still has pain reducing effects, and maybe taken in edible form a much healthier long term replacement for opioids or for certain conditions like glaucoma and epilepsy. Not saying I'm an expert or that marijuana is the cure- all but I'm sure it has a respectable place as medicine
