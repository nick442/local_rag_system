"My employer puts ""contractor"" in your email address if you're a contractor, just so no one mistakenly treats you like a real employee. jsmith.contractor@company.com They get crappy desks not much bigger than 1970s library carrels. Some of them might be making more than I do, but I'd bet 6 months' salary that most of them aren't - a lot of them have that hangdog ""should I go for catfood again tonight or treat myself with some nice instant ramen?"" look."
