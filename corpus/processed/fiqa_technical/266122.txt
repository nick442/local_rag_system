I don't know which articles you have read but as far as I know the impact of automation will not be same in every industry. For example, take Education where human interaction is intensive automation is unlikely to displace human roles delivering value but the same cannot be said about manufacturing which on the other extreme is a labor intensive industry. Most industries fall in-between these extremes meaning full automation is impractical.
