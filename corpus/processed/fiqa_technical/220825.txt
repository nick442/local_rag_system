Honestly, I got to say this. It's based on your knowledge and how you portray yourself. My friend is a finance major and doesn't know jack shit. All these people discussing what is a good major etc. How about you wow these people with your resume of experiences that show you know your stuff whether its in economics or finance? My econ degree allowed me to take a lot of finance classes and that's what I did. I geared my degree to classes that circled around investing. No investment classes were offered IMO so I just independently studied that on my own and took all the academic spheres and applied it to the real world. Even business classes. Why not start your own small business somehow? That's way better experience than the project management class I took where we fucking had a final project to see who could build the biggest marsh mellow tower with sticks in a team. I got a B in that class because I will admit I really didn't put time into it as I saw it as bullshit. I did however, double my parent's family business by using lessons learned from academics. So which is better? Its all good IMO, but what your capacity is what I would be more interested in as a employer which you can show through you experience.
