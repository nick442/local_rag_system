"To add to @Dheer's answer, this is almost certainly a scam. The money deposited into your account is not from a person that made an honest mistake with account numbers. It's coming from someone that has access to ""send"" money that isn't their own. I don't know exactly what they're doing to ""send"" the money but at some point in the near future your bank will claw that money back from you on the grounds that it was illegitimately transferred to you in the first place. If you send someone money on the premise that you're returning this money then that will be a separate transaction which won't be undone when the deposit in question is undone. Another possibility is that this person has gained access to an account from which they can send domestic wires but not international wires. Their hope is to send money to someone domestically (you) and that this person will then send the money on to Nigeria. If you comply with them; you, in a worst case scenario, could be seen as a money laundering accomplice in addition to having the deposit taken back from you. It's not very likely you wouldn't be seen as another victim of a scam but people have been thrown in jail for less. You should not respond to this person at all. Don't answer the phone when they call and ignore their emails. Don't delete the emails, it's possible that someone at the bank or LE want them. Call your bank immediately and tell them what's up."
