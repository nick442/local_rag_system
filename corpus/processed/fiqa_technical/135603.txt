> Also by your own definition, no one in the middle class is in poverty. No. By the US government's definition of poverty, nobody in the middle class is in poverty because they don't want to admit that the middle class is poor now. > I’ve also never said everything is fine, I’ve only said it’s improving systematically. And you're wrong. Technology is improving our lives as our broken economic system erodes our prosperity. You can focus on the improvements and ignore the growing problems and pretend everything's alright, but it's not. Worldwide, the middle class is losing prosperity as measured by net-worth. We have no money, and since we earn our money from each other, no way to earn it. This is a growing systematic problem that technology can't solve, and is only making worse. Since economic health depends on the ability of the public to spend money, reducing how much they have to spend is dangerous. It makes for recession-prone, bubble-prone, collapse-prone economies. Since economic collapse is a driving force behind radicalization, drug use, war, and starvation, we see these problems growing in places even as advances make them easier to solve. The root of all of this is a broken economic system that is pushing us towards a dystopian future.
