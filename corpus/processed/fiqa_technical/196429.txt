The number is a bit higher than what it seems. Its not like they fired 35,000 people. But by franchising the restaurants out, all the employees that worked at each location are now employees of the franchise owners. Not Burger King directly. So it reduced the number of employees burger king corporate has to maintain, but those people are still employed at burger king. Just clearing that up in case someone thought they literally fired 35,000 people.
