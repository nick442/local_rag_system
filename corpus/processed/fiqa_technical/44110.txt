I bought my first car on eBay. I took a bus to go pick it up two states away with a cashier's check. I was in college and had enough money with me to buy a couple table of gas and a couple cheap meals, but not enough for a bus ride home. The guy selling the car showed up at the bus station and gave me the keys. The car was in excellent shape. As you can imagine, this was around 2002 or so. Can you imagine trying that now? Oh, Amazon was actually founded before eBay. They were just a bookstore, of course.
