Hard work is not eliminated when the rule of law exists. You're presenting a false dichotomy of either allowing people to force companies to pay them more, or not having hard work. >Unions are legal so forming one isn't going against the rule of law, I didn't state they were illegal. I stated that Walmart should fire them. >if they weren't we would of never have gotten the things we enjoy today as workers like the 8 hour day and the ban on child labor. Absolute nonsense. The prevalence of child labor was decreasing long before any law was created prohibiting it. Child labor is necessary in poor countries because people are far less productive per hour worked. As productivity increases, parents can afford to send their children off to school instead of working, since their own work is enough to support the family. Child labor is something that needs to disappear on its own, in response to changing economic conditions. If you introduced a law prohibiting child labor in a poor country like Cambodia right now, it would lead to widespread hardship and an increase in mortality. In other words, no government mandate created due to union-pressure can possibly lead to beneficial change, since laws that limit people's economic rights, under the assumption that 51% knows what's better for the minority than they themselves do, generally do much more harm than good.
