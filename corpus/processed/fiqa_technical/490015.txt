I know all too well how it works. That doesn't change the fact that GE didn't pay taxes. If only my personal expenses such as food, gas, car maintenance, rent could be deducted from my tax liability and then when I operate on a loss (spend more than I receive) use that to get a tax refund. If corporations were people, why do they have a separate tax code? If corporations are people, they would be subject to the same tax code people are. We have so much corporate welfare via the tax code in this country, that it exceeds the amount of social welfare for poor people.
