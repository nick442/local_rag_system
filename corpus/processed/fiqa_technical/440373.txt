I say get rid of the awful ones but keep the good ones. Man, oh man, have I worked with middle managers that took care of a lot of mundane stuff like interdepartment relations, politics, filling out applications and having to even deal with tech support. I'm not sure if I want to deal with the suits or not. Now, there gets to be problems when you overdo it with the layers. Also, it gets problematic if too many back-scratchers and people protective of their own asses get involved.
