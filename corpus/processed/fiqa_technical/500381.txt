This seems to answer your question: http://www.organicvalley.coop/why-organic/antibiotics/ > If holistic treatments are not effective, as a last resort farmers are encouraged to administer antibiotics rather than allowing an animal to suffer. If antibiotics are used, however, the animal cannot return to organic production - ever. Also, the USDA guidelines state that an animal that was given antibiotics, for any reason, is no longer organic.
