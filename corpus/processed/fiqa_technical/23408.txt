Except when it does. [Legal definition of fraud](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud): Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: (1) a false statement of a material fact,(2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result. 1.) a false statement of fact is implied as the person using the coupon is representing themselves as someone who is using the coupon for the first time (as he/she is in a disguise to appear to be a different person) 2.) knowledge is clear - the person using the coupon is going to the length of donning a disguise - they know they're trying to get away with something 3.) intent is shown by the length the person went to present themselves as a new customer as well as the posts on the forum 4.) assuming the cashier was deceived by the disguise, it's reasonable that Target put the transaction through as it believed it was doing so with a new customer 5.) injury is obvious
