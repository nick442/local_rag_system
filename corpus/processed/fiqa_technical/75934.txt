"So you take enjoyment from people's financial stress and anguish? You work for a company, those ""smug"" sounding people aren't personally fucking challenging you at your fucking job, they are trying to ease some financial stress which is very obvious over a 2$ discrepancy. I sincerely doubt anyone calls 5 times to complain about a service they rarely pay for. You sir a condescending cunt trying to get fake points on the interwebs."
