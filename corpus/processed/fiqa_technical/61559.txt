"**Yup!** It's important to note that modern soft contact lenses let through 10 times as much oxygen as the original hard contacts that were in use 20 years ago. The company you referenced, that's actually owned/run by the original inventor of soft contact daily lenses. He started it up because he was outraged at the prices being charged by the big name vendors who had licensed his patent. His story is here: http://www.daysoftcontactlenses.com/GB/All-about-Daysoft.aspx Two important things about re-using dailies. **1)** Don't leave dailies in overnight, buy solution and take them out and wash them each night. It really makes a difference in terms of complication rates. You don't have to fill the contact holders up to the top, not even to the ""internal line"", but make sure the contacts are covered. The latter will save you half on solution. When I'm on a wilderness trip I will wear my contacts through every other night, because trying to wash my hands completely and the sanitary conditions.. well it's just less risk and trouble imho than handling my contacts with potentially not-quite-perfectly-clean hands. **2)** Don't use a single pair more than 2 or 3 weeks. The risk of infections and complications gets too high using a single pair of general soft contacts around the one month mark. This is my recollection of what a medical doctor at an ER near a University posted online 10 years ago. You see university kids are far more likely/prone to over-use a pair, and he found that all the kids coming to his nearby ER with eye infections - had worn soft contacts for one month or more. ALSO -- if you're taking them out at night and using solution (as I strongly recommend you do), at the two week part the cost of daily contacts matches the cost of the solution you are using. So wearing a pair any longer than 2 weeks doesn't actually save you much more money."
