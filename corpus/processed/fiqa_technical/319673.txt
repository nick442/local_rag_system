"When did I say that? All I said was that my success had nothing to do with luck. Partly because I did more than just work hard and partly because there is *no such thing as luck*. They may be working just as hard or harder than me, but are they doing all the right things to increase their chances of success? Did they major in business or journalism? Do they network, or is that ""a fucking bullshit game"" they don't want to play? Do they ask for letters of recommendation, or think that people just automatically write them and know where to send them? I've actually met many people who think it's rude to ask for a letter of recommendation. Do they use their resources wisely or spend their student loan money on Macbooks and iPhones? There's more factors at play than simply the number of hours they work in a day or their GPA."
