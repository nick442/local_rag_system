"Biggest bull market in recent history going on right now. I think the financial sector is doing just fine with the current regulations in place that require certain ""capital and liquidity requirements."" Awesome though they're getting rid of ""the Labor Departmentâ€™s fiduciary rule, which requires brokers to act in the best interest of their clients when providing investment advice about retirement."" That will really create some jobs. /s"
