">Please study the history of the labor movement in the United States. There's a reason we're paid actual money and not ""company bucks."" Because businesses WILL find a way to pay employees nothing if they can. Nonsense. Businesses must compete for labor. They will pay the market wage. >No. I want to ensure that the price paid for labor matches its real cost. Again, study the labor movement. The price for labor is set by the supply and demand for labor. That's it. It's real ""cost"" whatever that means, is irrelevant. And it's certainly not set by government mandate. >Sounds like the same fucking thing people (racists) said during the labor movement. I'm confused what you're saying. Minimum wage laws are racist, as they overwhelmingly target minorities for job losses. Let's focus on your policies, not those in the past. >People who don't study history are doomed to repeat it. Seriously, fuck you and your complete and total ignorance of history and complete lack of understanding about basic economic theory. Seriously, fuck you and your complete and total ignorance of the billions of people lifted out of poverty over the last 100 years of countries adopting capitalistic policies. How many hundreds of millions of people need to be slaughtered by communist dictators before you abandon your racist and misguided economic policies?"
