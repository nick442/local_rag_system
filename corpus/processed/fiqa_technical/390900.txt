Your desire to travel before starting work is smart and something you should do. There are very few opportunities in life where you will have a chunk of time to do such travelling. Having said that, your life plans may or may not pan out the way you expect. Ideally, you'd take the 0% APR for 18 months and max it out. A 3% balance transfer (BT) fee breaks out to 1.5% APR, but due in 1.5 years. That's a very good loan rate if you can pay it before the APR changes. Say, you take 6 months to travel. When you return, you have one year to pay off your credit card bill. Calculate how much you will borrow and how much your monthly payments will be. $1,500 across 12 months is $125. Can you add that as a monthly expense? What will your life circumstances be when you return from travel? Do you know what your income will be? Do you know what your expected expenses will be? How much padding will you have for emergencies?
