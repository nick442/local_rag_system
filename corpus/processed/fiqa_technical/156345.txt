The idea was to not make the same mistake Meredith Whitney did. You don't have to agree with me but I'm also not going to slap a specific date on it. Calling out structural flaws is one thing, and trying to put an exact date onto it is another exercise entirely. It's like pointing out the financial jeopardy the US government is in. At the current rate of debt increase we've been seeing we're guaranteed to face massive inflation eventually. The only way to stop this from happening is to have a fundamental mindset shift in Congress. *But* I'm not about to attach a date onto when this will happen because there are just too many variables for me to figure out when it's going to happen. Like I said earlier, Whitney's only mistake was to slap a date onto her call.
