very understandable concern. people say that it's like 10% idea and 90% execution, but i agree that if i had some absolutely brilliant, new idea, I probably wouldn't be too eager to share it. i expect most posts to be from people that are in the process of launching.. i.e. the product is ready (or is nearly ready) but they want to get feedback on how to tweak it to improve.
