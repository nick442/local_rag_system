"> Though I'd counter that if your goal is to manipulate economic exchanges between individuals with the intention of guiding the economy at large to a specific desired outcome, I think that capitalism is not the economic system for you :P Touche :) I will say that, to your point, I have come to believe that there are two forces at odds that are required for a robust and long lived prosperous society: 1. A capitalist system that encourages innovation through competition and 2. A government to check the inevitable concentration of wealth that capitalism naturally trends toward. They most effective ways for a government to check that concentration is through a progressive tax system, and a check on the power that the concentration of wealth creates (eg: forcing employers to pay a living wage instead of using a bully pulpit to extract the maximum effort for the lowest possible cost, as shown by the ""robber barons"" etc of the 1900s). Either way, I'll admit that I am not talking about pure capitalism. However, like the philosopher Georg Hegel theorized, all ideas go through a process of thesis (the first idea: aka capitalism), antithesis (the countering idea: in this case socialism), and then synthesis (the resulting compromise). The synthesis then becomes the new thesis for the system to further evolve upon. It's time for American capitalism to evolve."
