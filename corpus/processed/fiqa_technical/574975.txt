"sorry, my response was supposed to be to the above comment, not yours. My main point was that colonizing in Africa, where there was already a large population did not require bringing in people (which you would need to incentivize to move to, hence offering the ""free"" carrot of property rights to settlers of NA) to extract resources. Instead the British (and other European powers) just used the local populace to extract the resources. The main reason the US and Canada are well off is that property rights were established very early on and this encouraged people to ""invest"" and produce more because the higher production accrued to the producer and the producer would have legal recourse should a negative ""externality"" be put upon them by someone else. Obviously there were other reasons as well, but property rights are huge (this is true globally now) in encouraging people to ""grow"" their assets. Part of the reason Africa is still so screwed up is that many of their institutions and governments are too corrupt to protect their citizens' property rights, thereby discouraging investment and production."
