New car prices being up is kinda misleading. New car sales (volume) is down pretty significantly because used car sales are up. This has pushed the average price of a new car down in order to compete with the used market. However, the price of an average new car is up because the people buying new cars are more likely to be buying a nicer one, as others just buy used. As far as the second part of your last sentence..yeah..these 7 year loans on new OR used cars are fucking terrifying.
