This is a pretty good list, but there are several adjustments I'd make for investment banking specifically. The picture is slightly different for trading, consulting, and other business careers. edit: I know for a fact that all bulge bracket investment banks recruit at Berkeley, UCLA, and CMU for IBD. I would say the big difference between target and semi-target is that, expending minimal effort, you can get into IBD from a target with a 3.5 GPA. edit2: Liberal arts colleges are spread between the three categories. It really depends on the alumni network. **Targets**: Harvard, *Penn*/Wharton, Princeton, MIT, Duke, NYU, Stanford, Columbia, Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, *Georgetown*, Cornell, *Northwestern*, Chicago, *Caltech*, and other top schools I might've left out (Amherst or other good liberal arts schools, I'm less familiar here) **Semi-Targets**: *Berkeley*, *UCLA*, *CMU*, *USC*, Vanderbilt, *Georgia Tech*, UVA, UNC Chapel Hill, Notre Dame, Emory, Michigan, Indiana, Texas, etc. (think great state schools) **Non-Targets**: You get the picture. Less recruiting here, but some might still get recruited at.
