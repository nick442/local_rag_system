"> I went into my store, repeatedly during this 6 week boycott and the shelves were always stocked and being stocked. I guess the daily pictures in the news of empty shelves must have been fabricated then. You are completely delusional if you think 2M people said to themselves ""I'm boycotting Market Basket due to this ridiculous internal power struggle that's going on."" The reality of the matter is that news outlets were running stories daily about bare shelves and all the nonsense going on outside the stores. As a result, customers went to one of the many other options in their area to buy their groceries. Most customers don't give a damn about some random CEO, whose name they had no clue of before this ridiculous incident, being fired."
