I could also see the promise to keep NAFTA with Mexico, as well as the new CETA (free trade agreement between Canada and the EU) being a draw. Plus the fact Canada's started flirting more with China about free trade in the face of NAFTA struggles, as well as Britain flirting about joining NAFTA if Brexit goes poorly. Trade negotiations are another way Amazon could get slammed that's beyond their direct control. Also the fact that it would let Jeff slam Trump, instead of likely having Trump try to take credit, could have some personal appeal. Don't know if it will be enough, but Canada has some real selling points; if Toronto wasn't refusing to give special tax considerations, they might have had this in the bag.
