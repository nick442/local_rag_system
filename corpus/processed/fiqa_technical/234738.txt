So how does that work when you're past retirement age? Do you just keep paying huger and huger sums for insurance, or are you covered by your pension plan (if you have one)? Or do Medicare and Medicaid cover everything (i.e. you don't have to pay)? In which case if you move to Latin America, you could get stuck with a big medical bill, but not if you stay in the States?
