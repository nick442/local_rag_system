Excellent points, especially what you say about why managers like certain people and also how productivity is measured. I suspect many HR systems exist that aim to eliminate this subjectivity in terms of assessing employee performance and post-assessment, dole out rewards (pay, bonus, etc.) as objectively as possible..but of course these systems are far from perfect.
