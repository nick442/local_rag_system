Not just that. I occasionally drive through a rough part of town and see the dumbest people just walking in the street. There is a sidewalk, but let's walk in the busy road instead. I'm going to get video of it, it's insane. Nobody uses the cross walk, just dart out in traffic. This has convinced me that there may be a significant correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic classes. It's not education, it's common sense shit they seem to be lacking. It's really bad in the area I'm talking about. There are sidewalks and cross walks and they are both blatantly ignored by way too many people in the neighborhood I am speaking of. You have to see it to believe it, people are dangerously retarded. In order to not walk 20 feet further to get to a crosswalk and to a bus stop, many people just opt to step out into traffic. I came to this thread just because this is something me and my gf discuss each time we are in this section of town. It's like watching a live version of *Frogger* every 100 yards.
