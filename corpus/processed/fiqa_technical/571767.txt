It is totally a demand problem. Why aren't people buying things in Greece? Because everyone's poor and there is no demand? Why are people buying things in Germany? Because the German Government spent their way out of their recession by spreading money around to the people that needed it. Why did we get out of the great depression? Because those without money were given some, which they then spent. Companies aren't making stuff because no one is buying. Historically, higher taxes on higher income people and businesses equate with a better economy. I don't see any data, o. your side, just lots of hand-waving. http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/optimal-tax-rates-for-generating.html
