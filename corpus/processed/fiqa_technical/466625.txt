No, it doesn't, but overhead of a worker adds up. We are talking taxes, health insurance now, and tons of restrictions and safety issues that OSHA would come after me for, for being an employer. That, and I run the risk of getting an employee that manages to crash tooling all the time, which I lose money on. If I fire him, I'd have to cover unemployment, and the list goes on. That's something that was not mentioned in the article.
