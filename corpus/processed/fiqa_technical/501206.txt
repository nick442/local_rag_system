I know very well how my local government works, and you either don't or are being disingenuous. At the state level, New York is split between Democrats and Republicans, with the Republicans almost always in control of the state Senate, and controlling the Governor's office for 10 of the last 20 years. So it doesn't matter that Republicans haven't won in New York City at the State level, since the State Government is mostly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans in terms of control.
