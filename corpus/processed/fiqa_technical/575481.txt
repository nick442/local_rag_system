I don't expect you to remember the area for the surface of a sphere; I do expect you to be able to take a derivative of a volume. Especially if you are a PhD. Believe it or not, it IS faster than looking it up on the internet. And abilities to do quick back of the napkin estimations are very handy in my field (CS). Also, I noticed that meetings with people who are in command of basic facts are usually faster and more productive than with people who are constantly looking things up on the internet.
