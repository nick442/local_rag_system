Pensions have nothing to do with republicans or democrats. All states and cities and levels of government have problems with pensions, and it's because most taxpayers don't vote, but all government employees do vote. Whether you're republican or democrat, you're going to have to pander to the police union, and the fire union, and all the other unions, and your opponent is going to make unreasonable promises based on erroneous assumption to get the union votes, so if you want to win, you have to do the same. It's not a problem until 40 years later, maybe longer if the population keeps growing, but now here we are and people are having fewer kids and making less money, so good luck kicking the can down the road.
