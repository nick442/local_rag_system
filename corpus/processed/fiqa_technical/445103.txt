"In fact, according to this [npr article](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate), several economic professors assert that eliminating the corporate income tax is one of the mentioned policies that ""economists love"". > If companies reinvest the money into their businesses, that's good. Don't tax companies in an effort to tax rich people. Business taxes discourage capital investments that would otherwise lead to long term productivity growth. As politifact even admitted, it would appear that economists agree that these tax cuts improves economic growth. Unfortunately Politifact has a history of being deceptive with their ""fact"" checking categorizations when in reality there is a significant amount of nuance to analyzing these types of political statements."
