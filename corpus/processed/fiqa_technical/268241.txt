It does raise the question of whether investment bank analysts are doing their job when advising clients on IPOs. Sadly, no one, and I literally mean not a single person, reads a registration statement in its entirety. That's why I find this criticism of the JOBS Act particularly stupid. The problem isn't that enough information isn't getting out, it's that too few investors and analysts actually do anything with it.
