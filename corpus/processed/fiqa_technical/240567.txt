"If you think IBMs recent moves on telecommuting have anything to do with telecommuting, your confused. By forcing many people back into the office, often in a different state, they are implementing stealth layoffs. Just like Yahoo did, they are putting a lot of people in tenuous positions & expecting them to simply quit instead of move. IBM is shaky & laying off a lot of people. MANY IBMers are worried about their jobs, then a ridiculous demand to move to keep your job, without any relocation reimbursements comes along.. You read between the lines & just find another job. There are reporting rules for large scale layoffs & IBM is skirting around that by forcing people out ""of their own free will"". They don't have to pay unemployment, and they don't have to claim them as layoffs."
