"You're assigning more of a cause and effect relationship to commercials then they are intended to have. Its less about ""see the commercial - buy the product"" then establishing brand awareness and mindshare. Thats kind of marketing bullshit, but its proven to be true. If I were to ask you to name brands of soda's that first poped into your mind it would take a long time for you to get to something not produced by Coke or Pepsi, and thats going to influence your buying behavior."
