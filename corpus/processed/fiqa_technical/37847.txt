If all you look at is the people that can afford houses, then you're just primarily looking at banking policies -- who they will make a loan to, and on what loan terms; which are fairly consistent over time. FRED's home ownership statistic is calculated as the number of households that are owned; it makes no distinction between a household with a college grad still living with their parents because they can't afford living on their own. Apartment leases aren't getting cheap either.
