Heartworm in mammals, caused by a hazardous micro organism named Dirofilaria immitis, was once a southern United States disease but has now spread to different parts of the country. This endemic can affect cats, dogs, and ferrets. Since it is a bit different for each species, the heartworm medicines for each mammal differ as well.
