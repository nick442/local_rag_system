This might clear something up: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary One in Corzine's position assumes a legal duty and obligation to make sure that what happened at MF Global *does not happen*. It's not a choice, or a question of who was culpable. Corzine is legally obligated by taking on the position, and if he didn't like it, he could resign and thus terminate the fiduciary duty.
