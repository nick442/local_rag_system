Indeed. Hm, I do not think I have been to Michigan, in fact! I've been to Chcago a couple of times though. I've got a friend an hour off there, so maybe I'll stop by you both next time I visit. Do tell if you come to Europe though, Norway might be far to the North, but Europe is so small that it really doesn't matter much!
