"This is not about better understanding risk. FICO""s clients are the credit grantors, especially banks. They want o make more loans that are not classified as subprime. The credit bureaus put together a competing credit score product. Pressure comes from the banks playing one off the other and lo and behold, what would normally get a subprime rating becomes prime. The banks win and everyone can buy a new car."
