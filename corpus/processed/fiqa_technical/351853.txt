Yep, the wonderful thing about finance is the more you learn the more you start understanding the world around you. I think your question is more related to economics (deficits, surpluses and budgets) however countries can (and do) reissue new bonds to help pay off the old ones. Also keep in mind if a country has say $10trillion in debt, it isn't all due at once so maybe only $10 billion might be due per year
