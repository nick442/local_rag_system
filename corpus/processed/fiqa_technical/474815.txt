Well i used to intern at a WM company finding clients- its not easy. There are prospecting tools like Larkspur and WealthEngine, but they are ridiculously expensive, around $400 a month. Most advisers find clients through references, so you're going to have to network with CPAs, law firms, and other advisers and get them to send you people (what can you offer in return?). There is also the path of cold calling or setting up a website but those inevitably run into FINRA problems. Thus, it tends to be a slow process that is built up over time. The best thing you can do is create a niche for yourself and cater to it- so for example you can specialize in the retirement planning for certain occupations or under certain conditions. However, bear in mind wealth advisory is turning into a zero sum industry and software is going to make it even more compressed in the future. My firm spent thousands of dollars on marketing and even then 3-5 new clients a year is good progress, but these were also large accounts. What is your background?
