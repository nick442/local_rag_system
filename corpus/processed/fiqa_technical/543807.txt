Wrong on so many counts. I have worked with many start-ups, and the well-run ones have all payed their employees good salaries. They also have mostly older employees (30+) with families and kids, and work reasonable hours. If you are worried about some VC guy, then don’t let them scam you. It is their job to squeeze the most equity for the least amount. As long as whoever in charge knows what they are doing, this will never happen. Remember, first and foremost, it is a business, and if you see it not making money, or not having the possibility of making money, then don’t work there. Know what you are getting paid, and know your equity. It can work out great. I know a lot of people who have ridiculous amounts of cash working at start-ups, and they all stick together and use their experience to have repeat successes.
