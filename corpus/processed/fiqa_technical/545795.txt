If you are willing to use one main credit card for shopping, use a grocery points rewards card like PC Financial Mastercard. Pay for the groceries using the card to earn points and use those points to reduce costs. The only limitation is that you must shop at Loblaws, Superstore, No Frills, Zehrs, Fortinos. It works out to $1 = 10 points and 20,000 points = $20. So that works out to spend $1 to earn back $0.01.
