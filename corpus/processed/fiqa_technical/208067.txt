Muscle memory is hard to abandon. Who spent years developing a model understandably wants to maintain control and automatism. Thus my original question: how and at what conditions you transitioned a team from embedded formulas to a proper separation? In my experience when you demonstrate data has become increasingly erroneous as manual updates progressed. And when lack of collaboration features where perceived with enough pain.
