So you don't believe in any workers' rights? Are you joking? You don't believe in a minimum wage, limited work hours, health and safety, paid holidays, maternity/paternity leave, or non-discriminatory equal employment? You're ok with child labour? Once you strip away those laws you get a complete race to the bottom and an awful society that is essentially feudal.
