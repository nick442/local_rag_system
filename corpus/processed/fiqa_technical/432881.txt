>90% of it goes into some investment, like shares or hedge funds, and so out of the real economy. Seeing comments like this get upvoted really makes me suspicious about the grasp people here have on economics. Investments and such are very much a part of the real economy. The point is to increase production and optimize distribution, not maximize swaps of dollars. An investment is money you give to a company so they can do something. Hopefully that money makes them more productive.
