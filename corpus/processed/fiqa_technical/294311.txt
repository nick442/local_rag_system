it is pretty much the same as a normal margin loan but cheaper because you don't own the underlying share.the if the margin is $1000 at 5% you could borrow $20000 in total so the actual amount would be $19000 in total that you would have to pay interest on so at the moment it is 5.1% which is $19000x5.1% /365 days =$2.66 a day and if the share price rises you don't pay extra in interest costs unless you have borrowed more.it still stays at 2.66 a day until you have sold the shares
