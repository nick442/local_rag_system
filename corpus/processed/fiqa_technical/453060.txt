"Time to learn how accounting works! When a company loses money, it does not pay taxes. Just throwing numbers out, but suppose GE earned - $10 billion (that's a negative) in 2009. If in 2010 it earned $5 billion, it would not pay any taxes. It wouldn't pay taxes until it got back to even. Tax refund is nonsense. It is a tax asset, which is reported as ""income"" when it is recognized on the books. So when GE recognized its ""$3.4 billion tax refund,"" it was actually noting that it would not have to pay cash taxes until it made enough to generate a tax burden over and beyond $3.4 billion."
