"I am not trying to ""attribute the current economic climate and the decisions that stem from that with raising tax rates."" I simply think that a higher tax rate for the wealthy will further slow the ""recovery"". I also think that the issue of tax rates is being used to divert the attention of the people from that which is actually killing us: the national debt that is mushrooming thanks to trillion dollar deficits. The tax hikes are used to provoke a fight between red and blue without getting to the crux of the matter. The reality is that at most the government might be able to raise taxes that would generate 200 or 300 billion dollars more in yearly revenue over the short term. Over the long term these taxes will drive capital off-shore and into investments that shelter it from taxes at the same time that the debt continues to increase at over 1 trillion per year anyway! The debate should be this: Do we want to cut Federal spending by 40% now, or do we want to cause an economic and monetary collapse by continuing along with deficits that are 10% of GDP?"
