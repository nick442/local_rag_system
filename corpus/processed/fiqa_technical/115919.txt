I graduated with a Computer Engineering degree in the mid 2000's, my first job out of school paid $70k. Every job I took after that increased my income 10-15%, and I jumped around *a lot*. Anyway, the $250k jobs aren't really a SF thing, you can find them all over if you have enough experience (at least 10 years under your belt). I see $150-175k jobs all the time here in Dallas, if you factor in a generous 401k and other benefits you can get pretty darn close to $250k, and the cost of living here is pretty cheap. I totally agree that the degree isn't all that important once you get started, that's why I encourage people to put effort into cultivating a professional network. Maintain your linkedin profile, and never stay with the same employer for more than 2 years. Jumping ship will give you new skills and greatly expand your professional network. It's not particularly difficult unless you're an introvert (which lots of tech type folks are), but that just means you'll have to work a little harder at it.
