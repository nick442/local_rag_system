"I disagree that they are taxis, which is why I think that consumers should realize they don't offer the same protections. The argument for more regulations is that ""Taxis have regulations to keep people safe."" Well, ok, let's go with that premise. People are OK with ""ride-sharing"" services because of the many added benefits, but they also know that these services aren't taxis. Does everyone who uses them know they might be taking on an additional risk? Probably not. But I'd guess most people would be OK with fewer protections in order to use the added value from these services. Basically, it shouldn't HAVE to be a level playing field. If consumers willingly forfeit the protections taxis offer, then that is their choice."
