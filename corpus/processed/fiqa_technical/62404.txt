Oh Comcast. I once asked for just internet and they said triple play would be cheaper than just internet. I asked to confirm if the entire cost of the bundle a month was cheaper than than just the internet and they said yes. Later down the line I called to disconnect a service and see, turns out they flat out lied to me. I just moved last week into a new place (well, not everything yet) and called to transfer my service. They said I needed to have an install person come out. I called them out and was put on hold for 20 minutes (not exaggerating, I watched the timer) before he got back to me and said yes, it looks like you *can* do the self install. Unhelpful pricks.
