"Went to a top tier business school in Canada and applied to corporate finance positions in the oil and gas industry while everyone else sucked cock to get in capital markets. Not only did half of them drop out trying, but I'm getting paid one of the highest intern rates in the country while working 8 hour 4 day work weeks because I combine my vacation and ""flex"" days to take every Friday off while they work 12 to 14 hrs daily for 75% of my take home."
