I had a client that BoA forced escrows, and then forgot to pay their insurance company, and during the period the client's policy lapsed. While the policy was lapsed, a tree fell on the roof during a storm creating a huge hole. When they contacted their insurance, they were of course told the policy was cancelled for non payment. When they contacted BoA they admitted to their mistake and apologized, but accepted no responsibility in helping the homeowner with repairs. Instead, they gave them back the 2 months of escrows, and stopped collecting escrows for insurance and taxes all together. My client spent all the money they were reimbursed, and had saved up fixing their roof, and couldn't make payments that following month. BoA threw their hands up and said oh well, not our problem. They explained why they weren't able or prepared to pay them on time, and eventually ended up falling 3 months behind, when BoA decided to foreclose on them. Being average consumers that didn't know their rights, they lost their home, but have now filed suit. One could only hope the court awards these people maximum damages. BoA needs to be taken down, and has no business being in existence after all they have done to the consumers.
