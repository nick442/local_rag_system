My Wife: * Shitty genetics, lots of health problems * By her own admission at *least* 10 IQ points down from fetal alcohol/drug exposure/being fed alcohol/drugs by her abusive mother beginning at age 3 (or earlier). Compensates by compulsively writing down everything in lists so she can remember things. * Grew up in rural Indiana, dirt poor, abused physically, emotionally and sexually * Realized at age 12 that she'd be pregnant by 15 if she didn't find a way out * On her own initiative found a relative out of state to live with. Not a happy living situation but it allowed her to at least graduate high school. * Got into college, not a great college but at least college. * Got a degree. * Took a job teaching in an poverty stricken area so she could give back to kids growing up the way she did. Yup. All luck. She never could have done it without all that luck. Oh wait a second, no, she took responsibility for her own life and made something of herself instead of kicking back and waiting for a handout like all her friends and family who, oddly, haven't had much *luck* since and still live in poverty in rural Indiana. Did I mention she makes more money, works less hours and has better benefits than I do?
