I do not quite understand your point. Say you repeal a tax, without reducing public spending. Then if you analyze the economic impact, that does not fairly represent the impact of the tax, now does it? Just think of it this way: Increasing the wealth tax and increasing government spending =- Reducing the wealth tax and -reducing government spending- What do you think?
