The analysis of the report is a different issue entirely. I was just referring to economists incompetence. But while we are on the subject, this does paint a pretty bleak picture for the rest of the year. Combine this with the fact GDP grew 1.9% over the first quarter due exclusively to consumer spending and we may be headed for trouble. Businesses and the government are cutting back on spending. If they aren't creating enough jobs, then consumers will have to inevitably cut spending too, which would contract the economy. Not a very cheerful thought.
