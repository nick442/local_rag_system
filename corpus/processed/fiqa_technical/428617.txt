Well, duh. Notice that the feminists complaining about the wage gap make statements that imply that it's ALL women and ALL men and that the jobs are the same in ALL cases. Really? Got any examples of a female minimum wage being less than the state mandated minimum wage? No. Didn't think so. So at the bottom end of the scale the people getting paid next to nothing are earning just as little as the other people getting paid next to nothing. And at the top of the scale? Well, the WNBA players don't earn as much as the NBA players. Big surprise. But that's the problem with group assessment. You take 100 pro atheles making millions and add them to a hundred thousand people making basically crap, and the whole scale slides
