It depends, I just went through the process, and I switched from a liberal arts background to a Comp Sci field. I had to take a year of prereqs to qualify. I went to Auburn University for undergrad, which basically falls into the not great but not bad category. If you university falls in that range and you have above a 3.0, and can get above a 700 on a GRE quantitative test, you can most likely get funding somewhere. It may be less than ideal, but if you can find a prof that will take you on and you feel it is worth your time, thats really all that matters IMHO. Best of luck.
