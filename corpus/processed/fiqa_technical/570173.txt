If your broker lets you, you could just short GLD shares. The borrow cost is de minimis (it looks like it's basically zero at the moment), and there's no real upfront cost aside from the margin you'd have to post against the position. Don't forget to set a stop, though. You can also look at buying lower-strike puts (the lower the strike, the cheaper the cost). Don't go selling calls - that's probably outside your risk profile.
