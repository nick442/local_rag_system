"Revenue /= profits or profitability. Profits/Revenue=profitability To your ""lifetime revenue"" statement, Apple makes profit on the hardware sale (at a larger margin) and also obtains the same amount of ""lifetime revenue"" potential. Samsung makes great products. I have a Samsung TV. However, they have been in the global market for mobile much longer than Apple, which I think give a strong explanation for their larger market share. Apple is more focused on the mobile side (only one product, essentially) and just now getting into a large global presence at product launches. This is the thing that shows me Apple is the market leader: nobody scrutinizes Samsung like they do Apple (I don't hear anyone saying how stupid a Galaxy ""mini"" phone is). You get a lot of hate when you're doing everything better than the competition as a whole."
