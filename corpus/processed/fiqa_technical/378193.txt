This is a question I asked myself while considering an HSA, and I couldn't find any answers, so now that I have one, I'm answering it myself. I asked a family-friend/investment-banker about it, and he suggested you could only make distributions when on an eligible HDHP, but wasn't completely sure. I was about to post the question here to confirm or contradict his statement when I ran across IRS Publication 969 referenced in another SE question. In it, I found this statement under the 'Distributions From an HSA' heading: If you are no longer an eligible individual, you can still receive tax-free distributions to pay or reimburse your qualified medical expenses. Which indicates that you can still make qualified, tax-free distributions even when you are no longer eligible to contribute. (Unless someone else has evidence to the contrary)
