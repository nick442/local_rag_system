"There are so many activities Uber has engaged in that are consistent with being a ""bag of dicks"" that have nothing to do with fighting for the right to operate in cities that I don't think that's a particularly relevant point. I'd consider being on their side against the cities if they weren't fucking with the compensation for drivers, partnering with Banks to offer predatory vehicle leases to low-credit drivers and turn them essentially into an indentured workforce, or any of the other scummy things they've done over the years. They're beyond a doubt a bag of dicks."
