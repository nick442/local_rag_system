I think you missed his point as well. I see what you are saying, that this will destroy jobs. But the robot still isn't working a fryer. It's still not cleaning the store. It's not able to keep the bathroom. It's not able to make drinks. It's not able to load itself. It CAN mean jobs will be lost. It CAN also mean employee's are able to focus on other things instead of making the burgers. Now with your last sentence I have to ask. If automation is so bad, then why are there more jobs now (The most automated point in human history) than in the early 1900's (A much less automated point)?
