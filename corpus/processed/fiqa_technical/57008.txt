well 30 minutes outside of montreal for the same amount of money you'd probably get a McMansion too in the burbs. I'm talking island core. Problem here if you live outside of the city you litterally have to take a bridge to commute, which instantly means traffic! I'd be curious what you get for that price in the city you're talking about. By 20 min of downtown I meant 20 minutes from downtown by subway, aka the neighborhoods just around the skyscrapers. 20 min from the city would be different. Vancouver is pretty bad. Single homes on a small island (a lot smaller then Montreal) that sell 1 millions + As for Calgary, never went there, but I heard they are a in recession since the oil crude plummeted so house prices slowed down. Now the houses sells around the same price then Montreal, maybe a bit more.
