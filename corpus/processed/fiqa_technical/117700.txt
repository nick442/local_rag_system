As I stated above only 50% of the Bahamian economy is tourism, that's a large portion still but not the 90% you claimed it to be so your credibility is suspect at best and it doesn't matter what their economy is reliant on were are talking about income taxes here and they have a strong enough economy and infrastructure for it to be considered a successful tax free country. Everyone country is reliant on something to keep their economy afloat so to diminish how their system works based on that is ridiculous at best. Tourism is almost always a strong economic policy especially for a beautiful nation of islands.
