I think you just pulled that from your backside. I can assure you, a large amount of tax leaves the countryside and gets sucked into the cities. Besides that, most rural roads are in bad shape, as is the power infrastructure so tell me where is the subsidy? I also pay a fortune for internet, no subsidy there either. So your gloss over, cover all, statement is false.
