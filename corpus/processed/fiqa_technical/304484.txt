Store cards are incredibly generous with their approvals. I recently graduated and started working making around 100k and Bank of America only approved me for a $1000 credit limit.. Macys however approved me for $2000 for everyday purchases and $5000 for large-ticket items like furniture sets. It may not sound so glamorous to have a specific store card but they all allow you to build credit, and a credit card really doesn't let you do anything a debit card can't unless you're buying things you don't currently have the money for. Amazon is also issuing credit cards now, so with one of those there really isn't much you couldn't buy if you needed.
