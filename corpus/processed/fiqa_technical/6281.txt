I can't speak for all business schools but only my personal experiences as a student and then working professional. I graduated from a program ranked in the top 5 nationally and interviewed with several top companies (Intel, Ford, Sandisk, BP) right out of college before selecting the firm I began my career with. As I've moved on to other jobs having this degree has definitely opened doors for me and landed me interviews I might not otherwise have gotten. Plus the program I was in was heavily focused on case studies which is far superior to just lectures and note taking.
