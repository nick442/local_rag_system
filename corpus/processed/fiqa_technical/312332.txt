No one on here will be able to tell you if now is a good or bad time because that would require them to speculate on the future FX rate, if you want a guess try to find some forward FX rates and see but tbh its not worth doing for your situation instead of trying to speculate on the FX rate you would be better off exchanging asap and investing if your worried about making the most of the money.
