What about people who's products aren't bought? People who get paid to make money out of thin air. And what happens when those people make enough money to buy legislation that benefits themselves while hurting people who actually do make stuff for a living? And what happens when those people's activities cause the world economy to come crashing down? And what happens when those people's losses are involuntarily insured by people who had nothing to do with the problem in the first place? This isn't as simple as not buying an iPad because you think Apple charges too much.
