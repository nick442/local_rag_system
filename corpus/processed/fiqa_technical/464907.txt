I don't get it either.. you need to embrace the change and know that companies are basically amoral entities that will do whatever suits their shareholders currently. the impending automation boom will likely cause unemployment to reach peaks we can't conceive of. Basic income might be a way to counter it but I do worry about the type of unrest that being poor without options will cause if we don't have an answer when those jobs go away.
