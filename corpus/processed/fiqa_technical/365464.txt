Having the counties man up and foreclose would be the best thing possible. The new owners could sell the property at a rate that the bank doesn't want to sell it for then the new homeowners can move in, thereby causing one less vacant house. If they foreclosed on this as quickly as some of the banks have they could clean up the entire county and sell the properties in less than 6 months. If all of the distressed property is sold at a loss there will be negative effects on people trying to sell right now - but guess what - a year from now those distressed properties will be off the market and it'll rebound back up to current levels or higher.
