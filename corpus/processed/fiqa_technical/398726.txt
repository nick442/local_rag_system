First it doesn't take $245,000 to raise a child for 18 years. [A child costs only $1000 in their first year of life if you stick to the basics.](http://www.amazon.com/Bringing-Up-Baby-Thousand-Dollars/dp/1495363953/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1408502043&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=Bring+up+baby+dody+mitchell) This is just more media lies base on bullshit and conjecture. Beyond that, by 18, I expect the child to require about $100 a month in groceries. That's $1200 in food everyone. You could spend less than $2400 per year from 13 up.
