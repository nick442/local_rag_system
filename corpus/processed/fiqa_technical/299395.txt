I'd share my google sheet I have comparing the two, but in the interest of keeping myself at least a little private, I'll use a made up situation with real numbers. **Meet Bob.** Front End dev. Single. 5y exp in industry. Likes to live well, in a nice place. Has no expensive hobbies, or otherwise uncommon expenses. [Makes 70k in Indianapolis](https://www.paysa.com/salaries/indianapolis,-in--l). Lives off 50k, puts 20k in the bank yearly. Receives job offer in Valley. Lets say he makes 170k, which is easily possible. With a small company, you might expect ~120k. With a giant, you'd probably be looking at ~200k+. Both numbers include any RSUs. **Salary Sources for San Jose** San Jose was chosen, as many sites simply lump this greater area together as San Jose. Its just easier, and does not make a huge different in the numbers. I'm not a front end dev, but 170 is in the ballpark of my offers with larger companies in the valley, as a personal data point. * [Paysa, which sources salary reports from actual professionals. Typically from more larger, established companies \(Google, MSFT, Facebook, Linkedin, Amazon, etc\)](https://www.paysa.com/salaries/san-jose,-ca--l) * [Indeed, which is much more bottom of the barrel generally speaking. No large company is throwing their job on Indeed.](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Javascript&l=San+Jose%2C+CA) **Cost of Living** Lets see how the COL breaks down. Im using [this breakdown of what people spend their money on](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-americans-spend-most-of-their-money-2017-1) to get ideas. Lets say Bob was spending 60k in Indy, saving 20k/yr. * Rent - $1400/mo apartment, $17000/yr * Food - $20/d, $7300/yr (Bob is a bad cook/lazy) * Transportation - it looks like we can [estimate high and say 10k](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-household-budget) * Taxes - $14k - https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes#FB9ktMO6uP * 10k on other misc. - Healthcare, Entertainment, shit around the house, new socks, etc (breaks down to $190/wk) **Total: ~60k** Lets first try just using COL calculators, which were in the ballpark, but generally high, compared to what I found when breaking down my own expenses. * [Salary.com says 100% COL increase.](http://swz.salary.com/CostOfLivingWizard/Layoutscripts/Coll_Result.aspx) * [Nerdwallet says 100% COL increase for SF \(SJ not available\).](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/indianapolis-vs-san-francisco) * [Numbeo puts Consumer prices, including rent, to be ~50% higher.](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&city1=Indianapolis%2C+IN&country2=United+States&city2=San+Jose%2C+CA&amount=4%2C500.00&displayCurrency=USD) For the sake of argument lets run with the the assumption it costs Bob double to continue his standard of living, based off the above. As you mentioned, and as I fully agree, housing is the biggest expense, so lets check my assumption there. A Zillow search for Sunnyvale proper, very close to all of the tech giants HQs, shows [1BR in good conditions and of decent size \(700sqft+\) run anywhere between 2.3k to 3.5k](https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/Sunnyvale-CA/condo,apartment_duplex,townhouse_type/54626_rid/1-_beds/37.395016,-122.002616,37.348838,-122.064414_rect/13_zm/). Lets plan for the worst, and say its 3.5k. Thats 42k/yr. Living this close (literally biking distance) is a luxury, but lets say Bob hates commuting, so hes willing to pay as such. Lets not forget Uncle Sam, and more specifically, California's uncle Sam, which is extra greedy. He will want [roughly 65k](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes#kMLNaWg8M9), rounding up. The other big expenses are food and transportation. Lets say food is 50% more expensive, going with your argument. 7300 * 1.5 = 11k. Lets say the same for Gas, and general transportation (there is no parking situation in the greater valley - that is a San Francisco downtown city issue, so ignore that). 10 * 1.5 = 15k Same for everything else. 50% markup. That laptop in Indy that cost 2k now costs 3k (absolutely not true, but lets roll with it.) . Healthcare too. 10k * 1.5 = 15k Total San Jose / mid-valley COL: 15k + 15k + 11k + 65k + 42k = 130k. So using high estimates for everything, Bob now spends 130k of his new 170k salary. **He now gets to save 40k, double what he did before**. He also now hopefully has a great name on his resume which will literally open doors, a RSU package which will refresh yearly, **making him earn 500k/yr within a decade**, and will be at the center of his industry. Keep in mind, this is only coming at this from the mindset of someone in tech. If I wasn't in tech, I would never, *ever*, ***ever*** consider moving to the valley unless I was bankrolling some other job. But for tech, the logic is there. I'm sorry if I upset you, but I've literally broken down my expenses and done all this math for my actual situation. Lets not even get started with the other perks. For a large tech company, which is a very realistic goal for someone decently good and easy to work with in tech, you get unlimited vacation, a free for all budget of 2k for training, free lunch and snacks, shuttle service if you live in main hubs (the city, etc), great weather, can ski and surf in the same day - all things you likely do not get in a midwest tech job.
