Then you have two problems. A better solution would be in invest in education and training so that you reduce the number of unskilled, low wage workers. One way would be to get these people out of retail and back into manufacturing, but that is unlikely in the US. Another proposal has been to get people working in coal mines, but I'm not sure if a nineteenth century solution fits a 21st century problem.
