"A substantial portion of Native American poverty is ""reservation poverty."" It is influenced by historical US Indian policy, reservation policies and deals, and certain cultural idiosyncrasies. For example, Cherokee are poorer than the people who reside in the land they were expelled from on the trail of tears. That was an interruption of capital accumulation. The distribution of proceeds of casino, oil, and other land deals wasn't exactly perfect welfare policy. Finally, in some communities there are harmful institutions such as arranged marriages of teen girls. African American poverty has an almost entirely separate history, and is concentrated in different areas."
