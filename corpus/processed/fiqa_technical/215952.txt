TLDR: it isn't as simple as that. I replied to the comment above, since this is something I know about. Hispanics are well paid - it isn't like 15 years ago where some jerk farmer could pay minimum or below and mistreat his Hispanic workers. Hispanics know the value of their labor, have large social networks and will quit if they are mistreated. Also, milk and feed are commodities with set prices so increased labor costs can't be passed to consumers. In my response above I have commented on my experience with American workers in the dairy industry. I think dairy would have to pay like those oil rig job wages - and the industry would disappear because the cost of milk products would be more like gas prices - doubling rapidly. Would you pay $6-10 for a gallon of milk?
