"Black-Scholes! I work as LP in private market and every time I email some IR asking how some of their obscure convertible bond valuation is determined in their quarterly report, they just reply ""based on black-scholes model"" and all I can reply is ""thanks"". I never understand how that really works! Is there anyway you can go through a example, demonstrate how to calculate a simple investment instrument valuation using that model with me? Thanks a million!"
