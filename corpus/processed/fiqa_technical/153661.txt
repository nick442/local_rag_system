You won't be, right after purchase Eddie Lampert asked himself nervously back in the day if he made a mistake buying Sears and he was right back then for the last time. The merger with Kmart was like two sinking ships ramming each other to stay afloat longer, although I think Kmart was the bigger dud at the time. All I think he's trying to keep it afloat anymore is so he doesn't flood the real estate side of the business with too much empty commercial real estate at once. This is his only way to get back even just a fraction of his investment. Sears took its last gasp the moment it sold Craftsman. Now, they're just keeping the body warm and wheeling it around hoping no one will notice.
