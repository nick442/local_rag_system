So we agree about everything! Am I right? Susan is no good, got her job in a corrupt way, her degrees show she was not born interested in security (except for fat pay checks), people with IT degrees are more a match, suitable and qualified for security jobs, especially when they have specific on-hand experience, HR does not care about employees, and real experts have to fight HR and terrible management.. and usually lose because of this whole corrupt setup. Anything you don't agree with me about?
