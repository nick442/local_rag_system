Debt never rots or degrades with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest - nothing in the natural world does this. Biological populations do this when their growth is not checked, a virus in an epidemic situation comes to mind. It grows exponentially until it meets its natural limit - the capacity of its host population to sustain it, which crashes due to the virus' effects. So I'd say debt rots only when it pushes the economy to such extremes that a political revolution encompasses both debtor and creditor and the slate is wiped clean.
