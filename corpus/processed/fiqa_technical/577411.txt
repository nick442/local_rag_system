That's not how business works. Have you ever owned a business? Economics doesn't work that way. The market doesn't work that way. You're saying pretty words that are idealistic but those things would never work practically. You know where has laws like that? Cuba. You should see how they're doing. The reason America is America is because of the system. The most innovation comes from here. You're basically trying to neuter business. No one starts a company to with the intention of making jobs you're doing it do make money and work for yourself, and it grows. And you can't just make rules for public companies to not pay attention to profits, the entire wall street system would crash. And if you think that's fine, you don't seem to know what it is to the economy.
