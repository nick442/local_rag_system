My point was to collect as much tax revenue as possible without letting a loophole curtail the collection of said taxes. How ever that is accomplished is a possible solution I support, if the end game eventually disallows paying your own corp in a different country to bring down your bottom line then so be it. Or maybe we should watch what corps categorize as expenses, this is the magic of the internet, people can kick ideas around, you on the other hand had a virtual boner to find a small hole in my suggestion in which you could try to curtail the discussion. Instead of be anti-intellectual and trying to find tiny flaws in someones suggestions, why not make some of your own. Because last I checked shooting down suggestions while offering none of your own was not a productive practice.
