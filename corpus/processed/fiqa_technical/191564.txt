"It means that at the end of each month, the APY, divided by 365 (366 for leap years) is multiplied by your account's ending balance on each day of that month, then those interest amounts are summed up and paid out. It's exactly equivalent to the ""Average Daily Balance"" method; at the end of each month, the balance of your account on each day is summed, divided by the number of days in the month, then that number is multiplied by the APY / 365 * (number of days in the month). If you write out all these terms and simplify, you'll find the two boil down to exactly the same calculation being performed in different order (possibly with differing potential for rounding error). The only difference between them is whether the daily interest percentage is distributed to each daily balance or applied to the sum, and whether there's an additional redundant pair of steps of dividing and then multiplying by the number of days in the month."
