I'm not saying that Amazon wouldn't end up in Denver. But there's nothing special about Denver. Take a look at Boise Idaho, Salt Lake City Utah, or for non-mountains something like Kansas City Missouri. All cities with decent economies, decent Universities, middle of the country, sizable populations, similar living styles / activities (except for Kansas City with no mountains). Yet Denver is easily 2x the cost of living or more over each of those other 3. There's nothing so special about Denver to make it 2x the price. It's simply over hyped.
