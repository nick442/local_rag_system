"All very true. Keep in mind that the parents of the boomers saw it all coming first and took full advantage of the opportunities. In 1972 the rent prices just plain exploded, just in time for all those 20 something boomers who were leaving home. Those rents ""bid up"" housing prices. I bought an old house in 1972, on rent with option to buy or contract for deed, same thing, for $10,900.00 and sold it for $17k in 77. I would expect to see more ""rent with option to buy/contract for deed"" sales when the flipper crowd realizes they need to address the fact that buyers can be found without using banks."
