"I assume you are referring to Multi-Level Marketing, which have organizational structures that look like pyramids. As others have pointed out Ponzi schemes (often referred to as pyramid) are illegal. The key to multi-level marketing is understanding the true objective. It is not to sell soap, vitamins, cell phone plans or whatever. The key is to understand that you are building a marketing organization. You must motivate and train others to do the same. You cannot rely on others to do it for you, you must do it yourself. If you just are there to sell product, you won't make any money. If you have a lot of friends that you can convince to sign up, you won't make any money. If you can build a marketing organization, you can make a lot of money.

Also if one posses those types of skills, there may be better opportunities in traditional companies. Maybe."
