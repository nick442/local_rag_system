I dont use it yet, but i am building a custom app to run our event staffing business (none of the off the ahelf stuff makes us happy), and we want the option to be able to blast a text to our people when needed, and also to allow them to opt into sms notifications. So i will be building that in. since you asked for feedback, at 3 cents a text you will get no business. That is 4-5 times the going rate of providers like twillio and aws. The only way you add value is if you offer a small free tier (say 200 sms/month for free) or if you make it super easy for the customer. What i mean by that is, to use twillio or aws requures some development chops - ie, you have to connect to their api. Well, tons of business owners do t even know what that is, so if your service allows some non technical retail owner to collect a list of numbers, dump it into a simple box online (and save for later use) and then format a msg and click send, all from a clean browser experience, that would add value. But i also say that having done zero market research, who knows, such a service may exist already. Anyways, curious what you thought someone would pay 3 cents a msg for? Also, if you haven't yet, you should be looking at all of Amazons cloud offerings. If you are building anything technical, look at their Lambda product. It allows super cheap, serverless functions; basically you write the app, call it, and only pay for the time it runs. On demand, highly scalable, and you dont have to maintain a pricey server that might sit idle for houra at a time.
