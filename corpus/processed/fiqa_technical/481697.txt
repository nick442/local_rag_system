Even if the EV were powered solely by coal (the dirtiest energy source), it would still be significantly cleaner than an ICE. I read somewhere that it would emit 40% less carbon. In addition, the carbon intensity of the grid has been falling as renewables are increasingly deployed. Put solar on your roof and your drive on sunshine.
