People like to shit on Taco Bell but I'll be damned if much of their menu isn't pretty damn good considering the cost of it. Given, I wouldn't (and don't) eat it all that often, but you can really stuff your face for $3 and some change with food that is actually pretty good. Got me through some financially rough times in my late teens/early twenties. Nowadays I can afford to upgrade my beef burritos to steak, boi! Always assumed it was just another American fast food chain that made it's way across the pond.
