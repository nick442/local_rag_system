you dont understand the way markets work if you think that. speculators exist in every market. there are FX speculators, does that mean that the the US dollar, yuan, or yen is a game of musical chairs? If an asset or commodity has a use for everyday people, then they are going to buy that asset or commodity. Speculators or traders bring liquidity and reduce volatility to make the price less volatile so everyday people will be able to use it. Bitcoin is a new technology and people are trying to figure out what its value should be. This is r/finance and I have to explain this? Obviously there are many people out there who find value in a decentralized digital currency.
