I'm probably being unduly harsh, but I only have my experience to draw on. Windshield wipers that the dealer could never get to work right Replacing brake lights every couple of months - dealer couldn't fix Am electronic 4wd system that fails twice, necessitating a transmission replacement at 30k miles. This was a brand new vehicle, all under warrant protection I used to travel a lot for work, with a lot of rental cars, and driven a lot of different cars. The GM products just always seemed a little more rattley with the worst seats for me. I had the misfortune of driving a Cruize in Europe for a few weeks and I've felt church pews that were luxurious compared to that thing - though the diesel motor (Opel made) was nice. I compare that to the Toyotas I've driven for a couple hundred thousand miles with nothing but maintenance, and that's where I struggle. Maybe they are better. But my experience hasn't gotten there yet.
