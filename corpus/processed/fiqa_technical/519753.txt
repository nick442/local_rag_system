This is news? Keynesians were making noise about this years ago and nobody listened. There were headline articles and blog posts in the NYT in 2010 and nobody listened. Krugman clamored on about it for all of 2011 and nobody listened. OWS screamed for a year and nobody listened. And now Bloomberg rehashes what has been said all along and people finally pick up on it? Give me a fucking break. We're years late to this party and a lot of damage has been done as a result. I'm glad the facts are finally getting some of the traction they require but wow, what a fucking joke.
