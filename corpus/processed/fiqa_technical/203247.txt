You should talk to a tax professional in your area. It seems like you should start filing your returns. In the US there are certain income thresholds that need to be attained before a return is required, though it's often thought of as best practice to file anyway. Also in the US there are programs designed to encourage delinquent filers to begin filing again, which may include penalty/fee reduction for voluntarily filing. Somehow I suspect Canada has similar programs. If you stand to inherit a sizable amount of money it seems that you should have a history of tax returns in order to minimize the number of questions that are asked should the money come your way. I'd talk to a tax person before consulting an attorney. From the tone of your question the Canadian tax authority hasn't initiated anything against you. You just want to understand the best course of action regarding your tax situation.
