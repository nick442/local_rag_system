"Great topic, as interest rate swaps are one of the most commonly used derivatives by bank. In the simplest form, an interest rate swap is an exchange of payments between two parties. Say party A has a $100 loan with a fixed 4.25% interest rate, and party B also has a $100 loan with a variable rate, lets say prime plus 1% (prime is 3.25, so B is also paying 4.25%). Party A thinks interest rates are going to go lower and wants to lower his interest expense, while party B is a small company and doesn't want to be exposed to variable interest rates and needs to have a steady cash flow to project his budget. Party A and B agree to enter into an interest Rate swap for a notional amount of $100 where Party A agree to pay B prime plus 1% (fixed for floating) and party B agrees to pay A 4.25% (floating for fixed) for some period of time they agree upon (usually the maturity of the loan). Now from the start, the swap has a market value of $0, since A and B both receive the same as they are paying. As interest rates move, the value of the swap moves. Say interest rates fall, and prime is now 2%. B still pays 4.25% to A (he agreed to pay a fixed 4.25% no matter what) and A only pays 3% (prime plus 1%) to B. Remember the terms of the individuals loans did not change, so A owes $4.25 to his bank and B owes $3 to his bank. Party A uses the $4.25 from B to pay his bank, and pays $3 to B. Party A has lowered his interest expense by $1.25 and his position is considered ""in-the-money"", which means he is benefitting from the transaction. Party B gets $3 from A but still owes his bank $4.25. In reality, the transaction nets out to B paying A $1.25, rather than both A and B paying each other different amounts. B is ""out-of-the-money"" because in aggregate he is paying A. The market value of the swap would be the present value of that $1.25 benefit A receives, discounted using expected future interest rates (the same number but negative is the value to B). Please ask if you have additional questions or need clarifications."
