"The instructions do specifically mention them, but not as exclusive plans. Pension and annuity payments include distributions from 401(k), 403(b), and governmental 457(b) plans. The instructions also mention this: An eligible retirement plan is a governmental plan that is a qualified trust or a section 403(a), 403(b), or 457(b) plan. 414(h) plans are ""qualified"" plans. Employee contribution to a 414(h) plan is qualified under 403(b). Report it there and mark it as ""Rollover"". Talk to a licensed (EA/CPA licensed in your state) professional when in doubt."
