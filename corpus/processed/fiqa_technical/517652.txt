The meaning was plenty clear and that's why I pointed out you're simply arguing [semantics](http://www.fallacyfiles.org/etymolog.html). No reasonable bystander would read that and instantly jumped from humans, which with context implied human *labor*, to slavery. Disconnecting a word from context does not enhance meaning, it distorts it. And completely derails the point from something productive to useless.
