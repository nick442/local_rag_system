The problem is that some of us want to design an engine that is fair and stable. Others just want to win. Once some people know who has a chance of winning, they no longer see it as a space in which they are wanting to design something fair, they are seeing the design problem as part of the competition space. It's really important to teach people from a young age that the rule space itself is a sacred trust and that one must design a system so that they would be happy being any of the players in the system, not just the player they know themselves to be.
