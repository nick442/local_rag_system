"I suppose for the simple minded it is. ""Less taxes = less revenue = oh no, disaster!"". Which may be true for a small state budget that is often strapped for cash and struggling to get by. Cut revenue at the state level and vital programs suffer. The federal government on the other hand is a behemoth. It has a lot more sources of revenue than states do. It also has more programs and waste that can be cut, before even considering cuts to social services and entitlement programs, like regulatory agencies. Down vote me all you want but I find it preferable to have tax money in the hands of citizens and businesses rather than the government. The more money you give to government the more they're going to spend."
