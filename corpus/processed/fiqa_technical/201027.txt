Scott Galloway has a lot of interesting ideas about Amazon and how once they reach 20% share in a market segment then the competition is dies off. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8IOxCUSOWM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MVKAXcemXc I don't doubt Amazon's growth, but the PE always seems too high for me. I can't bring myself to buy, but maybe it's good timing to ride it through the retail apocalypse. I can't believe the hype of Prime Day. People are into it.
