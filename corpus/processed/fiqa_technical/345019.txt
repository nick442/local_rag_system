>Lol and a company spending more than they need to on labor is reality? Why do we have a capitalistic society? Because capitalism is awesome and because it always leads to the best results? No. We use capitalism because we have no alternatives that are superior. This of course does not mean it is a flawless system. This twisted notion that 'pure capitalism' somehow will always yield better results than a regulated/controlled capitalism is insane. Unfettered capitalism will unequivocally result endless conglomeration of power until we have a unified class of rich that control everything, much the way China operates. China operates under the pretenses that it is communist, but the reality is, it's the exact opposite, it is true free market capitalism, and as a result, the government has been completely overtaken by businessmen who then pass laws and control the citizens. I don't want this to happen in the United States.
