Transfer of Money from you to Your Mother is Tax Free. i.e. This will not be considered as income for your mother as there is NO work done. This would be considered as Gift and would fall under Gift Tax. As per Gift Tax you can give unlimited amounts to close relative. Mother is considered as close relative. The tax rule is same whichever option you follow. You would need to maintain proper paperwork, should there be any query from Income Tax department. Any interest / income your mother generates on this will be her taxable income. You have also mentioned that you are repaying some loan for your relative, again the paper work should be very clear when your mother is transfering the money to your relative. The interest you pay back maybe taxable to your relative depending on paperwork. Edit: Elobrate OP's edit to question From your point of view, once you have given the funds to your Mother and call it gift; it ends. What your mother does with the money invests, spends, etc is not your liability. However if your mother is tranferring money to person's who are not defined as relatives under Gift Law or the interest your relatives get are all taxable events to them.
