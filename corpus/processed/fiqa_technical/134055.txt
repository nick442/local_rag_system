That's not the problem here. The problem here is that monetarists and Keynesians don't differentiate between what you actually invest in. Their equations literally state that a bridge to relieve congestion in New York will produce the same growth as the Bridge to Nowhere. Unbelievable bullshit when put in the correct terms.
