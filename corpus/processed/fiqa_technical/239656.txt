Is it just me, or does it seem like Jia Yueting is the stupidest self-made billionaire of all time? The guy just seems like an unprecedentedly financially naive and arrogant moron. He's Chinese Reed Hastings throwing money at the idea of being Chinese Elon Musk too. Starting not one but TWO ambitious car companies competing with fucking Tesla as a division of a company whose business has nothing to do with automobiles, risking bringing down a cash cow with two absurdly ambitious (and even cannibalizing!) startups? What the fuck is he thinking? How the hell did this illiterate hack start a company and make billions in the first place?
