I agree with your title, but am confused with your comment. I am bullish on Gold in the long run. I believe that current market fundamentals are poitning towards a longterm bullish trend on Gold. These fundamentals are: 1. a weak USD. Although the USD has appreciated as of late, I believe this will be short lived and reversed as soon as the situation in Europe relieves itself. Once this happens, i forsee net outflows in the USD causing it to revert back to its long term deprciated trend, evidented by its performance (in real terms) over the past decade. 2.QE3 Similar to the above post, once the printing presses are turned back on, we will see all risk assets take off, a depreciation in the USD and of course a rise in the price of bullion 3.negative real rates As long as rates stay low (which they will for a while) Gold will have a cushion and will only push higher, given its historical negative correlation with this economic indicator. 4.Central Bank Buying If central banks are buying..I want in!
