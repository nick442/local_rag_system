This article is a great support for the Shangri-La diet. The author argues that your body has a target weight it wants to be at, and will stimulate you into maintaining that weight. He goes on to say that by consuming flavorless calories (one source given is extra light olive oil), you convince your body to reduce it's target weight, making it possible to eat less and not be hungry. I can vouch that following the extra light olive oil routine definitely makes you less hungry, but you still have to have the discipline to not eat when you're not hungry. One drawback is that you have to keep following the routine even after you lose weight. One interesting point is that the Shangri-La method worked really well for people with developmental disabilities.
