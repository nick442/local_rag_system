Wow, I don't believe it for a second, the admins are allergic to making money. This is right up there with Instagram being a billion dollar company..some people are smoking some good shit. These parts are relevant, the rest is wild speculation, Advance Publications might be trying to drum up some buyers for a sell. > By FORBES’ estimate Reddit is a paragon of thrift, spending just $7 million a year to support a 22-person payroll and 75 servers rented from Amazon’s cloud. > Value Reddit strictly on the basis of its skimpy current revenue and its inability so far to turn a profit, and the site probably falls short of even $50 million. Digg ended up being sold in pieces for a reported total of $16 million. Cost $7 mil a year to run, doesn't turn a profit, in an industry where new competition pops up daily..sounds like a winner to me.
