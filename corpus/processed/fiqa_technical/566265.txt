Yeah, that part is truly brutal. Even if you really did the best things imaginable to lower tuition costs, like AP courses in high school, AA at junior college, then state school for your bachelor's, you're still easily looking at $20k in debt. Amazon pay at a warehouse simply isn't going to cut it.
