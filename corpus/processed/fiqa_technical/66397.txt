"~~Not only would it be illegal, but~~ the $10k doesn't even sound like it would be a ""bonus"" of any sort for doing so. From the article: > If a restaurant opts in, it'll get a $10,000 gift from Visa (V) **to help pay for technology upgrades**, the company said. Emphasis is mine. --- **Edit ::** I was curious about this, so I started doing a little reading-up on businesses not accepting cash. It turns out that it **is legal** to refuse cash, but only if there is no debt to pay. If you get your product first, then there's a debt to pay, and the business must accept cash. If the customer pays first, then there's *no* debt to pay (the customer is already paid up), so the business *does not* have to accept cash. Link for the info: https://u.osu.edu/zagorsky.1/2016/08/05/do-businesses-have-to-accept-cash/ There are plenty of additional articles that talk about it, but I opted to link this one as it's a recent article by an economic researcher at a university. I figured that, if I'm going to link something, a primary source is probably better than a news agency reporting on it. It's kind of interesting, really, and I wonder how it would work in a place such as a restaurant. You typically get your food first, and pay later. This creates a scenario where the customer is in debt to the restaurant, so the restaurant would theoretically have to accept cash. However, if you pay first, *then* get your food, you don't have an outstanding debt, and thus the restaurant doesn't have to accept cash. Looking at the article again about Visa's offer, two of the types of groups it mentions are cafes and food trucks, which typically require you to pay before you get your food. This would mean that the customer isn't in debt to the service, and thus cash can be refused. How that would work out at a restaurant is another question entirely, as the vast majority of the American restaurant-goers expect to pay *after* they eat. This may be why the article specifically mentions *small business* restaurants. A local mom'n'pop restaurant is going to have a much easier time going cashless than a national chain would (and the $10k would do more for them to update their systems than it would for the national chain). Additionally, people might be more willing to accept the different practices at a mom'n'pop restaurant than they would at a nation-wide chain. Definitely an interesting bit of reading, and a fun bit of learning!"
