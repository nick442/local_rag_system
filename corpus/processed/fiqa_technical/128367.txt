The problem is, we already have an ID with a number attached to it. Except, even there getting a new ID number doesn't help much. Because, in many cases the business will happily take the old number as well. In other words, it's not a problem with the SSN so much as it is that institutions validation and the fact that proving fraud is left to the victim. If, instead, the financial institution had to prove everything, we would have multiple layers of security. Of course, at that point Equifax et al would not exist in its current form. Cryptographic tokens work reasonably well that it's something in someone's possession, and can be put into ID cards pretty easily. The problem is, you can't put them on forms.
