I got a new phone last month, my fourth contract renewal with AT&T. Not long after that, they started text spamming me relentlessly. I called twice, and basically got the same response, that they won't stop the spam messages. I have a good memory and I won't be renewing 2 years from now. I have no sympathy for them.
