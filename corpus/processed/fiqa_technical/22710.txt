How is it a write off? I write off my mortgage interest, it reduces my taxable income, but has no impact on my EBIT. If I paid workers more, my EBIT would go down and, due to this, my taxable income would go down. One is independent of my earnings, the other is a function of it. The former is a write off, the latter isn't, right?
