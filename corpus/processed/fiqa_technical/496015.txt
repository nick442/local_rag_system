Opening Bank Account in US without physically being present is difficult. I'm having number of clients in USA to pay for my work, but Iâ€™m really confused to get money from my clients to my saving bank account. You can get money via PayPal or if they are repeat customers, ask them to send via remittance services like Money2India or Remit2India etc.
