"> Don't slam it with some aphorism about how we should ""work to live"" when some people feel their work is their ""purpose""(the musks of the world). I wasn't slamming the idea of working with purpose because you love the job. That's a great way to live and I wouldn't ever knock it. I was slamming the idea that you're not successful if you make less than $500k. I was trying to give examples of people who live successful lifestyles without huge salaries. Salary is relative, salary is not necessary to live a fulfilled life."
