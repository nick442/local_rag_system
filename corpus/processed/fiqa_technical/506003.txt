The menu is too big again. Mcdonald's basically created the streamlined menu when they realized no one ordered hot dogs etc at their first restaurant. We saw this problem arise 8-10? years ago., they pared down the menu and came back. Not only does the bigger menu confuse the customers but slows down service.
