i live in China and you would expect the food prices to be cheap right? they aren't. Cheap groceries you get at the local ethnic markets in the US are WAY cheaper (but slightly better quality than here). Expensive food that's high quality is either non-existent here or SUPER expensive. Hands down, almost every good in the US is cheaper than anywhere else in the world, if you want it real and not fake that is.
