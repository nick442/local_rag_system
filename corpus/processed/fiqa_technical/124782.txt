> Good analogy is soft drinks - if Warren Buffet puts money into Coke, that doesn't mean Pepsi is going out of business. Coke and Pepsi are both very well established and very stable. Uber and Lyft are relatively new and are about to go through a huge change with automation. If either of them don't automate well and do so soon they will fail. There's not a lot that of innovation required from Coke or Pepsi to stay on the top.
