"I see the problem more that the controversial is banned. The mods took control of this subreddit under a pro-banking industry agenda. To filter out criticism of the banking industry resulting from 2008 event including ""debate the morality of central banking"". r/finance is the most successful astroturfing of reddit I know of. This has led to a filter of the controversial. Throughtful, philosophical and scholarly posts [such as this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/ncez0/greece_will_default_minutes_after_its_last_major/) are either banned or pre-filtered. The concern with pre-filtering things that the mods think are wrong, is that the mods haven't claimed any special expertise that makes them more knowledgeable than every submitter. Personally, I've only been attacked ad hominem-ly without a discussion of presented ideas or concepts by mods here. So it is possible to be too close-minded. Leads to insular views without discussion."
