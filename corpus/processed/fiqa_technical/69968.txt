Sorry, bro(or derpina). I already have a line of awesome people I wish to God I could hire. Currently have one in line ahead that I hope I can hire to telecommute in the future. It's rough right now out there. I hope I can make money so I can give it away to those who have need. I personally have a hard time believing that unemployment is at merely 8.3% or so. That's just bunk. Democrat or Republican, you'd have to be an absolute fool to believe those numbers.
