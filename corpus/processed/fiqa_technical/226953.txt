Found the girl who's never flown from the east coast to the west coast, gone right to a convention center to set up for a tradeshow, then gone to a hotel for a 5 minute shower before meeting clients for dinner and up at 6am for the show. I've done it coach and I've done it business class, and I gotta say, business class, having just that extra bit of legroom to not get cramped. it was easier to sleep and it translated to more energy and ability to get things done.
