"> You mentioned the customer experience randomly in some parts, then threw in Wikileaks in others. Only random if you don't understand what I'm saying. But I'll just give up instead of repeating again. > Visa and Mastercard have relationships with banks and/or processors, who have relationships with merchants. [â€¦] Cardholders aren't Visa and MC's clients I still don't understand. Why is the indirect relationship merchant->processor/bank->VISA so much stronger than cardholder->bank->VISA? Presumably VISA also tell banks not to allow *hardholders* to do illegal stuff with their cards? >> The WikiLeaks blockade was clearly political. What makes you say otherwise? And this is political. > So your argument is that anything political is the same as anything else political? No, it's that the wikileaks thing was clearly political, and trying to say ""that's not relevant because it was a legal matter"" doesn't make sense since everything after ""because"" was wrong. > As long as their reasons for doing so aren't discriminatory based on status in a protected class, they are (and should be) allowed to refuse service. I'm not saying they're legally in the wrong."
