To be fair you are right in thinking that consumers will always try to find the best option, the point that people are arguing here is that this consolidation will likely push prices up in physical retail stores that specialize in outdoor goods. Which kind of sucks if you like going into stores and browsing the isles because you are now going to have to pay a premium for that experience. Honestly, shopping online (esp. Amazon and eBay) is actually cheaper now for most things IMO, this is just accelerating the death of physical retail.
