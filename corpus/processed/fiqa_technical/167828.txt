"I don't think any of us claims pizza is an American creation instead of an Italian one. Pizza *is* an Italian creation. We are only saying that the regular pizzas they have in the US are mostly non-Italian style, and shouldn't be count as real authentic Italian food. It'd be like saying pastas are an Chinese creation. Pastas was inspired by the Chinese, but the Chinese didn't create pastas, they have [mian] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_noodles ), which means noodles. Point is, if someone change something too much and that thing becomes a ""new/different"" thing, we will call that person the creator and use its terms."
