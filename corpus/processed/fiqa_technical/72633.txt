The $500 minimum is a policy of the ASX. As such any broker that offered a different policy would not be offering direct purchase of exchange traded shares. Note however that this policy applies only to the initial purchase. From the CMC FAQs: The ASX requires a minimum parcel of $500 to be traded if you donâ€™t currently hold that particular security. Once you have $500 worth of an individual security, you can purchase any value of shares you like.
