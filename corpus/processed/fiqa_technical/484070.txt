>> “Nobody with more than 5 years experience has a cybersecurity degree — they didn't exist 5 years ago,” one Reddit user, /u/fishsupreme, wrote in a top-voted comment about Mauldin's retirement. “And a Computer Science degree from 5-10 years ago didn't cover security topics any more than an MFA in music composition did.” [From a recent Washington Post article on the topic of qualifications.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/09/19/equifaxs-top-security-exec-made-some-big-mistakes-studying-music-wasnt-one-of-them/?utm_term=.d6482410b0f0) > However, do you understand that Information Security is a highly specialized technical engineering field that requires tons of specific knowledge and understanding of technologies, protocols, cryptography, database, etc, etc, etc? Yes, and a C-level position requires administrative and personnel management skills and understanding of security policy, not specialized technical engineering knowledge of protocols, cryptography, etc. (And not database lol.) > she has no clue about security. When have I ever defended her actions? My only point is that the undergrad degree doesn't matter. > So give me a possible way how Susan got her job. Five years at HP, a year at Sun Trust Banks, four years at First Data Corporation.. that's like, ten years in technology and financial companies during which time it's impossible that she had gained any experience in technology or security that could have gotten her through the interview process > If contractors are more expensive than in-house employees, nobody will use contractors. omg where to start. I'll just chalk that comment up to inexperience and lack of understanding of total staff costs over time. (Which is weird, because you then went on to point out that employees cost more over time, demonstrating the benefit of using contractors..)
