Thank you for the wonderful response. I actually work out 4-5 times a week and have been for the past year or so(it's helped my productivity ten-fold). I think I am going to finish up the Python codeacademy course in order to understand the basics of syntax and then I will continue from there. If you have any other suggestions; I am quite open to them! Thanks!
