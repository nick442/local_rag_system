"It's all on cable (AMC, Showtime, Starz, HBO, FX). Sure it's a limited number of channels but it's still more content than anyone can digest. Those five channels produce a ton of original content.

And the good stuff is better than the old good stuff. Justified kicks the shit out of the Rifleman. Mad Men is another league than Dallas. I watch a fuckton of TV and there is more than I can keep up with (things that are of decent quality or better). Whining that TV sucks is class reddit ""I hate that things I don't like exist!"""
