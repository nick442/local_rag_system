"Putting middlemen into the equation is never going to reduce costs, but this is what the U.S. did in the 1970s when they made it much easier for new HMOs to be established and grow. Now the middlemen (HMOs, insurance companies, and their paid political toadies) have almost choked the market to death and they have no incentive to release their death grip because the status quo is profitable for them. The only way out is the single-payer solution and *everyone* -- business, government, individuals -- benefits from this *except* the middlemen and their bought-and-paid-for ""representative"" politicians. This situation of barely functional health care in the U.S. is the perfect example of what happens when politicians are manipulated to make policy based on who gives them the most money and until the money/profit element is removed from governance it is only going to get worse. Wealth as free speech? Yelling ""Fire"" in a packed theater is free speech too, but we don't allow it and for good reason."
