Well, it sucks that your landlord doesn't try to make you happier, and it doesn't sound like a very good place to live for very long. But I don't really see reasons for getting pissed or calling him a slumlord - I mainly just see reasons to move out. Really, what you've said is no reason to be pissed off at him. He didn't build it? Who the hell builds their own home or apt? Maintains to the minimum required by the lease? Well, that's certainly not the definition of a slumlord, and at least he's basically doing what is required. It's nice if he does more, but as you said, he's doing what's required. Upgrading falls into the last category.. if he doesn't feel that it's worthwhile upgrading, why should he do it? You know, just because he owns the place doesn't mean he's rich; he may be just getting by, and may need all his extra income to support his sick mother or something. It's not fair to call someone like that a slumlord - maybe the ones you mentioned in Allston or Brighton are. I don't think I've ever actually lived in any rental that was upgraded while I was living there. And I usually didn't want to be bothered with it anyway. As long as everything worked like it did when I moved in, that was all I wanted or expected.
