Ok, the point you're missing is that installed base is irrelevant. Yes, there's much more total installed natgas than solar/wind, but that's not important for calculating the impact on coal retirements. To displace coal, you need to install something new. That new generation means coal needs to be less profitable or get turned off. So the real question is how much solar/wind have been installed in the last 5 years compared to natgas. These new installations replace coal that used to be burning. Again, early in the thread you stated that solar/wind had very little effect. That's not true, they have a very significant effect. Natgas deserves significant credit, but certainly not all of it.
