"Well you are right about the market speaking but what you got wrong is what the market was talking about. The market does not dictate jobs, it does dictate production and sales. If they can produce and sell without jobs then they will. As far as coal being dead, far from it. Here are the actual numbers for global coal use. The unit is 1000 short tons. 1980 3,740,690 1981 3,814,908.00 1982 3,942,541.00 1983 4,051,196.00 1984 4,250,713.00 1985 4,445,314.00 1986 4,533,378.00 1987 4,692,590.00 1988 4,863,277.00 1989 4,816,369.00 1990 4,944,566.00 1991 4,778,631.00 1992 4,647,853.00 1993 4,806,460.00 1994 4,841,132.00 1995 4,938,585.00 1996 5,054,008.00 1997 4,961,120.00 1998 4,923,914.00 1999 4,989,302.00 2000 5,269,613.00 2001 5,350,284.00 2002 5,489,468.00 2003 5,917,536.00 2004 6,406,380.00 2005 6,836,650.00 2006 7,194,744.00 2007 7,560,933.00 2008 7,697,183.00 2009 7,638,344.00 2010 8,027,355.00 2011 8,438,300.00 2012 8,647,950.00 2013 8,701,070.00 As you can see the market has spoken and the conclusion is the exact opposite of what you claim. Not only is coal not ""dead"" it is surging. At current rates of use the proven coal reserves of the world will last well over 150 years. I suspect you will die and still be in denial about coal not being dead yet. Your kids will probably also be dead before coal dies and likely your grandkids as well."
