"Labor is the only thing that has value. What do you have other than your time, your abilities-- that is, your labor potential? The economy is made of *people*, not *trading*. Marx talked about this ""inverted world"" of capitalism, where a strange focus is given to exchange value, as opposed to use value. Expending and comprehension of human effort is all that we have; as late capitalism begins to collapses and post-capitalism rises (as in the startup world and some other segments, where laborers have a decision-making stake in their company and work for equity/salary as opposed to hourly slavery (i.e. they ""sieze the means of productions"" in modern terms)), we realize our maps are now ""worth"" more than the territory they represent."
