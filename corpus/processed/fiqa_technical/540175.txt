For example at my school, Cal State Fullerton, you are able to visit fullerton.edu/openuniversity to check for classes you might sign up for. You're required to pay for the course up front and in person at the college. There are both on campus and online classes there. Each university will be different though. If your parents are willing to spend the money, go for it. $: Around $1000 Also, you might be able to enroll in a community college and do the same thing. The biggest difference is the lesser amount for a course. $: Around $200 At 15, I think the smarter option is free courses that will alliw you to feel out your interests. Good luck!
