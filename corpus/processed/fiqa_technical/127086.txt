This is probably exactly how this type of thing developed in the first place! It's a relatively recent (last 30-40 years) accounting concept and was only really developed because, like you said, someone somewhere said, wait a minute let's break this down economically. Also, the larger the company, and more divisions, more parts, more countries, varying tax codes, etc. the exponentially more complex this stuff gets. One example that comes to mind: Verizon's back haul division operates at a huge loss because they charge so little to the cell division for line usage. The cell division makes 100% of the companies profits (although Vonage is technically a 40% minority shareholder which really complicates things) because it's costs are so low. If Verizon spun off the back haul division; however, the cell division would make a lot less. Most likely Verizon wants to lose money on back haul operations as it gives them political leverage (pipes are full, we need subsidies). Just thought you might find it interesting!
