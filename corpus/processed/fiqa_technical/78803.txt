So let me see if I'm following. You're only vaguely aware of the situation, unaware of the person we're discussing, and don't even seem to have read the article. Why do you think your opinion holds weight? Sure, we could come up with a hypothetical where this makes sense, but that has nothing to do with the situation at hand.
