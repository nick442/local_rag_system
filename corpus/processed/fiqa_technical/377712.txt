This does feel like market penetration pricing, though. Amazon is hungry for market share, benefitting customers is a side-effect. No doubt things will stabilize once they hit the market share they want. Though I'd also like to think that due to their diverse portfolio, they are keeping prices low because they have the risk-bearing revenue streams to do so!
