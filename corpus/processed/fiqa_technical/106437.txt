"Seriously. I've been in nonprofit for 8 years. I just reentered the market after two years of grad school and was shocked. Full time 40 hours a week program managers listed under ""Americore programs"" offering $1,000 a month as a stipend, with Masters degree to qualify. Those jobs were $30 -$50,000+ five years ago and that was on the low end. The level of job rebranding in this market is unbelievable. Employers should be ashamed. The same with ""internships"". I really believe labor laws need to start regulating this practice."
