"Here's a tip, man. If you find yourself starting a sentence ""I'm not racist, but.."" or ""I'm not homophobic, but.."" or ""I'm not sexist, but.."", just stop before you get to the ""but.."" part. It almost always proves the first half of your sentence incorrect. In this case, you finish the sentence with a generalization of women, that three women will create drama whereas three men will not. That is sexist. If someone said the same thing regarding hiring black people, you would probably consider that racist, right?"
