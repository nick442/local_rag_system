"I would strongly recommend the following: How to Win Friends & Influence People, 10x Rule, Built to Last, Good To Great, & The Innovators Dilemma How to Win Friends & Influence People completely reshaped how I approach interactions with people both in & out of the work place - its worth picking up your own copy so you can refresh yourself every now & then. The Innovators Dilemma by Clayton Christensen is one of those classic MBA starter kit books about product ideation & distruptive technologies in the market. 10x Rule is a solid ""beat your chest & take on the world"" type of self improvement books. I'd suggest the audio book as the guy's energy is quite compelling. Built To Last & Good To Great are all about organizational leadership & are just all around great books if you're into team building. I'd also suggest googling ""Pragmatic Marketing"" & picking up whatever they're plugging as the next latest & greatest book on product leadership. It's very much geared towards SaaS product management & agile development but there's good lessons to be learned for all professions. Also a Random Walk Down Wall Street is a go-to as well as pretty much anything by Warren Buffet."
