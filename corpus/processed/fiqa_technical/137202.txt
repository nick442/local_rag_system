">If you have more people in an insurance pool, premium costs go down, which is the whole point of the individual mandate. The costs depend very, Very, VERY much on WHO the people in the ""pool"" are -- actuarial data shows that older people (almost invariably and by definition) have significantly higher costs, ergo this is why their premiums have been higher (or if a particular pool has an inordinate number of older people in it, why everyone in that pool's premiums are higher, because they are essentially an *average*; and the younger members are in essence subsidizing the older ones -- conversely if a firm has almost entirely young, single people, premium costs are significantly {*significantly*} lower). One of the things the legislation does though is place an artificial limitation of the premium price differential -- ergo younger people will (across the board) be seeing a HUGE increase in premium costs (because the law is essentially mandating a major increased operating LOSS on the older pool members, the cost WILL be shifted to the younger people). End result is that premiums for younger people will increase several times over -- which will make buying a policy (which in the past was relatively cheap for young & healthy people) a significantly more difficult burden -- and that will *naturally* make paying the ""fine"" far more financially pragmatic. This is especially true since the OTHER provision of the law is that known pre-existing conditions cannot be used to exclude or change the premium cost -- so, should the individual be diagnosed with something they can, after the fact, still purchase coverage. Basically it is like being able to buy a lottery ticket AFTER the number have been drawn. It is an inherently unstable and unsustainable system."
