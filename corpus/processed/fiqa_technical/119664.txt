While it is often true that loyalty is not rewarded with a pay increase, jumping jobs too often can prematurely inflate your pay. I have seen people fresh out of school have 3 different jobs in 5 years, each one with a nice pay increase. Then suddenly, the company needs to trim some fat, hey look at this person with average output but slightly higher than average pay who has only been here a year. Looks like the best choice to cut.
