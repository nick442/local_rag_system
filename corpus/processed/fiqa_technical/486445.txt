I dont think we disagree. I believe the notion of control is elusive in this day and age. We have leverage or influence at best. I agree that if the government is asked to invest or subsidize in another organization, it has the right, as should any investor, to expect that its opinions will be heard and its interests will be protected. In that context, if any investor decides that its interests extend to amending management compensation, I think that is reasonable.
