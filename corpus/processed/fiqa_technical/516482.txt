Yea because we need beautiful UI glass effects in our nuclear silos.. Raw computing power has been sufficient for most tasks since the 80s. Almost all the gains since then have gone into usability. For something like a nuclear missile controller you really don't want to be updating every other year to untested new technology that no single human could fully understand. A beautiful UI is not sufficient compensation for the added complexity.
