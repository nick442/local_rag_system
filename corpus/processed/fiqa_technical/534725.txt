Question: My job that I've been with for 2 1/2 yrs offers a 401k, but doesn't match. I have an account, but it's still sitting with my old employer. The fact that my new job doesn't match and how I've heard so many mixed things about 401k has lead me to not signing up. I'm 40; I need to be doing something to save for retirement. Any advice would be appreciated. Should I invest in 401 anyway or put the money I was going to put in there someplace else? If someplace else, where? Also who would I talk to about money someplace else. I, admittedly, am really bad about all of this stuff, but need to change. My wife and I make 100k combined and should be getting things more together for our future. She has a 401k going, but that's about all we have. Thanks again
