Denver has a lot of Whole Foods locations because they are stores that were taken over when Whole Foods acquired the Wild Oats chain that started in Colorado. I'm really surprised that it is currently fulfilled by Sprouts.. I wonder if that will change? I would think that Sprouts would be absolutely feeling threatened by this Amazon move to buy Whole Foods.
