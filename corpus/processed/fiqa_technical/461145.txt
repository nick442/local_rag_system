"I understand economics quite well. This whole idea that the market will correct itself is bullshit. The government didn't come up with rules like you can't discriminate against people for the fun of it, but under some free market theory you would expect that one to solve itself. Well, it didn't. Have you ever answered the phones for cab company on New Year's Eve? No? Well I have, five years in a row. I can take 80 phone calls in an hour. I've told people it'll be four hours for a cab because that's how long it would take and they say ""Send it."" It's shitty because I can't refuse the call legally and there's no way in hell they're going to be there when the cab finally gets dispatched. Driver's on the street constantly contend with waiting for someone to come out and a bidding war starting to hire them. I've heard $80 offered as a tip to take a group before, although $20 seems to be more the standard bribe. There's no economic behavior to serve shitty neighborhoods. The riders don't tip and the driver is at an increased risk of being robbed and violently attacked. Why do cab companies serve them? Because the city legally requires it and in reality there are at least some decent people whose only option is to take a cab. So, congratulations, you took the same microeconomics class that I did and all the theory dictates that this should all work itself out. You get to throw around sayings like ""ceteris parabus,"" but things are never ""all things being equal"". The difference is I also spent a number of years going to the school of hard knocks and learned from reality how things actually work."
