I own a non-union company in the construction industry and my employees are harassed weekly.. At home, by phone, on jobs, all the time. They keep raising pay rates (around $75/hr + $30/hr in benefits now) but no one is working because clients are balking at the union prices. We pay well, give good benefits and are really low pressure. In the last 7 years we have not had a single employee switch over.. I think that makes the union more annoyed than anything.
