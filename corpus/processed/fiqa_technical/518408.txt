It's too bad the mods at /r/aviation have such thin skins. One comment one of them doesn't like and you are toast. Same thing with /r/cars. *Reddit* sucks in just a few ways. Mods are my beef. Too powerful. No appeals or challenges mechanism or user representation advocates. You are forced to be your own lawyer which Abe Lincoln said was a fool's game. Censorship will prevail over free speech. If you ran a business this way, customers would go to the competition.
