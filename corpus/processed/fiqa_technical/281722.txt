There is no need for micropayments, monthly payments, or harassment. A loan agreement can be drafted that your mom makes one payment annually to you instead of monthly payments. Depending on what she (and you) might be comfortable with, this payment could be interest only, or partly interest and part repayment of principal. Or you can set it up so that there is a balloon payment due when the loan terminates (say in five years' time) and she pays back the entire principal and accumulated interest. If you trust her to pay back the money, you don't need to ask for collateral or security, and you don't need to turn the debt over to a collection agency or send large men with baseball bats to call on Mom. If you just want mom to return the principal when she is ready to so so, and don't really want to charge her interest, then set up the loan to require annual payment of interest only (and the entire principal at the end of the agreement). Then, each year, a few days before the interest payment is due, send her a check for the interest due as a gift. Mom deposits the check in her account and sends back the interest payment to you. So, no harm, no foul: you have made her a gift (presumably less than the $13K exemption), she has paid you interest, but there is no net transfer of money, and as far as the IRS zebras are concerned, this is a legitimate loan. Do keep copies of the paperwork, though, and be sure to report the interest payment on your income tax returns as income to you. By extension, if you don't really want the money back, set up the loan so that the annual payment is $13K and is part the annual interest due and part the principal until the loan is paid off.
