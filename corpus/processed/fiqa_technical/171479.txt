The issue is that housing price increases can't sustain themselves indefinitely, in comparison to the rental market. Increases drive people back to the rental market, which brings the rental market up. Also, just as a AirBnB would drive property prices to go up, it also allows people who would otherwise not be able to buy a house to make the house purchase. Example - Loftium is a mortgage lender that will give you a cheaper loan if you put your house on AirBnB. That enables people to purchase a home when they otherwise wouldn't be able to. So over time (many years), the market should work itself out. In the short term, AirBnB can definitely cause market fluctuations. For example, it might enable people to continue to own their homes during a depression, which would cause a supply shortage. The only factor that affects ownership prices differently than rental prices in the long term would be regulation. Here's a [good article](http://www.sightline.org/2017/08/14/why-seattle-builds-apartments-but-vancouver-bc-builds-condos/) about that aspect specifically.
