Most prop firms these days want someone with a degree in math/statistics/engineering/physics/comp sci, i.e. someone who can think quantitatively and knows how to program. If your still in college you might want to consider switching to one of those majors rather than finance. You might want to look at some job postings from major prop firms just to see what they are looking for. Many firms have college recruiting programs so check those out as well. I also [wrote a post earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/tqrij/seeking_advice_on_professional_currency_trading/c4oxp4u) about prop trading but that was directed more at someone who is already a profitable trader. I forgot to add two links when I wrote that post: http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/07/steps-toward-joining-proprietary.html http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-can-i-join-trading-firm.html If I remember any other links I will make another post.
