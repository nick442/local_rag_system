Depends. If Levandowski(the engineer who essentially went from Waymo to Uber) signed a non-compete and non-disclosure agreement before leaving, Google could sue Uber in tort for interfering with the contract. Don't know the specifics of the story, but it really comes down to whether or not he signed those two forms.
