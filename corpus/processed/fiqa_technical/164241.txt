"People always use that place as an example when talking about the evils of the fast food industry. I love Chipotle as much as the next guy, but the place pretty much only serves giant expensive burritos. Their model could never scale up to something like McDonalds or Taco Bell. I'm not disagreeing with you though. Calling Chipotle and Taco Bell ""pretty much the same thing"" is nuts."
