This is a nice narrative, but the organizations I have operated in put a good amount of effort trying to de-bottleneck production issues by going straight to the front lines. My current org does an annual survey (with tons of open ended questions) and listening sessions around 5 year plans. Also every production employee gets a weekly 30 minute session with their direct report. Now it takes some effort to separate signal from noise (yes, everyone wants to be paid more and receive frequent strategic communication). Now grossly inefficient general and administrative costs that thrash bottom line . we have that in spades!!
