One of the problems is that its being marketed at a growth stock. When Facebook has 900 million users, there isn't exactly a lot of growth left. The only thing they can do is try to squeeze more money out of their existing user base, which won't be easy to do for people not generally interested in clicking ads or paying for things. Facebook as a company will continue to do well for a long long time. It's good they aren't really dependent on the money their stock brings them. I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock settle around $18-$22ish, even though it probably should technically settle in the $13-15 range.
