"Thank you for your reply. >innovation in tech Does that mean in laymen terms: inventing new tech or improve existing technology? Basically like inventing a car (if cars weren't invented yet) or BMW improving their models each year. --- I started to google innovation in tech. So much things I have absolutely no idea about just keeping moving around me in light-speed. What are some examples of technology that are vital to this new ""technology-race,"" I feel like is happening with the world. Is that a thing or am I delusional?"
