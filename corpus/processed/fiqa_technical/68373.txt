It seems like it could be used for the reason stated, but it's hard to escape a more cynical reaction. If you have a work station and it's assigned to somebody, then you can conclude that it's in use, unless that person is not working. The only way to get new information is by applying these to a series of unassigned work stations, to determine if you have more or less of these than you need. This just seems like another step towards treating employees more and more like prisoners.
