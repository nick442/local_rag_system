For me at least, comedy/entertainment and political issues are completely and in the most absolute terms mutually exclusive considerations. Namely, because comedians and entertainers have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to politics. Where is Jimmy Kimmels economics degree? What are Bill Nye's credentials in atmospheric science? I'll tell you where my economics degree is, in a bin on my dresser, after I earned it putting in year after year of 12+ hr days in the library studying statistical modeling, calculus, applied game theory and partial differential equations, as well as yield curve analysis, substitutibility in the bond and equities markets, and the impacts history, as well as cultural and legal institutions on market performance. Entertainers are nowhere even close to in the know about issues that effect real people. If I wanna know how to play pretend, then I'll go to a fucking actor. Actors aren't a source of information. They're monkies society puts in suits to laugh at. Thats pretty a basic part of the legistlative process. That dude is an special interest advocate who's trying to put pressure on lawmakers to cut off a piece of the pie for x groups interest. Its a negotiating strategy, not an annoucement of whats in the bill. What you did is disenfranchise yourself. What'd I say about going full retard? And seriously, where was your ass during the primaries? I'd really like to know.
