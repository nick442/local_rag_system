No. You simply form a separate entity for the film and then the studio charges all kinds of fees to the film entity, i.e. licensing or consulting or whatever. The film entity shows zero net profit so anyone getting paid off that is screwed (anyone who takes compensation in net should fire their agent), but the studio gets to book the profits. You can do this with any kind of business.
