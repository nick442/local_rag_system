"In Europe you can get a huge problem with the financial authorities if you do deals with a daughter company which are not done ""at arm's length"", e.g. by inflated fees or costs. (This can be classified as fraud, tax evasion or worse. Obviously, usually details are so complex that almost all investigations end with a deal, but in principle you can get into a lot of trouble.) This is apparently not a problem in the US, though."
