Realize that not everyone has the ability to save like that. If someone can save money, that means they are being paid (slightly) more than they need to survive. Many employers (too many) take that as a sign that they are over paying their workforce, and can easily replace them with people who get paid less, since they can also make it work by not setting anything significant aside. A lot of these people are only making it work by relying on credit too. It's easier than you might think to get trapped in a debt spiral, and a lot harder to get out when you cant take classes or even re-education courses to help you move up.
