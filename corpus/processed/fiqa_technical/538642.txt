You would assume they've made mistakes, but you'd also not know every person's life and circumstance that has them in that situation. You don't know everyone's life, but there are situations that just aren't accounted for and people are left behind in these jobs that don't pay a living wage. Even if they've made no mistakes, there are people stuck. They're stuck there and regardless of what choices they've made, do they deserve to live a life a squalor because an employer doesn't feel like paying them a wage that's enough for them to live off of? Should we let our system run business as usual when we know there are ways we can alter the system to make a real difference? We can change things, just becsuse it's helped a lot of people over time doesn't mean that we can't continue to improve upon it. This isn't a call to reward people for their decisioms, just a call to help those who've fallen not stay down their whole lives. As it is, we see generational poverty and a reduction in upward mobility for our people, why continue to allow it when we know helping them proves more beneficial for us all than what helping them costs us.
