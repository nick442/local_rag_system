> I don't think you quite understand how the software services model works. Most software co utilizes the Amazon model for growth until they reached a critical point either by market size or squeezing out other players. Uber is not a software company, regardless of what they claim. They are a taxi company that uses software for dispatch. They have zero innovation that allows for improved economies of scale. Amazon's approach and a generic software startup's approach do not necessarily overlap, but they do have similarities. > Your unit economic talks works only when bootstrapping and maybe debt financing. For companies that can grow using equity financing its certainly not the case. See: Tesla. That's completely false. If your product costs $10 but people will only buy it for $4, you will never make money regardless of how large you grow. In fact, the bigger you are, the more money you will ultimately lose. That's Uber's current conundrum. It doesn't resemble Tesla or Amazon's approaches whatsoever. If Uber raises prices sufficiently to achieve profitability, other entrants will continue to take market share and/or their customers will abandon them for the bus. Transportation is a commodity good, as evidenced by airlines and their utter lack of profitability over the decades.
