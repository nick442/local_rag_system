You can't sell if you don't have a product that people want, and even of you do no one will buy it if they don't know about it. Many ways to market, but you have to market. You are right, putting more crap out isn't what you should be doing, but if you believe it is just crap, you have already failed. Find a need then fill it. don't get a good deal on a product and try to figure out how to sell it.
