You are still not immune to automation. Unless you own said major corporation you will eventually be booted due to a streamlined algorithm that does your job better than you 1000x faster and cheaper. Yes even coding can be done by algorithms. Good for you for learning new skills but it only delays the inevitable. That is why it is productive having a conversation about what to do when mass employment is a thing of the past, especially since we have already been feeling the effects of automation for the past 10 or so years. I can assure you that shouting at people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps is not the answer.
