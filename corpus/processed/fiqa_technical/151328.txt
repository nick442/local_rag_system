Ethereum is a currency. You cannot invest in a currency. Currency doesn't have intrinsic value. It is only a medium for exchange. If you were stuck on an island and all you had was Ethereum you'd be SOL. Had you spent the Ethereum and bought a boat and took that to the island the boat would be an investment. The boat has value, it can get you off the island - whereas the Ethereum cannot. Also, Ethereum is trash. BTC4L.
