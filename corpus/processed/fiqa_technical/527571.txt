Then why do countries with single payer health plans see the cost for medical services increase beyond the rate of inflation every year? [Seriously, just look at these numbers.](http://www.towerswatson.com/assets/pdf/3585/Towers-Watson-Global-Medical-Trends-Svy-Rpt.pdf) It doesn't matter that they spend less of apercent of GDP on health care than us, because the net effect of thier models cause cost inflation that increases that percentage, just like ours. You could transplant thier model to the US and still see the same upward momentum. It is mathematically unsustainable.
