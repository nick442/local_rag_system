Many of the limitations of blockchains and bitcoin in particular can be overcome with changing the implementation, but most of the proposed fixes undermine the ideological underpinnings of decentralized verification and a fully traceable ledger. The major hurdle that it doesn't currently have a fix to make it a national currency is that the monetary policy with bitcoin is fixed -- and not by a government. Very few modern governments would be willing to entirely give up monetary policy; and as the number of transactions increases to the levels in which cash is exchanged for a blockchain, the kinds of entities that have the processing power necessary to verify a block timely gets consolidated into very few hands that own sizable data centers -- and then they arguably get to determine monetary policy among themselves without any election, voting, or duly appointed fiduciary responsibility.
