>During it's PEAK employment years, GM largely owned and manufactured the vast majority of it's own components. Not one of the components I listed did GM manufacture in the 1970s. Sure, if you were to look today, that list would be even greater including things like entire door assemblies, entire instrument clusters, even entire engines, but even in 1970 a huge amount of components were purchased rather than made. > eventually the dollar will either become so watered down I'm not sure that this won't happen. If it does it'll create a much different society as we suddenly can't afford all the crap that we've become accustomed to. I think it's equally likely that the equities market and the huge profits created in the financial industry and tech industries, along with the dollar being the world's only reserve currency will prop up the dollar and give rise to the bipolar society of which I describe.
