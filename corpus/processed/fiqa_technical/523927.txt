"Costco requires an annual paid membership before you can enter and the the minimum price of any purchase is greater than at other stores because you are getting large/bulk of that item. Starbucks charges several dollars for a cup of coffee (not an essential item). In both cases their clientele are the middle classes, not the less well off members of society. Consequently it makes business sense for them to pay staff such that are they are substantially similar to the customers. But Walmart does serve the less well off. And their management isn't stupid - if they believed a doubling of wages would result in greater sales and profitability they would do it in an heartbeat. But it won't. And I'll bet Walmart's customers and employees are as similar to each other as Costco's customers and employees are to each other. Walmart's effects on prices is [well known](http://mises.org/daily/2377). Every cent they save customers is a cent those customers can put towards other things, or prolong how long a particular amount of money will last. There are numerous [claims about them lowering inflation](http://voices.yahoo.com/the-effects-wal-mart-inflation-603517.html). So changing nothing else, increasing employee wages would decrease customer savings. We could make the cost of living for employees be less by reducing the costs of housing rather than crowing every time house prices go up. And if you believe everyone should have healthcare then ensure everyone has it. If you believe it should be provided via employers along with a bizarre ""insurance"" industry (a rather peculiar Americanism), then just make that mandatory in the law. And finally for all the detractors who believe it can be done better, go ahead and do so. It is always easier to advocate how and what others should do - if Walmart are getting it so wrong then show everyone the right way."
