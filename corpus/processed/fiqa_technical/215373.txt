Yr arguments (with the exception of making good products) are completely full of bs. The tax system is completely set up to benefit the wealthy. Most of the uber rich either inherited it or came from enough of a priviliged backround that they were able to start a business. Of course theres rags to riches people, but do you honestly think its possible to start a business when yr working two jobs just to make ends meet? Many many celebrities and economists have come out in favor of UBI. Get fucking real buddy
