"I also talked to the IRS yesterday to get a few of my own questions answered, and I asked a few of these while I was at it (as I didn't know the answers for sure either, even after reading IRS pub 969). To answer your specific questions: I would, however, like to confirm a few things: You are allowed to have multiple HSA accounts. My company forces me to use a specific bank if they are going to be make contributions. However, I would like to move this money to a higher-risk/higher-yield account. You are allowed to withdraw money to reimburse any past payments that were made after the HSA is opened â€“ perhaps years later. This would allow me to accumulate interest on the money and then get reimbursed later. You can transfer money between HSAs, etc. and the money will still cover any payments since the first HSA was opened? I am currently unmarried and without children. An HSA can be made to pay for any dependent or spouse medical bills as well. I am currently signed up with an HSA that is marked as ""individual"" or something. I assume that once I get married, I should have no issues using this money from the past on my wife and kids? Note that I am not a certified tax professional and you should not rely on this information for your own tax decisions, but should investigate or contact the IRS yourself."
