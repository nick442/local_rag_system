You can use an intermediary online bank account. For example, ING Direct has the ability to link to other real banks. You can link to both your old and new banks. Once linked, transfer the money from old bank to ING. Then transfer from ING to new bank. There are delays, and you can't transfer directly from bank-to-bank, but this should work, and should be free. The same concept should apply for something like PayPal or another online financial service.
