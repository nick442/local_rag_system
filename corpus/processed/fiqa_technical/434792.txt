Yes but it's more important to look at the longer term trends, which Schiff would actually probably support. He is not anyone you should take very seriously for intelligent economic debate. His glory comes from calling the real estate bubble, which deserves some credit, but all of his predictions of what would occur during the fall out have been wrong and almost the exact opposite. He doesn't understand modern economics.
