Fruit Fly Control & Fruit Fly Spray cleaned female fruit flies lay their eggs on the surface of rotting fruit. Fruit fly larvae feed on the yeast organisms and fungi growing in the fruit and vegetable materials in a semi-liquid mass. Natural Mosquito Spray uses essential oils, which are highly effective, but there are some burden about putting these directly on the skin, especially on children.
