If you'll actually read the quote, they've invested substantial amounts of money in modernization, including route optimization, machine automation, and facility consolidation. The only thing antiquated about their approach is that they remain attached to an arbitrary mandate that forces them to be inefficient because congress knows nothing about logistics and operates purely on the grounds of sentimentality, not the best interest of their constituents. Well, uniform pricing is part of their mandate. Price, wage, and quality uniformity are staples of marxist dogma. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service#cite_note-3 > The USPS is legally obligated to serve all Americans, regardless of geography, at uniform price and quality. There is no compelling reason why they should pay the same and charge the same across the US. The labor market varies accross the US, as do conditions that affect timely delivery. Pretending that this is not a fact is the exact reason why the postal service is repelling customers and posting multibillion dollar deficiets every year, at our expense.
