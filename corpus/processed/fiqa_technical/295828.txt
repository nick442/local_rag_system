Registering it as an LLC turns it into a business, and will have to be maintained regardless of whether you do any actual business with it or not. Strictly speaking, it also doesn't necessarily grant you any specific protections against the use of the name. Small business names are notoriously hard to protect when they are active. If you aren't actually using it, a judge is more likely to not rule in your favor. A regular Trademark isn't what you're looking for either. That is more for business product line names and similar. What you're looking for is a Registered Trademark (Â®), which is a federal legal designation disallowing other businesses from using your name or business branding.
