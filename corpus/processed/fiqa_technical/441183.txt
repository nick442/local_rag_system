"Some of it is very simple but almost all of it is very non-intuitive. Imagine that Donald Trump owns a lot of property that is valued at $1bn. So he puts that up as collateral to buy some gold worth $2bn dollars. A little while later the banks discover that the properties are only worth $100mm. In this case $900mm has suddenly disappeared and moreover the banks are in deep shit because the Donald owes them $2bn and has posted collateral worth $100mm. When they try to rough up Donald he tells them that instead if they go along with his ponzi scheme they might be able to sell his new $2bn property to someone else for $4bn, this way the banks will get their money bank and Donald will make a nice little profit. So the banks lend him some more money. This scheme only works until people start refusing to buy these properties at Donald's prices. This is a nutshell what has happened. Property prices were much higher than they should have been and Banks had derivatives which weren't worth as much as they claimed. When the market/people wised up to this fact the prices came crashing down and money ""disappeared""."
