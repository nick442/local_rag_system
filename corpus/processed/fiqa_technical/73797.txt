Worked my way through college, 40-50 hours a week making minimum wage at KFC until I got promoted to assistant manager. Yes it's hard, but not so hard that you can't still have a life outside of school and work. Having kids would change all that I have no idea what it's like to try and juggle work school and kids but that's the risk you take when you have kids wether on purpose or accident.
