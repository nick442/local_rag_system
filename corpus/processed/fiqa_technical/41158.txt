I expect to be back here in July. I did give my [first impressions](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/ufj37/payroll_additions_in_us_misses_expectation/c4uxylq) of this job report above. I'm just raising the possibility (and hoping like hell) that we're just seeing completely screwed up seasonal adjustment due to the freakish early spring in much of the country.
