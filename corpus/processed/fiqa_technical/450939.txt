If you're really price-sensitive, consider carrying cash in your wallet whenever your brother (or you) comes home to your own country. Besides saving money, this should teach your younger brother to plan well and manage his living costs or otherwise he'll starve. Let's say that a month's living cost is $1500 which includes housing, food, transportation, and the occasional splurging[1]. If your brother's school is in a per-semester basis, chances are he'll visit your home country at about twice a year. That will be $1500 * 6 months = $9000. You can still carry that amount of money in your wallet (that's 90 sheets in $100 bills, which should fit in larger wallets) provided that you're careful. If you or your brother don't go home regularly at least once a year, the 3% transfer fee isn't that big. Let's say that the total amount that you transfer is $18K (for a year's living cost, $1500 * 12 months), the fee for that will be $540 ($18000 * 0.03), which I'll bet is far less than a return airfare from the US to India/China/UAE. [1] I'm living on my own in Singapore right now, and my monthly expenses rarely exceeds S$1500/month, so I'm assuming that in the states that would be USD 1500. You can get a projection for that number yourself.
