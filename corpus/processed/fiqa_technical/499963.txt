They didn't have a choice. None of the cable companies wanted the TiVo to exist. In the analog days there was nothing they could do to stop it. With digital they were forced to support Cable Cards, but that was a total disaster. Due to foot dragging, terrible capabilities, customer hostile policies, and techs who had no idea what they doing that was a failure. If a cable company rents you *their* DVR or cable box, they get $5 a month (or whatever). If you buy your own box, they get $5 because they charge the same for a CableCard because they can. If they sold/rented TiVos, they'd have to give more than $0 to TiVo and would make less money. Plus, if you had a TiVo that meant that you didn't need OnDemand to catch up on the shows you weren't at home to watch, so they couldn't charge you for that. Also, you couldn't access OnDemand even if you wanted to, because CableCards didn't support it. TiVo was a threat to a sweet deal, so they all tried to kill it. TiVos were so expensive (at first) and so hard to setup (later, due again to the CableCards) that very few people bought them. In the mean time the cable companies half-assed their own DVRs and pushed them on consumers. Now most people don't see why they should pay extra for a TiVo with less ability even though it may well be the superior product. Plus, there are now services like FIOS and U-Verse that don't support TiVo. They should, but the FCC has dragged on the AllVid proposal that would let consumers actually have a choice in end point hardware. Some smaller companies offer boxes with TiVo software either as a premium or just turned their business over to TiVo to handle that stuff. That's nice, but Comcast & Time Warner cover the vast majority of the market and may be the only options in most areas. Neither of them offer it. The only reason the small companies offer it is to differentiate themselves from Comcast & TW.
