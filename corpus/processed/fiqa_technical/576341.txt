I do understand what you are saying. I see it. I live in a fairly low income area and it is the custom to include candy in every kid function. The kids are, as you might guess, on the average, kinda fat. I feel this will only change with public education, and currently we do have a state budget item to address this and we are seeing positive results. I also think that getting most of these kids a physical once a year where someone in authority points out to parents (or grandparents) raising these kids that being so indulgent is not really what is best for the kids does change behavior. Poor parents are mostly trying to do whatever they can to sweeten a pretty difficult life. Learning cheap crafts or attention or whatever is a better option really does change the behavior. These small changes are not so much just throwing money at an issue so much as including ALL the population in a shared health care system.
