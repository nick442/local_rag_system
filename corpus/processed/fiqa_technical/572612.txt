"Such a flawed, grasping-at-straws article. Do both ivy league institutions and schools like Hartwick (example used in article) have students that transfer out of STEM programs? Absolutely. But I can say with absolute confidence that engineering programs (e.g.) are considerably more difficult at the former. In reference to math SAT scores for Hartwick, >""The top, middle, and bottom third of students averaged 569, 472, and 417, respectively."" Sorry, but the bottom ivy students' scores are above your top performers by a substantial margin. Are there kids at ivy schools that got the silver spoon treatment their whole lives and perform well because of this? Yup. Characters of all types at all learning institutions. But don't demean the achievement of those who worked their asses off to get somewhere. Hi, I am bbqbot, and my jimmies are rustled."
