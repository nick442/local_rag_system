The thing that makes me laugh is that Sears got famous by innovating the mail order catalog. They then went to local stores, and completely got caught out on same convention that they helped pioneer. Simply putting images in peoples hands and letting them order the product. Sears could still be around if it would have focused on a decent online distribution center.
