Okay fine, great. I think you fail to see my point. Experiencing someone dying on the table does not alter the reality of what is behind America's relatively high health care costs, and its not an experience that will give one a special insight into the causes of high prices. Going back to your first point, economists have looked into the exact same cause you proposed. They have weighted its impact on healthcare and its not the largest driving force in way American healthcare costs so much.
