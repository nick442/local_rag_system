From what I’ve seen across a multitude of firms, the gaps start at recruiting (outsourced to a person with a BA from an unknown foreign school and no experience for $5000/yr) and propagate throughout an organization because accurate metrics for measuring IT talent are few and far between. They don’t realize their ship is sinking until 90% of their costs are maintaining inflexible legacy applications that aren’t even remotely functioning in alignment with their digital strategy anymore, and then they hire Wipro or Infosys or whomever else to come fix it. and then, when it becomes an unfixable clusterfuck of nonsense, they pay someone else for managed services until, like, I don’t know, the business goes under or the building explodes when the IBM 7070 mainframe they’re still using catches fire. It’s truly a fascinating cycle.
