"When portfolio positions are reported in percentages, those percentages are relative to the portfolio's base equity. When you start out, that is equal to the cash you have in a portfolio. Later it's the net equity of the portfolio (i.e., how much money you could withdraw if you were to exit all your positions). If you put $5,000 into your account and are long and short 50%, then you are long $2,500 and short $2,500. If it's 100% and -100%, then long and short $5,000. ""Leverage"" is often computed gross (as if all positions were long). So if you have 100% and -100%, then your broker may say you are ""levered 2 to 1."" That is, your gross exposure is twice as large as your underlying base equity."
