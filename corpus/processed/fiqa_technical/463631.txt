I'm not meaning to be condescending and I apologize if it came off that way. I'm offering my perspective. I see these relationships and have the perspective to see how the traders move about and where they move to as part of my role. The most common way I see non-tier 1 grads moving into top tier HF trading roles is via stepping into BB's, moving into market making roles, and then using the position of being at the center of the market to network into roles. Renaissance tech being the exception.. most of the traders sustain research roles as well and are most came in with PhD's and academia backgrounds.
