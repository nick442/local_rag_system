"my grandmother's farm has taken the approach of ""burn that shit before it can seed. If it grows back, burn it a few more times. Till the ground. Then if it grows back again.. burn that shit."" Only took a couple repetitions to eliminate almost all the weeds. All new weeds are believed to have come from the neighbor's shittily (it's worse than ""poorly"") maintained place. (they use a propane tank on the back of an ATV with one of those flame ""wands"" to scorch everything at ground level by hand. They do this so they can selectively burn and not kill the non-weed stuff that's growing)"
