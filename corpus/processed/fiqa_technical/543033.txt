"Alright, you're continuing to drift off topic. The benefit of clean sources is the comparative lack of pollution during everyday use. It is not as dependable or scalable as its competition. For now. The idea of ""powering"" an East Coast state with Midwest wind credits is asinine. It completely ignores the benefit of using wind sources. All this does is subsidize Colorado's energy endeavors. MA and NJ are forced to purchase renewable energy credits, as a result the residents of MA and NJ must now pay higher rates. They see none of the benefits of lower pollution, they are simply being forced to pay more so Coloradans can justify their wind turbines. Meanwhile, the power plants in these states continue relatively unabated. This is useless bureaucracy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_Energy_Certificate_(United_States)"
