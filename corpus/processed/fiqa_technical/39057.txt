"Please note, if you enter your password into a 3rd party website -- there's always the chance that the third party website is recording your passwords. Personally I've looked at the raw html and included javascript on this page, and(1) it looks like it's purely client side in your browser. However I have not examined the javascript that is being pulled in by the advertising. (Does advertising javascript included in a page have access to the full contents of the page and forms?) Anyways -- don't enter existing/good/in-use passwords into 3rd party webpages. Only do this with passwords that you have ALREADY changed, and that are not in use anywhere else. You wouldn't think I'd have to remind people of this .. but I do.. (1) At THIS time, the link that Pilebsa included to tools4noobs.com looks okay. Note that Pilebsa *could* edit his post and change the link *AFTER* someone else has looked at it. Hell, I could be a SHILL for Pilebsa -- ""yah yah it's safe man, I checked it out fer you"". Or tools4noobs or someone who has penetrated them could change the page AFTER I've looked at it. It's a dangerous world, you'd better know what you're doing."
