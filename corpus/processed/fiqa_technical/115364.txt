So real estate isn't a good investment? Yeah, it's went down at times. Still worth more now then say 15, 25 and 50 years ago right? Is nothing a good investment because it has bad years? Im not saying bitcoin is the best shit ever and it's perfect and everyone should buy it. But we've heard time and time again that it was in its death throws. Yet after every dip, it recovers and reaches new highs.
