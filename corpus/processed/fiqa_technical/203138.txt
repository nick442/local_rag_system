"> I didn't say she was qualified for the job; Good! You realized the real story here. Great! > merely that her undergraduate degree doesn't determine her qualification. Again, reading comprehension, please. And I said the same! >> But with my doubts, yes there are few cases of somebody with one background and studies becoming a real expert and leader in a totally different area. It's rare!!! >> For lower level jobs, yes, a music major may become a descent programmer or project manager. I doubt they will become experts and best in the field. I also said that for a CHIEF Security Officer, and other high level roles, these are serious responsibilities, only real experts with real background should be chosen. No ""diversity"" and ""nice person"" is even a factor here. As for HR, you probably haven't been long in the corporate world. HR is all about minimizing costs of employees and weeding out any ""troublesome"" employees that managers don't like. I want to see the first HR department that will go to defense of a long term loyal and good employee against their managers, also when ""position is eliminated"" or ""reorganizing"". HR reports to management and not to employees. Don't pay attention to HR's desperate attempts to promote their image among employees. .. and as a manager with many people reporting to me, I waste so much of my time on HR nonsense pretending that I care about HR views and policies."
