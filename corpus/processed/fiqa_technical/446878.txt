"They do not. M&A execution is housed within industry coverage groups; there's no separate group that executes. They have a group called ""M&A"" that advises on tax structuring, anti-raid, and other assorted issues (e.g. MASA) but they don't run the model and they're not really executing. Most of the people there are ex-lawyers or experienced bankers. Trust me on this, if you tell someone at GS you're interested in working in the M&A group, you're not getting an offer."
