Yes and no. It doesn't matter what you think, it often matters what you think other people think about Equifax. Or what you think a bank believes about Equifax. Given that their opinions are usually taken into account along with other bureaus, AND that their system was error prone already, I just don't see this Impacting them in any meaningful way beyond a big ugly lawsuit. We really need a legal and regulatory mechanism capable of ending companies over this kind of crime against consumers. It's clear to me that without that, all we have is outrage. And outrage is meaningless.
