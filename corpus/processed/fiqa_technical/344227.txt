Looks like Cracked is taking money form the Hotel lobby which has been out to kill AirBnB for a long time. This is perfect example of a native advertisement concealed as hit piece. Cracked should be ashamed of themselves. Do you know how many dead bodies have been found in Hotel Rooms? Do you know how much crazy sh-- happens in hotel rooms? And you're going to fault AirBnB for a few cases that aren't their fault anyway? For ---- sake! AirBnB has made it possible for millions to travel the globe without having to pay expensive hotel rates. I love AirBnB. Use it all year round. F--- hotels, and ---- native ads disguised as hipster journalism.
