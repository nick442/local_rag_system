As they say, the grass is always greener.. Honestly though, I understand the issues that a spike in gas prices (or anything as a matter of fact) causes, regardless of whether gas was cheap or expensive to begin with. I can assure all the Californians though, that once the initial shock wears off life will go on as usual.
