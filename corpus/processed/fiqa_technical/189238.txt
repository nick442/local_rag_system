"Here is another quote from the same speech: >“I just got back from Israel, Ireland and France – three countries that deeply recognise the importance of having a business tax scheme for jobs and wage growth. We don’t have that.” >Dimon lamented US failure to build an airport in the last 10 years and the opiate addiction epidemic. You don't build airports by cutting taxes, and you don't cite FRANCE's tax scheme to advocate for cutting taxes. Here is what Wikipedia says about taxes in France: >""France continues to be among the OECD countries whose tax rate is the highest. Taxes account for 45% of GDP against 37% on average in OECD countries."" https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Taxation_in_France"
