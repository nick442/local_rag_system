"The added value is web ordering (secure payments, shipping and paying fraud prevention) and handling logistics to ship to your door. Retail adds additional middleman cost via commercial brick and mortar stores with comparable expensive rents only ""near"" the customer (not to the door) and retail workers salaries. Many products don't need to be touched and felt before buying and with great return policies this is solved via a little bit more time (return ship & replacement). The last advantage of retail over online is ""can have it in few hours at home"" versus days for online shipping. Few items justify that instant delivery premium: emergency buys (spare parts for broken down machines, printer ink/toner cartridges), fresh cooked meals for example."
