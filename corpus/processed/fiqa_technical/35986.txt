Talking to the one Amazon employee I know, the sheer volume of shipments produces some interesting bugs. I mean, they really are pushing the envelope on logistics - inevitably you're going to end up with some spectacularly bad experiences no matter how hard you try just because the task is so complex. IE, we'd need to know the ratio of bad to good experiences to fairly judge, but the existence of bad experience isn't something that really needs to be proven IMO.
