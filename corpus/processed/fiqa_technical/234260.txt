"Charge less money. That's the only thing. What that really means is negotiating lower ticket prices with venues, not removing fees. People don't realize that Ticketmaster's business model is shielding venues from public ire, not adding arbitrary amounts to tickets for the minor service of buying online, a service everyone knows costs very little to perform. The arbitrary fees mostly go back to the venue per their agreement, however, they're divided out as ""admin fees"" and ""processing fees"" and ""convenience fees"" charged by Ticketmaster so that Ticketmaster eats the blowback instead of the venue charging exorbitant prices."
