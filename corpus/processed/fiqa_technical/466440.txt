"No. Fake news are lies and baseless claims where simple verifiable facts and logic can show them as such. For example: ""Russians colluded with Trump to win the elections"". Let's see: in July 2016 Trump won the GOP debate and was nominated by the GOP against 13 other career GOP politicians. And then he won the elections in November 2016. Facts? Yes or no? Are you saying that since July, the Russian managed to rig and twist the elections result for the choice, Trump, in November? Or is it, for example, Hillary cheating on debate questions given to her by fake-news CNN, questions that Trump handled easily? If my son did such a thing on a test in 1st grade, he will be expelled from school.
