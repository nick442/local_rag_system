"> company was incorporated, which makes it a public institution and that changes things. People keep saying this, but it simply is not true. No business is ever a ""public institution"". Even publicly traded companies are still *privately owned*. They are ""public"" only in the sense that they extend the opportunity to own a part of the company to the larger public. Insfar as this is true, they incur certain responsibilities to be transparent in reporting their financials, for example. But the idea that any private institution - corporation, church, parochical school, or small business ought to be forced to hire on the basis of someone else's idea of fairness is idiotic. It's a fundamental matter of property rights. Except in matters of fraud or force, I should be free to dispose of my property - say my business - in any way I wish, hiring, serving, or otherwise running that business as I see fit. If it is OK to force private sector institutions to hire and serve people because the government says so, then by the same reasoning the government should be able to force you to invite certain classes of people to your dinner parties. Even in the extreme cases of outright bigotry - say the KKK member that owns a business and hates blacks or the Muslim shop onwer that hates Jews - this should not be prevented. However offensive I most of the rest of my fellow citizens find the Klackers or the nutjob Islamists, they too have rights and privileges under our system and they too should not have those rights removed to suit my sense of fair play."
