"You can pontificate about how life is so hard for her because shit costs money and you're right, she can't support herself and kids. However, that doesn't change the basic economic reality that working full time at Popeyes simply DOES NOT provide enough value to her employer and there are two many people with her very low skill set that she cannot command a higher wage. No amount of government programs will change that. Robbing the tax payers through welfare, killing businesses and destroying jobs by imposing a wage that simply is infeasible is counter productive, unsustainable, and simply misguided. Don't believe me? Ask the University of Washington who have the numbers on Seattle's ever escalating minimum wage and the effect on [jobs.] (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-06-26/shocking-study-finds-seattle-min-wage-hikes-has-cost-works-14mm-hours-year-6700-jobs) This is, of course, assuming you care that people are being put out of work so a few can be paid a ""living wage"". Welfare is an endless tap of free money, [right?] (http://www.usdebtclock.org) The irony of your oh so well cited comment is that you didn't apply it to your own proposed solution of a minimum wage increase. [Here's](http://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/higher-fast-food-wages-higher-fast-food-prices) a great analysis of effect of this change on consumer prices, how it affects the capital side of the equation of whether to operate a restaurant at all, and how a higher minimum wage impairs the creation of entry level jobs. Succinctly, minimum wage jobs were never meant to be able to support a family of three, no matter how much you wish it could. By creating artificially higher wages you'll get higher unemployment, more substitution of labor with more capital intensive solutions (ordering kiosks, etc), and higher taxes and consumer prices. Edit: Link B.S. Edit 2: **trigger warning** Also, it's a lot easier to raise kids with two working parents, that's just math for you. Talk about a bad personal choice that no one has touched on. Poor kids :("
