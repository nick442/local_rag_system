First I'd call and make sure there's not some kind of mistake. If that fails, look into reapplying for forbearance. I'm not sure what you got it for before, but I added up your expenses (which you say is more than your income) and from your stated SL payments, it's more than 20% of your income. That should qualify you for a mandatory forbearance. If not, it should definitely get them to approve a financial hardship forbearance. Before either of those, try to get a deferment though as a financial hardship (not the same as a hardship forbearance, but same principle). If none of that works, ask for an income based repayment plan. It'll stretch out your loans but will relieve some of the pressure now. Best of luck!
