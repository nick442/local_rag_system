Remitting means paying, and entity means organization, such as a company, partnership, government department, etc. Remitting entity is legalistic jargon used to refer to an organization that is sending money somewhere. Why it is sending money and to whom is not implicit in the term, but depends on the larger context of the usage of the term.
