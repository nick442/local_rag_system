Was about to say - Ihop closing only 25 locations isn't a big deal. I have TWO in my town less than 2.5 miles from each other. Everyday they have people there no matter the time. College students hang there EVERY night. Both locations are impossible to get into on the weekends prior to 1pm. I think they are doing just fine.
