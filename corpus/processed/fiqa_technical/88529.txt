"The ""software industry"" also uses some of the strongest DRM available - see any enterprise-level solutions out there (Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, IBM, etc.). Sure, piracy there happens, but it's not widespread in the U.S./Europe. Similar with the gaming industry - strong DRM, and though piracy is tolerated, it's made difficult and time-consuming, thus ensuring that the vast majority of consumers purchase the product instead of steal it. Everyone knows that some piracy is inevitable, but DRM ensures that most consumers won't steal - the same way that retail stores use those little magnetic strips embedded in products. Bottom line - no one gives away their product for free. That's not a business model."
