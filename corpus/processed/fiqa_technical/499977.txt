"I am not saying it is fair, or that only they get to say ""this sucks"" I am saying that you should not be envious of them. Also, try to remember that the programs like the one they made use of don't just help that family. Foreclosures drive down property values. Sure it sucks to see them basically get rewarded for an. . . . optimistic gamble shall we say. . . but they are not the only ones that benefited. Their neighbors, some of whom likely are honest people who took a cautious path to home ownership, now will not have their homes decrease in value due to sister. She gets an unfair reward, but it also helps avoid her neighbors getting unfairly dinged. Not to mention that it is safer to have homes occupied, and they tend to be less likely to fall into disrepair. Also, try to remember that every house that does go back to the bank means one more family of renters. Banks tend to sit on homes, often for way way longer than they should, leaving that house empty, while the former tenants try to rent. Pour more renters into the pool while banks sit on unsold vacant homes and landlords can be more picky and charge more for rent. But in the end. . . .man your rent sucks."
