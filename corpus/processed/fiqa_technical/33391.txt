07-08 isn't our only reference point. It is the most extreme financial event in decades. But, there could easily be enough froth to spark another downturn (10 years since 2008 it wouldn't be too soon for that either) like market crashes in 1989 or 2001. It's not all doom and gloom but you have to be realistic. There is an economic cycle and it has been around 10 years since the last recession. Asset prices are high and not matched by real world performance. It would just take a medium sized shock to trigger a mini crash. Some kind of high street bankruptcy or accounting scandal could have quite major repercussions.
