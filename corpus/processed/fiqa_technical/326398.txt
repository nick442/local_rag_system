From what I can tell, the book talks about the current economic crisis is going to lead to a burst in the dollar market and government debt market. And how the current financial policies and the financial policies enacted by the previous administration, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan are going to lead to hyperinflation, devaluation of the dollar, and a massive spike in the national debt. And then it is supposed to provide financial strategies and ideas to weather the storm. That's all I can gather without buying the book.
