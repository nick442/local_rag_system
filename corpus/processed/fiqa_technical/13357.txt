If your goal is to simply save money on shaving supplies, there are easier ways to do so. If you are buying the latest Gillette multi-blade razor cartridge, then yes, you are spending a lot of money on razor blades. Consider switching to an old-fashioned double-edge safety razor. Pick up a nice razor for $20 - $50 (I like my Merkur HD), then buy the blades for cheap. I buy a 2 year supply of double-edge blades for less than $20. If you really want to turn in your man card and get your facial hair permanently removed, then it is really easy to calculate the payback time. Just figure out what you are spending in razor blades, get a quote for lasering your face off, and compare. If you are paying $10 a year for blades like I am, the payback time is going to be long. One more thought: remember, permanent means permanent. This is comparable to a tattoo, except tattoos are easier to reverse. Others have noted that the procedure isn't really permanent. What I understand from reading (I don't have firsthand experience) is that it is temporary in the sense that you will eventually need to start shaving again, but permanent in the sense that you will never be able to grow a proper beard again, if you wish. Basically, it is the worst of both worlds: it won't accomplish your goal of not having to shave anymore, but will make permanent changes to your face. The fact that you will need to shave again, even if only occasionally, affects your payback time calculation.
