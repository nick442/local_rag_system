">If this were true, why force citizens to use a specific central bank's paper money via ""legal tender laws""? You do not have as much of an idea of what you are talking about as you think you do. You can pay a person for their good or service in any sort of money you want, including gold, bitcoins, fishes, cupcakes, iron ore, or whatever. However, they must be willing to accept it. If you attempt to pay them in USD, however, they can't refuse. So why not start attempting to pay for things in semiconducters?"
