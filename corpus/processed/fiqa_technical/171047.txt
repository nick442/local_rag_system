Well, I was actually just looking at my own 10-yr old. She does dance/ballet all year round and golf/tennis in the summer. Just the shoes, costumes, clubs, etc. run to about 1k. One dance lesson per week is about 1K/year (she does three). And summer golf/tennis lessons plus memberships about 1K. soccer and baseball are cheaper. but hockey is significantly more expensive - and you have to travel a lot all year round.
