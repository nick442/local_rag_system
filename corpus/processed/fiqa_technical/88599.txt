My wife works at a prestigious hospital where advancement is based on medical achievement. Given what goes on her floor, the lack of basic management skills is causing things like chronic short staffing, which in turn directly affects things like costs (reliance on short term, expensive staff) and nurse to patient ratios. This cuts both ways: if medical staff want to be 100% in charge, learn a little bit about management.
