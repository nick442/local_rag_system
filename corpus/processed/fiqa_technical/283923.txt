There is a system in place called parenthood. However, many of the problems in the USA are because of lack of good parents assuming they are even around. I went to a juvenile detention center to attend one of their lectures, and one thing they expounded was the disproportionate number of kids in there who either don't have at least one parent in their house or parents who didn't care about them. Unless we go North Korean style brain washing authoritarianism, no nanny state attempt will fix this. The problem, responsibility and solution lies with the people.
