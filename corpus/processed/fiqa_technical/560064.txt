"Considering land mass, natural resources, population, tech and a thriving free market, this country could be heaven. It's just good. If not for corruption in Washington that legalized a bribing system that allows politicians to be owned by corporations that through lobbying write themselves laws that favor them instead of the majority of the people, this country would be in a much, much better place. Since most laws have to benefit the richest people first, and those are the greediest of people, it reflects on society. You have the Walton family worth hundreds of billions of dollars through a company that makes hyndreds of billions of dollars, but refuse to pay their employees decent wages. On top of that, many billionaires get tremendous tax cuts or don't pay at all. The burden is all on the middle class. People are angry. And don't give me that redneck ""leave the country"" argument, I am discussing a topic posted on a public forum. It's what I think and I am sure a lot of Americans agree with me. Are you going to tell them to leave as well? I have a house in three continents, you can't tell me shit."
