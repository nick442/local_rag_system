"While I'm sure there's some truth to the argument that unsophisticated retail investors index against the S&P 500 thinking that they're tracking ""the market,"" I don't think it makes sense to steer the S&P 500 in that direction to cater to that lowest common denominator. The *ad absurdum* conclusion of that course of action, of course, would be to abolish the S&P 500 entirely and move those assets into the S&P Total Market Index. But clearly there's value in having an index that tracks US large-caps with single share classes, just as there's value in having an index that tracks US large-caps in general. As for whether it will be a loss for passive investors..it will be interesting to see how that pans out. Maybe good corporate governance and direct accountability by managers really do contribute positively to returns in the long run and investors will benefit from this change as a result. Or maybe this will result in companies with multiple share classes being undervalued and create an opportunity to earn outsized returns by investing in them, and indexes that omit those companies will underperform. Only time will tell."
