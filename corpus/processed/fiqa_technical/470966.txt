Inflation is being hidden in false government figures. They report inflation as 2% to 3%, but when look at my records for the last 5 years I see most of the things I am paying for are around 23% higher. It may even be higher as some things are hard to figure in. For example, many food items are being sold in smaller quantities for the same prices they sold for in larger packages. When was the last time you saw a 3 pound can of coffee in your local market, or a half gallon of ice cream? Things like cable have gone up 50%. All my insurance policies are about 50% higher too. Meanwhile people's wages have gone up the 3% the government insists matching inflation.
