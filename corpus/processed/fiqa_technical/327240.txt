If you save money, invest in an education, start a business, refurbish your house, invest in technology by buying shares in a growing company, build something that can give you value long term, save money for your kids to inherit, postpone your spending, etc. it all accumulates and gives strong long term returns. These are the decisions we should encourage everyone to make, as it is these decisions that good countries are made from. You can rob the rich once, and then the richest and most productive people stop working and quickly all turns to shit, like every socialist experiment ever. I work hard and don't spend anything. At this rate I can likely retire in 10 years at 40 years old. Would be pretty pissed by then to have to share it with everyone who didn't work hard and didn't save and invest anything.
