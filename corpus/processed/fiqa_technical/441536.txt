When clearing funds from the sale of a home the following usually happens (USA): The left over amount is what you get. Your real estate agent should be able to go over all of that with you. If they haven't then you need to get a better real estate agent. Assuming you haven't listed the house on the market yet then you should probably start by finding out what the pay off amount is on your existing home (call your mortgage company), then look at the prices of recently sold homes in your neighborhood for a comparable house (same style/square footage/amenities) to see what it sold for. Now you will know exactly what all those costs are prior to sitting down and signing the paperwork for the sale during the closing proceedings. If for some reason the amount is less than what you owe on it then the mortgage company would have to be involved for you to even sell it. If the real estate market in your area is somewhat normal, you bought the house on a standard fixed rate mortgage, you've been paying faithfully these past 17 years, you haven't gotten a home equity line of credit (HELOC) loan (or otherwise cashed out of your equity at any point), you've kept up the maintenance of the place and there are no liens against the property (ie: unpaid taxes, lawsuits, etc) then it is highly likely you will get money from the sale of the house. However we (internet people) don't know any of those details; so talk to a good real estate agent.
