"Interesting; England went ""chip & PIN"" years ago and Australia went ""chip & PIN"" today but I've never heard of EMV. I had to look it up to know what it was. The point of the switch is to reduce fraudulent transactions. The chip can't be copied as easily as the strip. That's all I know. Rally I just replied because I had not heard of EMV."
