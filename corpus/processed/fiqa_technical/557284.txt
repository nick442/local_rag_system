I did not single out Scandinavia. The person answering my original comment to this thread did. The fact that economists view the structure of the US economy as different from other developed economies is a fact. I can give you quotes once I get back to my books at home. Yes. Supply of work force drives wages. If you take a look at the original - Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith - he also states that the fluctuating death rates of the workers is a natural part of economic cycles. Yet we would view this as brutal today. Most of the developed world views having an underpaid unregulated illegal service class as basis of the economy as brutal and a form of slavery. The people also want to come to the EU. They flock to the EU in bigger numbers than to the US. They are risking their lives trying to get to Europe along various routes. They drown in the Mediterranean by the thousands. They succumb at Sahara. They are at the hands of Turkish and Serbian criminal people smuggling gangs trying to get to EU through Greece. They try to breach the fence in Ceula by mass runs. You may have not noticed this in world news, but there has been a migration of historic proportions going on to the EU for quite some time. So why isn't there this underpaid illegal unregulated service class? You tell me. I would sincerely like to know.
