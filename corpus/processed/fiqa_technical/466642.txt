Don’t you hate this shit? Whenever there’s a business-related or pharmaceutical company article posted on reddit, I try not to read the comments. It’s too frustrating to read all of the comments like the one you responded to. People with no business education or general knowledge of natural economic laws just spewing shit out of their mouths. People with no real understanding of what they’re actually talking about or the real implications of their proposals, but they have an opinion on something that’s been in the news somewhat recently so by god they’re gonna tell you how the fuck it should be!
