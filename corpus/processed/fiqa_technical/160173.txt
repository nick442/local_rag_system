That doesn't bother me. I was raised in a military family and enlisted when I was younger, but separated due to a medical issue that came up less than 6 months in. I regret taking the separation instead of just waiting and trying to stay in, but it's resolved now and enough time has passed that I can enlist now. Anyway, it's something I want to do, just need to keep losing weight and learn to run faster first. I'd be doing the type of work I want to (enlisting as an officer in the field I'm studying) and, chances are, I'd end up stationed fairly close to home or family. I was told that I probably would end up deployed at least once if I did the minimum enlistment period, but that's not really a problem for me, either. Many of my friends have done overseas deployments, and I've talked to a few people in the specific MOS (jobs) I'm considering, and it seems tolerable.
