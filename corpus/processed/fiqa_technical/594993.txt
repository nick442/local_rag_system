"You have entirely missed the point. Let us get race and class out of this. Lets switch to something perhaps a bit less controversial -- and say there is one teacher that is really good at working with teenagers, and another that.. well, just *isn't* any good working with that age group. But the second teacher might work very well when working with *younger* children (and conversely the first teacher might be really poor at it). The same ""bare performance metric"" (ratio of change in student retention/understanding of subjects before/after a semester with said teacher) could be used to measure BOTH teachers in BOTH environments, without being concerned with the ""specific details"" of the environment. Same thing would would in cases of race/ethnicity, class, etc. And I am not talking about ""federal programs"" here (nor even statewide union-negotiated ""systems"") -- that is all just one version or another of central planning bullshit, and it WILL be gamed -- I'm talking about allowing LOCAL parents/schools/administrators to hire/fire based on MERIT and performance (as they perceive it, and however they want to judge it; it doesn't HAVE to be homogeneous)."
