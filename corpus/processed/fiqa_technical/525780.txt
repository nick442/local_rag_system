Okay i see where we might be confusing each other. In absolute dollar terms the employee might make more working for themselves, but money is not the only factor that goes into choosing a job. If the worker can make $600/week working for themselves and $500 doing the same job a company. They may value the benefits of not worrying about running their own business, or the extra free time like you said, as being worth more than that $100. They are still choosing the option that they value highest to themselves, whichever it may be. I didnt insinuate that the company is giving the employee some sort of gift in hiring them. They are just offering the employee the best possible option of the employee's other choices. If it wasnt the best option for the worker then they logically should not select that option.
