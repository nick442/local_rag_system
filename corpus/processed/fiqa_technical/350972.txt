"I'm working from 6am-2pm today (from home, since it's Saturday) and I'm on call from 2pm-4am tomorrow. If the phone rings at our company help desk at any time from 2pm-4am, I am expected to answer it or return the call promptly. I'm not paid for the entire time of 2pm-4am, but only for the time I'm ""on a call"" essentially. It was a shock when I found out that was the terms of the job (3 months in, there were dramatic changes in my schedule) and most of my friends seem to agree with me. Am I off base?"
