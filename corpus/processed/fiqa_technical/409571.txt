"Why does the article, which refers to the 2006-2008 boom as a gilded age use the same time period as a basis for labor participation calculation? Should they not use a more wise approach and make the basis around 2005 or 2004 and then calculate the amount of labor participating in order to account for the ""false high"" of 2007? Maybe I missed something in my education but if a specific time counts as an anomaly, then it should not be the base calculation when deriving a hypothesis about that time period. For example wage growth between 2005 and 2007 increased x% but between 2007 and 2009 decreased 3x% so we are really in for it now. It should be the base period of 2005 shows a growth of x% to 2007 and from 2005 to 2009 shows a growth of only one tenth x%. Of course this would make for much less sensationalist journalism and may not sell as many news stories as a sensationalist story would."
