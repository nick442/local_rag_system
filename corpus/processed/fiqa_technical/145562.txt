The easiest one to explain is swapping a variable interest rate with a fixed interest rate. Now like your 5. You are a being bullied on a playground, and the most important thing for you is to buy lunch! You have a bully on the playground who asks for money randomly, he's variable. It depends on how much sleep he got last night, and what he ate for breakfast, but by dealing with him he has a large amount of 'market risk'. You always try to bring enough money so you can pay the bully and still eat lunch. But this isn't an ideal situation..it's too sporadic. Instead you have an agreement with a 'mafia' like bully. He agrees to deal with the 'variable' bully, at a flat rate. So now you can plan ahead, and you now always have money for lunch. (The mafia bully still would owe the money to the variable bully, because in real life these would be banks) That's the deal. You are mitigating your risk from switching from variable to fixed. This example is extremely simple, but the idea is, you can remove variable risk by using a 'swap' for a fixed rate.
