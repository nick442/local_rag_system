It becomes a different game when you allow penny and ultra cheap stocks. People make much less plays, because the price of the stock doesn't change hardly ever, and when it does change you can end up with people making 10x money over night, and when that happens they sell everything and just camp on their cash till the deadline runs out. Penny/cheap stocks are fun, but only when you start with very little money, like $5,000, and everyone plays for them. They are a game breaker when you play the legit market. The >$2 rule is a default option when you setup a game, it isn't something random I made up.
