"I don't know where you got the info from that I have no clue personally, I have been the victim of racist abuse throughout my life. I also don't know who you are, I don't know when I called you a racist unless you yourself are Marc Faber (in which case you are a racist). Finally, I don't care about being a ""bastion of kindness"". The commenter I responded to just alleged that certain races make America worse. If he feels sad that I called him a racist idiot for saying that I couldn't really care less. If you feel sad for him too, sucking his dick might make the both of you feel better. Just a few weeks ago a guy in a car threatened to run me over just over the colour of my skin. I was just coming back from college - I had no idea who the guy in the car was and I was crossing the road so if he wanted to he could have killed me and my mama could have come down to see her son's brains all over the road. Nobody stood up for me over all these years and I've seen other races completely different from mine subject to worse, so fuck being a ""bastion of kindness"", when it comes to racists I'm a bastion of fuck you."
