I hate this argument. Budweiser is one of the highest quality products ever produced. Every single one is exactly like every other one, worldwide, and for several decades. They pay shit tons of money to keep it that way too. They are the largest because that is what people want. That said, it is a shit American pilsner brewed with rice adjuncts, and I despise it.
