I'd be very surprised (but feel free to prove me wrong) if he advised people to pay in physical cash. He probably means to not take out debt. In the world of M&A, the term cash is used a bit differently. You can fund a deal with cash, stock, or a combination of both. However, there are different sources of cash. You can have funds in your bank account, or you can go borrow funds in the debt market. So what this means for this deal is that AMZN shareholders will not be giving up any equity for the acquisition. They will either use cash that is in their bank accounts or go to the debt markets, raise debt, and use the proceeds to pay WFM shareholders. No one shows up with physical cash in either case. It's wired over to the people who will then distribute the money to the shareholders.
