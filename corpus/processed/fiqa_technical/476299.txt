"Yes, U.S. currency of any denomination is ""legal tender FOR ALL DEBTS, public and private."" But when you go into a store you (normally) don't owe them anything. In that case, it's more like a barter transaction: Your currency for their soda. Meaning that they can refuse to take ""your currency."" Open an account at the store, and run up a debt. Then you can pay in any denomination."
