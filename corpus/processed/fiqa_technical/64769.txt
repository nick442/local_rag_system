Not in the slightest. The issue is however the same one. We've created new industries to replace the ones lost - in many cases 1:1 because advancing technology simply displaced jobs or made them higher on the education/pay scale. Likewise in a lot of cases rather than reduce employment overall we saw increased productivity. That is good for everyone since a rising tide lifts all ships. The issue however is one of stability. When you get a shock to the system (2008, 1932 etc) then the whole thing falls apart. Last time it took spending on a scale undreamed of (WWII) along with a number of important factors to break the downward spiral. I'm wondering what's going to break this one. Last time there were plenty of mid-skill high pay jobs (manufacturing) to reboot the economy. This time most of those jobs are gone - having been replaced either by automation or sent overseas to cheaper labor markets. Now once the rest of the planet catches up or if fuel starts to go into the stratosphere again then we'll see a lot of those jobs come back (as some already have). I don't think we'll see as many as we had in the past. The service market is far more susceptible to shocks than manufacturing however just as a sales tax is far more susceptible to shocks than an income tax. Drawing all of that together though if you take it out to its logical conclusion when we hit full automation and even fast food is run by machines.. what are people going to do for employment?
