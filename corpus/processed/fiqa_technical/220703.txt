I'm not saying I'm so sure as to start shorting tech stocks (with market volatility what it is nowadays, you could lose money because bankers got a bailout and everything went up irrespective of its actual earnings). But I'm so sure as to say that selling any stock you've got in small tech companies and avoiding investing in start-ups is probably a good idea.
