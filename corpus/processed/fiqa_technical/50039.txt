For whatever reason, Americans gave up on learning about the world or caring whatsoever about how they are governed. Most people around me have some working knowledge of current events, but aren't interested or passionate enough to do anything about. And the 2 party system perpetuates this behavior, as does the media we consume. A lot of us don't vote because we don't believe at all in the system. As for military spending vs. social programs, well.. it's hard to disagree over facts [so I'll just link to this here.](https://static.nationalpriorities.org/images/fb101/2014/presidents-proposed-total-spending.png) Military at 16% vs. social programs at 50% combined. I'll never defend how large our military is - frankly I think it's a joke at how much we spend today - but there are too many spending issues to count and the social programs are a larger part of that than anything else. I'm no republican or democrat. Whether they believe it or not, both political party participants are for bigger government and more centralized control of the economy and our daily lives.
