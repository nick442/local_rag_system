"So really ""it depends"". Are you going to live alone, or have a roommate? What will you do for transportation? One thing you can do it look at university web sites in the area and look at their estimates for monthly living expenses in the area. Not that you will be enrolling in a university, just that those web sites can give you a good idea of living expenses in that part of California. An example site for Glendale (near Burbank) with additional links for more information can be found here: https://www.glendale.edu/apply/international-students/off-campus-housing-homestays As you can see, costs vary depending on your needs."
