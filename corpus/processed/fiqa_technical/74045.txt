It might vary a lot depending on what you'd be doing. I work in PE and my life is mostly a smear of meetings, dinners, weekend getaways, etc., with the people we're trying to pitch to. My friends in VC performing a similar role seem to have a better balance between work and personal life. That being said, our in office staff work a more or less 9-5 week except when there's a crunch for reports or prep work.
