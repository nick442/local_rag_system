Capital only binds together to the extent that it helps each node's (person and/or group) ability to help themselves. I'm not saying that smaller groups of labor shouldn't get together for mutual aid in the same way (after all, that's what unions are, albeit in a somewhat flawed way IMO). I'm just rejecting the notion that all labor shares the commonality to unite around.
