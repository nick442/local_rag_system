I get trying to attract companies, but then you get such a huge company in a smallish city or town, it completely dominates it. I have no idea why you would want that. Look at the Nestle bullshit in Canada, they are clearly breaking the law, but the towns are so reliant on Nestle for tax revenue and jobs, they are literally powerless. Small towns should do everything to discourage super large companies from setting up a head quarters in their towns. The companies will have too much power.
