This.. It's actually far more expensive if you look at it from the nation-state level. This is the same as a division of a company doing a shitty shitty job to save on their budget while annother division has to spend 10x out of their budget because of the Asshats in the other office.. Or say in construction, contractor A saved $80 by running the wrong pipe. Then Contractor B needs to overspend by $245k when the pipe fails, fucks everything 3 floors down and all needs to be replaced anyway. Do it right the first fucking time...
