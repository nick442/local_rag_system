This sounds like a pretty cool idea, and upon reflection, maybe not so crazy as it sounded to me at first. One suggestion: introduce some (probably vaguely described) rule change that makes it easy for people to contribute from their retirement account(s). That would allow you to plausibly increase the average contribution by a lot, maybe from hundreds like aranaxon described to thousands. If I were trying to do this right now, I'd gather as much money as I could (obviously) and try like hell to make alliances with pension funds and other major non profits that routinely buy a lot of common stock. Then I'd pick one fairly large bank and buy as much as possible. Be aware of [poison pills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_pill) and similar common arrangements that exist to prevent this sort of thing. Partnering with other institutions would help to alleviate them. Once I controlled (with my new-found buddies) a major bank, I'd be quick to replace the board and fire senior management. I'd do everything possible to get around paying any [golden parachutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_parachute). Then make all the changes I want to the bank's practices. The general idea would be that, after this, the *threat* of doing it to another bank would be enough to get them to change, without actually having to pull off a corporate takeover.
