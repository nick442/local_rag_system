Even their breakfasts are, at best, sub-par. I used to visit McD's once or twice a year for a sausage egg McMuffin and hashbrown. The last three times I tried it, the McMuffin had a fraction of the flavor it should have, more grease than it needed, and the hashbrowns were..well..not the most bland potato product I've ever had, but they were trying hard to get the title. Pretty sure I haven't been there for a few years, now. No real reason to.
