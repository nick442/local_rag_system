"As you say, the currency carry trade shouldn't work. The deluge of new cash into a high-interest currency should result in falling exchange rates. A November 2009 paper by Òscar Jordà and Alan Taylor of the University of California, Davis, may be offer one approach which is more stable. According to The Economist: They find that a refined carry-trade strategy—one that incorporates a measure of long-term value—produces more consistent profits and is less prone to huge losses than one that targets the highest yield. However, exchange rates, central bank interest rates, as well as money supply are all political as well as economic constructs. An economic driver for arbitrage may be offset by political will (such as US quantative easing) or even social malaise (Japanese continual low inward investment). I wouldn't go so far as calling the carry trade ""free money"" - currencies have proven far too unstable for that - but state interference in markets tends to be clearly telegraphed and a trader with nerves of steel may take advantage of it."
