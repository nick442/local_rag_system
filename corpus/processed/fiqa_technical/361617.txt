Yes, of course. My point is there are lots of different ways this could be funded. For instance, one of the doctors complained that insurance only paid him $100 for a one-hour exam, but it costs him $300/hour to operate his office - so he quit taking insurance. He said single payer is the way to go. But what if single payer also only pays him $100 for the exam? Then it's probably not so great. If single payer pays him $300, but it requires a 20% payroll tax to fund the system, would that be great? (I am not questioning a single payer system. I am only questioning the lack of information in endorsing a single payer sysetm.)
