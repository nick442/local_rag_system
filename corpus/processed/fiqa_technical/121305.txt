We can go back and forth all day if this should be illegal, should there be qualifications, standards etc. The bigger issue at hand really is what qualifies as being able to live a basic standard of living in regards to income. Can we even define this? This is the core of the issue at hand. Does someone who was making 40k a year deserve it more or less than someone who was making 1mil a year? I don't know. I do know this, if i can make 100k a year and still live a great life with the ability to save enough to have enough stashed away for 6-8 mos of unemployment, why can't people making 1 million+? It should be rather apparent why people making 40k a year can't do that as easy.
