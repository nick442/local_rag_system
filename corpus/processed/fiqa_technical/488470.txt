I wouldn't say it's an 'Office' collaboration tool. When I (briefly) played around with it in an organisation it was mainly for internal social, think along the lines of a corporate Facebook with discussion threads, interest groups and general banter. For a large organisation, it certainly has a place in helping breaking down department walls, encouraging employee discussion on interests/business issues in a a slightly more formal environment cf. Twitter/Facebook.
