"Not if they're unfunded and the company goes under, they don't. And more accurately, defined benefit plans have (perceived) value only to people who don't have the first clue how to soundly invest their own retirement funds - Which admittedly means ""almost everyone"". But TANSTAAFL - Even the rare pension plan that is fully funded and soundly invested will *still* tend to underpeform the market as a whole. If you really want to lock in a sub-5% return, just sink your entire retirement into whole-life annuities and you can gleefully call it a ""pension""."
