It amazes me how I just missed this. I graduated college in 2002. I was able to find a job. My college cost half as much as it does now and I was in the position to buy a home when the market bottomed out. The people who were freshmen in college when I graduated entered a whole different world. The problem is that as I moved up at work, I just got assigned new rolls in addition to what I was doing before. I work in a department of 2 people, we are both Directors. But where is my assistant and helpers, where did the entry level jobs at my workplace go? Downsized and/or outsourced.
