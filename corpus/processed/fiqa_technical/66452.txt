Grocery delivery in the U.K. has been a fairly successful thing for some time and most supermarkets offer this service. I guess the short distances involved makes it easier to operate, typically groceries on offer are the same as in the store and at the same prices, you just pay for it to be delivered in a refrigerated truck. Items are usually picked in the store although some distribute from a central warehouse so perhaps either could be utilised by Amazon, either to addresses nearby a Whole Foods retail store or sell some products from a delivery hub.
