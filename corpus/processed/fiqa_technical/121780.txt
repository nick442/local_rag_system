This sounds wonderful, and you sure are better at life than I am, but it's just not working right now at the country-wide level. You and your friends are not part of the problem. But the 30% or so profits made by the financial sector are just rents--[extra costs the rest of us have-nots have to fork over to the haves](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/03/30/chart-of-the-day-us-financial-profits/). [Businesses have also been making sky-high profits and just sitting on the money](http://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2011/04/business-profits-soar-not-much-trickles-down-unemployed). I don't see the reinvestment. I just see a catch-phrase with no substance behind it.
