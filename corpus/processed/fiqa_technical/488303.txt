Oversimplifying the market into very basic supply and demand doesnâ€™t reflect the way real markets behave. Your example of apple pickers fails to take in to consideration supply from regions where labor costs are significantly lower. If apples grown in the US cost $15 a bag consumers would just buy imported apples that cost significantly less. The result could be US apple farmers are no longer able to compete in the market.
