"One way to start with stocks is by playing the fake stock market. Investigate what trading fees would be with a broker, then ""invest"" a certain amount of money - note it on paper or in a spreadsheet. Follow your stocks, make decisions on selling and buying, and see where you would be after a year or so. That way you can get an idea, even if not exactly precise, on what your returns would be if you really invested the money."
