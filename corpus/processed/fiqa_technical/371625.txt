$1 more an hour = $160 a month..a few matching expenses and it probably increases payroll less than $200 an employee a month. Does anyone really believe that there is no money in personal care/health care? For evey 5 employees it is $1K more a month. That kind of money is next to insignificant in the industry, and the bosses probably spent more on that on food on the company card.
