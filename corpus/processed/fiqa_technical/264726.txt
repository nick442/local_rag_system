[**Legal affairs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Legal_affairs) of article [**Donald Trump**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald%20Trump): [](#sfw) --- >In March 1990, Trump threatened to sue [Janney Montgomery Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janney_Montgomery_Scott), a [stock brokerage firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokerage_firm), whose [analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_analyst) had made negative comments on the financial prospects of Taj Mahal. The analyst refused to retract the statements, and was fired by his firm. Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy for the first time in November 1990. A [defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation) lawsuit by the analyst against Trump for $2 million was settled out of court. On November 2, 1992, the [Trump Plaza Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Plaza_Hotel_and_Casino) filed a prepackaged [Chapter 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11_bankruptcy) protection plan. Under the plan, Trump agreed to give up a 49 percent stake in the luxury hotel to [Citibank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citibank) and five other lenders. In return Trump would receive more favorable terms on the remaining $550+ million owed to the lenders, and retain his position as chief executive, though he would not be paid and would not have a role in day-to-day operations. > --- ^Interesting: [^Donald ^Trump ^\(song)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_\(song\)) ^| [^Donald ^Trump, ^Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump,_Jr.) ^| [^Donald ^J. ^Trump ^State ^Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Trump_State_Park) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjj6nl9) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjj6nl9)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
