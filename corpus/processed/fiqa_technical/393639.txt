"You should seriously just stop talking. The term legacy employees refers to legacy cost structures. Costs that linger from a time when the competitive environment was different than it is today are referred to as legacy costs. It is not derogatory. Take airlines, for example. Airlines used to have incredible legacy costs from unionized employees incurred at a time when the airline industry was regulated. Regulation kept new airlines from starting up, so airlines could very easily afford to pay for pensions, huge benefits, massive salaries, etc. The few airlines in existence then had control over the industry. Then the airlines were deregulated and anyone could start one up. Suddenly, the airlines that could afford massive pensions in the days where they effectively controlled pricing could no longer afford these pensions and benefits when competitors did not offer the same benefits to their employees. Hence, every single ""legacy"" airline went bankrupt over the next few decades."
