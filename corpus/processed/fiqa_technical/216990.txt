Good answers here. I would like to add one more (less obvious) way to save - look for houses that are For Sale By Owner (FSBO). Owner's who are selling without an agent do not have to pay a seller's agent fee. The closing cost savings here are actually on the seller's side of the transaction. However, since you know the seller is saving money, you may be able to negotiate a lower overall selling price with them (or it may be priced lower than comps already) because of this factor. FSBO houses maybe trickier to find than those listed by an agent, because they will not appear on the national MLS used by realtors to find/advertise houses that aren't being sold by their own clients. You may need to physically walk the streets of the neighborhood you're interested in moving to, to look for FSBO yard signs. FSBO sellers may also advertise in local newspapers.
