"Your question was about recharacterizing. But then you said ""I contributed a few thousand dollars to my 401(k) as Roth contributions"" which means you never converted from a 401(k) to a Roth 401(k), the deposit was always Roth. Even if the law changes allowing the recharacterization, it would not apply to your situation."
