"> Who has the throwaway? Does reddit take everything so serious that a throwaway is needed anytime something doesn't go along 100% with popular opinion? Shit, I wasn't even challenging that it's lower. I didn't mean throwaway account, I meant throwaway comment that's effectively copy-pasted from every reddit thread ever. Popular versions are also ""There's no room for your [obviously desirable quality/statement]"" and ""We don't have time for your [obviously desirable quality/statement]"". I meant no offense, though those style of comments do irritate me; I'll be the first to admit that's a personal problem more than a reddit problem."
