Definitely more in the economics wheelhouse, but I thought it would be interesting to write a research paper on the black market premium. With marijuana becoming legalized in more and more districts it's interesting to see the effect on prices. I live in Canada and many of my friends are very sure that prices will rise because of taxes. I am not so sure. I think economies of scale and getting rid of the black market premium will more than make up for the costs of regulation and taxation.
