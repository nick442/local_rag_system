OCD is a serious condition and honestly you should avoid taking advice on how to deal with it from strangers on the internet. I am guessing you are having problems getting a good answer because few people are willing to risk harming someone in a vulnerable state. You need someone who can work with you throughout the process not some one time quick fix solution dreamed up by some anonymous people on the internet. I wish you luck and please do not take this as blowing you off. My best suggestion is find someone you trust and engage them in helping you gain control over your behavior.
