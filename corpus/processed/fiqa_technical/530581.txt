I am tired of the political bullshit on this subreddit. **Obama pushed for the same thing.** Just try doing a little research once in a while.. https://www.google.com/search?q=obama+public+private+partnerships&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS580US580&oq=obama+public+pr&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.6974j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 Look at some of those articles, pbs.org, thehill.com. Left-leaning news was all for it. Now all of a sudden because Trump is carrying it forward it's the coming of Satan. Let's stick to the economics of it and not the politics of it, that's what this sub is about (or should be).
