"Things like the air, fisheries, forests, oil fields, research science teams, etc. are ""commons goods"". They're scarce, but you can't actually stop anyone from using them or benefiting from them. They normally have no property rights and can't extract revenue for their own work or good. So pollution permits, or fishing licenses, are charged as commons rents."
