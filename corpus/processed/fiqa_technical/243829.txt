If people don't pay their taxes there's no way the government can have the funds to do any work not to mention the levels of corruption within the government itself doesn't allow anything to happen anyways. https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/05/03/guess-how-many-people-pay-taxes-in-india.html This article says less than 2 percent of Indians pay income tax. Vast majority who gain incomes through some sort of business earning never show taxes and handle with cash dealings. Then again even if we do pay taxes there's just no guarantee that it would be put to good use unlike in wealthier countries.
