I agree with all those points, but add them as reasoning to why I'm against the program. I'd rather invest the money into something worthwhile, and if I die have what's there be left to my family. My family and I would be better off. I believe that this would be true for every other individual paying into social security as well, and the great union would be better off putting that money into proper investments rather than a twisted defined benefits program.
