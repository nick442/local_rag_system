buying a logo from a foreign subsidiary is an import. They are importing the rights of the logo and is a trade imbalance to the negative. what are you claiming they are exporting? money? seriously? maybe you can claim they benefit more from the economic activity than the taxes. But you cant claim they benefit from being a net exporter.
