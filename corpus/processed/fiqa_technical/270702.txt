CS grad here currently getting my MBA. seriously don't do CS unless you love, and I mean LOVE programming. I did it and realized junior year that I hated it and was miserable. I stayed another year and got a minor in business which landed me a job in consulting. CS is hard man. Really, really hard and you get total shit interaction with people. If you have other questions I'd love to answer. On mobile now so I can't go into super detail.
