This is why business leaders and government leaders need to think and act much differently. Caring about the bottom-line and caring about the welfare of people are 2 completely different objectives. This is why I fear a Romney presidency. The man has proven time and time again how little he cares about people especially when money is on the line. note: Not liking Romney doesn't mean I like Obama.
