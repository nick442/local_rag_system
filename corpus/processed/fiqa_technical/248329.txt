The last batch I ordered were 2 sided. I did this because they were for my film production freelancing, so I could be leaving them on tables and things and using them as mini flyers of sorts to advertise. For my day job I have one sided as these won't really be used to advertise but to provide contact info. I find it's nice to have space on the back to write notes, alternative contact info etc.
