I cant speak for years ago, it coukd be that amazon took those articles to heart and changed its policies. Whatever the case, Amazon is one of the top employers in my area, and for good reason. The only thing i cant say anything aboit is career advancement, but even that is decades ahead of the competition. Free textbooks, company pays a portion of tuition, and automatic time off to attend school if you want it. The only condition is to stay actively enrolled with good grades, and be in one of a few specific fields of study (the idea is that amazon is investing in a skilled employee that it needs)
