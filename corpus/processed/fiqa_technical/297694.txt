Value is one area where economic theories tend to diverge and the (very) basic schools of thought both have excellent points in their favor. You've identified both here; one being that economic value can always be determined by net labor* or at least cost of inputs and the other being that economic value does not exist in and of itself and that only a market can determine value. In some ways it is just a question of world-view as much as anything but the concepts of natural prices or innate worth are difficult to argue against. At the same time, without exchange the concept of value has little meaning. So, as usual, it is some sophistry mixed with some sense. Both have elements of truth and both are considerably more complex than they seem at first. Interestingly though, neither seems to work very well as predictive models despite providing the basis for some incredibly complex and interesting mathematical workups. * Note that net labor is the sum of ALL labor involved and is incredibly difficult to quantify accurately.
