"If my wife and I tried this, we'd call it grounds for divorce. However, I think most long term couples actually do this, and it is just a budget. It is common practice for two spouses to deposit money into a single checking account. All of the household expenses are then paid from that single account. Same as you describe: if I spend money from the joint checking that is less money available to my wife. Based on your dollar amount, I'd have to say great work on thinking about saving early on in life. I think though, if you are actually starting out, getting into the habit of saving a ""dime of every dollar"" would be more beneficial. At some point your income will increase, and when it does so should your savings. By ""paying yourself first"" your savings will keep pace with your spending and you will be a happier person when you income starts to fall again."
