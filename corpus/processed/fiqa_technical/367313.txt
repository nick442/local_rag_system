You sell when you think the stock is over valued, or you need the money, or you are going to need the money in the next 5 years. I buy and hold a lot. I bought IBM in 8th grade 1980. I still own it. I bought 3 share it from $190 and its now worth $5,000 do to dividend reinvestment and splits. That stock did nothing for a thirteen years except pay a dividend but then it went up by 1800% the next 20 and paid dividends. So I agree with other posters the whole pigs get slaughtered thing is silly and just makes fund managers more money. Think if you bought aapl at $8 and sold at $12. The thing went to 600 and split 7-1 and is back to $120. My parents made a ton holding Grainger for years and I have had good success with MMM and MSFT owning those for decades.
