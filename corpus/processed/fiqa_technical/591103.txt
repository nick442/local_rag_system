"When using Time Value of Money equations, you need to know when the flow starts. A mortgage for example, has a first payment at the end of the first time period, usually 1 month. For savings, one can start the account with a deposit of course, or start by saying ""I will deposit $XXX at the end of each month. The answer really depends on the exact details of the situation. In your example, I'm inclined to suggest first flow is 1 year out."
