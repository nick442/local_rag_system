> If corporations are already so flush with cash they only inflate the stock market, why would further tax breaks improve anything? US Companies are hiding cash in oversea tax havens like Ireland and the Bahamas until tax rates go down or they are given amnesty so they don't have to pay exorbitant taxes that other companies who they compete against in other countries don't have to pay. When that money eventually comes back to the US, investment of the repatriated money will be infused into the economy through capital investments (factories, new ventures and hiring people) which will benefit the economy and will create jobs and other benefits.
