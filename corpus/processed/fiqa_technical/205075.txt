To deduct medical expenses (in the US), your expenses must first be reduced by 10% of your AGI. So a $30K earner can only deduct expenses over $3K, for example. Then, the deduction is added to your other itemized deductions, and it's only taken if it exceeds the standard deduction, $6300 for a single person. In the end, you need to do the math and see is the savings is worth it. If the tooth makes you self conscious or insecure, it may be worth every cent to do it ASAP.
