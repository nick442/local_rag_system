I think many of you are making unrelated comments and taking unjustified conclusions from the news, without reading the research. Many of the mentioned share provisions are not exclusive to Silicon Valley, technology firms, or the rest of Private Equity (i.e. ex-VC). The paper says: >These generous terms are not necessarily evidence of active post-money valuation manipulation and could simply be due to a difficult fund raising environment. And: >Importantly, our discussion does not imply that these terms were given for the purpose of manipulating SpaceXâ€™s value. That is not to say that I am not skeptical of many of the business models and valuations of the companies in the sample, but that is off the research topic. What the authors suggests is that valuation is often miscalculated by many people in the industry, and provides some relevant cases: from mutual funds who market those shares at the value of the most recent funding round, regardless of share provisions; to employees that wrongly perceive their wealth. I have some trouble accepting Brownian Motion to model exit prices (or pretty much anything else), it seems a bit off from reality, but nevertheless I think the paper is worth the read.
