I get CapIQ and Bloomberg, and I definitely prefer Bloomberg just because of the completeness of information. There's nowhere else that you can get a full financial statement breakdown and then seconds later have a debt distribution schedule and then with another couple keystrokes get a complete credit ratings history and have that only be scratching the surface of the info available. CapIQ is sometimes better than Bloomberg for street consensus estimates going out more than a year or two but I don't find myself using it that much.
