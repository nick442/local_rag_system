Do you think that the scheme of kick backs in this system isn't a problem? There was that story a while ago about a judge who was paid off to convict and sentence to a certain prison. That's just the obvious one. I suspect that there are many ways the system is being gamed beyond that one too. Prison does need to have a path for reform or you create career criminals.
