We just declared bankruptcy, chapter 13, paying back all debtors over a 5 year period, 7% interest, no fees, no penalties, 100% payback. Every one of our debtors was required to submit proofs of claim to the court, and those that did are getting everything that is owed to them. Those that did not provide proofs of claim get nothing. The bankruptcy finalized today (12/12/2011) and so far about $10k worth of debt has been disallowed by the court for their failure to provide proof. The relief, both financially and emotionally has been tremendous.
