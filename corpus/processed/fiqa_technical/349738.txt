I would focus entirely on the emergency fund first and get it built up as fast as you can. Once that is in place, you've got a cushion that will keep you from going into debt in an emergency. Depending on your monthly expenses, $2000 seems low for that. I'd aim for 3-6 months worth of expenses. Note that this is $800 less than your monthly income because of your savings. Once you have your emergency fund in place, then follow a formula like @MrChrister's to invest for retirement and save for future major purchases (car, house, vacation, etc).
