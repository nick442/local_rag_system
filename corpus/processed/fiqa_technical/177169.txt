No; it's a bond, not a wrapper like an ISA. You can buy more bonds, assuming you do this before they run out. And it's a retail bond, so you can't sell it; you have to leave the money tied up for the term. Remember, once you take cash out of an ISA you can't put it back - though you could of course put it back using this year's (Â£15k) allowance. And as the bond has 20% tax deducted at source, it's maybe not a good idea to take money out and lose its tax free nature. You can get 2.4% tax free from Coventry Building Society.
