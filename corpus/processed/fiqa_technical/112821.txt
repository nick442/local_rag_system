You can add $262,500 worth of notes payable (assuming that you use the cash to buy inventory immediately). Any more and you would push the current ratio below 2. In case this ratio is the trouble, the formula for current ratio is current assets over current liabilities. Notes payable is a current liability and inventory is a current asset so you add the number to both of them. I used Excel to do this. With this addition the quick ratio is 1.19. The formula for this is (current assets - inventory)/Current liabilities. So you take ($1,312,500 + $262,500 - $262,500 - $375,000)/($525,000 + $262,500) = 1.19
