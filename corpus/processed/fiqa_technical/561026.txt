That's what i was afraid of. If I did decide to double major it is going to be extremely difficult to keep my grades up all while juggling a job, so it's something I have to think about. After speaking to IB I'll see if it is for me. If not I was thinking about hedge fund or private equity. Guess we'll see. What other certifications should I keep in mind? Thank you for all your advice!
