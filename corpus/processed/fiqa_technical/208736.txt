Iâ€™ve had to move 7 times in the past 3 years, a combination of military, civilian, and student permanent moves. Several of those times it was impossible to bring anything more than a backpack or some luggage so I basically had to start building my home all over. So yeah mostly big ticket stuff (sonos are a must for me lol) but some late nights I might buy 4 pairs of timbs and wake up not remembering what I did lol.
