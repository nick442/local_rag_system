If you use a credit union, I look for the co-op network credit union ATMs. Wide network of fee-free ATMs: http://co-opcreditunions.org/locator/?ref=co-opatm.org&sc=1 You'll have to check with your bank or credit union to see what networks they belong to and if it isn't satisfactory to you, find a new bank or credit union.
