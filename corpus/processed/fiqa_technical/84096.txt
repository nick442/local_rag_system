I find that very surprising. My engineering degree came with a healthy dose of engineering economics. It's just another optimization problem for an engineer and they are generally really good at that sort of thing if you pose the problem to them. Of course the best ones already know this but even the lesser ones will generally do a good job if they know the business goals and constraints. Of course, management needs to share what those are and often they suck at that.
