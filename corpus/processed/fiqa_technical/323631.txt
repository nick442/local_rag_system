The GOP is in power and have an opportunity to build policy around taking care of the poor. Which is demanded by scripture in every corner that you look. So I have no trouble calling a Christian republican a hypocrite if they choose to use their power to build and propose legislative action which will do nothing to help the poor and will very likely make them more vulnerable. They have agency and they're using it to selfish ends contrary to the tenants of the faith. No where does the Bible equate taxation with theft or force, in fact paying taxes is expressly condoned and expected. Matthew 22:15-22
