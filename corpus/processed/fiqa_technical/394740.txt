It may depend on the rental agreement you signed, some agreements may include clauses that allow for early termination so check your agreement carefully. Where there is an early termination clause included it will usually have some sort of notice period or financial penalty associated with it. For example you may have to give a couple of months notice and pay rent up to the end of that period or be able to pay some sort of one-off penalty. As a more practical example I broke a US rental agreement early last Autumn and had two early termination options in my rental agreement: In my case we chose the second option since we were actually moving out of the country and it was easier to have our US finances completely settled. I'm now planning on breaking another agreement because I'm in the process of purchasing a property and the purchase will likely go through before the lease expires. In this case the early termination clause requires 2 months notice i.e. we will have to give 2 months notice and pay rent for those two months (unless we are less than 2 months from the end of the lease). As @BrenBarn points out you should also check the laws for the jurisdiction your rental agreement is in to understand what your rights and options are if your agreement does not have an early termination clause
