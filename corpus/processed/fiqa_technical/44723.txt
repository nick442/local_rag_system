I think I understand what you are saying. What I am confused about is the gov decision to give the $5 subsidy is because they believe the ppl that qualify for the subsidy are not able to meet the $10 price point, so then more ppl are able to pay that price. If the gov was giving ppl the subsidy that can afford to pay the $10 than I completely understand s price hike, but raising the price simply due to the existence of a subsidy certain ppl qualify for, just leaves us back to square one right? On a side note, this is the major reason I am leaning more toward socialized medicine because those Econ theories (subsidy increasing prices) work for typical markets of goods and services ppl can walk away from. The thing is that you can't walk away from health care. I work in medicine and from my experience most ppl working in the field aren't there for just making $$. Investors for sure are there for only that, but I just don't see a pure capitalistic model giving us better health outcomes.
