"Why do I like not having a planet 100% covered in salt water, with no land or fresh water? Gee, I am glad you had to ask. Globalization has been happening since before the USA declared independence, it has been happening for the past few decades within the USA, and it has nothing to do with any type of market (free, capitalistic, socialist, communist, command economy). You can't credit ""capitalism,"" with the reason the USA was so fiscally successful, when there was gold, lumber, furs, practically free tobacco and cotton thanks to slave labor, etc. It was a free-for-all in the new world, and has grown exponentially, since. I can hope to have a voice in whether we're living in the final 100 years of life on earth with dry land and clean air. I am not going to be able to refute any economic philosopher taught in grad schools across the USA, whether they espouse a command economy, capitalism, socialism, anarchy, or any other option. I am sure you liked Ricardian Theory and your professor very well."
