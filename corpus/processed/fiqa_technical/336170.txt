"Paying for a good home inspection, from a person you choose. Mine was $500 and the guy gave me a nice print out with a bunch of little problems that I knew had to be fixed. It was easy to determine my fix-up cost, which was separate from my ""I want to change this"" cost. He was working for me, not the agents or the seller, so I felt more trusting of his advice. If you end up shopping hard and looking seriously at several houses, you might end up paying this more than once. (A bad report would be a good contingency for cancelling your offer.)"
