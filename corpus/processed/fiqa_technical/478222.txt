They are competitors, but they have the same investors for both companies. It's what happened with Circuit City and Best Buy. Owned by the same parent firm, they strategically placed stores near each other and created fake competition by labeling the same item in each store as a different price, sometimes CC would have cheaper software but Best Buy always had the cheaper high end tech/appliances. So ultimately it was a giant smoke and mirrors cash grab on the part of the CEOs and major investors to create fake competition so they could have more profit. The same shit is happening with LG and Samsung.
