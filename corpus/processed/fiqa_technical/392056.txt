I am glad they are going away. Malls are an environmental tragedy. 1)They are the product (or maybe even part of the cause) of suburban sprawl. They encourage car usage and, by virtue of their need for large open areas to be constructed, are often far from where most people work and live. As a result, patrons have to drive large distances from their houses/jobs to the shopping centers. 2) The [parking lots are tremendous waste of space and hugely damage the environment.](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/transportation/parking-environmental-impacts-development-policies-research-roundup) 3) Online shopping is much better for the environment as the product can be shipped directly to the consumer. 4) Once they are built and then closed, the space where the centers sat is basically abandoned and turns into blight. Depending on the businesses that were housed in the mall and the businesses that were supported by the mail (especially gas stations), these sites could be toxic. I am sure there are more reasons why malls are environmentally harmful, but those are a few off the top of my head.
