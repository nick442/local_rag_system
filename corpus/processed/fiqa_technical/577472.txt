"Wow, that's expensive. Here's a list of the channels you get for the 30€ plan: http://media.abonnez-vous.orange.fr/medias/pdf/divers/chaines-TV.pdf ( You have to pay extra for the ones in gray and the first 19 channels are free even without a subscription ) There are probably much less channels than in the US but you probably only watch 1% of the available channels. Since I just checked, extra channels (like Canal+ which you could say is the french equivalent of HBO) are pretty expensive (40€/month). But I only watch American shows ""on the internet"" so I wouldn't know ;)"
