I've developed a [hybrid charity-fair profit business model](http://www.naturalfinance.net/2011/03/open-partnerships.html) that has an entire section devoted to Monsanto. Basically, GM foods is a comparable innovation to a cure for cancer or AIDS. The excessive greed of Monsanto would make them just as hated if they controlled the cure for cancer as well. Enhanced food productivity saves lives. More nutritious food would too. Monopolies that attempt to strangle every possible profit from the innovation are obviously focusing on saving as few lives as necessary.
