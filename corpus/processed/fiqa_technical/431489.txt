"Her ""experience"" over the past 10-15 years ago is not relevant and the fact is that it ended with the worst and biggest security breach in the history of the world. Do you want me to give you quotes of what Susan said ""from her experience"" in professional discussions about security? To see how clueless she was. Let's be brutally honest: what are the chances do you think that Susan got her job because she was an expert and the best choice for the job? I, with at least 98% certainty, am sure that she got her job because she knows someone, or someone at Equifax knows her. Anyway, enjoy the great experience, talent and knowledge that Susan has in this discussion: [http://archive.is/6M8mg](http://archive.is/6M8mg) > Susan: â€œThere are a lot of things to consider with that. One school of thought says that **when you put corporate assets into the cloud, they are more secure because you know exactly what you have there. You have an exact inventory, you know exactly who has access to that data, and how it is controlled.**"" This is so dumb and so incorrect and untrue."
