"Would love to see it happen but unfortunately agree with you. There is already demand for a non-cable ISP but telecoms have dug in for the long fight and are actively fighting these out of existence. Combine this with the fact that new media still needs to get it's content from somewhere and a ton of this content is owned by cable providers. They were willing to experiment with these new media sources when they were a tiny slice of the pie but now that new media is gaining mass market appeal, they want to massively overcharge for content to either a) drive the companies out of business or b) continue reaping their insane profits. The telecoms essentially have a monopoly and are using that to prolong the existence of dying businesses. I see this playing out in one of several ways. 1. The government wises up and either breaks up the monopolies or allows internet to become available through other means (as a public utility or allowing these ""mom and pop"" ISP's to exist). Don't know about the rest of the world but it will be a while before this happens in the US. 2. New media providers find way to distribute and market independent content and rid themselves of at least one factor holding them back. Unfortunately most people don't seem to be interested in independent content. I would suspect this is largely due to these companies owning the vertical and telling you what you should watch as well. 3. These companies die a long slow and painful death at the hands of piracy at which point a sane and legal way of getting content is free to exist without being squashed out of existence."
