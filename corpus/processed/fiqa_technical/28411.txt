That definitely hit home. I'd be thinking the same thing every time I submitted an online application and its quite frustrating. I'm beginning to realize I shot my self in the foot after graduation when a friend put me in contact with a friend of his who works at a large aerospace firm. The contact seemed more than willing to help me out and I figured at the very least i'd get an interview. So I dedicated all my time prepping for the position and following up with my contact. 2 months later it all fell through when the firm changed the requirements for the position. I asked my contact what happened and he basically said oh well. So yeah I spent all this time so focused on one job that I thought I would get and it didn't work out. In school I learned what to do in a job but due to my circumstances (working 30 hours a week in a bar in order to pay for school) I never learned HOW to get a job. given that, I appreciate your suggestions and although everything you said seems obvious now, I think I've mainly been in denial and don't want to give up on what I really want. But thankfully I do have connections in other industries and friends who are more than willing to give mock interviews. I have the tools but as you said now its up to me to stop sulking and take the initiative. Thanks for the response, definitely needed to hear that. I will also send you my resume if you don't mid taking a quick look.
