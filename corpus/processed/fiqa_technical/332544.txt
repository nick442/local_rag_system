"In 1989 there were ~18 million visitors. ~36 million achieved in 2003/2004. That is 14 or 15 years. To go from ~9 million to the ~18 million that visited before the ""change"" it took 14 years (~9 million in 1975) So no it didn't double in under 10 years at any point between 1989 and today and in fact it hasn't doubled at all since 1990. Been over 20 years now. And when it did double it took the same amount of time it has always taken."
