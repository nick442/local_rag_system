Did you read the part where the economists said the economic growth from unskilled workers was offset by the need for social services? Economists said globalization would be good for American workers. Then, whoops, sorry. Trade agreements lift those countries with high rates of poverty and depresses the wages of the middle classes in better off countries. Economists love to crow about free markets. Then, whoops, sorry. Banking and insurance needs regulations to prevent abuses leading to worldwide recession. Economists look at everything from the basic Econ 101 model they learned in school which described the ideal market. Theoretically, this is how markets work. I don't know why we still put so much faith in their words.
