Yeah history shows us lower taxes of stock helped the economy soooooo much. Just ask bush and his surplus he turned to a deficit when he lowered taxes, including the taxes capital gains. Bitch, when I cash my paycheck it's going into the bank, who will take my 50k i got from taxing Donald trump more because now I'm a federal employee, removing 50k from the stock market into the economy. You act like it would be some disastrous effect to tax the stock market more. Then maybe people wouldn't be pricing companies 10 years out because they have so much money they don't know what to do with it.
