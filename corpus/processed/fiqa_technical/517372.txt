"Ive got a lengthy reply for you, but I forgot to hit send. Anyway.. Honest question without entrapment. Do you really believe this ""anti science"" rhetoric? You must see that a good bit of that comes from a liberal media pushing an agenda. What has he actually done that is oppositional to science? As a data point the largest hit to NIH funding came during the Obama years. Granted they cleverly hid it in sequestration so they weren't left holding the bag, but they also didn't spend considerable political capital defending it. Not exactly a pro science move in any pragmatic sense. NASA funding increased 800 million. NSF is up 100 million. Collectively agencies are up 14 million from 2015. Data here https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/fedfunds/2015/html/FFS2015_DST_003.html Ultimately you have to admit the rapid expansion of entitlements lobbied for by democrats will necessarily create budgetary pressure on non defense spending. The assumption being that budgets of grant agencies is the primary mechanism by which government exerts control over science."
