Estonia is one of the few countries where you can purchase silver tax-free. You may wish to hedge your risk by investing a percentage of your Estonian currency into this tangible asset. Silver can be stored securely at a place of your choosing rather than in a financial institution. Plus you can purchase a small amount with only minor transaction costs.
