Kind of. You want to alter the kinds of foods you eat for life, such as cutting out soda and fast food. But the purpose of a diet is to lose weight, which means consuming fewer calories than you burn. When you're at a healthy weight, you want to maintain it, which means eating the same amount as you burn. So at some point, the dieting does stop, but that doesn't mean you go back to eating shit, it just means you have to eat a bit more to maintain your weight.
