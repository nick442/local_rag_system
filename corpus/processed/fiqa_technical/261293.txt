The government would never do something like this. What the government needs to do is start creating incentives for factories to produce simple drugs like potassium fucking chloride so it doesn't go on back order again. Companies don't want to make this stuff anymore because there's no profit in it. At one point my hospital was even at risk of not having enough methotrexate for two children to receive their therapy until one of the parents took it to the media. http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/ucm050792.htm There's the ridiculously long list of drugs on shortage/backorder.
