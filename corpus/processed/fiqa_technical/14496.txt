"Social media and word of mouth are going to be your best friends. Build yourself a good reputation for quality and good social skills. ""Hair designing"" is a big part of your job but so is socializing. You have to build relationships with people in the service industry to keep them coming back as a general point. My suggestion is to focus on the clientele you have remaining and strengthen your relationship with them. They will pass on the word of how well you're doing and how they really like to use you. In the mean time to build more clientele, try taking to social media. Share photos of your work (with your clients' permission) and offer special deals for people who follow you. Maybe offer 50% off the first visit for the next 5 new clients or something like that. Yeah, you're going to earn less money on those clients for those visits, but you may gain a long term client or 2 out of the deal. If that fails, you might try to get on with an established salon through a place like JC Penny or great clips, something like that.. until you can build a bigger clientele. All of the successful hair designers I know have several things in common - talented, sociable, empathetic, great pricing, nice atmosphere and a killer ongoing portfolio. Good luck"
