No, I don't have to 'deal with it'. In fact, there's a whole class of people who refuse to 'deal with it' and simply structure their businesses so that their profits are untaxable and accumulate in fun places like Bermuda where thieves such as yourself can't touch it. You might want to consider that perhaps the world would be a better place if you and yours learned to take care of your own rather than expecting others to do it for you.
