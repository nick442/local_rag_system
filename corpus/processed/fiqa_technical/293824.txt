> Their actual journalists like Chris Wallace or Shep Smith aren't that bad Yeah they are. They all play specific roles. If the theater wasn't complicated enough with detail, people would realize that it's fake. So they've got characters to fill every necessary role. It's easy to think it's real, until you look at the larger picture. See all of the sides and how they (the characters) manipulate their willing audience. If they were legitimate they wouldn't need to use deception.
