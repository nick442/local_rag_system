> I can't believe no one has mentioned Detroit yet! There's a reason for that: Detroit's lags far behind the competition. > University of Michigan.. The state is filled with good schools.. As far as educational attainment is concerned, metro Detroit is underwhelming. Many companies around here also have difficulty recruiting people to the area. >Detroit has an exploding urban core but also lots of space for new development right downtown. Detroit is still well behind the curve in terms of development. I guess open land might be considered a mild positive, but Amazon would build in a suburb somewhere if that were the only concern. >It has a quickly diversifying economy I've seen people make this assertion before, but I have yet to see even a shred of evidence supporting it. This city still lives and dies by auto.
