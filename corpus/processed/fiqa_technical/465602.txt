"Ahh okay thanks. The economic terms and lessons are coming back to me lol. I guess in the end it was a question on profit margins based on time. And god no the sandwiches are way better quality than Subway. Maybe I'll go get Subway to remind myself why I stopped eating it.. Guess it's my fault for using small numbers. I was just thinking like gourmet PB&J deep-fried and coated in sugar for $3.00. Had one at some ""friend's"" bakery last week and can't stop thinking about how crunchy but gooey it was for $3.00.. They weren't on the menu but my buddy gets bored working at his bakery and made me that glorified donut with PB&J filling. No regrets :) actually I guess I should've used donuts as the example and not sandwiches. Oh well too late."
