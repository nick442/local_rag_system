>“We want to help the people who may transition to a new job as a result of our technology the best way we know how: education.” >As new technology destroys one kind of job, it creates opportunities for others. We’ll need fewer line cooks, they say, but more engineers and technicians. The problem isn’t that jobs are lost on net, it’s the resulting skills gap. Transitioning into new work can be difficult to navigate, especially for low-wage workers. The argument that automation will only result in different jobs bothers me. Of course there will be a net loss in jobs. If replacing line cooks with robots results in an equal number of (higher paid) technicians and engineers, why spend the capital to replace the cheaper line cooks in the first place? The problem *is* that the jobs lost are net.
