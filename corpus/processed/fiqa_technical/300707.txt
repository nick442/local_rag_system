That's a pretty good writeup. The conclusion is worth noting here: >He believes that when you add all the environmental impacts, they still come out in favor of electric vehicles. (The Union of Concerned Scientists agrees; it found that even when you add in emissions from battery manufacturing, EVs generate half the emissions of a conventional car over the course of its life.) Still, consumers and investors should understand what it takes to make the materials that enable their green choices. Electric cars still seem to come out on top, though they could get better. We need to be aware of the issues, so we can hopefully push for better mining practices, for greener energy, and for awareness of potential trouble points such as recycling.
