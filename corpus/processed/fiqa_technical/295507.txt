"Those ""haters"" are trying to convince you away from making a poor investment. It would honestly be unethical for us not to. Tell you what. Meet with these people in real life. Take a tour of their current operations. Do your due diligence. Ask them hard questions. Like. Why they need to reach out to friends for investment, rather than a venture capitalist or a bank loan? At worst they are lying and it is fraud. At best they are in over their head with bad business sense and you're about to get sucked into it. Just because weed in general is going to take off, does not mean YOUR weed shop is going to take off. Example: Smartphones have taken over the world. Microsoft recently axed its windows phone because it did not work out for them. Your weed shop could be the iphone of weed. It also could be the windows phone of weed. I know you've gone over how he has experienced high demand. There's a saying we like here: Past performance is not indicative of future results. Its entirely possible a large retail chain (Amazon perhaps?) could enter the market and undercut you to the point that you are making a loss."
