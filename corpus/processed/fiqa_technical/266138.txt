i am not against bonuses, provided employees have health care, retirement contributions from the corporation, a living wage and a claw back clause if exec is fired for cause. The problem is for too many companies the bonus is based on exec's squeezing employees benefits or bought buy the execs using profits to buy back stock to increase stock prices and inflate bonuses based on stock price.
