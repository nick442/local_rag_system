I can confirm this, as I just had 4 machinists retire in my department within days of turning 65. Predictions are that 3-5 million jobs will open up in my industry (manufacturing) over the next 5 or so years solely due to retiring baby boomers. Things are not all doom-and-gloom out there. We actually had to request a few of them to come back in part-time since it is rather difficult to find experienced machinists.
