"You've touched on a very abstract concept that exist partly due to fractional-reserves and directly due to currency having no base (ex. not backed by gold), money can and does just pop into existence. To answer your question, we have to understand that the criminal is irrelevant. ""Can't a cyber criminal increase/decrease a bank's holdings just by changing a number in a computerized ledger book?"" The bank wouldn't need the cyber criminal's aid, they could change their own holdings. They have their own computers after all. Money's value is derived from trust. A bank that would change its own books would be black-balled. Similarly, a bank that un/consciously allows a cyber criminal change their holdings would lose trust. If this was a small transaction, they bank bottom line is unaffected. If these scandal is large enough to affect a bank's bottom line, the difference would be noticeable and raise suspicion."
