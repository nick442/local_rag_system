"Thanks, but I'm concerned I don't have enough math/programming to do serious quant work. I could learn it for sure, but it'd take some time. So wherever I'd work for would have to be patient with me as I learn. Edit: by ""consulting firms"", are you talking about, e.g., McKinsey and BCG? I think I must be mistaken - could you offer 1 or 2 examples of such firms?"
