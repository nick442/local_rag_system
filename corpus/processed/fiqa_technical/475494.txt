"Alright, I know a lot of people do see it as being wrong, and some have tried to pull a ""government motors"" sort of thing with Tesla, but it's really not correct to do so, so I tend to overreact a bit when I hear any suggestion that that be the case. By the way, I should say that ""Elon says"" the government loan didn't save the company. Maybe it did and he's just saying that for PR purposes, but he has been honest in the past about when the company has been near-death, so I'm willing to trust him on this one when he says this wasn't a near-death experience - especially after hearing the story of the Mercedes investment which Elon has told in a few interviews. The Roadster did make money overall, but it was all spent on S development, as had been the plan all along (which is why Tesla didn't show a profit on the books, because it went into R&D/capex). The loan definitely helped make the S happen faster, but I feel it probably would have happened anyway, just maybe a year or two later or something. I also do encourage you to drive one if you can, it's a great thing to try :-)"
