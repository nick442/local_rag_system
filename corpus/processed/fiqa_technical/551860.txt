Here's a story I like to tell about how one complaint call cost a company many more millions than that: I work in a building that has a satellite office of the Wrigley Company. We're in Chicago, so it's just down the street from the head offices, so it gets the occasional visit from Bill Wrigley, Jr. Our building is concrete, so it has notorious cell phone signal problems. Well Bill Jr. was having some signal issues so he called T-Mobile's front-line tech support to see if they could do something about the signal issues. Problem was, the customer rep didn't know she was speaking to the CEO of Wrigley, and refused to escalate the issue and left the issue unsatisfied. So, Bill Jr. immediately ordered Wrigley to pull the plug on the *entire company's contract* with T-Mobile. Now, everyone in my office building gets 5 bars of service.. with Verizon.
