Monopolies spur competition by startups and other giants. If Intel abuses a monopoly Apple will make their own CPUs or invest in AMD. Microsoft Office resulted in Google Docs. Internet Explorer in Firefox. If anything monopolies without government backing (preventing entrance to a market) cannot last long because it shows there is a shit tin of profit to be had. Even with ISPs we are seeing investment and innovation in gigabit wireless with companies like Starry to get over the natural monopoly.
