"Dude, you are totally moving the goal posts. First of all, the fact that you had to crawl through my comment history and came up with a completely unrelated response rather than addressing my point is pretty pathetic, and a pretty common behavior who are wrong and don't want to admit it. I don't ""hate"" California, I think it's overrated. And I think it's overrated because what you get isn't worth what you pay. That isn't being ""biased"", it's cause and effect. If it didn't cost 3x as much to live in California as anywhere else, I would like it a lot more. And the math doesn't work out. You in your original comment said the typical salary is 170K. Now that you have been proven wrong you are now claiming it's 200K+. That isn't the ""math working out"", that's distorting reality until it lines up with your preconceived notions. And now you are restricting ""nature"" to mountains (since apparently anything that isn't red river gorge is ""ant hills"" and therefore not worth anything). Again moving the goalposts. And even if your idea of ""things to do in nature"" means ""I like backpacking in the mountains exclusively"", you would be much better off in places like Utah than California. Repeatedly saying ""I've done the math, I've been offered a job"" doesn't mean anything when I've already shown you the math doesn't work out, and I too have been offered a 6 figure job in SF. I'm clearly not the one that's biased, you are. Look, if you have built up California into some mythical place so sacred that you are so clearly willing to do mental gymnastics you are demonstrating in order to make reality conform with your personal notions, great. But for everyone else, the ""math"" (as in actual math, not changing the numbers around until it makes sense), doesnt work out."
