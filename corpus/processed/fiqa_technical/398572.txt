I just looked through 40+ random funds on barclayhedge.com's database, and it's about evenly split between 2/20, 1.5/20 and 1/20, with a slight majority at 1.5/20, and 2/20 slightly ahead of 1/20. Others are at various rates like 0/10 and 2.5/20. I was very surprised to see Renaissance funds at just .35/10. I believe his Medallion Fund was at 5/36. James Simons is quite the quant. Nothing is too expensive if it's actually worth the price, but most hedge funds are no better than mutual funds. The only real advantage to hedge funds is the wider risk profile.
