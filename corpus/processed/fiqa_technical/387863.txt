Because people have the protestant ideal of working hard = good. And long means hard. It would require a gigantic shift into an egalitarian mode. Working to live, not living to work, and it's not a small step to take, since the industrial revolution, it's been the fact de jour. And no one has to get fired, people just need to take the 30 hour work week seriously, and manditory vacation time for example. Has to be everywhere though, or else the workaholics will skew the system.
