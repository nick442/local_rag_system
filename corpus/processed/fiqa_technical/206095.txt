Well, if you did not vote for Hillary/Democrat, I applaud you! I always voted for democrats: Obama twice, Al Gore (idiot), Kerry (much bigger idiot), and Bill Clinton twice. Last election I voted for the first time for a Republican. I would not vote for the other 2 alternative from smaller parties - don't agree with them, they are idiots, and it's a waste of my vote. Anyway, back to Trump, not my ideal for a president, he's doing very good job in many areas. Don't agree with everything he does, but the majority of what he did I agree.
