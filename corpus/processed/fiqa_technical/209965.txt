"* Claiming something is a simple solution does not make it a simple solution * Taxation is not a simple solution * Taxing HFT is just going to cause the HFT traders to squish around and find loopholes and ways to avoid the letter of the law, making the situation *more complicated* * This will engender *more* legislation, further obfuscating the market, making it even harder to understand exactly what's happening * And on and on the cycle goes, the government with ""simple"" solutions that don't work, and the market responding by squeezing around them somehow Here's a better way to solve this: ***STOP TRADING ON A MARKET YOU DO NOT TRUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!*** Don't ask the government to step in and clean it up. JUST FUCKING STOP USING IT! Make a new exchange, an exchange that *chooses* to not allow HFT, and let the HFT-inclusive markets collapse into a shitpool of cancelled block orders that nobody can use. *THAT* is the simple solution - let it fall apart on its own. *Let it die a death of natural causes!* But that solution does not empower the government or accord it a ""right"" to tax something, so *that* solution will *never* be discussed, nor implemented."
