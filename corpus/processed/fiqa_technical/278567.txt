No, I'm not arguing that at all. Just the timing of ones birth, and the desirability of ones skills in that time is a matter of luck. Hypothetical: If Bach had been born in 1980, do you think he'd achieve the same level of fame and sucess as he did, assuming he released the same compositions? edit: additionally, had Bach not been born into privilege in the first place, no one would have ever heard of him. Being born into privilege is incredibly lucky.
