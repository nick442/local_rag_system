> Strawman What a cop out. There is a real functional problem in terms of getting capital to the people who need it in as short a time as possible before the whole system collapses. Tell your 'strawman' to Tim Geithner, the Obama Treasury secretary, or Barney Frank, who is among the most liberal US Congressman at the time and was one of TARP's staunchiest allies. If I had my choice, no one would get a bailout and all the bad banks/borrowers could go drop dead, but the consequences were so dire. I really hope you are some philosophy Sophomore in college and aren't responsible for actual capital investment decisions in the real world. Your line of argument is downright pathetic and illogical.
