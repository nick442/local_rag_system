It's very possible that someone would lie to their landlord/landlady, but not be prepared to lie to the police. So here's what I would do. Advise your tenant that since her money has been stolen from your letterbox, she should report the theft to the police. If she refuses to report the theft to the police, then her story is probably a lie. In which case, treat the rent as deliquent and demand payment in full. Invoke whatever kind of recourse is available in your jurisdiction. If she goes ahead and reports the theft, then it's very likely that her story is true. It's probably in your interest to stay on good terms with such a tenant, so you could offer to split the loss with her. But let her know that this is a one-time offer, and you won't be so generous again.
