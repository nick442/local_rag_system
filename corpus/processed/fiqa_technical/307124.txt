What is defensible about any upvoted item on /r/politics that pertains to Trump? You are arguing semantics, Trump's positions are indefensible outside of propaganda and, quite plainly, he is a liar and is CONTINUALLY exposed as a liar. Again, you have provided no substance for Trump or his supporters not just being outright full of shit, because there is no substance to provide. You don't like it, you're free to leave.
