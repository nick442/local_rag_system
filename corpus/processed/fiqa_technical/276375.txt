The thing about amway products is that they are products people already use and buy from other stores. I mean protein bars and energy drinks and body care products.That's not the right way to have a profitable business; buying a bunch of inventory in your garage and then trying to sell it. The money is in getting people sponsored and teaching them to switch their shopping habits to go through their own store as amway pays you a bonus based upon the amount of product you and your business consume or sell in retail. The more volume, the higher percentage you get in bonus. Now this can develop into a business asset that is very low maintenance and pays you well. It takes maybe 15 hours a week to host meetings after you make enough money to quit your day job. Compared to owning real estate? Compared to owning a grocery store business? Those things have a ton of overhead and major headaches to handle. But I do agree the majority of the industry is very amateur and they will teach you to do stupid stuff like put inventory in your garage. That doesn't make amway a pyramid scheme though. Amway is the largest privately held debt free organization in the world. No public stock and they made over 11 billion dollars in 2012.
