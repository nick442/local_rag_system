I agree, and admit that I probably assumed a bit too much context. >hate group exists for a specific hateful purpose, whereas a country does not I agree, but PayPal *is* into taking highly-publicized regional action based on social and political issues. For example, consider the transgender bathroom rights issue taking place in North Carolina last year. Not even close to every resident of the State supported it, yet PayPal made State-level decisions based on it—such as their choice to pull out of plans for a new global headquarters in Charlotte, NC. See here: http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/05/technology/paypal-north-carolina-lgbt/index.html If all residents in Saudia Arabia don't believe in discrimination, and therefore PayPal doesn't exclude business with the country as a whole :: Then all residents of NC not agreeing with another form of discrimination shouldn't exclude business from NC as a whole—yet it did. The difference? PayPal isn't going to lose a recurring amount of money by moving their operations to a different State, especially when they haven't really laid down too much sunk cost. Cessation of payment processing, on the other hand, would have had an impact on their bottom line. They like to flex their Political and Social Opinion, but seem to be very cost-effective in how they choose to do so. I respect them for taking initiative to use their influence to impact the world in a way they see most-fit, but I also believe that many people over-applaud or over-blame them. PayPal isn't risking business for causes in the same way that a soldier might risk their life for a cause—they're only risking their reputation like a Politician might in openly supporting or opposing a war.
