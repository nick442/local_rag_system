Are you emailing him constantly or just sending over a question here and there? Asking because there's a point where advice isn't free and if you aren't paying him to answer extra emails and phone calls, he's not likely to answer them. Also, he probably has a lot of clients so it can be hard to keep up if you get lots of emails from a client. If possible, ask all of your questions in one email.
