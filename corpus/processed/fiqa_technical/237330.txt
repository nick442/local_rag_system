Small price for the government to pay when you are competing to attack a company that will create tens of thousands of jobs and billion in economic activity. Are you suggesting we let them go to Michigan or Alabama or Texas. If they did go, not only would we miss out on those tens of thousands of jobs and billions in investments but we wouldn't realize any of that sales tax revenue anyways!
