"The ""par value"" is a technicality that you can ignore in this case, and it has nothing directly to do with the merger. When a company issues stock, it puts a ""par value"" on the shares. If it later issues more shares, they cannot be issued at less than par value. The rest of the notice seems to be as you said: If you hold until the merger takes effect, they are going to give you $25/share and your shares will be gone. As always, you can try to sell on the open market before that time instead, although you can bet that not too many people are going to want to give you more than $25/share at this point."
