"We cannot know if you owe them anything. But at the least I would expect that they don't just say ""you owe us"" but ""we found out that we were supposed to pay you $X, but we paid you $Y which is more"", and then we can go from there. There are things like ""we should have paid you $12.20 per hour for the last year, but we paid you $12.50 per hour"", where you can tell them that by paying you that rate, you assumed it was correct one, you wouldn't have worked for less, so they effectively gave you a raise. On the other hand, if they say ""you worked here for 38 hours a week, but we paid you for 40 hours a week"", and you did indeed work only 38 hours, then most likely they are correct."
