"First note that Standard Chartered Bank's domain is ""sc.com"", not ""scb.com"". The ""scb.com"" site appears to be an architecture company ""of sorts"". The ""yandex"" email address is for a Russian search company which offers free email services. The ""standardchartered.X10.bz"" email address is clearly a spoof use of the standard chartered name, and is registered in Belize - a small central American country and tax haven. The ""yilmazguneadana.org"" is not recognised by internet DNS, so appears to be an email only service. This is clearly a phishing scam. Do not respond to this email. Of the many thousands of people that have received this email, sadly some will be dumb enough to respond - the elderly are most vulnerable to this type of scam."
