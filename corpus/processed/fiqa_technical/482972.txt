As a parent, I call bullshit on this. I may or may not retire rich, but my kids will have more opportunity than I did, and they will have the benefit of learning what I have learned about entrepreneurship, what my wife has learned about medicine, about what we both have learned about health, debt, relationships, sleep, cooking, self reliance, and so on. We are the first generation in each of our families to be upper middle class, none of our parents had college degrees. Our kids go to better schools than we did, and will have more opportunities than we did. If they take advantage of them, they will be more successful than we are. This is not luck. This is by design, because we don't think of the well-being of our kids and future grand kids and future great grandkids in terms of our current income or our own lifetimes. We don't buy the most expensive cars or houses or clothes we can. We save, invest, pay down debt incurred from mortgage and student loans before we knew better, put money into a future for our children. Us focusing our entire lives from the day we graduated from high school with no money and no job up until now, and into the future, has been and will be geared toward making sure my future family has it better than I did or my parents did. Sure, we are lucky enough to have been born now in America and not to have been tragically murdered or disabled, and lucky enough to have had roads and access to public school, but to say my family is simply lucky is horseshit. We are very fortunate and it is important to be grateful for the luck we have had, but decades of focus and sacrifice and dedication with a specific focus on increasing income and saving cannot be dismissed, and a dynastic focus on generational wealth building simply cannot be called only luck.
