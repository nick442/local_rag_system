"To save someone from reading this blogspam, the answers are.. 1. Become technical and code it yourself. 2. Use an off-the-shelf program that lets you plug in basic functionality. 3. Hire someone at the right scale to support your needs. 4. Buy someone else's finished solution. However, the question is wrong. The real question should be, ""if you don't have or employ someone with the experience to buy/make, support, and market your app, should you spend limited capital on an app that will likely go unused?"" - that answer is most likely no."
