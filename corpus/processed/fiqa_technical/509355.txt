You don't necessarily change your calculated profit margins and posted prices, but you advertise and offer price matching. Two out of three consumers may still pay the posted Best Buy price, while the knowledgeable third consumer that did their research will receive the matched price. Their profit on that third customer will be lower than it was for the other two, but currently they don't get anything from that third customer at all since they just order online. Meanwhile, now that they're in the store, they may buy a few movies or a power strip.
