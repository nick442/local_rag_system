I am 22 and was asking the same questions at age 18. I first started by getting a small credit card and paying it off before the end of each month. I use this credit card for groceries/gas small expenses. Then when I built up my credit more I then began to look for loans for expensive cars. The first being around 22k, the second around 41k. You may want to look at buying a much cheaper car. I would suggest that you look into starting a small credit card and get into a habit of paying it off every month and paying off your loans. I would suggest saving as much money as possible to buy a car, the less amount of money you need to borrow the better. Having good credit is great, but nobody turns down people who wish to buy with cash.
