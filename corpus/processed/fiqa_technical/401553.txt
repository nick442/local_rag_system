I mean they can be, if you have simple enough tastes and roommates. I don't understand why people feel like their first should give them everything. Every entry level position shouldn't have to pay enough to support a family. Spouses and teenagers should have the right to work as well, and their skill/pay level isn't going to be equal to someone supporting a family.
