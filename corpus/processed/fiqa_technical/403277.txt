Google's management is already acutely aware of hese forces and likely has better intel than any material publicly available. Apple is not in the ISP business and while people having faster internet would possibly benefit Apple to a mild extent this isn't a pressing issue for them. Unfortunately the dominance of the cable oligopoly is upheld by political forces outside the influence of much of the private sector. I'm not too familiar with the American regulatory system but my guess is the DoJ wouldn't even look twice at this, let alone have any jurisdiction on the matter. Sorry :(
