I travel from NZ to the UK at least once a year and since the TSA became a thing I've gone the other way round the world. It's a shame as I'd like to travel round the US, but don't want to be treated as a criminal just because I choose to set foot on US territory. Included in this are the horror stories of the poor bastards that are treated atrociously by border control, just it seems, because they can.
