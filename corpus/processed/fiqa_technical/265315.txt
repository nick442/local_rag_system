Well people are better at understanding what other people want from them than robots are. so you have a process where people, working for people are always going to be moe flexible and better understanding of the goods to be delivered for the money than a robot is. is similar to how you could propose, lets replace all workers people with aspergers who have a high iq and lets say we are going to pay them a lot less than to do the same job. These people are not going to take over the job market! Its exactly the same argument as with robots. It doesnt matter how smart and tireless you are, if you have aspergers a normal worker is going to outflex you and be worth their money in a lot of ways that you arent.
