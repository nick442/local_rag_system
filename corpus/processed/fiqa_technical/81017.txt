His immigration policy certainly isn't encouraging the best and brightest to come here in the same numbers that they were before he was in office. His travel ban is a big reason for this. Not only that but his administration has a decidedly anti science slant. They've been deleting research info at the EPA, and their budgets haven't been helpful for science and research either. So yeah, they haven't been helpful. Clinton would've been better. At least she would've tried to improve our assistance for research and technology subsidies. Trump doesn't even pretend to care.
