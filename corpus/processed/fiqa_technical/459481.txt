Here's my solution for income inequality. One guy who makes 600,000 a year (the president at my university makes this) splits it into parcels of 25,000 a year distributed between 24 people including himself. Those people have to give the president a blowjob once a month, or 12 blowjobs a year. The president retains his supremacy by getting more than 250 blowjobs a year and everyone at the bottom of the pool still has to suck dick for a living. Problem solved! -Umm, how would this not work? It gives 23 extra people a chance to lead happy lives as opposed to **one**. His life is still happier and more fulfilled than the other 23 and they still have to do unpleasant work to earn their keep. -For business people you all don't really think outside the box.
