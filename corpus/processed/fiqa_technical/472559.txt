. Stop it. You're the only one mischaracterizing. You tried to pin a $15 minimum wage on me when I vehemently disagreed with it. The cost of college for me and my 2 brothers was over $500,000 because we all went to great schools that were 40-50K a year. So I'll take my 18 years of public education (full of AP classes by the way), followed by my four in college, which got me an economics degree, and I'll keep laughing at you for failing so miserably at being condescending. If letting business do whatever they wanted worked, trickle down economics wouldn't fail as regularly as it does. We didn't regulate the banks in the early thousands. We came close to a depression. We didn't regulate businesses in the progressive era, And we got disgusting meat processing plants and the triangle shirtwaist factory fire. You understand no ones equalizing outcome. I just believe that if you work 9 hours a day 6 days a week you should have a decent standard of living. I can be hysterical, but your wrong, you suck at being a dick and you just don't want to pay more taxes. There's not economic reasoning behind it. Kansas's governor had the same thinking as you. Deregulate. Let business do their thing. Cut taxes for th wealthy. Kansas's residences sat on that money and Kansas is in crisis right now because of it. That's because more money into businesses doesn't mean they'll increase production especially if it doesn't increase efficiency, or did you not learn about that? Every time we deregulate businesses run amok and then the government has to bail them out with tax payer money, only so they can turn around and lobby for eased regulations. Or does the result of the 08 Financial crisis not ring a bell? You do understand most of your taxes go to subsidize billions of dollars for corporations like Walmart right? Where's your outrage? And you're talking about looking at history? Son, lmao. You're an idiot.
