I know the feeling. I used to smoke after doing my laundry. Had quit for about 10 days. Do laundry. Once i am done i was overwhelmed by this urge to smoke. Didn't see it coming. One of my most challenging moments. I somehow made through the next two hours till that urge waned off. Thats why as you go along it becomes easier. If you need to talk to someone let me know.
