"Sounds like my internship! I'm at a major bank and doing some back office stuff as well. I'm at work as I type this. No one really has anything for me to do, so I sit in my cubicle and read e-books and make DCF models for fun until I get a rare ""project"". I might as well learn something while I'm not doing anything, right? Don't quit though. Maybe ask for more responsiblity. Or do what I do and use it to learn. Either way, you can make your internship sound good on a resume, especially if your employer has a good name."
