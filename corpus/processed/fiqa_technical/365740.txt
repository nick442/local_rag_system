So by your logic, if a guy mugs you on the street, you're being extorted by his mechanic for charging so much to fix the mugger's car? Like the mugger, Boeing didn't have to resort to extortion to pay it's bills. It could have gotten money honestly, but extortion was easier, it already had the weapons, and it wasn't afraid of the consequences.
