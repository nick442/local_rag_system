"Yeah, so where are the scholarly articles? I don't see any being referenced in the article. Seems to me like it's just his opinion. Explains why it's an op-ed rather than a research article or something of substance. It sure is easy to say ""don't have a kid before 21,"" but have you considered that a lot of kids don't have access to birth control? Or even sex ed? I've met teens who don't even understand how sex works but they sure are having it. What about marriage? For some kids, it's easier to get married because it gives them access to housing, health care if the spouse has a plan, but even then, the divorce rate is so incredibly high that a lot of them face homelessness and situational poverty when they separate. Have you ever seen someone working 2-3 jobs but they're still poor? I've certainly seen it. I've seen kids choose work over high school because it means they can support their families. A lot of families in poverty depend on every single member of the family to bring in a source of revenue, and even then they can't seem to get by. You said it yourself, you can't support a family on minimum wage. But kids in generational poverty have learned to. Their mothers taught them. ""Getting out"" of poverty just isn't real for most of these kids. That's why the [cycle of poverty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_of_poverty) usually spans across three generations in a family. What happens in a child's home life will affect them for the rest of their lives. When they learn how to live in poverty as children, the behaviors they learn are much more likely to carry through to adulthood. It doesn't matter what your political stance is, it's going to take some intervention from the government to create programs for these kids in generational poverty. This issue is much too complicated and pervasive to treat it otherwise"
