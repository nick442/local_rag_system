"Free Speech isn't a myth, but ""Diversity"" is. I'm constantly bombarded with self-righteous and imprudent missives about the importance of Diversity, but they mostly just repeat words meant to make us feel better about ourselves. We've corrupted a well-meaning goal into a vulgar set of data points about employee demographics, all while conveniently ignoring the plain fact that you have to first collect that demographic data on your employees in order to accomplish our goals. I prefer the concept of ""inclusion,"" meaning we need to create workplaces that welcome great talent, free of non-business related impediments. Already, though, there are signs that few people actually think this through, and it's only a matter of time until it becomes another meaningless set of metrics that upper management can feel good about. /end of rant (Disclaimer: this was not directed at any organization in particular, especially not a data-collecting giant like Google.)"
