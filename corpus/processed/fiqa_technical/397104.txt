(xposted comment from a discussion in /r/economics) I work for (and am a cooperative owner of) [Equal Exchange](http://www.equalexchange.coop). We are a food and beverage company. We have a pretty conventional management structure and division of labor. We all get regular paychecks (and awesome benefits). The company did over $55 million in sales last year and has been profitable for 23 of the last 24 years (don't ask us about 1997. We lost $7,000). What's different? Well, last year, every single worker/owner got the same share of the profits: about $6,500. Didn't matter what your job was. Also, the board its entirely elected by the workers: one worker, one vote. Only the workers can nominate and vote for the board. Six if the nine members of the board are workers. They can fire the CEO (and we did once). The workers as a whole have to approve major (really major) decisions, and also any changes to the company bylaws. It's a crazy company that most textbooks would say is impossible, yet here we are. [Here](http://equalexchange.coop/about/annual-reports) are our annual reports. In 2013 we had $56 million in sales and $2.65 million in pre-tax profits. We buy almost all our products from small-farmer co-operatives, and we sell our products to virtually every consumer grocery co-operative in the US (among many other places). Edit: fixed typos
