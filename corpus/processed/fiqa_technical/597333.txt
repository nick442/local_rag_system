"Agreed. Sometimes, I wish I would have done something more creative, more engaging, more dynamic. Finance is very straightforward and logical. For every contingency there is a specific set of rules/theory you follow to make a decision. I work in corp dev at a fortune 500 healthcare company and very little gut decisions are made without a ""model"" or endless PowerPoints explaining a decision. Of course this is an incredible simplification of the finance industry, but you can't tell me that working in finance can hold a candle to the every-day general dynamics of working for a small web start-up. Sometimes I think of how much I would enjoy doing that, working for a startup. But then I log into mint and I laugh as a model goes down on me while I sip on johnnie walker blue on a tuesday night. Life's good."
