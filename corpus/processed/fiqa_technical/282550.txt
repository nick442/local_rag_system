Everyone has a different way to measure wealth. If everyone in your state has $10 worth of food and housing and $1,000,000 worth of explosives, some may argue your quality of life is worse than a state where everyone has $50 worth of food and housing. If everyone in your state has $1, except one guy has 50% of the world's wealth, some may argue that your quality of life is worse than a state where everyone has $2.
