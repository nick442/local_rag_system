> The demand for fiat currencies comes from the fact they are necessary to pay taxes Only because the collective population has decided that the fiat currency has value. Taxes are not handed down by some benevolent leader, it is you and I deciding that we can do better things if we pool a portion of our wealth together. Let's say we want to build a road between our homes to improve the act of visiting each other. We decide to share the cost of building the road. I throw in 10 chicken, and you toss in 100 seashells. We work our way over to our road-building friend's place. We give him our offering in exchange for building the road. He doesn't like seashells, but he is willing to take 20 chickens in exchange for building the road. But now we are 10 chickens short from reaching our goal of having a new road between our homes. We decide to implement a strict agreement that all future pooling of wealth needs to be done with chickens. Seashells are not acceptable. And now we have a tax paid by a mutually agreed upon exchange medium. It works because everyone agrees that chickens have value. If everyone suddenly became vegetarian and saw chickens as having no value, our tax pool would become worthless. The fact that our tax is paid for in chickens does not mean that chickens will forever have value.
