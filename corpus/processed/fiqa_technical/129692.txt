In reality here is what is going to happen. Other nations will continue to distance themselves from the dollar. China in its arrogance will make a premature move against the dollar but at the same time the dirty little secret is they are dancing on the edge of economic collapse right now. Some countries will move towards China further weakening the dollar but not destroying it. China is going to have a real drop very soon (*probably along with the US and other large nations*) then everyone is going to panic and flock back to the dollar because they don't know what else to do.
