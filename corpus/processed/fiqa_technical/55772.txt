I would read this irs page to get an understanding of how this might negativity affect you. There is an 800 number at the bottom of the page, I would call them and find out what your cousin did file on your behalf (ie Extension). I would get your original paperwork back from your cousin (or look for copies) and get your return done as soon as possible (either by another CPA or yourself). If you do owe, you owing more every day thanks to interest. If you have a refund due, then get your refund.
