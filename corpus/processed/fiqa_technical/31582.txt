400 games a day are released in the app stores. There will always be random small games that find success but the vast majority of devs without diversified portfolios and cash flow will fail quickly. It's like any other entertainment industry with way more music tracks/movies/games than demand. It's incredibly risky (not to mention freaking hard as hell to make something 'fun'), especially compared to taking those programming skills and making a decent, steady salary as an engineer.
