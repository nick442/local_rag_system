You can explain things in more detail with more thorough examples, links, references and diagrams on your site. This question just happened to be something I was thinking about recently. You could also cover the tax consequences of capital gains on tax-free bonds, since I expect they are treated the same as other capital gains (short-/long-term) and are not tax-free. Edit: My additional explanation of why municipal bonds are tax free in addition to federal bonds is clunky, perhaps you can approach it more concisely.
