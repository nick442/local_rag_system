"Don't know why you're being down voted here. If any one still thinks Trump was ever fit for office I'd personally be shocked. He's done so much more harm to America than good by being our president. Other countries laugh at us. America is a circus act and will remain so while he's in ""power"". I won't even say president because that just not the right term anymore imo."
