Things we should all understand: * The Federal Reserve will not engage in QE3 or QE4 or any kind of QE. - Inflation is too high and the economy would be harmed rather than helped. * The Federal Reserve will not raise rates until 2013-2014. - Ben has been pretty adamant and clear about this. What I'm concerned about is that they keep pushing back the date. Interest rates should have been raised last year.
