I don't know what is worse, the guy on that video's holier than thou, condescending attitude, the fact that anyone would dedicate an hour to criticizing the Young Turks (who have got to be about the dumbest and least relevant political commenter in existence), or the fact that this is posted to /r/business. There is no point in this thread of garbage, from a comedian's political opinion, to a pack of college know-it-alls, to this ridiculous hour long breakdown of a bunch of college know-it-alls, that isn't completely garbage.
