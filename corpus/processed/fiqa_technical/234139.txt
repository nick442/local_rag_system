I would not want to be Sprint or T-Mobile right now. You can't merge, you can't get funding to buy spectrum. It is a whole host of pain. Look at the [spectrum deficit](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--6IjuqZjH--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18ky96u2tk3edjpg.jpg) between these guys. Lower level spectrum 700-900mhz is around 3-4 times more useful than the higher frequency for coverage (making the signal go far and through walls). This is a big deal for 2 reasons: 1. The less towers you have to build, the cheaper it is (less capex and opex for sites + decreased operational complexity) AND the quicker you can roll out the network (first mover adv). [EDIT: This only applies to coverage situations i.e. along highways, and in rural regions. Coverage is important because even those who don't travel that much consider it highly as a key purchasing factor] 2. The less accurate you have to be with the network planning. Imagine you have a big circle that you can place on a town, vs having to use 3 equivalent circles. The planners can get the number of towers wrong and/or the location of the towers. In the long term; Sprint and T-Mobile are going to be pushed into being high-city only Telcos, less profitable in general (IMO).
