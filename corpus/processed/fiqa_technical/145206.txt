They would be making a huge assumption. Like when they thought people would buy Z71 trucks that weren't four wheel drive. And guess what! They were right. They're only going to be making cars right now I'd almost guarantee. Maybe some light SUV's and maybe a large SUV but only as an option along with combustion engines continuing. EV's are definitely being aimed at urban commuters and are best used for that purpose right now. But before long they will be making $$$ selling all that torque to workers/enthusiasts.
