if Amazon can perfect same day delivery, then businesses will really be in trouble. I frequently still go to walmart instead of ordering on Amazon because I want something that same day. but if Amazon can deliver its products on the same day without charging a ton for shipping, then I might just order everything on there. In the meantime, I will continue to shop at stores like walmart and walgreens.
