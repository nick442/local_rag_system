We can't run out of money, but the buying power of that money can be significantly reduced to the point where it's fundamentally useless, i.e. inter-war Germany and many countries in South and Central America. Germany managed to skate by by creating a new Deutschmark in a confidence trick, and it worked because Germany is a solid, iron clad manufacturing powerhouse of a lot of stuff. The only thing we're a solid, iron clad manufacturing powerhouse of is sophisticated weapons systems and little scraps of paper we say are valuable. My question is, at what point do we engage Washington's unlimited money printing presses until we reach that point? What's our optimum level of monopoly money output? We shouldn't just charge madly into the abyss
