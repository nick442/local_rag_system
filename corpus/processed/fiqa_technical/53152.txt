I don't like going to the movies, therefore everyone should stop going to the movies. What a ridiculous notion. Maybe everyone should stop listening to music, watching tv shows, playing video games and reading books? Or do you only support boycotts of easily copyrighted and easily pirated media that you already don't consume (ie. blockbuster films) that way you can feel self righteous about your valiant efforts of denying consumerism without actually doing anything different or making any conscious effort at all to change your own lifestyle while mandating that all others change theirs? Thanks, by no thanks. I'd rather pay 15 bucks to see David finchers remake of a girl with a dragon tattoo and another 15 for Christopher Nolan's dark knight rises so that these talented directors can continue to have the financial resources to further push the envelope of high budget cinematic achievements (that i consider as art).
