Our problem is not that a few interest groups have favor, our problem is that dividing the population by interest groups scatters the governments focus in too many directions, catering to many minute interests, often away from the common good. See pluralism/hyper pluralism. http://m.sparknotes.com/us-government-and-politics/american-government/interest-groups/section5.rhtml This is good politics. We don't want a government that only extends the protection of the law to majority groups, but this is also the exact reason why government can never be trusted with the distribution of goods and services. When you cater to that one asshole that has to have it his way, everyone else suffers. Why the fuck would you want that in charge of any part of the economy?
