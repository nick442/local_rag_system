"> I don't even have words for this. I'm not surprised. The ""you don't get to tell me what I can do with my money"" talking point has been hammered into American brains. You would agree with most Americans that if the parents are in serious debt and pass away then the debt should not pass on to the child, yes? It makes sense because why should the child have to pay for his parent's failures? So why do you believe that debts shouldn't transfer but credits should? If a child shouldn't get stuck with a parent's failures then shouldn't a child also not benefit from the parent's successes?"
