"I didn't say that the economy isn't doing well. You just made that up. It is a fact that the president has little to nothing to do with the stock market. Whether you want to believe that or not, it is still a fact. I don't ""believe"" WaPo. What I do is listen to the idiotic words that your leader says. I listen to him pretend to have invented the phrase ""prime the pump"" while simultaneously using it in the wrong context. I listen to him pretend that ""covfefe"" was something other than a typo. I listen to him demonstrate over and over that he has no clue what he's talking about on a variety of subjects ranging from how the internet works to what an armada being ""on the way"" means. If you can honestly look at the past 8 months, the things that he's said, and the things that he's done, and come to any conclusion other than that he's a fucking moron, you're just as stupid as he is."
