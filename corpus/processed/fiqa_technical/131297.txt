Limiting liability to your investment is one of the main points of corporations. When you contract with a corporation you know that all you can get if the corporation defaults is the assets owned by the corporation, not the owners of said corp. There are plenty of covenants debtholders can put in place to restrain management from making decisions that can be detrimental to said debtholders. >So here is a case of a legitimate lawsuit, it was heard in court and Rich Dad was ordered to pay $24 Million to his former partner(s). It seems that the corporation was ordered to pay, no? The man does not claim he can't pay it, he claims the corporate entity that is supposed to pay it can't pay it. I don't think the opposing side ever had an agreement with Kiyosaki on a personal level. This man probably runs several businesses, there is a chance some may go under. It is a legitimate tactic to insulate each business from one another. The debtholders know this ahead of time and receive extra yield on their investment for taking these easily identifiable risks. If you don't want to invest with someone who doesn't have skin in the game, all you have to do is don't invest.
