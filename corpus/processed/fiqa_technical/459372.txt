Im still dealing with a $1,000 laptop i bought from them that stopped working after 6 months. They replaced the mobo and now it BSODs every five mimutes. I have four service orders, three phone calls, and a web chat related to it, and they want me to file a lemon law document for a replacement. Which has to be done at the store i bought it from, with a copy of the service record that the store manager is responsible for obtaining. Because thats gonna happen.
