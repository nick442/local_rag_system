Bust the Trust! Many people would argue that those six existing companies should themselves be broken up. Monopolies are harmful to everyone individually and the economy as a whole, it spits in the face of free trade. The leaders of these companies are so abstracted from the products and services their companies provide, the most they are accomplishing is convincing lower administrators and managers to do shady and illegal shit to improve their own bonuses. Meanwhile the researchers and average workers get shafted with endless cuts and ridiculous and nonsensical demands from 15 tiers of bueacracy.
