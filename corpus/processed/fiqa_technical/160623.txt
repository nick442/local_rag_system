"I agree for the most part. I thought about them, I even thought about money supply and some others. But the point was mainly that businesses as a whole have been doing bad for not just this year or since 2008 but over a decade, not enough to account for inflation. This is grounds that the economy is in a recession, and will be. Bond's aren't really an investment in business as they are loaning money to the government on interest so they don't portray whether the economy is in recession or not. The premise was that a recession is/has occurred, not that money cannot be made in a good portfolio. Perhaps you didn't fully understand my last point, I don't believe gold and silver are the bubble. I believe the dollar is the bubble and it has been bursting since 2000. Commodity prices are merely a sign of the bursting bubble. Given that we're in recession, the only way to ""pull-out"" as it is apparent people have been doing for the past 10 years, is to buy real assets and that this creates a positive feedback loop into devaluing the dollar. Not everyone will pull out, but most will. For a long while the assets have had little exposure to the inflation of the dollar, and now it's catching up to the assets. Ergo assets are undervalued, they are not the bubble."
