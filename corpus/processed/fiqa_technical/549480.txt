The only place fast-chargers are needed are along highways for people taking long trips. And that's exactly where they are. Tesla Superchargers are along all major highways, spaced so that drivers can get wherever they need to go. Sure, it's more than 5 minutes to charge up a car. But that's offset by spending NO time waiting for the other 90% of your daily driving. Just plug in when you get home, and you've got a full ""tank"" of electricity every morning."
