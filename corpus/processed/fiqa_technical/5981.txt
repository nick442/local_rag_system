">these jobs aren't meant for adults with families. Says who? You? Society? Just because people _think_ that's how it should be doesn't make it correct. A job is a job. Yes, it's requires less skill to work at Subway than most jobs but that doesn't mean you should be be forced to live below poverty because you have that job. They shouldn't be making surgeon wages, but no one is arguing for that. People want to live like a human being. They want to pay their heat bill so they're not freezing in the winter. >They're part time, no-responsibility positions that pay beer money Want to know why? Because companies choose that. They could easily cut their employees by a third, pay a livable wage and full time status to the remaining employees and STILL grow/expand and hire back the people they cut. Aldi's isn't doing bad. Costco is doing pretty well. QuikTrip is growing like a weed. All these places are ""beer money jobs for teens and students"" yet they've found success in paying actual, livable money to their employees. People think that if companies raise their wages they'll go bankrupt and they've done a good job convincing everyone that. It's been shown that [raising the minimum wage doesn't affect employment](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf). If anything it helps because less turnover = more efficiency = more money for the company. TL:DR Ya'll motherfuckers need empathy."
