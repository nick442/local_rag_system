I'm a debt guy, hence the bias, I guess ;) Kitchenace's answer is relevant. As for considering alternatives in a given situation, it sometimes happen. M&amp;A is often done through a combination of equity and debt for example. Mostly, issuing equity dilutes control and potential dividend returns, while debt pushes your interest charges up and adds pressure to delever or refinance later. Balancing the two will depend on the company's intentions, it's capacities (servicing debt requires a more stable cash flow generation capacity, while equity is more rewarded by strong growth potential) and a host of other factors.
