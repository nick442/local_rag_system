Automation is definitely closing the cost gap. But for reasons that go well beyond automation alone. You have to look at the entire supply chain, not just your in plant cost of adding value to products. Even something as simple as waiting days or weeks to get parts for something that broke that can multiply the $1k a year labor cost many times. You can't just call the local hardware store in many places to solve even relatively simple problems. Then you have to worry about the logistics of getting your finished product transported to external markets. Especially when much of the transport is done over poorly maintained, or even gravel roads full of pot holes and rain gullies. How much durable capital, both coming and going, gets damaged in the process? This is even before taking the uncertainty cost of corruption and bribery into account. Even just simple problems can easily cost you a week labor out of each month, and the supply chain issues add up nonlinearly. As the factory itself becomes more automated the cost of these supply chain issues just keeps increasing relative to other cost, even as the supply chain cost remains constant. Hence the supply chain cost, as a ratio of total cost, actually goes up faster than the rate at which automation itself is increasing. Which requires a fully modernized infrastructure and business environment to address. Something that is extraordinarily expensive to build from scratch.
