That's not why they crashed. They crashed because the only reason people were buying them is because they would go up in value and then they could sell them for profit later. Sounds exactly like Bitcoin in my opinion. The only difference is Bitcoin is useful in the sense that criminals can use it and not get in trouble. How many people do you know using Bitcoin as a currency? They aren't, they are only buying it to sell it for a profit later. That isn't sustainable. It isn't backed by a government or military and it is too volatile to actually use as a currency. When it crashes and criminals are the only ones using it, then what is it worth? Maybe $100 a coin? $10? Who knows, it sure as hell isn't $5,000 a coin though.
