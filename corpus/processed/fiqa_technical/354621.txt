"How many of you enjoyed your first job out of your undergraduate studies? Have any of you switched careers before completing a ""standard"" year because you didn't like it? I'm doing some really fun stuff in my current internship, there is a lot that I enjoy, and I'm a lot luckier than most - but I can't see myself doing this job for more than a year (if I'm even given an offer)."
