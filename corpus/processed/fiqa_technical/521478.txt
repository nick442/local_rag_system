Obviously, we're assuming the company can pay it back, which is why you may only have five to twenty policies via the most renowned five to twenty companies at one time. *edit: Besides, an immediate boost in purchasing power is pretty advantageous (from my last post)-- *(if someone invests $500 of capital at a 5% interest rate for a one year bond, they immediately get back a note with the purchasing power of $525, which they can spend right away if they wish (if inflation is going to happen anyway, why not beat it to the punch?)).*
