I'm curious what percentage of the job market make up the no-experienced people you mention and what percentage is made up of individuals that, for one reason or another, are stuck working those types of jobs just to make ends meet. Unless you distinguish between the no-skill individuals that don't need a livable wage, like teens still living at home, and other people that are struggling to support themselves with the only job they can get, and do so without age or other forms of discrimination, raising the minimum wage to a livable wage level is the only way I can think of that would enable the disadvantaged people that are for all intents and purposes stuck in their situation to gain the financial footing they need to raise themselves up to the next rung of the ladder. If you have other suggestions, I am more than happy to hear them.
