"Well, ""on the streets"" is different from what you saw. You probably saw one of the early production models that weren't being delivered to owners. Last night was the ""first 30"" delivery, so the first individual owners (Tesla employees) that received their Model 3 took ownership last night. If you see one on the road now, it's more likely to be an owner ""production"" vehicle rather than a production model that isn't being delivered."
