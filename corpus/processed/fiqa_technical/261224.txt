What is never mention was that even though top marginal taxes were high, even extreme, nobody paid them. Reagan lowered taxes but also made lots of people pay taxes that had never had to pay them before. You could essentially write off losses from a business indefinitely. Failing to earn money on an investment was also a loss. My dad, on the advice of an IRS tax auditor, built a greenhouse and we started selling flowers. But it was intended to never make any money. It's sole purpose was to reduce tax liability. These tax shelters were geared as personal tax shelters. So what was done to service bigger business was to create what was called holding corporations. These corporations would take investors money and basically just sit on it. Which could then be claimed as a loss. But if these spread between bank interest CDs) paid on the holdings of this corporation and the interest cost of borrowing against those holdings hit a sweet spot they would build a strip mall or something similar. This was the trigger to the boom bust when the Feds raised/lowered the interest rates, and had a lot to do with stagflation at the time. They would turn key the project and reinvest in holdings. People could essentially bring their taxes down as much as they wanted, even to zero. It just meant that they had to put more money into holding corporations. When Reagan changed the tax code to disallow these tax write offs he put lots of very wealthy people in the poor house overnight. They went to bed one night and woke up with all their investors wanting their money. I know a guy that operated a holding corporation that still cries about it to this day. Of course he has never really financially recovered either. *** The point is that what the tax code listed as your top marginal tax had no bearing on what you paid in tax prior to Reagan. 34% tax was WAY more than most of these people ever dreamed of paying in taxes prior to Reagan.
