"Navigating in Windows takes way too many clicks. Find a way for me to get to what I want without digging and holding my mouse over things and then you'll help me realize my full potential. I'm not going to learn to customize anything either. So develop your solution around that; Get the user what he/she wants without them having to explicitly tell you exact details. Maybe you turn on something that watches how I interact and what programs I use. Maybe there's an ""App Store"" in the OS that only sets up what I've selected. Maybe millions of ideas - but solve that problem and you'll have a happier user. Build the machine around the user's style. DONT force the user to make the machine work for them. edit: I don't have a Mac so I don't know if that's how they work. But I did just get the iPhone 5 (from an Android) and God Damn that's the way a device should function. It's built around HOW I use the phone and I don't have to figure anything out or force it to work for me. It just works. Even after rooting and various tools the Android was still something that worked against me rather than for me."
