The escrow rules used to be A LOT more lax. The banks used to screw people pretty hard. For example - after paying off a loan banks would drag their feet about sending back the money. This does not account for much on one loan, but if you multiply that by all the loans they service it is a significant amount. There are not strict rules governing the amount of money that can be held in escrow and how quickly the money has to be returned after a loan payoff.
