This story will end up being a case study at business schools. It isn't often that non-union workers, most of whom don't get paid much, bring a company to its knees over a change at the top like this. This is a 71 store chain. This CEO is a multi millionaire. Customers and employees risked their jobs and paid more for groceries elsewhere just to get this guy back in charge. That's a relationship between management, employees, and customers that is extremely rare.
