"How about doing a Lease Option with a very long term and a very early ""option"" for the guy buying. Essentially he will be making your mortgage payments for the next couple few years. Much less paperwork for the both of you that way. See a lawyer for the paperwork, from my limited experience with a real estate lawyer is a standard document and shouldn't cost that much."
