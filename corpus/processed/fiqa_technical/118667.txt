"> Outside of money, the biggest thing I think we will leave to our kids is what we have learned.. I would argue even money is less important, but continue. > ..you are acting like a totally responsible young adult according to societal norms and people who are supposed to give you advice, and you are totally fucking yourself. Totally agree. FYI, your example seems fitting for someone born into a middle class home and their choices are bad but not destructive. If it were someone from a poor household then the 25 year old doesn't know about the American Heart Association, doesn't know about credit to get a card or house, invests nothing, often gets payday loans, gets a car from a used car auto-lender, drinks and watches a lot of TV, has probably been involved in a pregnancy, and plays the lottery in the hopes of a better life. > Is that your fault? I would say, ""no"". Society has effectively set you up to fail. > What if you've concluded generational wealth is simply luck.. > You may dismiss your opportunity as bullshit, and remained trapped in the standard American day to day wage/debt slavery. You almost certainly will dismiss the opportunity. Even if you can realize the AHA, financial advisor, or payday loan guy gave you bad advice, there are better looking opportunities. Put away money for a rainy day? Fuck that! If I listen to the auto-loan guy I get a car *today*. I'm not sure I understand where your contention was. Are you thinking that people shouldn't be cynical of the system and be able to recognize an opportunity to better their life? I'm heading out for the evening. I'll look for your replay later tonight and maybe respond. Thanks for the thoughtful discussion."
