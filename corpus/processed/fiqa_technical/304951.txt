It’s Uber’s game to lose because they went the luxury route first and accepted the money on promise of growth. They’re challenged with maintaining that growth which has pushed them to grow and diversify their business and is forcing them to find a way to automate their car service. It’s caused them to become the shitty company they are- bulldozing over laws/regulation/own employees. Lyft started at the same time but were coming from a different angle taxi and scale up from there. The old way of starting a business was to start small and grow. The new way is to have an idea get a crap load of money and promise/deliver growth. The first is not necessarily the sexiest but if they keep growing and keep their nose clean they just have to wait for their competition to fall on their face.
