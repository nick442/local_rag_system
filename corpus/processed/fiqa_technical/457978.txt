"ConfirmedCynic, I also appreciate your opinion on this. You're right, families need to be more tight with each other and support more. There are plenty of families living together just to make ends meet. And it really sucks that college grads have to go live at home because they can't get a job with their degree or making shit for money. I don't know what you mean by ""serf"" (sorry for the ignorance) but I get the point. Anyone can build up a cash fund of some sort even if you make little money. It's all about priorities and willingness to work your ass off for what you want. Like I told the person above who commented, if you'd like to connect on social media and learn more about this topic, let me know and I'll give you my details. Have an awesome day! William"
