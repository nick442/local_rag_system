I do agree with you for the most part, but I think you would be shocked how many people will opt for an online place because they are ordering from work and can't call or simply don't like interacting with people on the phone. How many times have you seen people argue for who is calling in for takeout? I personally don't mind it but I am sure it makes a difference.
