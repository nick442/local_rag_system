>If AUD loses half it's value, forget your 3.75% you've just lost half your savings. Aaaah see now it's making sense. Basically I'm uncovered on any changes in the FX rate and if i hedged that with a currency swap I'd lose any gains from my interest rate due to the arbitrage that would be captured by larger FX firms (who would be the writer of my currency swap?) ? I'll refresh my irparity knowledge later.
