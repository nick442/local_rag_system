Walmart isn't going anywhere anytime soon. There will always be a need for a place to grab a large variety of merchandise then and now. Some others like Target though, are starting to struggle and are trying out a smaller store format and moving away from the suburbs in a last ditch effort to stay relevant. And even mainstream grocers like Kroger have seen their sales dwindle (Aldi, Lidl and such are an enormous threat).
