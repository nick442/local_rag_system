Can confirm. Have kids. Am not rich. Live in NYC. Everyone got caught up on the janitor thing. It was one client of mine and I was shocked when I found out what he made. Dont know if he was born into the job, he was towards the end of his career, had been a janitor for 30 years and probably worked some over time. He doesnt live in rent controlled housing, he probably makes too much to qualify though I dont know how that works. He actually owns a pretty nice house in a working class community.
