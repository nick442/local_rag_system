Okay, since you work hourly there are two substantial changes you can make: 1) Move out of Astoria and closer to Jersey City, such as, to Jersey City. Move out of NYC into Jersey!? Heresy! But that ship sailed when you started working there. 2) Work more hours now that you aren't spending 2 hours and 30 minutes of your life commuting. You can make an extra $125 per day, in theory. Since this is $625 more a week, and $2500 a month, it is a substantial change you can make. Presupposing that your current contract has more hours to work.
