It's probably worth distinguishing that I am talking specifically about revenues and speaking to the beliefs *about* revenue of people who make the cuts-for-growth claim. I am tempted to say that *nominal rate* does not mean *money paid* is common knowledge. The challenge here is disentangling how common that knowledge really is from a cynical ploy for political gain.
