The government bailed out the financial system because it was in its best interest to. Letting the system all crash on top of yourself is definitely not smart. So we loan financial institutions money, shore up any short term issues, and we get most of the money back, if not all of it. If I'm not mistaken, all the bail out money was paid back. But beyond the point, there may be merit in basic income ideas, but this is definitely not the kind of rhetoric, thinking, analysis, or insight that it needs.
