"http://finance.yahoo.com/stock-alerts/stock-watch/add/?.done=/stock-alerts/ You will have to have a yahoo account. If you want to provide an alternative delivery email address, visit the URL above. Click ""Stocks Watch"", enter ticker(s) and price(s) at which you want alerts, then at the bottom select the ""email"" radio button. If your preferred email address is not listed, click the ""Add an email address"" link and follow the instructions. I don't know what their limit is, but I currently have three addresses set up -- two to non-@yahoo addresses -- and it works fine."
