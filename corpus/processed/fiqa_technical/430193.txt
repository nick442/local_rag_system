I think these systems of wealth re-allocation is where the heart of the debate about the American economy is or should be. Should we have our government intervene and re-allocate wealth in some way? It already does to some degree, although arguably in a bad way. It's much easier to avoid taxes when you can pay for the sort of expert good at avoiding that sort of thing. Middle/Poor class individuals end up paying more taxes relative to their income further exacerbating wealth inequality. I think it was Bill Gates and probably many others that have mentioned that one of the best ways to get money to underutilized market participants is by investing in businesses who then employ people. I think the concern with the American economy and everything else dependent to it is that the mechanisms/pipelines for enabling the poorly utilized are outgunned by the mechanisms/pipelines for taking the money from the poor/middle class and putting it in the hands of the rich. Loan-based financial products are the biggest offenders I think. If only hypothetically I would like to see what an economy would look like if loans were simply not an option, or if the idea of merit qualifying a person for a loan/financing were significantly more accurate.
