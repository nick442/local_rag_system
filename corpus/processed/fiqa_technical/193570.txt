More than likely what you speak of was a symptom of a larger problem. The retooling of economies from manufacturing based, to information based caused a large sector of previously employable people to be left jobless as low-tech manufacturing jobs were replaced by robots and developing nations. The government then tried to solve this by putting the underemployed to work, treating the symptom instead of the underlying disease.
