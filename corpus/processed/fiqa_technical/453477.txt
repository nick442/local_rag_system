ESPN get over $8 per subscriber per month. The next best channel is TNT with something like a $1.27. 45+% of Dis revenues comes from Cable operations, of which, I believe ESPN makes up half of that figure. Their streaming service might augment the declining revenue from Cable, but like I said, it's plugging a hole, but the boats still sinking.
