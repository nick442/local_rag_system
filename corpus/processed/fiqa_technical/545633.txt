I just don't see that many suckers falling for cheap or subprime loans, given their student loans. Yellen raising rates will dampen aggressive bank profits somewhat. Smucks will be smucks, but smarter buyers would appraise their debt load and opt for renting or cheaper houses. But then again, people don't even learn from recent history. US market is at recovery/pre-euphoria stage now. Canada is soon to pop a year after rates rise courtesy of Yellen. Given the size of the US gen y cohort, it is likely that many in their 30s in 2020 will buy. And will cry when the next bubble pops, as Boomers start selling assets to fund their retirements.
