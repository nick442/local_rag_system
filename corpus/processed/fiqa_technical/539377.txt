I am not really qualified to be engaged in this argument so I won't tell you why I suspect you are wrong. That said, there are many many many factors that drive productivity (which I believe is up?) and the income distribution (which I concede is a big problem). Observing that the problem started approximately concurrently with the end of the gold standard (which is arguable), is really not evidence that we should return to the gold standard. Correlation != causation.
