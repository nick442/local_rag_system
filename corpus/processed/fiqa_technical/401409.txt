My opinion would be to sell now. I think what Valve is attempting to do is lance an bubble. Up until now, you have people purchasing (and storing) more keys than they're using in the hope that they'll maintain or rise in value.( I.e. The value of a key is greater than the utility of opening a chest.) In the coming year, there most likely be more players wanting to sell keys for their value than players hoping to open chests. So I think you're going to see a minor crash in the value of the keys.
