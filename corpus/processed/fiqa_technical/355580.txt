Wealth Management Analyst at major bank in NYC - I averaged 55-60. I had a close friend who worked for an NYC insurance firm and averaged just over 40. During the summer, they also got out early on Fridays. Early career pay wasn't great, but he consistently used the hours as a selling point to bring me over.
