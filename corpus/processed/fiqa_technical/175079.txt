Perhaps too much. We have made public schools and the police responsible for dealing with widespread societal failures. Parents don't get paid a decent wage, so schools have to provide breakfast and lunch. We don't have public healthcare that covers mental health we leave the insane to become homeless and ask the police to deal with them.
