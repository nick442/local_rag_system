Your suggestion seems a bit too extreme. Handing auditing responsibility to a government body/agency would just create its own set of problems and other conflicts of interest (for example, opinions could be subject to politics, increased bureaucracy, laziness due to monopoly) Hell, if the government audited the statements, they would have the power to authorize only accounting policies that maximized a company's tax payout. The audit only firm proposal by the European Commission seems to be the more reasonable solution to try to avoid conflicts of interest (firms that audit companies are less likely to issue adverse/qualified opinions on them since those companies were simply following the firms' own consulting advice) which seems to be the heart of the problem even though the SOX nearly eliminated that. But if the audit business was effectively separated from accounting firms' other practices and audit only companies sprung up then other problems would arise. Audit only firms would still be unwilling to piss major clients off by issuing qualified opinions (and lose future business). Also, since the audit business is not really the present firms' money maker, costs to audit would only increase to ensure that audit only firms are profitable.
