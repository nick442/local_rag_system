edited you's to they's and I's =) Further, I'm not ballsy enough to go all out on this. I actually am slightly in debt buying silver. But in a hyper-inflation event credit is cheap to pay off. If one was confident enough they could hypothetically go into silver on large margin and pay it off quite easily after the hyperinflation occured. Much like what the government is doing with it's debt. At that point you are betting the government will continue doing what it is for a long while though. Just a thought.
