I agree, the markets that Amazon competes in his extremely competitive with larger companies (such as Wal Mart) operating at smaller margins to increase volume. Since Amazon is continuously trying to increase its customer base and customer loyalty, they really need the low margins. The 1% increase could be harmful to the long-term growth of the company, which as the executives of Amazon explain, really matters more than higher profits this quarter. Furthermore, 5% decrease in SGA sounds like a company that's downsizing, particularly a company that operates as efficiently as Amazon, making that suggestion unreasonable and unrealistic.
