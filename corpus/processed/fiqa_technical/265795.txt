>Even though her husband still works.. Ok hold on there. That's not really retiring, your husband still works. You are transitioning to a stay at home mom. And in NYC your $67k annual expenses after that kid comes will balloon big time. Great job, well done, but don't belittle your husband's work by pretending you both sit at the cafe all day.
