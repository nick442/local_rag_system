">I was refreshing when he did it, so I saw him downvote me in real time. So you are watching his computer screen? As that is the only way you can see such a thing. For all you know it could been someone else who saw your comment and downvoted it.

Do you like making up bullshit claims or something? I only have this account and no I am not defending them. I am more mocking you if you will over getting all upset over being downvoted. >this is way harsher than I wanted to be with you If you think how you being with me is harsh then you got to be the nice ""harshest"" person ever."
