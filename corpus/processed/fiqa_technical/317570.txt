I see a couple of ways of getting at this. One would be to switch to a VAT. That would capture a good amount of revenue on anything that's made here. Second, I want IP to be taxed. We pay property taxes, so I think that trademarks and copyrighted works should be taxed just like how real property is taxed. You want to register the Burger King logo in the US? Sure thing! You will pay a percentage of its value every year and you get to use it exclusively with the full protection of the US courts your taxes help fund. I also see this as a good way out of the IP cesspool we're currently in. Copyright has become unreasonably long mostly because Disney doesn't want to lose the rights to Mickey Mouse. Look, I *am* sympathetic to Disney's argument. Mickey genuinely is important to them. But Mickey is fucking things up for everyone else. So I think Disney should pay a percentage of Mickey's value every year. In exchange, they keep their copyright forever as long as they keep paying. Now, if the copyright tax isn't paid, then the property becomes public domain forever. This would let Disney have what they want while non-profitable copyrights become public domain, as they should. Anyhow, the one thing all the big tax-avoiding companies have in common is IP. If you tax their IP in exchange for protection in US courts, there's really no way around that. They will either have to pay or let their IP go public domain.
