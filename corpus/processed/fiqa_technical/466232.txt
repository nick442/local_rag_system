And they get paid like everyone else. Is the worker more important than anyone else? Or are they equal? And as equals should they not pay the same rate for the same services as anyone else? Walmart doesn't treat you any different based on account status, neither does any other voluntary service provider. Why does an involuntary service provider get the right to discriminate based on success? McDonald's doesn't do a survey of the in store customers and make a segment pay more than another so they can eat for free. Im not sure how people can fight inequality by treating people unequally.
