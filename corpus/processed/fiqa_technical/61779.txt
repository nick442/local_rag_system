I don't know that this study so much measures selfishness so much as consideration of a problem that you come face to face with, which might be significant for some category of selfishness. That is to say, I don't think all instances of selfishness are like running into a starving person on the side of the road and not giving them money. Some might involve thinking of others without their envelope to their grandfather being right there, and capturing that might be even trickier than this already convoluted experiment.
