>The idea that extra bodies competing for jobs would drive down the price of labor also needs to be justified. Basic supply and demand. If supply(of labor) increases(ceteris paribus) then the price of labor falls. In reality the supply of labor and the demand for labor are constantly changing(usually upwards). So if the supply of labor increases faster than the demand for labor does then the price of labor falls. If demand increases faster than supply then the price of labor goes up.
