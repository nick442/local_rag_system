"I have personally known a family in the hills of Southern Oregon, US who lived off the electricity grid. As far as being ""possible"" yes, but easy is a certain no. This family was very dedicated to the point of living without grid electricity. A special built home of native field stones, careful alignment with the sun, location within the valley. I would assume that making a normal home be off the electric grid is much more difficult. Not impossible, but pretty darn hard."
