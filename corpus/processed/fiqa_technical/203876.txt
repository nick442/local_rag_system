If you don't mind, sign the form and move on. If you would rather make a point, go to another lender. You lender had certain boxes they have to check off as they go through the paperwork process: the two things your lender cares about are those boxes and getting paid. Take your money elsewhere and they don't get paid. But seriously, just sign the agreement. Focus your intelligence and productivity on something more worthwhile than your pride.
