"I worked for one of these companies. they treat their employees like shit, they expect you to work like an Indian and not question what they do. They expect more for their dollar and don't mind heaping task after task on your back. the place I worked at promised me a raise after 60 days, turns out since I was over qualified to begin with they gave me their ""top"" pay right away, and there were many many others that after 3 or 4 years they never saw another penny. They over promise the customer, and then expect us to pull miracles out of our asses. Never again. It's great they are bringing jobs back to the US, but it's still a foreign company that is getting the lions share of the money and contracts."
