There would be a catastrophic collapse in the financial industry. Not exaggerating. Every bank is a company that's technically held by another company, a bank holding company. Every investment firm typically has anywhere from dozens to thousands of separate little companies (depending on the size of the overall firm) that it uses to manage money and risk. There's ways to try and solve agency problems and moral hazard problems in corporate governance, but disallowing corporations from creating wholly owned subsidiaries is not the way to do it.
