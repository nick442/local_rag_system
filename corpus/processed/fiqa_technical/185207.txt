"Clearly you aren't in trading. While that is the case for IBanking, I personally work with numerous very successful traders who ""underperformed their peers"" and I'm not doing so bad myself either. Having a good GPA has almost no correlation with being a good trader. Honestly, from the interviews I've given I've found that the kids with the extremely high GPA's 4.0, were less suited for the profession."
