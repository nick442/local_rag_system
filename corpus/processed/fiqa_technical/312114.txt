I don't see the reason for this response. It seems the only logical conclusion since the following factors aren't explanatory: I) resources; II) environment (excluding Earth natural resources); III) landlocking; IV) historical circumstances (excluding evolutionary environ; cf. Clark, 2008); V) colonial legacy (it's actually predictive of greater success, not less); VI) badly-drawn borders; &c. All explanations drawn from common equalitarian tropes seem to fall flat and counter-examples abound. What's more, other differences with a more biological, evolutionary basis are; A) more sensible, and; B) more explanatory.
