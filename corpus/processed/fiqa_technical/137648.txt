It’s 60-70% of US transportation. Not ICE passenger transport. Around 60% of that is for LD vehicles. Down to around 35% of the total. Global oil consumption is different that US oil consumption though. Many countries are not as heavily saturated by vehicles on a per capital basis as the US. It’s possible the stat I was reading was around 20% could be eligible for replacement by electric. Other important note: Most vehicles are considered “electric” even if they are simply Hybrids that use an ICE to charge a battery.
