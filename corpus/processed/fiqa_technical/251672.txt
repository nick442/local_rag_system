Employee badges are designed to track your location. If you don't want your activities within a company to be tracked, you wouldn't be able to work for many companies. I don't understand why you think you deserve the same privacy at work that you get at home. My transit card has a microchip. Do you seriously think it does anything other than perform transit transactions?
