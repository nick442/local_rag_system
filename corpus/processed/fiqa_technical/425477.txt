In addition, take those who must support themselves through school. It's fucking hard to pay your own rent, utilities, food, gas, etc., while progressing through school at a normal rate. They have no qualifications or experience, yet they're trying their hardest to further themselves. Are we supposed to trap those who were born without economic advantage? It's a complicated issue, but it's not up to us to judge those who work unskilled labor jobs. As a society, however, we need to find some solution to helping people raise themselves out of poverty and provide for themselves and their families. In summation, there are people who don't want to just be handed a fish, and want to learn to fish. However, they don't have enough fish in the first place.
