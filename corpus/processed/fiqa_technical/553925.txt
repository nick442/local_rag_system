Hey thank you so much for the reply! So the interview is a late stage one - I've gotten past the concepts and honestly the role *shouldn't* be that heavy on the finance side ..what I'm looking at now is actually having to mock up a financial forecast in a real estate development scenario. I'm getting the case in advance and have to prepare a presentation. So right now, I really need the ABCs of forecasting specifically. But I'm definitely checking out your recommendations!
