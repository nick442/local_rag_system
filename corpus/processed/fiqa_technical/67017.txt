As a web designer and developer, I would like to add an addendum that a quality web site usually *starts* around $1500. We're a little more pricey, but we run about $2500 for the standard Home, About, Services, Testimonials, Photo Gallery, Contact setup. Everything else is dead on. Great write up. I would add that getting yourself involved in a local chamber of commerce is something that we did, and were successful with. The chamber is now working with us on some of their new design projects.
