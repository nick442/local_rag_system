out of all of these, luck is unquestionably the most necessary of the conditions. do you know successful lazy people? i do do you know successful undetermined people? i do do you know successful dimwits? i do do you know successful idiots? i do do i know successful people who didn't have an extremely high amount of luck in their lives? nope. pretending that luck isn't a necessary condition implies that there are sure thing, can't lose undertakings in life. there aren't. and that doesn't even begin to address a priori luck in terms of ones heritage.
