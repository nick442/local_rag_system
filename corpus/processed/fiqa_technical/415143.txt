"I'm looking to leave my corporate finance position in the next several months. Looking at positions externally with more responsibilities in the same realm or to move to a financial services type role in consulting or similar. A lot of job postings call out ""financial modeling"" as a desired skill. What specifically is meant by this? Modeling cash flows? Estimating P&Ls given some assumptions? Valuation? I'm in Excel all day in my role but still can't seem to make sense of what I should be doing to prepare for a next step in my early career. The ""models"" I typically work with involve calculating accruals or analyzing sales/ margin data in my corporate environment which has become very stale as of late. Thanks!"
