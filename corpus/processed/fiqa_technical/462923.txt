It gives some vague crap about pain, but talks very little about the actual diagnoses, chronic pain is one of those things that seems subjective, but can be very problematic for determining ability. A construction worker with chronic back pain might in theory be able to do a desk job, but if hes an older worker, especially only a high school graduate, he's gonna have a fuck time trying to get a desk job, and is likely unable to meet the standards required for retail, and you can not be just a cashier, all cashiers are now stock/clerk/cashier with lifting minimums and requirements to stand for 4 to 5 hours at a time. In THEORY theres a job he could be doing, in ACTUALITY there isn't. Times of high unemployment create more and more situations like that as people who found some acceptable niche to fit in that accommodated their disability now find it extremely difficult to find that accommodation again. Lacking other options, it now becomes a necessity to get into SSDI since the US has pretty much no real reliable welfare. An SSDI requires you not work, so you can't wean off of it, its a trap, once you're in, you usually don't get out. It's the biggest, most extreme welfare cliff in the way it's designed.
