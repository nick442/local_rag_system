> U.S. housing prices are up more than 25% since the beginning of 2012. However, they **still need to climb** more than 20% to just reach their pre-recession highs gets pretty annoying to constantly read about how much we're STILL OFF the high. HIGH point was peak BUBBLE point. Is that really a goal?, if so, why?
