CEOs, CFOs and Board member are over-rated. A company runs mostly because of a lot of gray people taking care of the various day-to-day functions needed and done by the company. CEOs, CFOs and Board member mostly take credit for work done by others. But, yes, someone needs to make the top **new** decisions or address new top unexpected situations. This is rare, and to begin with, companies with CEOs and CFOs and Board members are very slow in to make such decisions, and their decisions are mostly based on research and recommendations done by those gray people behind them. So, no need to sweat over a company running without a CEO, CFO and Board members for a while. It will be just fine.
