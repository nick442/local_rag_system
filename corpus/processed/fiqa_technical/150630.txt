>Olsavsky’s answer came in response to a question from Douglas Anmuth, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, on whether Amazon had considered using Whole Foods’ more than 400 brick-and-mortar stores to establish a physical pharmacy presence, which it has reportedly received wholesale licensing for in at least 12 states. I think this is the natural next step to their retail strategy, especially given that Olsavsky declined to get specific on their pharmaceutical strategy. he did expand further on wanting to get their existing physical products in front of people: >I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there’ll be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So, there’ll be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we’ll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods: Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents. We have on-campus bookstores.
