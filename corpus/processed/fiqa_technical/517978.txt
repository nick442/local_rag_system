Being from a working class background l found tipping repulsive but I can see benefits after seeing more and eating out with age but one thing still pisses me off: how unfair it is that breakfast and lunch servers get lesser tips while those overpriced dinner places get so much more tips for servers who work even less than the breakfast wait staff.
