For aggregate demand: we've built an economy that depended on credit to fuel demand so it should be no surprise that a correction in the market slowing down demand because its not easy to get credit as much as it used to. Economic growth should be built on productivity and savings not endless credit. For interest rates: Companies are no longer expanding because they have already over expanded. Over the past few decades companies have been enticed with cheap rates, encouraged by the fed and governments, to capitalize their productivity to supply an inflated/manipulated demand. If it wasn't for all of this cheap rates, producers would not have incorrectly over capitalized. For currency: We live in a world where many of the products we buy/sell are made with imported and domestic parts. So cheapening our currency will also increase the prices of the goods we buy at Walmart, Best Buy, Apple stores etc. If we lived in a country/society where domestic products are truly domestic made and resourced then there would be some benefit to devalue our currency for gain of export. Besides, like you said, I doubt other countries are just going to sit idle and watch us continue printing money to make our dollar worth less.. they will respond the same way. Regarding supply and demand, it is a circle.. so supply needs to also be cheap enough to encourage people to demand it. So giving money to people so they spend it is not going to fix anything. For Gators: Go Gators!
