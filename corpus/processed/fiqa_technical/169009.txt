"2010 - What $20M looks like with hindsight of 7 years Friend: ""Dude there is this new thing, you should grab some, it is $0.10 per."" Me: ""So like a penny stock? Nah im good that seems like a waste."" Friend: ""No man this is going to blow up and is the future. Take like $500 buy some and it will be worth like $1000 next year."" Me: ""Nah ill keep putting my $500 in safe investments making me 5-10% a year."" Edit: I am aware I probably made the ""smart"" choice but turning $500 into even $200,000 would have been nice"
