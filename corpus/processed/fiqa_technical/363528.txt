My attempt to convey the shorthand report notes on file: >..bipartisan opposition at the capitol to the GOP health care bill. All three members of Vermont's congressional delegation joining the Republican Governor, and Republican and Democratic leaders of the state house and senate, all joining forces here to attack this new GOP bill.. It would send the budget into deficit or throw 51,000 Vermonters off health care completely. >The proposed deductions in Medicaid would leave our state with a budget deficit because [we can't] absorb without cutting health services for the people who deserve it the most or significantly raising taxes.. If you have heart disease, or get cancer, and are suddenly thrown off of health insurance.. it is immoral, it's not acceptable. >Now it is rare to see leaders from all three parties speak out so forcefully here. Governor Scott, in particular, pleading with the Senate to slowdown, take a breath and draft something acceptable to both parties. He is back from a weekend in which he met with his fellow Republican governors, and said that many of the fellow GOP leaders feel as he does. Even conservative.. minority leader Donald Turner, who supports health care reform said the Senate GOP repeal bill is not the answer. Some leaders saying the Medicaid cuts could force a number of our small rural hospitals to close.
