>“If you were to disallow deductions for settlements, then that would create an incentive for companies to litigate the case all the way to a trial verdict,” Victor Fleischer, a tax law professor at the University of Colorado, said. “If the company had to pay a claim in that instance, it would be deductible. That’s not wise public policy either.” Huh? First of all, if the deduction were disallowed why would the payment of a claim at the end of a trial be deductible? Second, part of the problem, which is unaddressed in the article, is that the companies paying these fines typically sign agreements that admit liability for the fine but deny all aspects of wrongdoing. Thus, there is no precedent set and there are no guidelines to follow in the future. As such, the result of a trial would actually be instructional to future participants in these markets. Similarly, it might actually result in personal liability for the worst offenders in the organizations.
