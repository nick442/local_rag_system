">>> it means you can't compare education to any good for sale >> Why not? > For the reason that I already gave I don't know what reason that is. You sort of suggested that education is not a good because you are forced to buy it but you're not forced and even if you were that doesn't mean it's not a good. Otherwise you have just repeated that ""Education is not a consumable good"" without any justification. > Who pays for inner city public schools? Not the students that want part of being there By that logic, children's toys are not a product either because the kids who play with them don't pay for them."
