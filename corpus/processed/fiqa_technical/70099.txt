Follow your own logic. Millennials have less capital, so they have to borrow more for any given house. Sure you can expect some amount of reduction in prices, but it will not make up for the lost cash of losing the deduction. If you buy a $200k house ((100% financing @4% just to keep it easy). Say the price drops 10% to $180. That saves you $800/yr. Say 25% tax rate. @ 200k your deduction is $2000. I don't think prices will drop 10%,but you need 25% for this to be better for millennials.
