"Google ""forex broker"" and find one of the thousands that allows you to trade on Gold futures. Then use one of them to short Gold.. just watch your leverage. I would certainly wait before you're shorting gold. Why tie up capital in a bubble that you think will burst in the next few years. Wait for the price to increase and monitor for actual signs of the bubble bursting. Right now with the Euro possibly collapsing shorting gold probably isn't your best bet."
