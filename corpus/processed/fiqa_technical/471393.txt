It has been sort of hit or miss. I sift through the piles of science fiction ebooks on amazon.com. At this point the suggestions list and the most popular lists and the people who bought this also bought this lists seem to be a pretty good source. I will admit that it isn't all winners. The Hal Spacejock novel I'm reading right now is just terrible (supposed to be funny SciFi but ends up just being really shitty). At the price I pay it is alright to get a dud now and then though.
