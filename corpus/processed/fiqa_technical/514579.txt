The concept of a social contract is absolute. A constitution defines the 'how' of a state. The social contract addresses the question why a state even exists and what justifies its existence. And I say it again: the only justification for the existence of a state is the protection of your rights and freedoms from others. Capitalism is based on the exchange of goods and services based on mutual agreement and respect for each other's property. Its driving force is competition. It is an invisible force that has been there since the very beginning. Every other system can be defined as a restriction to capitalism. We agree on that. You can work because the state ensures your safety and the protection of your rights. That's the social contract again. Police, courts and military might be on the list of those necessary services. However mandatory public healthcare is not. Preventing a monopoly is not about wealth redistribution. The driving force behind all the benefits of capitalism is competition, once you have a monopoly the whole thing turns sideways in that area. You need to introduce a few market regulations and a handful of guidelines for competition, but redistribution of wealth won't stop its formation.
