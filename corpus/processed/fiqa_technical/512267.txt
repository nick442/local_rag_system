It is best to take advise from / appoint a professional CA. Will I have to pay GST? No GST is applicable. Exports outside of India do not have GST. Do I have to collect TDS when I send money to the PUBLISHERS ? No But another guy said, I have to pay 18% tax when receiving and sending payments, apart from that I have to collect 30.9% TDS when sending payment to the PUBLISHERS(outside India). There is only income tax applicable on profits. So whatever you get from Advertisers less of payments to publishers less of your expenses is your profit. Since you are doing this as individual, you will have to declare this as income from other sources and pay income tax as appropriate. Note there are restrictions on sending payments outside of India plus there are exchange rate fluctuations. It is best you open an Foreign Currency Resident [or Domestic] Account. This will enable you payout someone without much issues. Else you will have to follow FEMA and LRS schemes of RBI.
