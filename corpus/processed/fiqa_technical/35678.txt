I wouldn't call them another Snapchat. They aren't dependent on advertising and they are actually in a pretty decent position. What is concerning is that moving forward they think they advertising will make up for their losses and be enough to set them apart. Other than that.. They have been cashing in the shift away from cable and the 'purchase only the networks you watch' mentality. They have the brand people like and trust, they have the hardware, and they are pretty boring at the end of the day. I think they'll be one of the few who survive if there were to be a major tech crash coming up.
