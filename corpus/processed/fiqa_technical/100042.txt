Well yeah, that's why they put the disclaimer on the article, so people could know and judge accordingly. That's evidence of good journalism, not bad. That conflict also doesn't negate Wapo's good track record, and the fact that that track record is one of its best selling points. I don't think Amazon would sacrifice that cheaply; definitely not as a cheapshot on some objectively bad pitch videos.
