> Sure, you don't agree, don't know why don't agree, can't explain why you don't agree.. because you like to disagree for the purpose of disagreeing. Oh please. You're the one who started attributing disagreements to me about things I never said. > What don't you disagree with? OK, I'll bite. > Susan is no good? She made a grave mistake. Can't speak to the totality of her career based on this one incident. > Got her job in a corrupt way? No public information sources I've seen support such an allegation. > her degrees show she was not born interested in security (except for fat pay checks)? Her degree shows that in her youth she was more interested in music; her career history, on the other hand, demonstrates an interest in security. Alleging that her interest was solely based on pay is pure speculation. > people with IT degrees are more a match, suitable and qualified for security jobs, especially when they have specific on-hand experience? People with specific, recent experience (Susan had 14 years), are more qualified than people with an outdated IT degree. Between two people with identical experience, the IT degree might help tip the scales. Still, her role was administrative, not hands-on, so specific technical skill sets are less important than management skills for this role. > HR does not care about employees? Good HR does. > real experts have to fight HR and terrible management.. and usually lose because of this whole corrupt setup? Real security experts are not often also experts in HR and management, so aren't qualified to judge qualifications or actions of taken in those contexts as they are unlikely to have a clear view of the overall situation. Claiming that the HR and management setup is systemically corrupt is a specious claim.
