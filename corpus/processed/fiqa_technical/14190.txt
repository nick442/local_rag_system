I think Microsoft is far from being the next IBM. Keep in mind mobile hardware isn't for everyone, even Amazon abandoned it. Microsoft has done a great job with their cloud platforms, revamping the microsoft office suite to compete with google's, their entire surface line of laptops and tablets, purchasing linkedin, etc. I would say they are making the right and relevant moves to not only stay relevant but shake up the status quo that they were living in for a long time.
