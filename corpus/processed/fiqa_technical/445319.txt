I wish people stop blathering about cheap labor this and that. If that were the case, Japan, Germany, Korea, etc would follow the same trend as in US with declining manufacturing, instead of top global powerhouse and major exporter of manufacturing good. Yes there are transition from low cost product, but as those 3 countries proved, they can move on and make higher end goods.
