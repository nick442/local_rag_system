Agreed. Even if you don't wish to stay with the company as you mentioned, OP, getting any qualifications you can (especially when they're free!) before you start job hunting is great. Sure, any company you start at will likely pay for it, anyway, but if you can get it now that means you'll be employed that much faster. Be sure, however, to check that your current employer who intends on sponsoring you does not have a clause in their contract saying you have to pay it back if you leave within so many months. I'm not sure what the standards in the US are like but in Austria if you receive expensive training, most contracts will require that you continue your employment for at least x amount of months or you have to pay it back in full (or partially). This should all be in your employment contract.
