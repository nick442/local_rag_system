Very interesting article, thanks for posting. It's going to get really interesting really fast if investors force governments to raise taxes to pay investors, regardless of who's 'right' in the situation. On a related note, I read awhile back that many US cities have sold the rights to various public areas to foreigners. For example, I believe Chicago sold the rights to collect parking fees along certain streets for 75 years to a company in the Middle East. Some cities then found that if they wanted to have a parade down that street, they had to compensate the company that owned the parking rights because they wouldn't collect any revenue the day of the parade. I can't see how this ends well for the US economy.
