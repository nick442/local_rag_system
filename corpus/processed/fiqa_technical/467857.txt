I would pay the minimum amounts on all loans then pay off the $5,500 @ 7.25% (highest interest rate), then pay any remainder on the $2,000 @ 5.5%. Even though (1) and (3) are at the same rate, I would pay (3) off first as it is a smaller amount and thus can be paid off sooner - giving you less loans to concentrate on paying off .
