Oh poor me I have to drive a shiny and clean sedan instead of shiny and clean sports car on a trip I'm not even paying for /s. Don't try and justify an entitlement complex. This guy is pissed that his ass has to be in a nice Kia instead of a nice Mustang on a trip he isn't even paying for, while the majority of the world's population still live agricultural lifestyles from the cradle to the grave.
