..which just proves my point. Why go to McDonalds when I can serve them up in minutes, have leftovers, and the whole meal costs less than what McDonalds is charging? It would be different if McDonalds had a teleporter to beam that burger to my doorstep within seconds..but they don't. By the time I drive there, pick up an order, and drive back, I could've made my own meal for less.
