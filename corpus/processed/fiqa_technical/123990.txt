Dude, let go of the Muslims all being terrorists thing. One of us is wrong on the thing they keep bring up. It ain't me. Who I voted for is none of your business. I intentionally don't share such information. The only reason you want to know is so that you can bash me for my opinion. That's why you brought up Obama and Bernie. No, thanks. Go pester someone else about their politics.
