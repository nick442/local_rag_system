"Wouldn't any rational person leave those decisions to the managers who have collectively positioned the company to be able to generate those profits in the first place? I'm sure Carl Icahn and other ""activist investors"" would disagree but part of the reason for investing is you trust management to make a good ROI. If as an investor I'm not happy with a 30 or 40 percent ROI then I should get out of the stock."
