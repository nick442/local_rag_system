"Perhaps people in student loan debt aren't the source of the assessment. There have been multiple warnings from Nobel economists on the potential for student loans to do what the housing market did in 2008. If we suddenly find out a large fraction of the educations loaned weren't worth enough to pay back, many positives on company balance sheets would suddenly appear as negatives. When negatives are realized, it triggers what some economists have termed a ""balance-sheet recession"": the great depression and 2008 recession both had this mechanism at their heart. They're a special type of recession that are not temporary and take on the order of a decade to crawl out of."
