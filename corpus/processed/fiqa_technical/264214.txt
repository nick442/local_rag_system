I don't understand why that's a rip off, it was cheaper to have one less battery design and they were able to get cars to more customers because of that. Obviously they have a nice profit margin that they cut into to offer it, but based on the market size it made more sense to do that, customers are happy too because they get to defer cost for a nicer car, or get more life out of the one they bought?
