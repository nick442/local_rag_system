I'm not saying that I have a problem with public transportation, I'm saying that it makes sense for the government to be investing in it. I'm saying that they should be putting more money into improving it. My whole point was that when there's a service that isn't necessarily profitable the government should be putting money toward it so that the public good is the focus.
