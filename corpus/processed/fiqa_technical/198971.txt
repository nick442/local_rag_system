I agree with you on that. The larger the purchase the more important the CEO. However, you are a looking at the CEO from a B2B perspective. I am trying to see the CEO from a B2C perspective. And I am also trying to identify which aspects of the CEO that are the most vital/prominent in the decision making process in a B2C situation.
