It's interesting how ups doesn't seem to be having a problem (a private company). It's more evidence that the government isn't really good at running anything. It's partially because they don't have to worry about making a profit and since it's not their money (it's ours), piss it away. If they can't even run something simple as the post office without nearly going out of business, healthcare is an impossibility.
