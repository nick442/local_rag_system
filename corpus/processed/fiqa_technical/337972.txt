I have never used Square, but my understanding is that they charge a premium for their services. Basically, because you get this nifty smartphone pluggable credit card swiper, you end up paying more than the alternate options. Granted I am in no way knowledgeable of the alternates (as in, mobile credit card machines?), but I assume they aren't as easy to set up. When it first came out, one of my buddies decided that he would accept payments from friends via Square (for beer, meals, concert tickets, gas, etc), and I remember reading that it charges a flat fee plus variable cost, which I thought was a rather silly cost to be incurring. Maybe that has changed? Basically, Square sounds almost to good to be true, but I'm not a small business owner dealing with credit card transactions, so you probably shouldn't listen to me.
