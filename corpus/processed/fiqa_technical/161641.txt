"the economy is, therefore, a gigantic broken window fallacy if you want to go down that path. if you had technology that made food procurement, shelter, healthcare, and transportation obsolete, everyone in the world could do another productive activity. the parable discusses the negation of the ""benefit"" that the calamity causes to economic actors (i.e. saying a broken window creates a job for the glass dude ignores the fact that the shop owner is now out one window) by a loss of use of that same capital for the shop owner - risk of loss associated with vehicle usage isn't analagous. It would be more in line with the shop owner consuming a resource which has a replacement cost."
