That stranglehold is because of the small margins in the business. When you put cabs on the road there are only a few models to work with; the lease model where the company puts as many cabs on the road as possible, the commission model where they balance fleet size and demand, and the medallion model where you have a lot of individual operators. The lease model sounds nice for the customers because there's excess cabs compared to demand, but drivers aren't going to pay $160-300 a shift to not make any money, so even still the cab company has limit the number of cabs they put on the road. In any case, once you add up all your costs for gas, maintenance, licensing, and insurance you're left with a very small margin. Sure a cab company could 3x the number of cabs it normally does at night during the bar rush, but the other 16 hours of the day they're sitting on the lot not doing anything because there isn't as high of demand during the day. That costs money, and if the cabs aren't working they're not paying for themselves. Thus the market finds a balance between what supply there is depending on time of day and how much it costs to support a fleet of that size. The only outside effect on the market equilibrium is how many taxis a city will license. I really don't like the medallion model because of this. The medallion owners love it because they're sitting on upwards of $500k asset in some cities.
