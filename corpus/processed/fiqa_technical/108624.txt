"normally getting seated next to a particular guest at a particular dinner isn't described as ""privilege"", and it's not idiosyncratic to call that ""luck"" edit: i don't mean to be pedantic. rather, you seem to really be trying to whitewash, minimize, and explain away the luck. another example: ""made his path to success easier"" as if that path was guaranteed, but more difficult, absent his luck. i don't think he himself would agree with that."
