Any actual evidence? From what I've read, all the testimony has been roundly discredited. You're very hip and edgy for calling me an Armstrong fanboy, but I'm just looking for actual evidence while you keep saying he needs to prove himself innocent instead of the accusers proving him guilty. Morally bankrupt. That's what your technique is.
