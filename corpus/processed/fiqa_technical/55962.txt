"While It is understandable to be concerned about the choices offered between Mr.20% and the Oft Returning Hemorrhoid, I don't think the US should be lecturing you about a stable government. It turns out the US Secretary of State Called the US President a ""Fucking Moron"", so this meeting you had, don't put to much weight in it, you will have to have it again with the new US Secretary of State and explain all over again that the Taliban is not a type of crop that covers 40% of Afghanistan and no, minerals cannot really be found in President Ghani's ass, it was just a figure of speech."
