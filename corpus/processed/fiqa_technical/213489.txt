> The rate given was discounted since we originally discussed this option at the start of your loan process of **which you had agreed to.** Did you, in fact, make an oral representation agreeing to this? Either way, they are bound by the terms of the loan agreement / note. If the loan documentation does not give them the ability to unilaterally change the interest rate at their discretion (you would be a fool to have signed such a document, and your lawyer would have been a fool to have allowed you to sign such a document), they are on the hook. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule of contract law (excluding oral representations not memorialized within the terms of the contract) and your lawyer should advise you regarding the same. That's the legal answer. The business answer is that you are letting pride cloud your judgment. If you don't care, don't piss off your mortgage lender, because there may come a time when you depend on their goodwill. Also, you're looking for /r/personalfinance.
