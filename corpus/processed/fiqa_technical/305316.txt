I believe the law was originally introduced to preserve competition in the market - smaller companies with very good products can't compete with someone who can leverage their monopolist position in other markets (= high market share, unrelated to the number of competitors) in promoting possibly inferior products in other markets. Google has hundreds of millions of their search engine users in the EU alone. It should not affect normal competition since the law only applies across different markets.
