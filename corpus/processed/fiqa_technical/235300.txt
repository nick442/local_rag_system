Yea, you're still young. Just start trying and do the best you can. Maybe you don't land on Wall Street, if that's even the goal, but you can absolutely break into the industry and work your way up. People understand mistakes, and a DUI that will be 4 years old when you start working isn't going to be a big deal if you have a solid 3 year track record. Don't doubt yourself, don't keep people around that hold you back. You don't need to go to a top tier school. It helps, sure, but it's not a requirement by any means.
