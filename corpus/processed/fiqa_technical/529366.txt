You would need additional information (login information [username and which service]) to fully make use of it though. I'm not sure how you would collect that? You could use such a service to build a dictionary for a dictionary attack I guess. It's only after this sort of attack that people start explicitly checking their passwords though? edit: From re-reading your comment I see you've already come up with the same limitations. To answer the question you actually asked, I would say you have no way of knowing these sha1 generators don't store the queries, just that it would be difficult to use the resulting dictionary. You would see which hashes are on your list versus the hashes on the leaked list. And then use those matches as a dictionary to attack someone's linkedin account.
