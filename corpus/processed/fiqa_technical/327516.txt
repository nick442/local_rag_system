"> As you probably do not know, the poorest counties in the US are 95% white Your source specifies Owsley County, Kentucky as example of ""the nation's poorest country"" which is 95% white. It is also [the second smallest county in Kentucky, with a population less than 5,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_County,_Kentucky). Nobody disputes that there are pockets of very poor white people. The liberal position is that, in general minorities have it worse. Consider [Wilcox County, AL that actually was poorer per household than Owsley County in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lowest-income_counties_in_the_United_States). [The population there is 11,670 and it is 72.5 percent are black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcox_County,_Alabama). That right there is enough to counterbalance Owsley County's imbalance. (It tilts it to the other side if you consider that there are more whites than blacks in this country.)"
