"Last night, there was a sudden influx of submissions titled something along the lines of ""Springfield Plumbing Services"" or ""Houston Locksmith"". Clearly all spam that made it through the filter, when legitimate stories got simultaneously downvoted.. most likely by the same people that submitted the spam. It appears that OP submitted one of those stories that got downvoted."
