Credit unions operate for the benefit of their depositors, who are the actual owners of the institution, whereas conventional banks operate for the benefit of their shareholders, who of course are not necessarily depositors. So credit unions will typically give a benefit or service for free if it is free or extremely cheap to them, whereas conventional banks will charge for it if they think it will not lose them depositors.
