">I did read your comment, and all the other ones that referred to me as ""he."" Believe it or not, the melodrama you see is imagined. I didn't write, for example, ""This stupid fucker doesn't realize I've got a vagina."" >[..] but after actually typing my name ""Amy Hoy"" you still refer to me as a ""he""? Amy is a girl's name and my picture is obviously of a woman. Hey, you blew a gasket at me for calling you a dude when I was fairly obviously not actually making that mistake. If that doesn't seem like not reading and/or an overreaction, I don't know what would. >I didn't write, for example, ""This stupid fucker doesn't realize I've got a vagina."" Sure, that would be *more* of an overreaction, but it's also so far from accepted etiquette in /r/business specifically and reddit in general - that you didn't reply with something that would only be normal in YouTube comments certainly doesn't make your actual reaction any *less* of an overreaction. A polite ""hey, you referred to me as a dude a few times in there, wanna fix that?"" would have worked. >The culture I'm complaining about is everywhere, not just in b-school. This is the start of a rebuttal. ""not just in b-school"" essentially translates to ""you said a thing, but that's not what I was talking about."" If you want to agree or support something someone said, it's a good thing to actually do so - you had that idea just fine in your original writing, in discussing jwz's original post on the matter. I'm sorry to come down so hard on you, but I feel it's pretty insulting to write an essay in support of a thing someone wrote, then have the author backhand you. And then pretend they didn't when called on it."
