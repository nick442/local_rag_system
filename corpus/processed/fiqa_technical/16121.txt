Is that even a question? Congress can't pass shit, just look at the boarder crisis.. Which leaves only the executive and judicial branches to pass law.. and the way that works is the NLRB passes new rules and the judicial branch decides if they are legal or not. And to your dictatorship point, for fucks sake, the current administration has been far more passive with their executive powers than most administrations.. its just extremest GOP tarts who don't believe in science or rational thinking that using that claim to rally their base.. I mean a war on whites, the things that come out of these peoples mouths.
