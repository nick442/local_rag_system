It sorta has to do with zoning because we decided in Washington that we like have space between houses and a backyard. But because of that, we're spread out. And have longer commutes to work. Which leads to shitty traffic. The only solution to fix the traffic issue I can think of is for big corporations to stagger starting times but that might interfere with business operations. also give motorcycle riders a lane. Like in California
