TLDR * Of funds with a five-star rating, three years later only 14% had performed at a five-star level. * Of funds with a four-star rating, three years later 25% received only a one or two-star rating for that period. * About a third of three-star funds received that rating again three years later for that period. * Sixteen percent of two-star funds went on to receive a four- or five-star rating three years later for that period. * While one-star funds were most likely to merge into other funds or be liquidated, about 14% still went on to earn four or five stars three years later for that period.
