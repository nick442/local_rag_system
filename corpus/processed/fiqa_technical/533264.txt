There's a lot in there. First of all you're denying the existence of public goods and the need for an actor on behalf of the public, chosen by the public (aka democracy in a republic). But also, government is the chosen form of organization for every country on the planet, with the possible exception of the failed states that devolve into piracy and gang membership. And I'm sure you'll agree, those gangs and tribes are a form of government. So in the absence of government, government is created. We all choose to utilize government to create a better society. And we can change it if it's not working. So, 'somehow the state convinced us?' No, we all chose this. It's absolutely the point that government is different than McDonalds. They are for different things and they have different goals. Our government regulates businesses so the profit motive can be counteracted. It can't have the profit motive.
