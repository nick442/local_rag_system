I agree with you. I'm a millennial. I'm not some old dude sitting in a chair writing on Reddit without first hand knowledge. I took out six figures of college debt, but spent a long time calculating my expected ROI. Years after working I lived in relative poverty to pay of my loans and finally have done so. I totally believe in many forms of loan forgiveness, but a blanket forgiveness I cannot support.
