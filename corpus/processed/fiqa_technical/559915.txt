".. which is why the entire ""it costs 1.8 cents to make a penny"" argument is meaningless. We're not losing 0.8 cents per penny made. If that was true, we'd also be ***gaining*** $99.877 for every $100 bill that was printed ([which costs 12.3 cents to make](http://mentalfloss.com/article/68650/how-much-does-it-cost-manufacture-us-paper-money)) - which would more than offset the non-existent ""loss"" that people seem to think we incur producing pennies."
