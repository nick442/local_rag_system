These are both trade book companies. Very few of these books are actually sold to students (except for literature texts I would guess). Most of these books are the paperbacks you buy for pleasure reading, or the coffee table books you might have around. You are thinking of Pearson's Higher Education group, which publishes textbooks. My guess is you wanted to rant about textbooks, though, and used this unrelated news as an outlet.
