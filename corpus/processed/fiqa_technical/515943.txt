Look at how fast you are backpedaling. My statement was that you can get a union job at Boeing with nothing more than a high school degree and a passing drug test. Both my observations and Boeings own job posting lend certainty to the fact that that statement was accurate. You don't seem to have the courage to just outright admit you're wrong, so that will have to do. >You're not proving anything by showing me the job specs. You claimed that it required more than a high school diploma to get a job at Boeing. I proved you to be incorrect. >What you don't understand since live in a world where your resume gets you in the door is that the difficulty of a job I don't think there's anything involving this conversation that you understand but I don't. I understand how difficult getting a job at Boeing is. I understood the requirements while you falsely claimed that they were something other than what I said. And I have fought far harder to get where I am than you have for anything in your career, so I am aware of the difficulty of getting jobs in general. By the way, if you're relying on your resume to get your foot in the door you have already failed. >And just for the record, Boeing's thousands of union professional and technical aeronautical engineers would like to have a word with you about lack of credentials required to get a union job at Boeing, if we're going to split hairs. So your argument is now that SOME of the union jobs require greater credentials? Really? Nice try but your bullshit argument reframing isn't going to fly.
