This is a meaningless question without additional parameters. You certainly can live on $30k if you live a spartan life in a low cost of living place. What could change.. You want to live in a US city? Have kids? Send those kids to college? Save money? Go out to eat? Travel? Buy your own health care instead of being on your parents insurance? etc. etc. etc.
