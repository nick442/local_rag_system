I'm sore but the MAJORITY OF AMERICANS don't want to wash dishes as a career choice. My goodness even if you are the son or daughter of a well of family they don't actually expect their kiddo to work hard. This is HARD work we are taking about, laboring in sun, hot dishwashing, waking up at 4am to clean rooms. I have just never seen a well off family do work like this. It's really for poor Americans but let me tell a single mom can't survive on season work, temporary, no benefits all hours. It just isn't work for any American who wants to be successful. But no worries all hear jobs will go to AI in the future anyway! Then there will a crap ton more out of workðŸ‘Œ
