Not really, we have a 600b deficit. Many people are paid to much for what they're worth. Our fortune 500 make after taxes 1 trillion. Let alone what the 0.5% are making. Sorry Tom Cruise I like you, but 5 weeks of a movie shoot I don't feel bad you're left with 40 million after taxes from it. You ever stop and think that the executives don't have an incentive to help lower costs because they get these huge checks?
