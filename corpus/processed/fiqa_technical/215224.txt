You give extreme importance to the Laffer curve, while ignoring monetary velocity. Yet, the evidence for the first is scant to non-existent, while the evidence for the latter is overwhelming. To quote one of the [greatest theorists of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), who went by the *feel* and the *beauty* of equations: > It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong. I am a trained condensed matter physicist, and the theory vs experiment debates have played out in our field decades back. Without empirical observations, you are wrong.
