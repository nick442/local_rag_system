"> Also as a 1099 worker you are still subject to income tax and jail time if not paid. No shite shirlock. > That's the part of this you don't fucking get. If I don't give the government my money I get kidnapped and thrown into a fucking cage. The part that *you* don't get is that it is as it should be. You live in this country. And whether you like it or not, you benefit from the stability, structure, and network that taxes built in this country. *And* you *should* go to jail if you don't pay those taxes. You are like a little kid, born into a good home, with good parents, and has all his basic needs met but whines about his chores with cries of ""but, I didn't *choose* to be *born*.."" Don't worry.. When you grow up, one day you will grow the balls to leave."
