"You should be handling it in another way. You cannot, strictly speaking, have AR entry if you didn't issue an invoice. You should record it as a current income. Unless you're on accrual basis (in which case you could either create a ""dummy"" invoice or not accrue this income), AR has no real meaning to you. AR means that you billed someone and you have the right to the money. With Amazon affiliate program you do not have the right to the money until they decide you do, and once they do decide that - they just pay you."
