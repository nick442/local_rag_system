Erisa laws protect your retirement just like something should mandate what minimum ownership should be to classify yourself as exempt from labor laws. I like this idea a lot..however how does 1 employee present enough value to actually effect the price of their company stock? This would only work for top brass positions..which is probably the way it should be.
