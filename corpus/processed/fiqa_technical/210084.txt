I too have a nexus 5 and have had a note 2 and various other phones i couldn't reach the top left corner but on andriod it isn't really an issue. When I use an iPhone 5 i have issues hitting that stupid back button all the time with my tiny lady hands. I bigger iPhone would be completely useless to me unless they revamp the UI and judging by their keyboard UI it hasn't really been a top priority.
