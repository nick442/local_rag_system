Giant, Trek, and Specialized have partner brick and mortar shops that are selling more than just their bikes. They're selling direct to consumer but the hope is that they are going into these shops and buying other cycling accessories that they manufacture i.e. helmets, shoes, cycling kits, etc. I don't know much about Canyon but my guess is that they are mainly selling bikes and all the other stuff isn't a big component of their business.
