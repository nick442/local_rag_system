"The local K-Mart to us will sell the whole pizzas for even less if they're old. They've trained me and other customers. Come on ""When's the pizza getting old"" I ask. ""Come back in 10, we'll save one for you."" 10 minutes later, me and 4 other people are grabbing $2-3 large pizzas. Whatever the fuck they feel like charging. In the meantime, I enjoy the time machine that is K-Mart. ""Wow, 2006 Hot Wheels! That shit's probably collectible by now!"""
