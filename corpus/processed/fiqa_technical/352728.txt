"Gold ownership has been outlawed before in this country. However, if you research it I think you'll find that there are two components in pricing gold coins: * The spot value of gold * The numismatic value of the coin in question. That second point is where you get fucked. There are a whole lot of outfits selling worthless ""investment grade"" coins that sell for way more than they should based on gold content, and for way more than any coin collector would ever give you for the value of the coin itself. But it's much harder to find a reasonable price for some supposedly rare coin than it is for the metal itself, so it's easier to scam you. So it's in the best interest of the guys that advertise for these firms to say ""buying rare coins is awesome, and buying straight gold is stupid."" Me? If I want to buy going coins I'll buy US Gold Eagles for a small percentage over the spot price. They're probably more liquid than some random chunk of goldish metal that says it's 1oz/10oz/100oz of gold."
