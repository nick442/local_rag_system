One group of people I've learned through talking to colleagues is working moms are desperate for minor day-to-day conveniences. In my own circle of people I know, women outnumber men vastly as far as being heavy users of Alexa and Amazon Fresh. This is obviously anecdotal but just thought it worth mentioning. edit: I'm a male. edit 2: I also think a lot of techies want to see technology evolve for technology's sake. My silicon valley friends are largely like this.
