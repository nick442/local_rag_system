"Yes, except many, many Icelanders still owe debt on assets they purchased in krona (the Icelandic dollar) before it collapsed. Now many are stuck with homes, vehicles, etc. on which they owe twice the underlying value. You'll often see this referred to as ""private debt overhang"" in financial news articles, and it is not reported on nearly enough. Just letting the banks fail doesn't unwind all of the ridiculous currency speculation that took place in Iceland. They may be on their way to recovery..eventually..but they're still in terrible shape in the short term."
