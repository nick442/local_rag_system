Few extra dollars? Sometimes $10+ a ticket, which quickly becomes $20 when taking someone out. As someone who goes to a few shows a week (so far two this week, third this Saturday), that would be $60 a week, but sadly I do not have a girlfriend. I actually didn't think I would have an example from this week, but look at [Laura Marling's](http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0700475301BFB681?artistid=1362337&majorcatid=10001&minorcatid=1) show in Chicago. The **service fees are $14.34**. I actually saw her at a venue this week primarily run by volunteers (also not ticketmaster) and the show was a quarter the cost. When service fees cost as much (sometimes more) as a concert there is something wrong.
