I've already worked for a major broker dealer. I came to ask this question on Reddit for unbiased advice. I've asked multiple people the same question in industry and they always tell me something different. Since I will be registering in my home state of New York, I looked up what the regulations are and was even further confused. One website says >Licensing Requirements: Series 65, Series 66 and Series 7 combined, or one of the following acceptable professional designations: CFA, CFP, CIC, ChFC, PFS. Whereas another says > If you have taken the Series 65 or both the Series 66 and Series 7 within the last two years, you do not have to do anything. My confusion is the part where the first website says Series 65, Series 66, and Series 7 combined.
