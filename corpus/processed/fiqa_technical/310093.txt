I'm not going to discuss speed here, because speed is just a characteristic of bandwidth for purposes of this discussion. Bandwidth is not at all unlimited. I'm not going to act in a pedantic fashion with you, but the idea of bandwidth almost literally dominates the data delivery model. From the telcos, to the wireless providers, to the fixed infrastructure providers it is literally the dependent variable upon which the rest of their business is based. It is absolutely limited, and it's valuable. And - most importantly - *it's privately owned.* Yet you want to take it from its owners (those owners are the shareholders of these companies, among which you are likely) and simply give away their most valuable competitive advantage because.. ..you support the right of any Tom, Dick or Harry and their business to push their information to you for free?
