It really depends on your demographics. Where are they located? What are their common interests? Could you use this to effectively target them with advertising? Do you get repeat business? Do you have past customers info? They're antiques: do people actually play these instruments or are they just ritzy fucks who want another dusty piece of wood in their house? TL;DR Know your customer, find a way to reach them three different ways and let them know you still exist.
