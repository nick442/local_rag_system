"I'm not an economist, but I understand the idea of value or ""price"" is purely ""what people agree it to be"". The quants and analysts I've worked with always talk about ""discovering the price"" - it's an unknown until someone says ""I will pay X"". Are my 2nd hand Nikes worth $20? Put em on ebay to find out. If someone buys them, then yes, 2nd hand Nikes are worth $20. If they don't sell then they're not worth $20. Obviously ebay is not the most efficient market out there. The exchanges attempt to be that with prices varying by fractions of cent in fractions of seconds (milliseconds). EDIT* Perhaps another way to look at it is ""What is the 'correct' value of a computer game, say 'Skyrim'?"" Your idea of the value of labour and production costs produces some figure. But in the real world, what actually happens? On release day the game is priced at, say, $60. And lots of people say ""I will pay $60"". Many people don't, but many people do. Months later, Steam has a sale and they suggest Skyrim is now worth $30. Lot's of people who didn't think it was worth $60 do think it is worth $30. The amount of labour that went into is hasn't changed. So what it the true or 'correct' value/price of the game? What is the correct value/price of *amything*? It is *what people will pay for it*."
