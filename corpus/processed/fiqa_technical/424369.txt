You don't need autopilot. You don't need a paint upgrade. That's why it's called base model. It's meant to be an electric car and that's it. 200+ range? I don't see Ford, Chevy, Honda, Toyota, Acura, Audi, Hyundai, Mazda, Lexus, Porsche, etc doing this. As far as parking, shit happens. Get over it. The guy is building high speed tunnels I'm sure he'll make hover pads for cars to park above each other. Just chill.
