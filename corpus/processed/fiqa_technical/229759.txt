I think that public education is literally under attack in the US right now. At least on the Internet. For example, I can't even begin to tell you how many arguments I've gotten into with people on here about this. I never meet them in real life, though. Its strange. Basically, they feel we no longer need public education, since people need more of it now they figure why bother. Allowing education to be privatized like healthcare has been would be a huge mistake.
