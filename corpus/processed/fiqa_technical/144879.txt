First, you can never trust what USPS says about the status of your package. I have had tracking numbers that said they were pending receipt of the package up to and including the day I received the package myself. It's a nice feature, but nothing to rely on. Second, she cancelled the order after not receiving it in 6 days?? I've shipped things New York to California (or vice versa) that took 10 business days to arrive before. A few times because of bad weather in between, and several times because they attempted delivery and I was not available, or because the shipper wasn't able to get it to the post office 3 or 4 days later than they said they would when they filled out the label. Cancelling your order after 6 days is jumping the gun a bit. I don't blame the company for initially saying they couldn't refund her purchase since their records showed it was fulfilled. I WANT to jump on the bandwagon disliking the company for their response, but let's be honest here - ars technica did not reproduce her communications to the company verbatim like they did the company's messages to her. She could have written much more crazy that would make the company's response seem tame and level headed in comparison. Trying to collect the $250 is ridiculous, you're allowed to have an opinion about a company and espouse that to others. But let's not grab our pitchforks over how horrible this company was to treat this lady this way for not getting her iPhone case to her in 6 days.
