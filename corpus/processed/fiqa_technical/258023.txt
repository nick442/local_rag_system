I'm not criticizing you for not paying for the Washington Post, you have to allocate your resources based on your priorities and it sounds like you're doing it logically. My objection is to that it's overpriced. It's provides a service, both to the reader and society that is other with at least $8/month. That doesn't mean everyone ought to purchase the service based on some social obligation, just that it's reasonable price for what they do.
