> My biggest thing is I can't put them on bookshelves..I have a mini library starting and I really enjoy having physical books around I can pick and choose from whenever I feel like reading. Aah, the stationary life. As someone that likes experiencing the world and has spent 2+ months in maybe 5 countries so far in his life (including living in 2 and soon a 3rd), the bookshelves are the most annoying part of physical books. Sure, they're visually pleasing, but when we moved countries last time I swear 50% of the weight we dragged over was in books. Also: I do a great deal of long distance flying, and used to pick up books for both flights. 20 flights a year and I'd have 40 soft cover books of mediocre quality accumulating on my shelves just from that. I hate throwing books away, and with my wife flying similarly we just accumulated this crap (and it was annoying while traveling too). All in all, life has been **much** easier since the e-books came out.
