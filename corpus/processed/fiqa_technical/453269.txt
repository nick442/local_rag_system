There is no collective hive mind on reddit. There's just occasional mobs, and semi-anonymised individuals. This very thread disproves that, since the redditors here are complaining about the actions of others. The whole metaphor is crap anyway. Unless it's a very schizophrenic hivemind, with multiple personalities and capable of expressing them simultaneously. You know it's just because you have unpopular opinions, or say a lot of stupid stuff like above, that gets you down-voted (btw it's generally the latter, but being a bit of an arse like I am can also get some down votes as well). Get over it and join a different sub-reddit where you can find some like -minded people with whom you can form your own hive mind.
