"I live where Uber, Sidecar and Lyft are available and have almost regularly used all three services. Out of all of my experiences, Lyft has been the worse. The drivers I've had are quite creepy. They don't seem to have any regulations of how the drivers should act. I've had a driver start smoking in the car with me. Also, they do not have upfront pricing. They do not give an estimate so it's a surprise when you get the bill. They are also a dollar or two more expensive per mile than Sidecar or Uber. Sidecar is great for when you need longer rides. Their rates are generally cheaper for long trips. The drivers have rules they need to follow. As a driver for them, it kind of sucks. They are based off of a ""donation"" that you pay for your ride. So you could have a $20 bill. but only pay $3. And then Sidecar takes 20% of that and then to transfer that to your account is either $0.50 or $1. Unless you drive full time, it doesn't make much sense to drive. And Uber. Oh how I love them! I had one bad experience riding with them and they called me the next day and gave me a refund and some extra ride credit. They are consistently cheaper than Sidecar or Lyft and much more professional. It's like getting a private town car without breaking the bank. Most of the drivers are former taxi drivers, but they go through training with Uber on how to be courteous and knowledgeable about the city. I cannot rave enough about them! :D It's shady of Uber to mess with their ""competitors"" but that doesn't change my opinion about them. I highly doubt that Uber is telling the drivers to do this."
