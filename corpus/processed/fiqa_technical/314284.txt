The f150 has been the top selling vehicle in the United States for geeze, I don't know maybe 20 years? The country runs on F150s. Basically every carpenter, mason' electrician, air conditioning guy, roofer, machinist, construction worker, pipeline inspector, municipal parks employee, horse trainer, and so on, and so on.. Every one of these people drive an F150 everyday for work. then there are a whole bunch of people that drive F150s for fun. They use them to pull their boats, their camper trailers, their motorcycles,..
