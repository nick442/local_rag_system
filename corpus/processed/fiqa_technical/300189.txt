Triggered? Did i attack you personally insult you or saying anything that was a charged statement? I'm pretty certain i simply talked about the subject and what it means for consumers. If i insulted you or showed any degree of frustration I'm sorry. I'm not frustrated. Even though I believe you may be trolling, I'm not upset. I'm simply putting out correct information. I hope you understand the principle behind the business move. Take care.
