Please do not read this and think Taco Bell is healthy. Maybe compared to other places that are exceptionally bad for you. But it is not healthy. I am not saying never eat it. Who doesn't like Taco Bell every now and again? But please don't think eating there is healthy. No matter what you order its processed food that will never give you the macronutrients and benefits real food offers.
