Well lets see.. JP Morgan Chase, for example, has a market cap of $118 billion. The U.S. labor force is about 158 million people. So if every working american kicked in about 400 bucks, you'd have enough money to buy a a controlling stake in JPM. Goldman Sachs has a market cap of $44 billion. You could buy a controlling stake in Goldman if every working american threw in about 150 bucks. Of course you'd have to purchase the stock at a large premium if you're trying to gain a controlling stake.
