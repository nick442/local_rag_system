"Headline is false. The gas came from a cracked pipe; it did not permeate all the way up through the bedrock from the gas resevoir. Edit: Okay, I misread that. Let me try again. Methane leaked into the watertable in Dimock, Pennsylvania. That is known to be the result of a cracked pipe. So in that case, neither gas nor fracking fluid ""permeated through bedrock"" into the water table. Now, they found methane leaked into the watertable in Pavillion, Wyoming. THE CAUSE OF THIS IS UNKNOWN. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE GAS ""PERMEATED THROUGH BEDROCK"" INTO THE WATER TABLE. So, again, the headline is misleading. A fracking operator may have improperly contaminated the water table, but this is far different from the fracking process itself contaminating the water table."
