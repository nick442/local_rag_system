Well to be fair, I cashier at a whole foods right now (just finished college, still just taking it easy) and it has way more traffic than any other grocery or retail job I've had. They're not really that expensive, depending on what you buy, and plenty of people come in to shop. So while, as the other reply mentions, you may not be the demographic, there is some clear potential for Amazon to do well here.
