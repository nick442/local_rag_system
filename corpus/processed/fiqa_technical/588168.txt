What definition did they use for luxury goods? >The Deutsche Bank Research report defined luxuries as “goods or services consumed in greater proportions as a person’s income increases” That is completely meaningless. So lets look for a similar definition and see what we can find. [Here](https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2014-economic-commentaries/ec-201418-income-inequality-and-income-class-consumption-patterns.aspx) is a study that uses a similar definition. In their breakdown, they have 'luxury' goods as defined as owning a home, owning a car, using public transportation, and household operations. Those things do not seem very 'luxury' to me.
