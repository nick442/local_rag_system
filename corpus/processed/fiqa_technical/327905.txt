">The homeless should stand in lines, This would only artificially create LONGER lines, and LONGER wait times. >then sell their spot in line to others who need it. In order to give the ILLUSION of being able to ""jump"" to the front of the line. Basically you have recreated (yet another fraudulent) ""frontrunning"" system. *Granted that wouldn't apply to renewing a passport, but to just about everything else.* **Why not just HIRE someone to do your errands for you** *if you are so overflowing with extra cash? Heck you could then have your ""personal servant"" do a lot of other things for you as well -- iron your pants, draw your bath, wipe your arse, etc. A Jeeves for your Wooster.*"
