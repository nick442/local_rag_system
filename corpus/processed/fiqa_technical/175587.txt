I'm not asking for the world to owe a huge salary and benefits. I am asking for jobs to pay a wage and provide benefits that allows the people they use to make money to live without worrying about getting sick or making rent. I'm not saying everyone needs a salary that can play for a lexus and flat screen tv for being a cashier at walmart. Just enough to pay rent, food, bills, healthcare. Why in the world would you work at a place that doesn't pay you a living wage if you aren't getting something else out of it?
