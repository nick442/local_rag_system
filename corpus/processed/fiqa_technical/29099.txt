There is a severe problem with the economy now because people, banks, and governments have been taking on an unprecedented amount of debt relative to income. This isn't a matter of government debt to GDP, but [total debt to income](http://grandfather-economic-report.com/natdebt-vs-natincome.gif). People are still going to buy stuff, as you've said, but they are not going to be able to buy stuff in the same way as they have in the past. They maxxed out the credit cards while the interest rate was near 0%. Any increase in the prime rate instantly triggers a chain of defaults. So, yeah, the party is over.
