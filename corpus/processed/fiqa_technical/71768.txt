"Maybe it is a matter of how long a perspective you take. If you are focused on very close things, like only the coming quarterly results, then *anything* which did not maximize cash flow might seem suboptimal. But what if it strengthened the long term prospects of the business? What if it contributed to a planet that did not get destroyed, thereby maintaining a better business climate (pun intended) for the future. Clearly survival is preferable to a business than extinction. But we make short-term choices based on kind of old ways of looking at things. It's not ""profitable"", even though pursing short-term cash profit may lead to ruin."
