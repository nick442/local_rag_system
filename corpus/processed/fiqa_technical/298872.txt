"@MrChrister, Budgeting is really about planning your spending. Many programs and most advice will tell you that budgeting is tracking your expenses. That's only the first part. Track your expenses for about a month to figure out what you plan to spend in the future. Your budget is then just a list of things you're going to buy or pay for with the money you have at the moment. I recommend creating a budget every time you get some money, keeping an eye out for future expenses you may need to save for. The envelopes are for those expense that you are going to use cash for. The envelopes make you plan to spend a specific amount of money, the money you put in them and no more. Envelopes protect you from overspending. I use ""envelopes"", that is, paperclips or sticky notes or different sections of my wallet, to organize my cash. I use cash for things I'm going to buy in person: gasoline, groceries, eating out, the movies, home improvement stuff, buying birthday presents. These are my ""envelope"" expenses. I use one check a month to pay rent. I use my online banking to pay most of my bills automatically (like school loan and Netflix). And I use the actual websites of those companies who I want to pay manually (like utilities, b/c those change every month). Does that help?
