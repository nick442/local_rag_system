I don't think anything will change as long as you can buy a politician in this country. The get elected, fulfill the promises only to those that contributed to their campaign and then go out stumping to raise more money. There is no way you can win their loyalty unless you give them their required blood money. Unless you're a HUGE giver, you won't get what you want. One politician's vote won't do anyone any good so you have to sway several of them which requires even more money. The one good thing about Obama's presidency was that america got to see how big of a poser these politician's can be. They claim to be the exact opposite of the incumbent before them, then, regardless of whether they are a dem or rep., they continue with the exact (or worse) policies. Hopefully, the voters of this country wise up and realize it's not dems vs reps. it's haves vs have nots.
