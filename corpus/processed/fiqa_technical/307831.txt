*sigh* When is the last time you looked for a job? I've been employed literally non-stop since I was 15, usually with 2 or more employers, so I expect no government handout. But the job market is really *that bad.* I got lucky last year, in that one week out of college I found a job. Three days later I realized I hated it, so I started sending out resumes. I averaged 5 a week. Over the course of the next year, I received 5 replies and 2 interviews after sending out my resume **over 250 times**. The first reply took 6 months. I stayed at that same job, hating it every single day for a year, because I had no other option. I received one reply for a job that I was perfectly qualified for (I know because I interned at another office doing the exact thing) and they told me I wasn't qualified. What if I had been laid off during that time? Remember, it took 6 months before I even got a *reply*. I would have been screwed. **TL; DR: Living off of the government is not, by default, because you are lazy.**
