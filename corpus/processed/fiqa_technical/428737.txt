They aren't giving stuff away their resources for free. If they bail Europe they would get a massive boost in international clout and political power. He who controls the purse strings, controls the world. When you give aid to a country, that country is pretty much your bitch. I mean, look at the power the US has over all of Central and South America. Hell you can even look at Pakistan, the US kills civilians over there with drones, yet Pakistan doesn't dare stand up to the US since the US provides billions in aid to Pakistan. The US pays the bill for a large part of IMF, NATO, and the UN. And for those reasons, the UN/IMF/NATO is pretty much just a puppet of the US. If the US doesn't agree with something, none of those organizations will contradict the US. None of them can, the US foots the bill for most of their funding. A China that just sits on $3.1 trillion dollars has zero world influence. Money that sits in a bank has no power. But when China spends those trillions, and trades them for power and influence. That's when China will turn into a superpower.
