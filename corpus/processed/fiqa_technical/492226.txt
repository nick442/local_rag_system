The best way is to either file a dispute (or threaten to) with their regulator. They do NOT need negative attention from a bank regulator, so it should get their attention if you show that you are aware of and willing to contact them. They take this extremely seriously. You can figure out who the regulator is using this helpful page on the Office of Comptroller of Currency's (OCC) website. If the OCC itself regulates the bank you can file a dispute using this web page.
