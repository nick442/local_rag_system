Not exactly. My sewing needle example had nothing to do with population growth. Population growth offsets nothing. Unemployment percentages would go up as populations grow if there was a net loss in jobs. Instead unemployment goes up and down just like it always has. How did population growth offset farmers using tractors to get you more food? Africa also has seen explosive population growth without using nearly as many tractors as we use, how are they doing? The fact of the matter is, more things are being produced. This means more people are buying more things. Not that there are more people being born buying more things, but people have greater buying power because as more things hit the market their price goes down. What income class would you have to be in to buy a computer in 1985 compared to now? What was the capability of producing a computer between 1985 and now? Automation simply means- This is one area we no longer have to focus on, now we can focus on other areas. Also where are you getting that we are approaching unsustainable levels of population growth? Please look up Atlanta vs Barcelona year 2000. Look at the difference in population per hectare. How can you say we are quickly approaching that point?
