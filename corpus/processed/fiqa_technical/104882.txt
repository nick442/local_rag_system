So you understand the system is broken. Why do you think more of the same will fix the problem? The government is corruptable and is widely believed to be corrupted by their allies in corporations that they protect by giving special powers that allow them to avoid responsibility. These powers are not available for the average citizen. But are available to various government organizations and can be bestowed on whim to anyone they deem worthy. How is this an improvement? What do you in your own words think should be done to fix things? Are you a bot? Can you make words of your own or just links?
