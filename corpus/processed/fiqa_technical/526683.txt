Okay, first of all you have the make up to right into financial behavior field. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_finance I am not sure where to go for such a degree or the job prospects afterwords, but frankly 'they' say it will be something of great interest in the future. I am beginning to find in finance it is not so much what you can do, but WHERE you live. I'm not near any major city that has financial headquarters so I may end up moving just to pursue something that interests me.
