Don't ever believe you're not good at something in college. Trust me, do not decide to not take a certain class just because you weren't good at it in HS. Now why are they making you choose your major right off the bat as a freshman? A lot of people only got accepted into the business school sophomore/junior year. Who cares if you get to take intro to marketing earlier than everyone else. Most of the classes in your freshman year should be some gen eds and a whole lot of electives to help you choose your major may it be freakin philosophy or intro to computer analysis. I'm not gonna tell you to go do finance or CS because really, this is freakin AMERICA. You work hard, you'll get rewarded. Do what you love, I have too many friends who's doing what they don't love, just for the sake of makin some extra cash right after graduation. Just get that 4.0, be well presented, get drunk every other weekend and have fun in college. Since you're already thinking about all this, you're way ahead of your class, you'll do well bro.
