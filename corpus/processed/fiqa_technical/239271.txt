Big money, by vitue of its own existence, produces value. What's a person to do with it? Stuff it under a mattress and earn 0 yield? No. If you want safety, you'll put it in AAA rated US gov't bonds and help fund the government. If you want yield, you'll put it in broadly diversified equities investments, small companies, big companies, energy companies, tech companies, media companies, and so on, and soak up the net gain while injecting much needed capital investment directly into those industries, financing start up costs like construction and equipment procurement costs, as well as staffing costs. Yes, big money absolutely creates value. The trains, cars, roads, and sidewalks you travel through to get to work? All financed by filthy rich people money. The building you work in and the equipment you use? Likely financed by filthy rich people money as well. Its called financial intermediation and capital arbitrage, and you can thank your Gods you live in a country where the government allows it to operate efficiently.
