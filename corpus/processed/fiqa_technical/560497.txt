You're contributing 98.2% of your contributed amount (deducting 1.8%) each month and at the end of the year, deducting a flat 15 pounds. The easiest way to do this is to use a spreadsheet.

Is this a taxable account where you deduct (for example, 35%) of the growth annually for taxes or is this a non-taxable account?
