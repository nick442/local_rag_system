If I applied for a decent paying job and told them that I only want to work 3 days a week, they'd probably wouldn't hire me. Some people would be happier working less and foregoing a bit of pay. ~~Take a look at labor norms in Italy, seems to be working well for them.~~ Nevermind, the Italian economy isn't doing too great right now. I was basing that statement off a Micheal Moore documentary where people tend to work less and are happier.
