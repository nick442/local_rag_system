"> Consumers don't want a conversation with minimum wage employees who don't give a damn Correct. However, consumers *do* want to have a conversation with employees who do give a damn. Some of the happiest customers I've had are the ones that I get to talk to one-on-one about the shoes they are interested in. Whether the customer knows what they are looking for, or if they need help finding the right product, they always appreciate talking to an employee who can confidently explain which features make a shoe the right fit for them. If we don't have the right fit for the customer, we can actually try to find it online and purchase it right then and there for them. 99% of the responses to that are along the lines of ""Well I'd rather try it on first.."""
