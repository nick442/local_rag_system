I'd like to learn more about this study. The article says they surveyed 500 managers. This is theoretically a large enough sample to make inferences from, but I'd like to know: 1. Why a larger sample wasn't used 2. The distribution of different copmanies/industries these managers worked in 3. The geographical spread of these managers. My suspicion is that this study is actually heavily biased by the corporate culture of a small group of companies or geographic region. How do I know these managers didn't all come from a single corporation with a toxic work culture in a bigoted town?
