Hello all, Ive recently accepted a job at one of the big banks as a marketer. Ideally this role leads to becoming a financial advisor. I was wondering if there is anyone here has experience with that career path-starting as a marketer and becoming an FA- and if it was worth doing it over going to grad school or whatever other career interests you had. Also, what were your hours like when you first started? Ive heard horror stories about people coming in before 7 and staying after 7..
