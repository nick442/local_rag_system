It's not that simple. The problem is that Greece is not in control if it's own finances. Neither are any of the other countries. The Eurozone doesn't have the power to do things like raise taxes or sell government bonds, and the individual governments don't have the power to float the currency. The Eurozone is going to unwind over the a decade. Greece will leave, but there are another 4-5 countries that should leave the Euro for the same reasons as Greece. Spain seems likely to be the next up, with Italy not far behind. The Euro was never designed to break apart. We really have no idea what the shockwaves of a country leaving the currency will look like.
