#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; [**Double Irish Arrangement**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double%20Irish%20Arrangement): [](#sfw) --- >The __double Irish arrangement__ is a [tax avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance) strategy that [multinational corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation) use to lower their [corporate tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax) liability. The strategy uses payments between related entities in a corporate structure to shift income from a higher-tax country to a lower-tax country. It relies on the fact that [Irish tax law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland) does not include US [transfer pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_pricing) rules. Specifically, Ireland uses [territorial taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Taxation), and hence does not levy taxes on income booked at subsidiaries of Irish companies that are outside of the state. In the late 1980s, [Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.#Tax_practices) was among the pioneers in creating this tax structure. > --- ^Interesting: [^Double ^Irish ^arrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement) ^| [^Criticism ^of ^Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook) ^| [^Corporation ^tax ^in ^the ^Republic ^of ^Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_tax_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland) ^| [^Abbott ^Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories) ^| [^Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjzsh40) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjzsh40)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
