Oh so it's ok for MSM to have a play where Donald Trump is murdered. But if I say something to get a reaction out of you the conversation is over? How is that ok to have a play where the acting president is killed? Freedom of speech is ok until you break the law. To threaten or imply death of the president of the United States is a crime. Donald trump did not write the law. In fact Trump wasn't even alive when that law was written. China Russia United States. They need to eliminate the religious problem we have.
