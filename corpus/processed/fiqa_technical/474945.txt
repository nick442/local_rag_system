Welp, I've seen a dozen bands/artists I absolutely love go and change their act and style so severely that I couldn't stand what they were doing - I simply didn't like it. I understand why they needed to, gotta stay true to yourself. But oh man, what I'd give for another album of two from each of my favorite artists who no longer make stuff of the type I loved. Taylor Swift's fans are very lucky.
