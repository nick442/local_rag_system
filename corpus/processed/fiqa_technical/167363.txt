"I agree that real income growth has been flat twenty years, but you're wrong about Americans owning stocks. Anyone who has a pension is directly involved in ""gambling"" on the stock market. Check out /r/personalfinance -- there are lots of people who invest/save money, but don't earn a lot. There are options that are as cheap as $25/pay..It gives you a way to invest when you are young. I have paid into a mutual fund/etfs since 21..wish I had done it sooner!"
