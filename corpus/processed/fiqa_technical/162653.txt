The easiest way is almost definitely through a Canadian bank. They can get your American credit history through Equifax. American Express in Canada will have no problem giving you one if you have an American Express in the US, as well. It would be easier if you went through TD Canada Trust since there's TD Bank NA in the States, or BMO since they own Harris Bank in the States. Oh, and doesn't Bank of America have Canadian branches? I'm in the process of doing the reverse (getting US card when I'm from Canada). I use XE Trade to transfer money -- the rates are great and it takes only 2 days for a transfer to go through if you use wire transfers ($25 charge) or online bill payment through the bank (free).
