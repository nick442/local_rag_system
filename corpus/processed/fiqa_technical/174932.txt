"I think the idea is ""freedom of the press goes to the guy who owns the press"" In terms of false advertising, that applies to an outright lie ""our paint lasts forever"" and it doesn't. There are all kinds of laws and precedent which protects advertisers from their own lies. Look up ""puffery"" as an example. Judges figure you if you are stupid enough to believe, for example, any claim made regarding supplements, alternative medicine, ""natural foods"" and so on, well too bad for you. It sucks but thats the way it is. Even if, for some reason, preventing negative reviews were possible legally, they'd just use sock puppets to post positive ones. Look at many of the comments concerning products on Reddit. Can it be that so many people are passionate owners of Tesla that any discussion of its many failings are immediately shouted down? Well, there is the stupid factor, I guess."
