As a car guy, I would question the wisdom of putting in a new (read - usually reman) engine into an 8yo car. Unless the engine is known to have longevity issues, I'd try to find a good used one, say from a crashed car, and swap that in. The labor part is going to be roughly the same obviously but if the cost of the engine halves, you might still end up with cash in your pocket. This mainly works if the cost of the engine is substantially higher than the labour, if it's the other way round get a new/reman engine with a warranty.
