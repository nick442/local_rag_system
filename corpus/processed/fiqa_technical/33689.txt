"We just got a chick-fil-a competitor called [PDQ](http://www.eatpdq.com/index.php?id=2). The fast-food-ish restaurant doesn't have a freezer or a microwave, they bread their own chicken, and cut their own fries. I know this because the entire kitchen is completely open. The only thing I'm not certain about is the caloric / nutrient info for their menu. I've looked and haven't been able to find anything on it anywhere. McDonalds/Wendys/Burger King better wake up and smell the pseudo-bacon cooking too. Chains like in-n-out, five guys, and smash burger are dominating the mid-tier of burgers while cook-out is emerging as a serious threat to the lower tier. Cookout is exploding in the South East because their food is absolutely delicious and you can get a ""cookout tray"" with a burger, two sides, and a drink for about $5.50. The old giants of fast-food are in trouble and it's about damned time."
