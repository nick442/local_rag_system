"You're right. The tech ""community"" has a hard-on for the mythos of Startup Founder: Hero of the Long Hours. But, really, Marx must be rolling over in his grave right now, because as developers & designers, we *own* the means of production. They're in. our. heads. And yet we still volunteer to be used as tools for other people to get rich off of. This would be fine if, in exchange, those other people offered a cushy, secure life. But they almost never do. Because nerds want to be used. I agree with you there: technology has no point if not to make the world better and our lives easier. If you can make your employer $75k in a quarter, you already know how to deliver value. You just need to figure out what you need to switch around to do it for yourself instead."
