"We don't have a free market. Furthermore, without fail, every example in history that approaches a free market produces an environment entirely consumed by corruption and immorality. Humans, at the most basic level, are fundamentally incapable of sustaining a free market system that results in a generally ""good"" outcome for people. I heard a story in a documentary about the financial crisis (which was prior left void of any meaningful regulation), at it's worst, and in private, the banking CEO's told Henry Paulson that they needed to be regulated because they were incapable of keeping themselves in check. That only came out at the most critical moment of the worst financial shit in recent history. No banking CEO will ever come close to admit such a statement today now that ""things are OK again."" That's how things work in real life, all people are just children. And you want our *health care* to be handled by those children? In this analogy the government with their ""annoying"" regulations are like the adults.. but Trump - so never mind, now even the adults are idiots, so we're basically just fucked. Be careful what you ask for."
