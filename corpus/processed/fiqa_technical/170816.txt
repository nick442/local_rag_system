"This is perfect timing for a ""pre-Winter check"" type offer. Sure I read something about a similar campaign in The Wizard of Ads or a book like that. Essentially, a lot of people's plumbing goes bad in the winter when they start turning their heating on or their pipes are leaky, etc, so they can save money now by getting a pre-Winter check for $X. I can't flesh out the idea any further than that, not being in the industry, but it might inspire some ideas. Depending on the market, this sort of thing could even be turned into a story within the local media *especially* if a particularly bad cold snap is predicted or the like."
