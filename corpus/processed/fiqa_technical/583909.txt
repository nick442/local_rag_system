No, it won't go on the front page because it uses bullshit math and reveals a deep lack of understanding of how the numbers are calculated. The unemployment rate is calculated from the Current Population Survey as well as the participation rate. To add to the unemployment rate of one month/survey by calculating the participation rate from a different month/survey is very problematic. If you are looking to include those who have stopped looking for a job because of poor job prospects, you could try using the U5 unemployment estimate. The U5 number includes those who have recently stopped looking for a job. It only goes back a year for the respondents, but at least it is comparable because it is in the same month/survey. The author also states that the U6 unemployment estimate should be 20% without explaining why it can be calculated like that. I don't think the participation rate can be used to suggest that the U6 is higher than it is when the U6 already takes into account a large percent of those that have stopped looking for economic reasons.
