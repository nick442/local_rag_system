>Since gold in this very simple hypothetical system has absolutely no use other than a store of value, it is debt. But gold does have other uses. It is a metal that's used for jewelry, it has decorative value. Exchanging something for gold is like a caveman giving you a stone ax if you do some cave paintings for him. If all the civilization disappeared, gold would still have a value, different from bank notes. Gold is a convenient standard commodity for exchange for several reasons: it's indestructible, it's compact, it's easily recognizable. All the gold ever mined in the world would fit inside a typical five-story apartment building. Yet it doesn't burn, doesn't spoil, can be stored forever, different from apples or oranges. >these firms would be adjusting their capacity, and not sitting on trillions of dollars of currency that ought to be liquid. Here s where the difference between actual work that has been performed and a promise make a real difference. These companies are sitting on trillions of dollars of promises, not products. What they have is paper, shares, bonds, debentures, whatever. They are unable to transform those papers into products, because they lack the manufacturing capacity to do so. They do not have a million apples, they have a paper where the farmer said he would grow a million apples. Overall, the corporations in the US have invested heavily in acquisitions of other corporations, this trend has been going on for several decades now. These papers cannot be easily converted into anything useful. For the moment they are just there, with their nominal value that people agreed upon. It's not easy to turn that investment into production.
