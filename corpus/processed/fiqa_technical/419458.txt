Hey man ive beem to siem reap and angkor wat, womderful place to visit! The best thing you can do is give a price for the very first thing. Like 5 dollars anywhere in siem reap 20 bucks to go to angkor wat. Put prices on the side of your tuk tuk so you dont have to negotiate. Thats the biggest reason i didnt want rides because i didnt want to negotiate. Good luck dude
