It definitely does. Part of the misinformation the GMO PR puts out is that there's a difference without specifying they are both non-GMO. Organic is non-GMO. The difference is that organic goes a step further and removes synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, and growth hormones (which is a problem for meats and dairy) in addition to GMOs.
