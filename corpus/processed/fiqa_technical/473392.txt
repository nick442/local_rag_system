>And this is bad why? What is the total funding? What is the total return? Do you have the necessary facts to evaluate this? Yes, I have. The public picks up generally, about 75% of the total cost of a major sports complex and in the past 20 years, U.S. cities have spent upwards of $20bn on major venues alone. Not included are the hundreds of smaller venues such as arenas and ice hockey facilities that almost never produce the sorts of economic benefits promised. Some, such as the Meadowlands in New Jersey aren't even paid off before the next one is being built. And that's not including sizeable and ongoing tax breaks. Sports teams are pretty profitable organizations - why does the public have to foot the bill?
