Yeah those are similar numbers to the largest cities in the US. You can buy a house in or near a mid-sized US city for 100K but it would be a very basic house in good not great neighborhood. After the downturn, I bought 2 houses as investments. One I bought for 31,000 USD and after renovations I had 85,000 in it. Sold it for 115,000. The other I bought for $91,000. I still have that one. It rents for $1200/mo and is currently worth maybe $140,000 (3 Bedrooms, 1 full bath, 1 half bath, 1400 sq ft). It is a very safe area but Cincinnati city schools. FYI Cincinnati has a STEM academy that is one of the top public schools in the country but you have to test into that specific school. Those prices just blow me away. I make a very good living plus the investment income and I don't think I could even sort of make the payment on 1.4 million for a shack. Everyone can't be a trust fund baby or a Google millionaire. FYI(2) I joined a Bay Area internet startup back in the day and in the end it got bought up by an ERP company. My stock that I hoped to make millions on got me a $45,000 payday (so a lot better than nothing but in no way buying me a house in the Bay Area)
