If you can somehow get it into the hands of opinions leaders that would help. Could you use it in a cocktail and serve it to particular people in a club with UV lights? The cane sugar could be a double-edged sword, yes I don't want corn syrup but I don't want the calories either. If you can use something else that decreases the calories while not tasting like crap I think that would be great, since Redbull sugar free taste like shit.
