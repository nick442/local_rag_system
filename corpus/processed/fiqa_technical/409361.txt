Wow, that's interesting. So it's not just the debt load or the demands of the equity, the place isn't cash flow positive on an operating basis. I have been there and while it is gorgeous, it is far away from the main strip. You have to make a trip out of the way to get there. And the layout is a bit daunting and hard to follow. The casino just felt empty in certain parts and was easy to get lost in.
