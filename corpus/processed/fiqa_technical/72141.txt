> So: what do i do to have the monthly %change? I was thinking (last day of the mont CP - 1st day of the month OP)/ 1st day of the mont opening price. No, use the same day (usually month end) of each month (i.e. December 31 vs. January 31). Use closing prices only. Keep in mind, it may make more mathematical sense to use LN (natural logs) to determine %-change and standard deviation. The simplest way to compare the riskiness of each is just to compare St. Dev. You can, of course, go into more detail. If you want to impress your professor, look up the efficient frontier and make one for each portfolio.
