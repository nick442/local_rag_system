">""Engineers cant even reliably get a robot to recognize an object like a chair."" My first thought in response to your statement was that you were wrong, but then I started thinking about the very wide variety of what we consider to be a chair and I realized that thats actually quite true, especially if you include modernist or upholstered chairs in the set of chairs . However, I think thats a bad example, because not being able to do that particular task reliably and rapidly for another five years or so without spending a huge amount of money isn't going to save any particular jobs that I know of. Because we're not at the stage yet where we need to solve those particular kinds of problems. The kinds of machine vision problems that are impacting jobs are much more mundane and much easier to solve. For example, distinguishing between kinds of fruit, produce, etc. in a grocery, or determining visually if fruit is ripe, etc, in various agricultural applications."
