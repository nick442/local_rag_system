Interesting, I know a fair few doctors and lawyers (heck my fiance is a doctor) and it's not that common to earn more than $300k at 30 years old. Maybe it's more common at 50+? I know for doctors it's all dependent on your specialty, for example it's pretty common for surgeons to earn more than $300k but not so much for specialists in other fields such as palliative care or general practitioners. Then again I don't live in America so maybe it's different there.
