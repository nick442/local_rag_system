The type of day trading you have described is a form of gambling. As with any type of gambling, sometimes you win. Doesn't mean you are good at it or will win next time. As long as you clearly understand that you are doing it for fun, I think your current strategy is fine. If bankruptcy is on the table, you need to stop now.
