Every couple years they have these polls. They're total Bullshit because they're not even sanctioned by Congress. The Island HAS voted on becoming a state and independent before, but it has always stays the same--A Free Associated US Territory. Until Congress AND the House make legislature AND THEN actually approve it, THEN a poll like this across the island would make more sense. Even if all that happens tho, it could be vetoed. Right now this is simply like having a really expensive Twitter poll.
