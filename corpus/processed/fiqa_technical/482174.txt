For computers it is just a matter of making it faster and generally simply increasing it's capacity. For a 3D printer it is a matter of giving it the capacity to produce these things at all. I'd be extremely impressed the moment a 3D printer could put out a forging let alone a multi-part functional assembly with various materials. People back in the 50s were really damn sure we'd all be using flying cars and living on the moon by now.
