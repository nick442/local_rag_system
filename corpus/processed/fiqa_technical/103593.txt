"Yeah..I was a libertarian until they said they want to end the Federal Reserve. I'm more of a conservative. Your point (that a minimum wage at a major metropolitan area is often not a ""livable"" wage) is irrelevant. Wages are a fee given to employees for their work. The way an employee earns a high wage is by providing value that is greater than that wage. If the value an employee brings to an employer is less than the wage he's paid, an employer will lay off that individual because the employee *costs* the employer money. Therefore, setting a minimum wage simply means you ban certain individuals (usually first time workers or otherwise unskilled) from the workforce because they currently do not have the skills and/or experience to justify that wage. Furthermore, the higher you set the minimum wage, the more people you deprive of jobs."
