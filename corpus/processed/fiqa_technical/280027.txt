Sorry about the link. I guess it didn't upload with the post like I thought it did. I've since edited it and added it. I think it makes some really good points. Could it be that your client decided that they just couldn't afford you, and that was just the excuse they were giving? (I'm not saying they had good reason). Nothing turns me off quicker than someone offering me a discount, especially if I'm not already a customer! I just wish that worked on my wife..lol I admit that it isn't easy to constantly come up with good content on a regular basis that offers something worthwhile that people regularly become engaged in. In today's world people consume content very quickly and then are left wanting more. Keeping it fresh is no easy task, but the way most seem to go about it is just spinning wheels and wasting time.
