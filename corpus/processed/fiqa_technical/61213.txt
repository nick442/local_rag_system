Funny, cause from where I'm at, it's rare for a brick and mortar to beat Amazon's prices. Best buy, RC willey, Walmart, Target, etc, none compare to the service, price, convenience, that I can get from Amazon. Take for example last month. I purchased 2 chromecasts in 2 weeks, then they dropped the price from 35 to 30, I got on the chat, in 5 minutes I had a refund of 5$ on both them. They not only price match others, but they stand behind what they sell much much better then any brick and mortar I've been in.
