I work there and eat a meal there, sometimes two, five or six days a week. I'm still not tired of it. I haven't gained any weight from it yet either because I treat it like a normal meal and don't eat a full burrito, chips and guac every day. Nevertheless I love cooking the food there and am rather proud I'm serving up quality stuff.
