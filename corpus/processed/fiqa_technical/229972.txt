there's something to be said tailoring advertising directly to me. even though I consider myself an anticonsumer, truth is I spend a shit of money buying stuff. I'll never buy one of big ass trucks advertised during football, but I do watch football and yes I could be convinced to buy a Volt. In fact I'd feel better about the world if I saw Volt commercials. thinking the world is full of red neck good old boys (no offense) leaves me feeling alienated by the end of a game. quit wasting money and customize my experience for me.
