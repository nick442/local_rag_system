I do not think the CFA is enough to land you a job. From what I have read, most well respected institutions demand someone to either be an experienced hire or currently doing their undergrad/MBA. Searching WSO is the best way to get good answers for these kinds of questions as I am only an undergrad and my experience is mostly in economic research.
