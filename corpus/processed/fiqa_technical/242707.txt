when weed growing is decriminalized, i will not pay eighty dollars for a small sack of it, because now i will be able to go over to my friend billys house and he will give me a large sack of it for five bucks, which he now does anyways, but he only does this for his very good friends, cuz he doesnt want to go to prison and lose him home and his family and he tells me that he would rather live in his house rather than living in prison, lol. the value of weed will drop thru the floor when i can grow it and not risk losing my freedom and my family and all of my assets, not to mention the criminal record that would prevent me from ever living a productive life ever again. if i said that no person would pay for weed, that is not really what i meant to say.. i meant to say that there will be a lot of weed floating around and you wont need to pay $250.00 per ounce for it, but instead you will probably get an ounce of decent weed for $30.00 funny story, when i was in california there was a weed club that i used to go to, and they were at risk to lose their license to sell weed, and the country bumpkins that worked there put a sign up that basically said this: DONT MAKE US QUIT SELLING WEED, LOL. CUZ WE DONT REALLY LIKE SELLING CRACK, BUT IF WE CANT SELL WEED, WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO SELLING CRACK. i am not kidding, they put this sign up where all of the customers could see it. i almost peed on myself when i read it.
