Every single expensive book you buy - make sure you relist on eBay, Half.com, local craigslist, university boards, whatever .. the second after your final exam for that class. I figured that out when I went back to grad school, and the impact to my wallet was substantially less than undergrad (scaled for the number of classes). I ended up only being unable to sell maybe 2 or 3 books out of a dozen or so. And out of like $1000 on books, recovered probably $800.
