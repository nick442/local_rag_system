Well that is not entirely accurate, but the sentiment is true. If Jeff himself liquidated the stock it would cause concern because he is the driving force at Amazon. But whether or not the stock price is driven up or down is more about where demand meets supply rather than simply supply. For example, almost every time a company buys out a public corporation they pay a premium for the exact opposite effect you're talking about, though it's the same logic. If you are wanted to sell 40% of a company you owned you would likely do it this way. If Jeff announced he was retiring and had good leadership set into place after him and THEN created a buyout of his 40% he would likely get 30-50% more than the stock is currently worth. So there are a lot of factors.
