"Good. Although I could see their case for having opt-in location sharing to ""help them improve their service"" as knowing where potential customers are located would enable them to know where more cars are needed during certain times *before* bookings start to come in. eg. if they see thousands of their app users are at a sports game or concert they might send cars to the location in advance to get faster turnaronud times on bookings that will likely come in once people start to leave the venue. But yeah, this should 100% be an opt-in and should be completely anonymised. --- But yeah, personally I'd never enable it, however I can see the case for why it might make the service better."
