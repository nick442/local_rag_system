"There is no universal answer here. Some card issuers will. Some that will close the account will warn you first. For my ""sock drawer"" cards I'll try to take each out semi-annually to make a single transaction, then put it back in the drawer. I've heard you should charge something quarterly, I've never had one closed with semi-annual charges."
