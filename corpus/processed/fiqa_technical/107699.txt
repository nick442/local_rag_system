What if you felt you were cheated by the bank? What if you had something terrible unexpected happen to you financially? Also a loan is not a promise. A loan is a contract. The contract has outs for all parties. I never understood why people felt a loan was a promise. Many people were sold home mortgages that they did not understand. Of course it is their fault for not understanding what they were getting into.
