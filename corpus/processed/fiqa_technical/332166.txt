"Seriously. Listen to everyone responding to you. What part of this is asking for advice? ""If any you want to come visit Siem Reap, Angor Wat temple please help me a job."" He's literally asking people on this sub to hire him. That's like the definition of advertising. He asking people to use his services and pay him. He's not asking for advice. Not sure why you aren't deleting this post. It's super unfair that you'd allow this guy to get so much free advertising exposure, but not others."
