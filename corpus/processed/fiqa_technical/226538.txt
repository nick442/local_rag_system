"It's too much work. Same with insurance. ""Shopping for insurance is a hassle"" Why the fuck is this the normal, hopefully not but people I talk to, attitude? If people can fuck with you and make a lot of money they will. People just don't care and it's very strange. Then again it doesn't affect me. These scammers aren't getting a dollar out of me."
