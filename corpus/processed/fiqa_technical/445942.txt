The low payroll does help. Keep that in mind next time you see someone working at walmart, especially if you see they're doing a pretty good job. They aren't getting paid a whole lot to do it. Also it's interesting to note that I didn't know a single one of us who didn't put a very large portion of our paychecks back into the store. Walmart has it pretty good with their associates.. associates just don't always get a fair shake. Part time gets health insurance after a year tho.. and it's not too expensive.. doesn't cover a whole lot but it will get you into the doc and 4 dollar scrips from the pharmacy don't hurt either.
