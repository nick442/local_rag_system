"Your conclusion there is very wrong. Labeling laws are never designed to intentionally mislead. Yes, sometimes they fail, and can often be abused, but generally speaking the majority of our labeling laws are pretty good. There are plenty of issues, but it's an extremely complex thing, and there are bound to be issues. Most at least have a reasonable justification. Though not all. See also ""natural"" versus ""artificial,"" which is a crock of shit."
