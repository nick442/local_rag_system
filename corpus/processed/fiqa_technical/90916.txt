As my business partner likes to say, *don't bark at a barking dog*, it's just not worth it. The unfortunate thing about finance is people who *know what something is* thinks that's the same as *knowing something*. It's become pretty absurd at this point with everyone I've interacted with in the industry over the years. And everyone all too defensive of whatever it is they think they know. Tesla does not earn an accounting profit. Absent any adjustments, they are negative cash flow as well. But it's one of those rare cases where adjustments absolutely have to be made - as they are material. The business relies heavily on outside capital but a lot of it is the result of growth/capex decisions, as opposed to ones made for survival. We don't have the same set of books that capital providers get from Tesla - the ones that show you what you're looking for in this argument - but I can assure they do clear a net positive cash at this time in their history, before their aggressive expansion plans are put into effect. We have a cool facebook community that I help run. 2,000 people or so. Used to get into the weeds on stuff like this, but lately they've all been infected by crypto. I sort of just sit on the sidelines now. That is your true job security - your competition getting attracted to shiny things.
