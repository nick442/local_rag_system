I cannot explain how the derivative is created in specific, because I have never actually built one. However, [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mitts.asp#axzz1wwZTADu5) suggests to me that the concept is quite simple. They are selling a synthetic protective put. An individual could quite easily remake the payout structure of these securities - 1. Buy the share or index in which you are interested 2. Buy a put option on the same asset with a strike price as your purchase price 3. If you are interested in the target-term aspect, you ought to buy European puts. American options will be more expensive, but give you more flexibility to sell your share. 4. At the maturity of your option, if the share is below the price you paid you can exercise your option and still have your principal. If it is above, leave your option alone and sell your share for profit.
