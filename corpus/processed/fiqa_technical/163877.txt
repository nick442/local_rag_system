I don't feel a thing, my livelihood is hurting from the type of greed displayed by the asshole I was replying too. You don't have to give a fuck, this country doesn't have to get better, inequality can drive us to third world standards, it's fine. I'm sure you're going to be voting to re-elect Trump. Don't bother replying to me.
