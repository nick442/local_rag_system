You can invest for yourself, be your own boss, make your own hours. My boyfriend and I both trade for our personal income, and we work from home and have these as our only jobs. he chooses to work longer hours and devote more time to it, because he values money over free time more than I do. If you consciously choose what you value most (the ratio of work time to free time), you can make it your goal to secure a job which follows your values. If you let your job dictate your hours/values for you (for example, accepting a position somewhere because it will make you a lot of money, but it will leave you with little free time) you may be unhappy if that's not what you want. I think people have a lot more control over their happiness and work hours than they give themselves credit for. Good luck in your path!
