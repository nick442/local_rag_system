That's like saying the Dollar is untrustworthy because Madoff used it in his scam, or that the Dollar is a criminal enterprise because US cash is the number one currency of the black market. If you believe those arguments as well, then I grant your criticism, but otherwise you'd be inconsistent. Personally I don't think it makes sense to blame the money in any of these situations. Money's just a fundamental tool for all economic activity, good or bad, and in all of these cases, I'd argue the money did exactly what it's supposed to do. Seems a lot more reasonable to blame the individuals involved.
