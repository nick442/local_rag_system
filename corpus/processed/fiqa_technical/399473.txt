see, anyone who isn't heavy finance which truthfully is a good 80% of the business, will be fine with the transition. My issue is how to support the remaining 20% of advanced Excel users to attempt to find other (hopefully better) ways to view and change the same data. We've had these talks several times over with the technology transformation team and the main takeaway is: - most users misuse Excel as a work-around tool to address messy data/reports, so for these processes they want us to determine if the data could come out clean and could run the desired analytics on the data straight out of the source, then would there be a need for Excel? For some models like Monte Carlo, etc, I believe those ones are going to have exceptions. But do you think it is understandable and feasible to attempt to remove all the misuses of Excel and instead work towards a better way to accomplish the same goal? Because I do find that a good amount of spreadsheet work is sometimes just cleaning up the report/data output before the real Excel magic happens.
