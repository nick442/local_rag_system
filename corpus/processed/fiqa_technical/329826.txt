"> (1) You put MBA behind your name? Lol who the fuck does that. Literally every person on their resume. There's this thing called LinkedIn too.. you should check it out. Go see for yourself. > (3) Generally they work for 3-5 years and then go back for their MBA. Some go part time while working full-time (which is what I did). Yeah, like I said, this USED to be the trend probably when you went through school. Things are changing and employers are looking for more education even for entry level jobs. > (4) You claimed that there are no jobs without an MBA now - I proved your very wrong in 3 minutes - these are shitty companies either. No, you didn't. I never claimed that. Plus, you proved there are entry level jobs that don't require it. My point / advice isn't so he's marketable for a 1st job, it's so that he can get a promotion faster than the competition, or at all. Every job that's a finance manager requires an MBA or has it as highly preferable. You're taking a hugely ""dickish"" tone here guy, and I never said shit to you about your lack of understanding of the business world - WTF is with the tone? It seems like you've got a chip on your shoulder, and all I'm trying to do is tell this kid he'd be better prepared getting an MBA right away. You think this is a win/lose sort of thing.. but let me ask you this - tell me WHY he shouldn't get one right away. If you actually want to WIN this, then prove that. Go!"
