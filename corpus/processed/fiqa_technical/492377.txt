They're mostly shitty service sector jobs who are unwilling to pay wages that match the local CPI. Just look a job page for New York City as an example. There are thousands upon thousands of open jobs, but most of them pay way too little for somebody to actually live in NYC with those wages. I live in New Jersey and that is pretty much the case here too. Anecdotally, it seems that every restaurant or food place has a hiring sign up, but they're only paying $9.00/hour. And that is SHIT in a state where a *cheap* studio apartment is $1,200 a month. So it seems that the main reason there are so many job openings is because they are not willing to pay a wage so that people can actually afford to live around where that job is.
