"Apparently, only in America do people understand the difference between positive and negative rights. A negative right requires others to abstain from interfering with your actions. These are ""natural"" rights, such as freedom of speech, religion, freedom from unreasonable search and seizures, etc. The Constitution is full of negative rights that are ""endowed by the Creator,"" i.e the government does not grant them to you, but rather, the government cannot strip them from you because you already have them. Positive rights require others to provide you with either a good or service, such as healthcare. These rights always require government coercion, such as forced taxation, to implement. They also don't exist without that government coercion. These rights are granted by government (and can be taken away by government as well). Americans are much more supportive of negative rights. True freedom means freedom from government coercion. Thus, calls for healthcare as a ""right"" are rejected by huge numbers of Americans. Healthcare is not a right in the same sense that freedom of speech is, because it is not a negative right."
