Part of the problem with electric cars is also that they won't allow small commuter vehicles on the roads in most states. We have a gap between motorcycles and highway capable cars. Vehicles that are too big to be a motorcycle, but too small to pass crash testing that's needed for a highway vehicle. The exact size car that you would want for an inner city commute, is illegal or regulated out of usefulness in most states.
