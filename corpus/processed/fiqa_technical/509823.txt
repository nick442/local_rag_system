Not sure how this is a clear case of Quid pro Qou. In the U.S., the majority of oil production actually benefits greatly from higher prices due to the fact that it uses fracturing technology which is higher cost. The fact that Qatar is increasing oil hurts the United States much more than it hurts the Saudi's. Their cost of production is significantly lower than ours.
