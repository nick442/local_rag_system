This is based on evidence over the past 35 years which coincides with the largest technology revolution in human history. Those automated jobs were going away even if minimum wage was cut. Our business community is enamored of technology solutions that enrich them in the short term and to hell with the law no term. To keep telling the public this then prevents people demanding a livable wage in fear of no job at all. It keeps working class people complacent with the abuses in their work environment, such as forbidding legal breaks, not paying overtime that is due, last minute schedule changes, unpaid 24 on call status and less than 8 hours between shifts. Fear is the most powerful mute button in the world. Long term, profits will begin to slide slowly as we are seeing in retail right now. It will be blamed on Internet shopping, millennials are minimalists or student loan payments. This doesn't explain deceased shopping by other age groups, but shhh, not suppose to notice. As more and more people are left in poverty or near poverty by lack of wage increases, the number of customers fall. When it hits the middle class and they stop shopping so much, our economy will be in a persistent recession. Layoffs to reduce expenses leads to fewer customers for products leads to decreased profits leads to layoffs.. Automation will, of course, reduce the expenses in the short term, but will also eliminate the market. All the white collar workers that think they are immune will be shocked when it hits their industry, but it only makes sense in myopic business circles to eliminate higher wages workers, too. Sometimes technology is the problem, not the solution. I expect to be banned for saying so.
