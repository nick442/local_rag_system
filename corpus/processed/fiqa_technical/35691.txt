"Anyone who needs to DEMAND respect.. hasn't *earned* it, and probably won't get it. What he'll get instead is lip-service & ass-kissing.. stuff that *appears* to be ""respect"" but really isn't. But, at the same time, you can't really ""be friends"" with employees.. they're *not* their to be your ""friends"" (nor are they ""like-family"") -- that doesn't mean you cannot be ""friendly"" (i.e. civil & courteous, even -- to a degree -- empathetic & understanding) -- but there is a difference between being ""friendly"" and trying to make people into your ""friends"" (i.e. drinking buddies, etc). So how do you EARN respect? Start by being respectful -- give credit where it is due (and make sure you KNOW where it is actually *due* -- don't just give credit to the ass-kissers & self-promoters). Likewise, you can ""ASS-U-ME Authoritay"" --- or you can ""take on a role of RESPONSIBILITY & ACCOUNTABILITY"" -- there is a world of difference between those two as well. Of course -- within a ""family"" business -- you're going to have difficulties doing all of those things *unless* the current management has already established a ""culture"" that facilitates it. Given your father's mixed statements (and the general tendency of ""family"" owned businesses -- and the fact that you are being promoted to a managerial role *primarily* because you ARE a member of the family) -- well, that seems somewhat unlikely."
