Ok go ahead and make a site like this and see how it does. Realistically nobody wants to sacrifice their own internet browsing speeds to remove a couple of skippable & blockable ads. It'd be great if gigabit fiber was available nationwide, but it isn't even close. 30% of households still have DSL. Your tech solution relies on building blocks that don't exist, and compromises that people don't want to make. Changing stuff over to P2P would require a massive infrastructure investment alongside with a rethinking of common web development principles. Before you go trying to reinvent the wheel, learn what pi is. The ad-based model works. The subscription-based model also works. Many sites are switching to a combination of the two. Servers allow for centralized updating of your content. The only broken thing is that ads aren't perfectly targeted to individual users, which is changing. If you don't want to see any ads, pay the website a subscription.
