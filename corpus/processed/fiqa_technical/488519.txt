Get really good at Excel. Make it a goal to have it become a specialty of yours. Practice the basics, learn to create models, read books on it, watch videos etc. As far as publications, just try and get to the usual suspects on a daily basis. WSJ, Economist, CNN Money, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, etc.
