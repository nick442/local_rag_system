That's a really good idea, though in most cases like this the template letter is sufficient: Someone with legal expertise drafts a template letter with the proviso that this letter will probably have the desired effect under a specific set of circumstances. If this set of circumstances apply to you, then you can print this letter out and send it.. Legally, a properly worded denial by an individual is no different than the same denial written by a lawyer, so unless someone has actually began litigation there's rarely a necessity to seek legal advice. And in most cases firing off a denial (or a fuck-off letter) is more legally advantageous than silence, so it might not even be worth it..
