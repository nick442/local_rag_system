> Mr. Anthony quit last February, upset that Express had given him an annual raise of just 25 cents an hour. He now works at a Zara apparel store on Fifth Avenue, which, he said, gives him 30 hours a week and does more to accommodate his scheduling needs. So, instead of bitching and moaning, he went and found a better job. What a radical concept. If you allow yourself to be used, you only have yourself to blame.
