"Using cash instead of a debit card lets you see in real time how much cash you have left and where it's going. It's a lot ""harder"" to see the cash disappear from your wallet than it is to swipe the plastic (whether it's a debit or credit card). Using cash is a way to keep the funds in check and to keep spending within a budget (i.e. you can't spend it if you don't physically have the cash anymore)."
