It's always been that way. You are trying to bend the world around your own circumstances. That's not how it works. Everything is consolidating to be more efficient. With digital, robots, and globalization, markets have reduced the need for U.S. manufacturing ..and that's what a lot of small towns had going for them. It's gone. Sitting around and wishing for the past to come back with something like the government to legislate it is wishful thinking. I highlighted the solution: It's to move where the money is or is going. People get cranky when they have to give up a skill or trade (or hometown) they've spent 10, 20, 30 years in. I get it. I'm looking for ways to diversify my experience, even having a job in tech, because someday maybe it won't be here.. or it'll be in India, China, Russia, the Philippines, Latin America, Bulgaria or any of the numerous countries where the labor is cheaper and the supply is higher. It sucks, but it's also reality. If your hope is in voting for some sort of legislative change, godspeed but it won't help. Regulations will be issued and companies will push money to safe havens in Ireland, Liechtenstein, the Caymans, etc. to avoid them. They'll outsource more and layoff to compensate for the new expenses and generally find workarounds. Add that to the rise of countries already benefiting from outsourcing and globalization.. maybe the US market isn't so important in 20-30 years. Gives the government even less leverage on corporations.
