I don't think BPS or Cabela's need to have many locations. Around my area they're ~~their~~ a destination shopping experience. People will drive 2 or 3 hours just to go look around and eat at the attached restaurant, even though they likely have an Academy in their home town with a Twin Peaks / Hooters right next to it.
