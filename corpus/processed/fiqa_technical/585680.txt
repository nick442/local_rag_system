I work in corporate finance at a large bank. Here's my opinion. I'd say learn SQL, Tableau, and OBIEE first in that order. I do know Java but have never personally used it at work. I know some people that do and Java is usually the language of choice for banks. It's really good to know but it's rare that a company would expect an accounting or finance person to use it. But almost every team in corporate finance will use at least one of the other three. Most finance / accounting people don't take the time to learn these. So most teams have one or two hot shots that do most of the work. Also, you can learn those three easily over the summer if not sooner. They aren't very difficult. Java is more complicated so maybe take your time learning that after the other ones.
