The S.E.C. is just a training camp for financial consultants hired by CEOs of multinational firms. Remember how many people were sent to jail after the financial collapse and the housing bubble? That's about how many you can expect to go to jail this time, too. The worst that will happen is minor fines dwarfed by the amount of money made in any illegal activity that may have occurred. It isn't so much that government has any real problem with white-collar financial crime per se; they just want to make sure they get a cut.
