Word from a designer I know: many garments produced by American Apparel at the end of Mr. Charney's reign were overpriced; poorly sewn (often with un-hemmed un-finished edges); sometimes little more than a piece of stretch fabric fashioned into a tube or a large rectangle; inconsistently sized and fit to the customer. Also: the advertisements and commercials featured hyper-sexualized, semi-nude models who were often regular employees. It seemed to be an innovative way to run such a business but doing that sort of thing in LA is quite possibly the wrong model nowadays. A year or two back, the LA Times ran a story about some LA clothing manufacturers leaving the city and relocating to El Paso, TX: http://www.latimes.com/business/la-me-korean-jobber-market-20150902-story.html
