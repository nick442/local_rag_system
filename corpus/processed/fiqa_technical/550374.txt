It really depends on the client though. A large listed company that suddenly changes from a Big 4 auditor to a much smaller one is quite suspect. Sure some Big 4 partners can just sign off with their eyes closed but if something goes wrong, I can guarantee you that the other partners would be more than happy to kick them out. Auditors generally aren't reluctant to give an unqualified opinion. It's just that when they do, it normally means that the client is so far gone it's not worth dealing with them anymore. If your client refuses to change his accounts and you worry he will drag you and your multi million dollar business down, thats when the unqualified opinion comes in.
