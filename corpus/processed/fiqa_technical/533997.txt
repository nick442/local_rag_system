Yeah. If you set sales goals on an AI such that it cannot reach them legitimately, there are no morals holding it back. IANAL, but iirc dodging culpability is one of the main reasons YouTube uses pure blackbox AI to do its DRM / brand management stuff. This is why, seriously, I think we need to get moral philosophers involved in AI projects, so we can embed some ethics at the core.
