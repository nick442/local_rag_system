"Jeez - you want me to come over and read the articles to you as well? >Ghana operates the National Health Insurance Scheme to provide citizens with health insurance. The level of premiums citizens must pay varies according to their level of income. Most medical facilities are run directly by the Ministry of Health or Ghana Health Service.[8] >Rwanda operates a system of universal health insurance through the Ministry of Health called Mutuelle de SantÃ© (Mutual Health), a system of community-based insurance where people pay premiums based on their income level into local health insurance funds, with the wealthiest paying the highest premiums and required to cover a small percentage of their medical expenses, while those at the lowest income levels are exempt from paying premiums and can still utilize the services of their local health fund. In 2012, this system insured all but 4% of the population.[11] >Israel has a system of universal healthcare as set out by the 1995 National Health Insurance Law. The state is responsible for providing health services to all residents of the country, who can register with one of the four national health service funds. To be eligible, a citizen must pay a health insurance tax. Now if you want to be nitpicky about whether income-based taxes levied on an individual for nation-wide healthcare counts as ""requiring a person to purchase insurance"" you can - but I think we both know that level of semantics is reserved for people who've said something stupid and now have to retreat into word games."
