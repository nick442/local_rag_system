I think im most excited about Simple. If someone can come along and can provide all my financial needs in terms of real time info on my accounts and spending ability, forcasts for spending, and adjusts all that in real time, i'm freaking sold. While i'm not a crazy spender, something like that is great for people. I'm going to play around with Codecademy for sure though.
