">Boss: Amazon is threatening to shut us down because we ship too many orders late. How do we fix this? >Me: Ship every order on time. >Boss: No, I meant, ""How do we fix this with software?"" I've noticed they have fixed this with software. They pretend they have shipped it way before they do. Also amazon has fixed the problem they had with amazon prime customers ordering too many things with free shipping. They have made more and more things ""amazon marketplace"" so you have to pay $4 or $5 shipping. Sometimes even things ""fullfilled by amazon"" will be in the used page for books and won't be free shippings. More and more things don't have free shipping for Amazon prime members."
