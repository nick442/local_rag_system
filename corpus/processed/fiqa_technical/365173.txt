Yes, you did. Scroll up. Your defense as to why you aren't racist, despite saying overly racist things, was that you have black friends. Your defense right now is that you have black, brown, and yellow friends. It's like you don't take inventory of the last stupid thing you said when moving on to the current stupid thing you want to say. Again, how long are you going to try to convince me that your ignorant racist point of view is correct before you either take a look in the mirror, or shut the fuck up and move on with your ignorant racist life?
