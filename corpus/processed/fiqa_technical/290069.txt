If both cards have the same interest rate, there's likely no practical difference here. Very likely, the required minimum payment is calculated the same on both cards. Pay off one card and put the rest on the other, or split the payment across both cards. My personal preference would be to entirely pay off one card and put the rest on the other. It feels like a bigger accomplishment. If one card has a significantly different interest rate, obviously you'd try to pay that one down first. Alternatively, if you owe less on one card, you may choose to pay that off and then cut up the card, if you are trying to recover from a poor financial situation. This way, you have achieved a specific goal. But again, in your case, it sounds like your two cards are entirely interchangeable. Either way you do it, well done on putting your money where it'll make the most difference right now.
