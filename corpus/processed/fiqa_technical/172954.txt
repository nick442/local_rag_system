I am still waiting for the investor lawsuit against Lampert for breaching his fiduicary duty by prioritizing his hedge fund over Sears. He is looting Sears piecemeal and assigning the assets to the hedge fund. How is this anything but a breach of his legal duty? I would not be surprised if this is approaching illegal levels of looting, and not just civil damages.
