"I am assuming that there is some arbitrary law preventing ordinary people from investing.. because I have never seen a guaranteed 6% ROI YOY in my entire life. Talk about the 1% of the 1%.. lucky bastards! Banks are puplicly traded corporations.. what's stopping an investment company from creating a ""fake"" bank that takes investments from regular people and invests those into the federal reserve? Returning 5.99% per year to their shareholders?"
