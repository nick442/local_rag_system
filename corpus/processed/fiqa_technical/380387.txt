People are downvoting you, but the reality is that a cushion isn't a bad idea. Not a perpetual thing, but until the OP gets set up with a job place to live etc. They know the job is going to work out etc., they might want to have some cash, as they are likely not going to forgo eating etc.. that said I would treat it as money to be used in place of a credit card (with the high rates) etc.. Again I am not saying spend the money, I am being realistic, that it takes money to secure an apt, and unless you can borrow cheaper than 6% elsewhere (I know I could probably get unsecured money cheaper than that where I live, but I don't know the OPs situation). I wouldn't invest it given the situation personally. If you have a great job, it won't matter, you will build up past 1200 soon and can then start to invest a portion of that cash. If you don't, then you shouldn't be risking debt money, especially if your level of sophistication in the market has you here asking the question. That 6% savings is tax free as well, so you need to gross it up based on your tax situation. Also make note of any currency conversions that would need to happen, so depending on what you want to invest in, currency risk could be a real concern as well. One other reason I think getting down at least a portion of the debt could be good is simplification. Can't spend money you don't view yourself as having. Some people might be more disciplined to reign in spending when they see a lower number in their account. I'm personally not one of those people, but again, I would likely kill the debt off now just to have one less thing on my mind.. but only as soon as I am stable (know where I am going to live, have enough to eat, and relatively sure that will continue in the future..)
