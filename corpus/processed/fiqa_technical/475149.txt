>It's a marginal cost that is passed on to their customers. No, it's not. The bank can't just jack up prices when they've got competitors, after all. >The costs of which will be passed on to customers. Again, if the bank has even one competitor who didn't suffer as much or any damage, customers aren't just going to suck it up. >Image is EVERYTHING - it's the only thing that supports the existing murderous regime. I'm not remotely an anarchist, but this statement just sounds fucking foolish. *Brute force* supports the existing regime. That's basically it. You had people marching peacefully in the streets, in their thousands, for an end to this regime, and the regime arrested and evicted the lot. Oh, and spied on them too.
