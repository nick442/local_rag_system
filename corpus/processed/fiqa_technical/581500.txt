Agree. The key word is 'standards'. Every seller is going to encounter a crazy buyer once in a while and should be prepared for a ridiculous return now and then. On the whole, people buy things because they wanted to buy the thing, they aren't going to return it just because. If the sellers want to cut down on returns, make sure there are good photos, accurate descriptions and quality control. If a buyer has been unreasonable, blacklist that person. I did that to a client 40 years ago. took forever to talk my boss into letting me do it, but it saved us thousands of dollars of year.
