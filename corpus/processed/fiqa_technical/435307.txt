I wonder this myself. If an economic apocalypse actually came to pass, owning a bunch of gold bars - or shares in gold bars held somewhere else - isn't going to help you eat, or keep you from freezing to death. The most valuable goods will be those with some utility - food, water, clothing, medicine, ammunition. I think the financiers and their pornographers at WSJ forget that their entire world - and everything of value, power, and consequence within it - will cease to exist if the power goes out.
