My cringe worthy writing was because you thought I didn't know what I was talking about then I had to let you know since I guess you thought you knew the truth. I know I'm right I'm pretty sure a lot of people know what I know and they are successful during this generation just like myself. You can keep asking question about what I say but the only answer you will get is a thank you from me because the more you ask dumb questions the more my portfolio looks that much good because you don't know anything and probably make dumb investments.
