I find this state hard to believe. We have been adding about 200k jobs a month for a while now. in the last 12 months that means about 2.4 million new jobs. Amazon has 113,500 of those that means there was 2.3 million other jobs. for them to have outdone 46 states that means 2.2 M of those would have to be in 4 states alone.
