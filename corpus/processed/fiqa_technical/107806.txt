"A few comments here: 1) a degree from an Ivy League school is the most common ""golden ticket"" to an IB job. Ever wonder why kids with psychology degrees are working at GS or JPM investment banking? 2) short of an Ivy League degree, good (not even great) grades are a standard (think 3.3 GPA and above) and network like crazy. 3) have an uncle who works in IB (obviously you have a huge advantage here) and get an internship at his firm. 4) understand what entry level IB entails. Expect long hours (think 7am - 1am), dull work (putting together power point decks, running comp tables, formatting excel sheets), and high pay. 5) understand number 4."
