"> Israeli control of America's economy, the Fed the Treasury Sure! You make me, a Jew and Israeli, so elated that somehow Jews and Israel, less than 2% of USA population, 0.01% of world population control the USA, the Media and the Banks. What else do we control? > The Palestinians, can't even get water and medical supplies Go ahead and show me one article or picture of ""Palestinians"" dying of thirst or untreated diseases. In the real world, obesity among the Arabs in Gaza and WB is far worst than in Israel. Want to read about it? > As America's economy fails and Military power wanes What an American patriot you are. You know so much! So I am sure you can refute what I previously wrote to you: >>Back to ""Palestine"", a short real true and verifiable historical summary: There was never ever a country or nation of ""Palestine"". The only reason we hear about ""Palestine"" and ""Palestinians"" today is because in 1967 Israel liberated the local Arabs from a 1948 occupation(!!!) by Egypt and Jordan of land given to them by the UN, for which Israel agreed to. If the 1967 events never happened, you would not hear today about ""Palestine"" and ""Palestinians"". True or false? >>So, Israel never wanted to be a ""Greater Israel"" to rule over millions of additional Arabs as part of its democracy or ""occupation"" - more Arabs than Jews!! Israel is not that dumb. True or false? >> The blockade is actually by Egypt and Israel. Check the map! Egypt has a lllllooooonnngggg border with Gaza. True or false? >> The local Arabs can have a ""Palestine"" for themselves already in 1948 (if they agreed to the UN partition plan) or 1967 after they were liberated by Israel. Israel has only one condition, in 1948 and in 1967, for a ""Palestine"": that ""Palestine"" needs to be a nice neighbor to Israel. They don't want to be nice, so no ""Palestine"" until they grow up. True or false?"
