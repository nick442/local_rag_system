"The money for unemployment insurance was taken out of their paychecks, so why shouldn't they get the payments? Most unemployment insurance money goes right back into the economy anyway, so this ""pocketed"" conclusion is more of a weasel word argument than anything else.

One projection put the cost of this at $2 million a year, so it isn't even really significant compared to the rest of the Federal budget."
