"So? In the past, if you did not know, only 2% of the population had bachelor degrees. You know very well that, unless you physically drop from high school, you will graduate, even if you can barely read, write or answer ""if you drive 70 MPH, how long does it take to drive 70 miles?"" And as a former professor in the university, I was told I can't fail students even if they are complete illiterate idiots. 33% (one in three!) of the population having [worthless] Bachelor degrees and going into debt because of that is terrible! It's not realistic. They lowered the requirement to finish high school and bachelor degree so much that those degrees became worthless."
