"Here are the risks involved with student loans: So - what happens if you decide (or are forced) not to finish school (50% of students don't)? You have no degree to boost income, but still have the debt. What happens when you graduate and want to use that saved cash buy a house, car, etc., and treat the student loans as a monthly bill? The next thing you know you're loan-poor and are struggling to make your monthly payments just like most other ""normal"" people. You aren't going to earn significant interest on your cash while you're in college (and it will not outpace inflation), and there's significant risk of your college savings losing money if they're not in risk-free investments, so it would NOT be wise to take out student loans when you have the means to cash-flow it. Also, student loans generally charge a roughly 1% fee, so that actually negates the interest you earn in your savings account. Plus you already have money in a 529 plan that is meant for college expenses (and cannot be used to pay student loans) - use that money for what it's for."
