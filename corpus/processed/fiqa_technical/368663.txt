"> What does it even mean for something ""to come out of IT's budget?"" From the IT managers perspective he has a budget of X dollars to allocate. When X dollars are spent that's it, he isn't allowed to spend any more. If unforeseen expenses are incurred (e.g. the computers for the new hires) and deducted from his budget that leaves a deficit that has to account for, usually by dropping something else he had previously though urgent enough to spend money on. How this is represented in the books is of no interest to the IT manager. His world view is limited to “I had X dollars, now I only have X-Y dollars.”"
