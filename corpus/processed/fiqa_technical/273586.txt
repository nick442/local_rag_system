I believe he thinks that it cannot be racist if it is the truth, when in reality it's not true. I think that a large part of the reason white people were successful in the United States was because of the massive wealth of resources. His comparison to Zimbabwe makes no sense because it is a completely different physical climate with different resources. But of course he pins it on skin color, because it's easy for him to do in his mind. It's really upsetting to know there's still a lot of people like this; I also don't know how they can continue lying to themselves, with evidence of successful people from all races and cultures. Obviously the massive wealth in the UAE is due to the fact that they're brown, not because of the oil /s.
