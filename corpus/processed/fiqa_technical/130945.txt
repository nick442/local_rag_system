I had a friend who worked for a temp company as a dental hygienist and when she left after a year or longer she ended up taking them court because they wanted her to wait like 6 months before working in any office she worked for under contract. While I can kind of understand the companies point of view, it would've been career ending for her since as a temp she worked at pretty much every dental office in the area. She ended up winning in court and they had to change their contracts to only be 30 days rather than 6 months.
