"Fwiw, I don't actually put much credit in the laffer curve, but just like to point out that the argument that it justifies tax cuts is predicated on being above the peak rather than below. I'll also point out that the biggest expansions of the US economy happened under a top marginal rate of 90%. That rate was basically only on income higher than what 99.9% make. Of course explaining marginal tax rates to most people fails. If you say ""were lowering rates but adding more brackets at the top end. (90, 99, 99.9, 99.99 %ile, for instance). Or even doing something like ""lowering tax rates, but all personal income is taxed the same"" and possibly ""dividends are taxed at the income tax rate of the individual, but are deductible from the corporate income""."
