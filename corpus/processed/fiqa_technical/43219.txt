"I mean, it's only a difference of an order of magnitude, really. Until you consider the following: 1) Only a fraction of the $800B Muni bonds market is new issue. 2) True spreads on Muni bonds are hard enough to calculate as is because they're all OTC. 3)The author quotes that the particular bid was for an 87K/year return on a notional of $300M. That's a spread of a whopping 3 basis points that the bank took extra over ""true value"". 4) Intraday vol for almost any financial instrument is more than 3 basis points. 5) So that's what he's making this big deal over? THREE basis points? I don't even know the length of my penis to within three basis points, and I challenge you to find anyone who could name the yield on the 10Y Treasury within 3 basis points."
