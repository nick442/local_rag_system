"Anyone can sue you. Whether or not they would win the lawsuit is what matters, and to win there would have to be measurable damages. How much money could the seller possibly have lost due to this in just a few days? IMHO the most you'd realistically be out is your earnest money. BTW, your realtor gets paid only if you purchase a home, so in this case your realtor may not have your best interests in mind if the choices are: ""buy this house"" or ""don't buy anything"". Definitely talk to an attorney, and then consider notifying the seller ASAP."
