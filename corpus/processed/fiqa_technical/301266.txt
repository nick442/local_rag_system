I don't do this at all, but it's the internet, so hey, why not? According to the IRS, penalties and fines are only non-deductible when they are paid for actual violations of laws/regulations. So what crushedbyadwarf said is probably correct. The penalty/fine reduces their income, and they become entitled to a refund on the tax they paid on that income. It's still a questionable tax treatment of the penalty/fine.
