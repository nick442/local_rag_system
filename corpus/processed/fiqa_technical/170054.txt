Hypothetical Question: What happens if the state can't make pension obligations anymore? Credit rating would go down, pensioneers (current and future) would have to take a cut and some taxes would increase or legislation would change that makes it impossible to enact pension holidays. Probably a combination of the above. What else would happen?
