I'm not sure the reasoning still holds though. If you default on your student loan, your diploma doesn't get repossessed. There's a signifiant moral hazard associated with student loans. A mortgage on the other hand is around a very physical item. Though I can still banks lobbying for better rules, that would be hugely in the consumers disadvantage.
