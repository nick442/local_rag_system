I wouldn't want to have a house no matter where I live. So I am more than OK with always living in an apartment. We live in a really nice place right now. My husband is pretty up-to-date on how the country is running and he would be telling me if he were at all concerned about the state of things. Which he isn't.. at least not anymore than when I first met him. So, while I am sure that I will always be middle class.. I am OK with that. And perhaps Americans do earn 20% more than Germans but they also pay a lot more for things that Germans do not pay as much for. Edit: Also, my husband's grandfather was one of the leading historians in germany until he died in 2009. His grandparents were very well off. His parents were poor while he grew up. My husband is on his way to being a partner in an expanding business (he does programming) and his brother is a Pharmacist. By this time in a year or so from now the amount of money my husband earns will double.
