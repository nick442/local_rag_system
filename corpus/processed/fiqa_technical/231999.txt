"This comment is too long to put in comments. Sorry. I suggest you also do a dry run of your taxes with the rental as part of it. When you rent a house, you take depreciation each year. This means that even if you are breaking even, the rent paying the mortgage, property tax, etc, you may still show a ""tax loss."" In which case, planning and knowing this, might suggest you adjust your withholding so instead of a large refund, you get better cash flow each month. Also, pull a copy of Schedule E and the Instructions. You'll be wiser for having read them. Last. If you have decent equity in the existing house, it may pay to refinance to save a bit there, or even pull some cash out. When you buy the new one, you want to be in the best position you can be, and not risk cutting it too close."
