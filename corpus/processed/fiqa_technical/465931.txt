"It's like you're talking about a different article. I wonder if you read it at all. He doesn't talk about discrimination and he doesn't suggest discriminating against top schools at all. What he says is simple: > Don't hire someone on the basis of his or her educational institution. [..] Instead, hire on the basis of class rank, even if--no, especially if--the person is not from one of the more prestigious institutions. This should be completely clear and I have no idea how you got the impression that he's trying to prove that ""Harvard kids are dumb"". Might I ask which school you personally went to?"
