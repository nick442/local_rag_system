Previously, AirBnBs counted as hotels, which meant that you had to get a hotel license and other stuff that was too onerous for one guy with an apartment to bother with. So it's not that they specifically banned AirBnB, it's just that the previous law regulated big hotels and small hotels the same way. IIRC, AirBnB has run into similar legal issues in the states.
