I find that most of the people who make this case either are threatened by Bitcoin's success (Jamie Dimon one of the banking cartel heads) and / or they don't own any Bitcoin. Based on the concerted effort to tarnish Bitcoin's rep by various actors simultaniously, I also wonder if the big money just wants to drive down the price a bit in order to get in at a lower price point. All in all I suspect the short term setbacks for Bitcoin, which it always bounces back from rather quickly, are helpful in terms of some check on too fast a lift off for the platform. Which crypto currencies will best retain and increase in value seems to be a much more accurate question than IF crypto currencies will retain value. One thing I am nearly certain of is that when another global economic crash looms, crypto, which can't be inflated and isn't controlled by any central bank, will probably skyrocket in value. But time will tell I suppose.
