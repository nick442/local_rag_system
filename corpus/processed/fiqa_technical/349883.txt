Hay for cattle? That seems strange - why are you not doing ensilage? It has a lot better nutritionary stats and is easier to make since it doesn't require the raw material to be as dry as hay. Where do you live? Here we have roughly 9 months of not enough grass growth so not collecting feed for the livestock is not an option.
