"And at this point the term becomes relative, rather than absolute. You are only able to ""claim"" territory you are able to defend, for there is no large, objective body that guarantees your ownership of this territory. If you are unable to defend your territory, you lose it. You will either be killed or driven out, and now YOU are the ""trespasser"" should you return. You envision a dystopia. Good luck."
