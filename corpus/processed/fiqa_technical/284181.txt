Touch ID follows the same exact model that Apple has always used to be successful. Take an important feature that few people will appreciate or use, purely due to their laziness; distill it down to a simple enough common denominator so that everyone feels they can use it in spite of their laziness. Some people like complex features and customizability, others prefer streamlined features and simplicity. Just because *you don't* care doesn't mean *noone* cares.
