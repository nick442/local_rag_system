Again, that is NOT YOUR BUSINESS. I never have given out such info and I never will. You calling me a coward will not change that. Please move on from the topic. I have not read the Koran, but if you'd like to go down that path, there's some pretty gnarly shit in the Bible. Maybe you shouldn't open that can of worms if you're not trying to look dumb in this argument. I really am tired of you and your ignorance. Do you have anything of value to say, or just more racist ramblings of a lunatic?
