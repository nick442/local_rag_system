Yeah, not to disparage solar, but solar. It's not a good idea to have government pick winners and losers. Without government picking oil decades ago we'd probably have solar already, without subsidies. Without government picking automobiles (via government built interstate highways) we'd probably have a robust high speed passenger rail system.
