To put it simply interest is the fee you get for loaning money to the bank / government / company / person or whomever you lend it to. A dividend is the money that a company pays out to its owners. For some cooperatives (may or may not apply to your credit union) you become an owner through using it, such that they'll pay you a dividend instead of or as well as interest. Which could explain them using the term interchangeably .
