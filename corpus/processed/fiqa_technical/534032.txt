[What's wrong with utilizing family for financial stability?](http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/03/real_estate/multi-generation-households/index.htm) It's a common practice that goes on throughout the world. When you're financially distressed, utilizing family is one of the best ways to save money. It's not about sucking off the rest of your family, it's about pooling resources in a strategic manner. It can cost a ton for an elderly parent to live on their own, especially if they're only on social security income. Moving in with family allows her to care for children and save on housing - Win/Win scenario. Children are delaying leaving their homes until they are older, especially with the rise in college and healthcare. Parents can still charge them some sort of rent and the kids keep affordable housing. Preparing a meal for 5+ people generally is more affordable on a per-person basis as well, compared to making individual meals. When it comes to creating a plan to save money, nobody should look down upon living with family.
