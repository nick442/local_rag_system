"I will give it to you straight; in the end it's about the money. Tourists don't ride tuk tuk anymore because online they read that tuk tuk overcharge and it is better to take a taxi with meter. So, if I was a tourist and you want me to use your service, what I would need from you is the understanding that I will not be paying more money than a taxi. You have a couple of ways of doing this: 1. Install a meter in your tuk tuk. Put a sign on the side of your tuk tuk saying ""This tuk tuk uses a taximeter"". 2. If you do not have the option for a taximeter you need to advertise your free prices. Put a sign on the side of your tuk tuk displaying your prices showing that you do not overcharge. 3. Advertise your services on TripAdvisor, different forums, etc. Good luck!"
