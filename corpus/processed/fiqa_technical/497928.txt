As others have pointed out, they do in fact exist. But it may be worth pointing out a possible reason that they are not as popular as commodities futures. If I want exposure to the oil market (for example,) buying oil futures has a big advantage over buying oil. Namely, I don't actually need to store the oil; I can roll over my position rather than taking delivery. On the other hand, buying single stock futures does not have such a compelling advantage over buying the stock itself, so most people would simply do the latter. (Although stock futures might provide some other advantages in some very specialized situations.)
