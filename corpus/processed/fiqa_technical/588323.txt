Insurance companies don't do natural disasters. If a significant number of people had flood insurance in Houston, the insurance companies would go bankrupt handling the claims. They just aren't structured to cover a situation where a large number of policies are likely to have claims at the same time. That's why when insurance coverage for a large scale disaster is available at all, it usually comes from a government agency.
