It's a persistent myth that the US has any trouble whatsoever selling its debt. No country with it's own fiat currency has trouble selling debt. Of course there is a limit to it and that limit comes in the form of inflation via currency weakness. The dollar is, in fact, still near historic highs even though it has come down some recently. I would not be the slightest bit concerned until the DXY is down in the 70s.
