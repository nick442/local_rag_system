Stay out of accounting. Accounting (despite what accountants think) will become highly automated. So too will many aspects of finance. Deloitte and KPMG have both partnered with software firms to create artificially intelligent audits. A good career would be a job you enjoy that deals with unique situations (projects). These are less likely to get automated.
