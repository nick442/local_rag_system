Cab companies in my city have actually adapted and provide many of the benefits that Uber used to claim as their own: ordering on an app (#1 advantage in my opinion), lower prices (20% discount since Uber came to town), tracking of your cab on an app. Still lots of room to grow, but I like that Uber has forced them to adapt a bit at least. I still try to use cabs when possible because Uber is, in general, a piece of shit company.
