"I simply wrote my bank an email and said, ""I want to handle my own escrow"". They said, ""fine"" and even let me set up a third account called ""escrow"" (savings and checking being the other two) that I just transfer money into whenever I want. But, I don't actually know what their requirements are for doing that. I have a ton of equity in the house, and I never missed a payment, AND I have direct deposit at that institution. So, it can be done."
