There's an unwritten rule among IPO underwriters that they will not go below a 7% underwriting fee. They act like an oligopoly, artificially keeping the price high to avoid losing future underwriting revenue. Additionally, the most famous example of a reverse auction IPO was Google's. Despite a lot of concerns leading up to the IPO, it was priced rather high and did very well following the IPO.
