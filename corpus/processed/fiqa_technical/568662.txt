"Dear OWS - when you march on Washington next month, please demand that all these bankers be arrested, tried in court and then executed. This is BS, how are they able to get away with this - these guys literally destroyed our economy and yet we have people who sold a bag of weed sitting in jail. Come on Obama, you said you were going to ""Change"" things - this is one thing that will get support from everybody!"
