It absolutely is. I too was offered a job with a major tech company in the area, and the 6 figure salary after cost of living was equivalent to ~60k elsewhere. The cost of things like travel and house hold items will remain the same, but housing makes up the vast majority of expenses most people have to pay every month. When housing in the Bay Area is 3x higher than everywhere else, the the overall cost of living is around 2x as high. There is a reason it's not uncommon for engineers all making 6 figures living 5 to a house. That doesn't really happen elsewhere.
