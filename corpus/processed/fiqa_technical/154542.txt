>Can't be that much more sustainable, isn't China also building ghost cities at break neck speeds here? Most ghost cities fill up eventually. There are some major fuckups, but that's always been the case with urbanization, and China still has a shitton of peasants tied to the land its trying to slowly get into the cities. Cf many other urbanization processes which resulted in huge numbers of people living in hastily built structures unsuitable for human health, and then dying in a fire / plague.
