"I think there is an important distinction between ""Republican Lawmakers"" and ""Republican Voters"". There's no way Paul Ryan, Trump, Cheney etc. don't know the underlying economics..but they also know which side their bread is buttered on. So long as they can sell the continued funneling of wealth in to the hands of the very few as an ""economic policy"" designed to ""encourage growth from the top"", then Republican Voters will continue to be victimized (along with Democratic voters, children, kittens, basically everyone) as the ultra wealthy ""invest"" billions of dollars in campaign contributions to elect men unethical enough to sell it."
