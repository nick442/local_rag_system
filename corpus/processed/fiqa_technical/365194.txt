"In *[United States vs. O'Hagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._O%27Hagan)* the Supreme Court established the precedent of interpreting SEC rule 10(b) using the ""misappropriation theory"". The theory establishes that: > misappropriating confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of that information, gives rise to a duty to disclose or abstain. You're correct that from a legal perspective the rules are anything but clear outside of company insiders. However, your own admission is consistent with what anyone in the securities industry knows is true - if you trade on material non-public information, you risk being charged. I think most would conclude that it's unethical irrespective of the letter of the law. It damages the integrity and functioning of markets. Furthermore, if the law was clarified, I think it's highly unlikely it would state ""trading on material non-public information is permissible for anyone who is not a company insider"". Instead, I would expect it to be consistent with ""Trading on material non-public information is illegal. If in doubt, abstain."" And this is exactly what the government officials should be doing - abstaining."
