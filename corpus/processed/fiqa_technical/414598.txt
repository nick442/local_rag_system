I agree with what you said regarding not wanting to put the work in to get it. When I was coming out of school and deciding whether or not to pursue my CPA (I went into industry (Private Accounting), not Public Accounting) my manager told me this. What would you think of someone who went to law school and didn't take the bar? Seems ridiculous doesn't it? Well the same, kind of, can be applied to the CPA/CA - if you have a degree in accounting.. why not take the CPA exam?
