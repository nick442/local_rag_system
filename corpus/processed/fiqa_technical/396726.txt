> Wu no longer competes actively. Instead, he has found his niche educating others on how to play and being a web personality at tournaments. I actually think it's a sensible move for someone to get out of finance if they hate it and pursue a passion while they're in their early 20s. Chances are you won't strike it rich, but maybe it leads to something else, as it has for Wu. In the worst case he can go back to an office job with some good stories.
