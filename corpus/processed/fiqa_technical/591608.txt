"Give the type of books I usually read (science fiction) I don't care about the loss of ""independent"" book stores or the big box book stores. Some of the best books I read are by small time authors that probably don't have time to shop their books around or tried and can't get their works published by a big name. Instead they can sell their books on Amazon for a few bucks. They get some money, I get something to read, and Amazon gets a cut for bringing us together. It is fucking fantastic. If Amazon starts to screw either the reader or the author too much we simply move our business elsewhere. As a bonus I don't end up with piles of novels that nobody wants."
