I think you're a little out of touch with reality if you think being poor today is as simple as buying groceries instead of eating out or renting a room for the completely arbitrary sums you came up with in your example. And I'm not trying to stand on a soapbox and preach how I came from nothing like you and here I am today. I do just fine. Have never wanted for anything growing up, was never hungry, always had presents. Now I'm 32 and I drive a forklift for Fed ex, I make about 45 grand a year in the Midwest with no degree, which is pretty decent. But no, you're wrong to think that everyone can just plan their lives and live below their means and then suddenly they'll all be doing much better. You're probably also of the opinion having a smart phone and internet access is the first thing a poor person should cut off to save money.
