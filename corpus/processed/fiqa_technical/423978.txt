> There are plenty of people that consistently beat the market. If the market were truly efficient, then everyone should just passively invest, which would make the market inefficient, leading to active investment. Passive investing a.) Doesn't mark the market *less* efficient, I don't know how you came to that conclusion. b.) There is not a big group of people who consistently beat the markets. There's a tiny, *tiny* sliver of a fraction of a portion of a group of people that beat the market over any ten year period, which is *consistent* with pure randomness. You're statistically likely to say those kinds of anomalies. In fact, it'd be stranger if we *didn't*. c.) The markets aren't *truly* efficient. They can't. There's imperfect information. The point is the potential exploits cannot 1.) be exploited on scale, because that creates market efficiency, and cannot 2.) be public, because that also creates efficiency. As more and more exploits are found, we're eliminating all these black swans. If you compare all 400 professionally managed mutual funds, only 2 have ever beaten the market, and by less than 50 basis points. That's 0.5%. That's not even consistent with randomness, that's worse than random. It goes to show how few and far between any potential exploits exist. It's simply not worth your time as an investor, because if giant firms employing hundreds cannot find them, a handful of people won't be able to find them by anything other than chance. It's almost always better to passively invest. You can read more about this, because while intuitively you may feel active investment can be better, the numbers don't lie and I promise you you're very wrong.
