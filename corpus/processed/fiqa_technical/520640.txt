"not sure how you could be more wrong. my favorite part by far was the fedora worthy ""nonsense, and unworthy of further comment."" definitely followed by a little tip, wasn't it? you've missed every single point i bought up. i'm not acting like investors are fat cats - you're borderline illiterate, and spend too much time on r/libertarian or watching fox news, so you jumped at the opportunity to straw man ""a dang pretentious librul."" what i said was ""relatively elite,"" exactly because i'm not saying they're cigar chomping pigs- they have a lot of money relative to most of the population. i simply don't care enough to try to go point by point. my whole point was that the comment i was replying to represents the style of mainstream economics that misrepresents basic phenomena, and your reply was just a doubling down. ""they are rational"" - lol literally choke on your MLP figurine. you've no idea what you're talking about. your other posts indicate a greater ignorance - you don't know how to watch the vix, or why your options move the way they do? really shocking /s"
