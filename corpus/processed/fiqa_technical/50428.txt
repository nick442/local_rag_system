Even though the person you're responding to actually said paternity leave, I'll respond to the benefit that maternity leave provides to employers: Businesses with a paid maternity leave policy benefit in 2 ways. 1) Companies that pay for a maternity leave period (as opposed to allowing the time off but requiring it be unpaid) have hire retention - which means that the woman is more likely to come back than become a stay at home mom. 2) Companies with good maternity leave policies get the pick of the litter in hiring women. So while they're perhaps having to hire men they feel are in the top 20th percentile, with women, they're able to hire top ten percentile.
