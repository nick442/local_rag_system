Well, the same stats would probably apply to any minority or racial group. Would it be safe to say that White Males are the best CEOs because 100% of top 10 companies in the world have white males as CEO? Oh & yes - Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, is Gay. Can we then say Gays make for the best CEOs ? Correlation does not imply causation. This is how ALL racial/sexist stereotypes and prejudices are perpetuated. This is wrong.
