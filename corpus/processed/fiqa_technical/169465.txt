"I'm actually quite impressed by lucky people. Being lucky is a difficult skill to master. Steve Jobs was lucky that he met Steve Wozniak. Larry Page was lucky that nobody came up with Google before he did. Bill Gates was lucky that IBM called at the time they did. They all would have been successful without these lucky breaks. They'd have had other ""lucky"" breaks. Maybe not *as* successful, but they have the skill of spotting the opportunity and seizing it. The luck is the difference between being a billionaire and a multimillionaire."
