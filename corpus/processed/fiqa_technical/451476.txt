I think people are worried that this woman is going to become the sole scapegoat for the whole fiasco and the rest of the Equifax leadership is going to walk away scot-free. The CEO won't face any penalties for selling his shares after the incident, the board won't be held to task for waiting six weeks to reveal the hack, and any legislation that could prevent such incidents from occurring again will be nipped in the bud.
