We use the PC financial credit card. We switched to PC banking about 8 years ago and have been extremely happy with them. You get points for using their banking services and if you use their credit card you earn points. You can use the points earned for free groceries or purchasing anything at No Frills, Independant and Loblawas Superstores. With the points we've earned over the years through just our regular banking, we've purchased a 6 piece patio set, patio swing, tons of free groceries and currently have $500 worth of points that we're using to purchase food and gifts for the Christmas season. You can find out the particulars on their points program throught their webiste at www.pcfinancial.ca
