This is the first I've heard about manufacturing downturn. The article shows wages up in other sectors and the BSE is stronger than ever. Recent changes (currency + GST) are painful, but they seem necessary and beneficial in the long run. I'm still long. Edit: GDP is down to 5.7% from 7.9% for the same quarter last year.
