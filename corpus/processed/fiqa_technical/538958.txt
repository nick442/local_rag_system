"The fact that women and elderly people work is actually bad for the economy: when half the population wasn't competing for labor, wages were higher. This isn't a gender thing, men could stay home-- it'd be cheaper than daycare, kids won't grow up institutionalized, could improve a house or raise livestock or something more productive than vacuous employment, etc. You had to pay ""family men"" more than some guy with a kid across the country. By entering into labor competition, women drove down wages and fucked up a generation emotionally distant children."
