In addition to the other comments there are things like training costs. Lower paid employees tend to turn over more quickly so instead of training one employee for 4 weeks and staying for 3 years you spend 12 weeks over that same time period as the minimum wage employees each only stay for a year. Also, you aren't necessarily scheduling all three people at the same time, it might be 3 part time workers at $12 an hour covering one role vs. one full time $20 employee working 40 hours a week.
