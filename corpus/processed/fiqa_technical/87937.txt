Apple did this with the Newton. They had one fairly good model for sale when they announced a much better colour (which was new) model coming up with way better specs. This basically ended Newton sales, which were required to fund and justify development of the announced Newton. Not that the Newton was a certain success, it was that this move certainly doomed it.
