Depending on the organization, this sounds like a failure to manage expectations on your part. Just because someone has VP in their title doesn't mean you have to drop everything and answer them. Especially if it is a non-urgent question. If this is the case, then you need to go have a talk with their boss about the detriment to the company this person is causing. It works both ways. Unless it's the owner or the CEO, I have pushed back and managed the expectation on just about everyone I have interacted with. It won't always work, but most times, it does. It does depend on the organization.
