US government budget is $3.8tn. Trump tax cut amounts to $200bn pa. That's 5% of the total budget. So even if all of the tax cut was paid for by firing people, which it won't because a good chunk will be paid for with bond issuance, you would have nowhere near 4 million redundancies. So I'm going to venture on a limb here and say that you just pulled these numbers out of your ass.
