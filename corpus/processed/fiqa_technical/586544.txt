"Are you sure you're actually talking about real people and not shills? It's pretty common to attribute nonsense to an entire group of people based on one shared perspective. Consider each post as an individual and not part of the group and this fallacy disappears. ""I don't put insecticides on my garden because inoculations cause autism"" doesn't mean insecticides are non-toxic or only idiots care about the quality of their produce."
