There's a big difference between the 2 scenarios. Apple doesn't have any liability of one of their devices is used for criminal purposes, and that wasn't even the situation. Apple was asked to unlock a phone so the FBI could look for potential information. DB however has a legal and ethical obligation to prevent it's services being used for money laundering and other criminal behavior. This included internal controls and audits on customer activity. The House Democrats asked if these controls were performed on Trump's accounts, and what the outcome of their audit was. A request that is well within the House's scope. If Republicans signed on to the inquiry the House could subpoena the information and it would carry the force of law. The only way this would be remotely analogous to the Apple scenario is if Apple was legally required to routinely read your emails to make sure you weren't a terrorist, and the FBI requested an accounting of whether that particular terrorist's emails had been read. If Apple had denied a request like that, it's unlikely that PR would have been so favorable to them. edit: and it was the San Bernadino shooter's phone
