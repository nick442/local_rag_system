Yup. SAP and Oracle are customized to each individual company with little to no overlap. Being experienced in one companies SAP setup does not guarantee that one would be familiar with another companies set up. Adding to that, Companies complaints about having people graduate without the skills they need is a load of bullshit. Instead of complaining should have partnered with the schools to make sure that students were learning and gaining experience in the things they actually need.
