Depends. What are the options available for the 401k? If they are low expense ratio options, that can be a great start. Otherwise, just do your own tax deductible IRA At 40, with no retirement savings other than one 401k, you're likely behind. Its time to get serious; no reason you can't with that income. Look into an IRA at Vanguard to start for up to 5500 a year per person if the 401(k) is no good.
