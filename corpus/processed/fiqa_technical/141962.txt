As someone who spent the first 20 years of their life living in and around the city (with family working in multiple casinos) I wonder how many of the people commenting here actually have a grasp of what's going on in Atlantic City. While not totally off, the generalizations and explanations from several people who appear to have never set foot in the state -- much less the city -- do not come close to covering what has gone on in Atlantic City for decades.
