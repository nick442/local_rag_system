Are you serious? I used to get the occasional cold call at the last place I worked at. You can just smell them and I got them off the phone ASAP. I think cold calls are *incredibly* fucking rude and I hate people who make them. My advice is to find another way to make sales. If you are an intrusive asshole who wastes my time you will get absolutely nothing from me. And I am not the only one who feels that way. A cold call is like going up to a complete stranger, smacking them in the face and then asking them to buy something from you. It just doesn't work very well.
