"The future of the internet is Ad-free. Ad blockers are increasing in usage every day and there is _nothing_ that anyone can do to stop that. Companies like Facebook and Google who make most of their money selling advertising are shitting themselves over this. Facebook is _THE ONLY_ profitable ""social media"" company. There's like 5,00000000000 social media companies and NONE of them make money except facebook. That's not because facebook is great, it's because facebook is diversified. Don't listen to me, be fools."
