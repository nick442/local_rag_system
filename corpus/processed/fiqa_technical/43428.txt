"Correct me if I am wrong, but Germany has a very extremely diversified economy. It does not depend primarily upon oil exports like other countries, but rather on very complex machinery and other finished products. So being locked upon a system that ""puts exports ahead of anything else"" from my perspective is not bad for the German economy. If an industry collapses, the whole country does not go into panic straight away like oil rich exporting economies."
