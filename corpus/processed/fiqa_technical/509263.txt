I'm not going to lie, I'm surprised Wal-Mart's online game hasn't evolved faster to put itself more in line with Amazon. .as well, pushed a few pf their own implementations Amazon hasn't been able to due tp their lack of a real nox store anchor point. ..but, Whole Foods and even their own delivery service has a long way to go towards that end vs the quantity of locations, as well the expanse and refinement of Wal-Mart's distribution network. Wal-Mart *may* die.anything's possible.but I imagine that they'll both end up owning so much of each other that they'll essentially function as a single entity vs disappear entirely. Even Sears is still around.technically.
