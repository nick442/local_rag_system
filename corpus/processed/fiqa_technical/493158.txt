This: I was told by my broker that the amount of money I invest would be spread across multiple banks (which are FDIC insured) so that at each bank the amount would not exceed $250K. Has nothing to do with this: Is this how CDs offered by brokerage houses (that are not themselves FDIC insured) offer protection? If you want a CD, get the CD from a bank itself.
