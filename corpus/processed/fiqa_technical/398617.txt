Collapsed? BWhahahahahahahahah! No junior mommy and daddy (Republicans and Democrats) are having a spat over the family finances. Sure it looks bad, and some bills are behind, but it would take a whole hell of a lot more than this to collapse Illinois. We got something like 39 billion dollars in expense and are only collecting 36 billion in revenue. If we raise revenue, i.e. increase taxes a bit and hold the line on spending then this mess will eventually work itself out. One thing that most don't get and don't report on is there is really no more fat in the Illinois budget to cut. The cuts Republicans want are to school funding, hospitals, infrastructure, etc.. We have all ready cut almost everything else out of the budget. The reason Rauner can't get his budget passed is no politician is going back to their school district and telling them they are taking another 20% cut on top of everything else. No Democrat is going to allow him to destroy unions and he won't compromise. This is a pissing match between him and Maidigan and if you have not been paying attention it looks like Rauner is going to lose. He may have vetoed the budget and tax increases, but it looks like a veto proof majority can be created, as the fiscally conservatives won't let Illinois bonds go to junk status.
