I am afraid that raising revenue will do two things. 1. It will reduce the money that creates jobs in the real economy and create incentives to protect wealth rather than to use capital for economic expansion 2. It will convince politicians and bureaucrats in the Imperial City that budgets don't have to be cut since revenue is increasing
