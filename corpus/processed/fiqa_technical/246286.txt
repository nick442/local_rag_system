I'd be down with alleviating student loan debt, but only after massive reform to who can take out student loans. The fact that we have students studying fields with limited possibility of ever finding work, and borrowing $150k to do so, is patently ridiculous. If you want to study anthropology, no you can't borrow 6 figures. It's a super cool subject. I'd love to study it. But fuck no, I'm not going to borrow money to do that any more than I'd borrow 6 figures to travel around Europe for 4 years. Social sciences are generally a big part of the problem right now, and students are frankly being misled by schools who misrepresent the career potential of many fields. Sociology, women's studies, anthropology, comparative religion, interdisciplinary studies, afro-american studies, psychology, etc. All excellent and worthy subjects if you can afford them. But students shouldn't dig a hole for themselves to study them and then complain later when they can't find work.
