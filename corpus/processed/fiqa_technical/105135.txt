"Definitely. The husband and I were talking about this very recently. Our food budget when we moved in together 4 years ago was about $175 every other week, and that was buying good stuff often - steaks, boneless chicken breasts, non-generic brands, etc. Here we are, four years later, and our food budget is $225. That doesn't buy ""good stuff"" anymore. That buys our meat (just ground beef nowadays) in big packs from Sams so we save a buck a pound, a lot of our dry goods and non-perishables from the discount store (and by that I mean ""salvage"" grocery stores), and our basics which are mostly store brands. So on average, we are spending $100 a month more on poorer quality groceries than we were 4 years ago."
