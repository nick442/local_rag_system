We're talking about American workers here, not workers from third world countries. In America, everyone gets a free public education and has access to numerous social safety nets. The people that really want to make it happen here can make it happen. One of my very best friends took the bus 3 hours each way to get to jr. college so he could go to film school. He moved out to Hollywood and was living with me for a few months after he had gotten a job out here. He got laid off and had to go home. When he got home his parents drug tested him and kicked him out because he had smoked weed 1 time right before he left. With no money and no job he moved in with his brother in a one bedroom apartment. His brother proceeded to get fired and neither of them had anything. He was pestering the hiring people at several editing places out in L.A. all the while looking for coins in the parking lot of fast food restaurants so he could get something to eat. Finally he got a job back out in L.A. making a little over $10 an hour. He moved back here, busted his ass and now makes around $90k a year. O, and all this (excluding film school) has happened since May of 2011. 3rd world countries are entirely different than the issues that Wal-Mart workers in America face. It's not an apples to apples comparison. Americans that are working in a Wal-Mart shipping center that want more pay need to go out and better themselves and provide a service that society values. Just showing up for your 8 hours a day and stacking boxes in trucks is not of high value here. And they should be paid as such.
