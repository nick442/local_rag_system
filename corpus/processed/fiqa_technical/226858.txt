Why dont we ask bithumb, coinbase, mtgox, moolah, cryptsy. The blockchain doesnt make you more secure externally if your security is still shit. And its entirely different uses. An internal chain would be used to secure internal documents so they could not be altered, it offers no added security to stop read access over, say a properly secured internal database. The only advantage is that obce something is added, it cannot be removed.
