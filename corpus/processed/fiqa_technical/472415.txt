"> (NK and Iran with nuclear weapons, both say publicly ""death to America""). Iran's nuclear facilities are under 24/7 inspections by the US and IAEA. The claim that Iran has a nuclear weapons program is US/Israeli propaganda -- pure and simple. Even all of our dozen-plus ""intelligence"" agencies state Iran has no nuclear weapons program. North Korea likely has a half-dozen or so nukes. But on the other hand, what would *you* do if the world's most aggressive, war-loving nation refuses to end the still-officially-ongoing Korean War? North Korea has offered to end their nuclear weapons program, to re-join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and allow full UN inspections -- in exchange for the US ending the Korean War and giving non-aggression guarantees. We (the Bush administration) rejected that offer."
