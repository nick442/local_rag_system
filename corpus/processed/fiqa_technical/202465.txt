I think overall you are correct. This is going to be a series of smaller improvements that will add up to big gains. * Stem cells to regrow my lost teeth? Sign me up! * A cream that renews skin tone? Take my money! * A caffeine replacement with no crash? More (enhanced) tea, please. * A vaccine series against cancer? Which arm? * A candy that *burns* fat? Yum! Soon I will be the person the 2011 monkeybreath was afraid of. And with better breath, too.
