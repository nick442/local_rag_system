"Look for jobs you can do PRN - pro re nada or ""as the need arises."" Basically very part-time work, where you are free to decide whether or not you want to work given shift offered. It's pretty common in medicine and in education. If you want to work a whole week, you probably can! If you don't, they just call the next person on the list. Obviously you'll need some extra education, but I'm assuming that isn't a problem. Beyond that, as far as 'leisure' pursuits - try to write a book! Fiction, nonfiction, doesn't matter. You'll suck at that for long enough to take up a few years of your life :). You could get a pilot's license - also pretty time intensive, and could lead to some interesting part-time gigs as a charter pilot down the line. General kind of tour guide/leisure activity instructor work seems to be very rewarding. I'm active in my local motorcycling community, and I've never met an instructor who didn't love his job. MSF instructor is a 12 hour per week gig. Good luck!"
