As a resident of New York State you will, in addition to the Federal income tax handled by the IRS, be responsible for state and local income taxes. For New York the state tax forms are also used to determine your New York city tax. If HR was either not aware of the local tax requirement for New York or you filled out the New York State version of the W-4 incorrectly you may have had too little tax withheld for New York state. The refund from the IRS is not dependent on the refund/owe status for state and local taxes. It is possible that your state taxes are fine but that you owe taxes to the city. That tax you owe to the city will reduce the refund from the state and may require you to pay money to New York. Of course if you do itemize, what you pay to the state and city may result in deductions on your federal form. If you owe back taxes to the state or local government this could result in the IRS seizing a federal refund, but that doesn't happen right away.
