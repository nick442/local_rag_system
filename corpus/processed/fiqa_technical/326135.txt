Amazon certainly won't have a monopoly. Monopolies can rarely exist without one or two things. Government support or limited geographic area. Amazon can't kill Walmart so at a minimum we will have a duopoly. FedEx and UPS will adjust their business models and maybe even merge. Amazon won't have a monopoly on self driving fleets. Uber and Lyft will increase freight. Google will probably buy an auto manufacturer and have their own fleet. What we are seeing form are a handful of Titans that will fight this out for a very long time. Oligopoly here we come.
