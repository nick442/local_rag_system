Clearly you respect him but I just question if you would still respect him if he didn't have all that money. He is definitely not an intellectual or a tactical heavy hitter. He has shown some very good strategies but they more often than not require a lot of upfront money to be able to weather any temporal bad results. I can definitely applaud him for not being an idiot who burns through an enormous wealth in a short period of time.
