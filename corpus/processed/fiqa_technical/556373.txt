I understand how it works very well - as Europes financial centre. I understand that without UKs EU membership those days are gone. I understand that rents in Frankfurt are skyrocketing because banks are fleeing a sinking ship. Without financial passporting rights to the worlds second largest economy London as a financial centre is finished. New York does well because it's part of Americas economy, Hong Kong does well because it's part of China's economy.
