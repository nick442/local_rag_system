Zero positive feedback (except my performance review), cold attitude (friendly with others), regularly does not invite me, and only me, to meetings that affect me, etc. Outside of work, makes it really uncomfortable to talk to him, but is great to everyone else. It seems more personal than professional, and he just comes off as cold to only myself. I really just want to bring this up to make work more pleasant; it's not really a 'hostile work environment'.
