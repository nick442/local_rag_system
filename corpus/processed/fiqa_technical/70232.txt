That’s a race to the bottom though. There will always be someone willing to work for less than minimum wage, or doing unsafe work without proper protection, or work unpaid overtime in an hourly position, etc. The worker protections aren’t just paternalistic. They are also about self-interest. The more companies that profit off of poor working conditions, the worse it is for all the rest of us.
