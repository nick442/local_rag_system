Working on existing accounts does look really easy. It takes a special type of person though, and getting those accounts in the first place does take some serious effort. As an aside, one of the more interesting things I found about salespeople is that they are well compensated, but very stuck. They can move to competition, but changing industries or moving to another region is extremely difficult for them due to the highly networked nature of their business.
