> they're so inexpensive to make. Oh, no argument here: they're a stop-gap measure to prevent (from the network POV) hemorrhaging cash. I just think the networks are being short sighted, and responding far, far too early in a show's life. It's not unlike stock investing, trying to respond to every epileptic twitch of the viewing polls. The most watched episode in TV history (ender of MASH) was of a show that wasn't very popular to begin with, in fact it went 2 or 3 years before it started clearly leading the shows in it's time slots. (Coincidentally, that's about the time they gave up the pure hyuk-hyuk, pink submarine style and went for the moral high ground.)
