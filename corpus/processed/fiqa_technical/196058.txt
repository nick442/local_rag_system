"Thinking their funny.. in the graph.. you lost me and did not influence me when I read that. In general, today's crowd, including my 12 years old son, know that when someone is pushing something at you, it's almost for sure not a good product or idea. Especially when it's not clear what the idea/product is, and when trying to find out more information from them, you can't. As my grandfather said, ""good product and ideas do not need promotion and, instead, you need to search for them."" Simple as that."
