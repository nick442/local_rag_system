These comments are crazy in here with regards to earnings after 4 years of college. I'm an account exec(field tech support)with a Fortune 500 company and make a $110k per year, with no degree. In my same industry with no experience I was making 65k when I was 27 in an entry level sales job. We have mechanics that start out at $20 per hour and make $30-35 per hour after 5 years. My point is that you can make really good money without a college degree.
