if you open spreadbetting accounts and prove to the inland revenue that trading profits are not your main income, you will not be liable for any tax on your gains.

This is only an issue if accounts are larger than Â£400k. seems anything smaller doesnt get the sniffer dogs attention at the IR dept.
