Dude, just because Reddit says Walmart = 100% devil, does not make it true. For example, my mother happens to work at Walmart (Dallas, TX) She LOVES working there. About $14/hour, great healthcare/dental/vision, gets shares on the cheap, etc. She's been there about 7 years. Edit: and 10% off everything.
