"From your own article they attribute it more to how they handled the banking crisis. And then there's this: >""The lessons don't transfer directly because of the relative size of the old banks in relation to the economy. What we were left with was quite manageable,"" said Jon Bentsson, senior economist at Islandsbanki. Also, Iceland is an extremely small country, with just over 300k people. Lessons learned at that scale don't translate well to countries like America, with three orders of magnitude (just over 300 Million) higher numbers of people. But true enough, I did not ask that question so I am willing to admit when I am wrong. Iceland did indeed recover with austerity measures in place."
