If you do go the online route (there's TONS of information out there on how to launch an e-store) make sure you're aware of the caveats. Amazon sellers for example can be shafted pretty hard on returns, as policy generally dictates that you eat the costs. If you don't have a lot of capital this could be back-breaking. Don't let that discourage you, though! You could make a decent business essentially just setting up an online storefront and drop shipping items from elsewhere, which could fund the capital needed to open a brick and mortar shop. To answer your question directly, what everyone else has said is definitely important and correct but don't ignore the smaller things like the fact that you could have a page that presents the items better and makes things look more appealing/luxurious, and the fact that not everyone punches every item they're considering buying into Google to compare. Decent marketing can go a long way (depending on what you're selling, at least)
