Yes. But this should only apply in the case where workers consider the market clearing wage to be too low, rather than the issue in question where it appears clear that employers consider the market clearing wage too high. Caveat: there should be some allowance for subsidy / protection of industries critical to national security and infant industries that face innovation costs, as well as a robust social safety net for workers who find their individual skills mismatched to the market.
