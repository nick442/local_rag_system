Except customers were already sold before these designs apparently materialized. That's what China does, shows off a prototype and then changes materials and build. Also, we're not talking about a car, albeit uber expensive, like Rolls Royce, we're talking about an airplane that costs hundreds of millions of dollars that needs to work within very small tolerances over thousands upon thousands of operating hours. Any school child can see the dangers in outsourcing too much of that.
