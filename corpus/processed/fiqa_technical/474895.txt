Your analysis is wrong for a few reasons. One, the consolidated margins of Nflx are being weighed on by international expansion. US EBIT margins were 24% in 2016, and even that is an underestimating of steady state margin profile because nflx runs a subscription model where CAC is paid up front. US marketing was 7% of US streaming revenue in 2016, so in a mature sub-replacement growth profile you could easily see that coming down to 4-5%, accretion that delta to the US EBIT margin, leaving you around 26-27% margins. Stead state international margins should be higher because in local markets Netflix only wants to have 20% of the content library be local, with the remainder leveraged from the US library. Haven't read the Bernstein report, but I think you misunderstood it. The point was that the analyst calculated net customer LTV and valued the company based on that times his sub estimate.. The value additive part of the note is the LTV Calc, which I haven't seen but I imagine is probably based on the above margin analysis and some churn assumptions.
