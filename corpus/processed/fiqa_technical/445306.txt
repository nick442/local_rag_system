Keep in mind the book and tax basis will probably be different, so you may want to keep a separate calculation to track the tax basis. There is no journal additional journal entry for this.

For example Quickbooks doesn't explicitly close its books, but re-computes the balance sheet dynamically depending on the selected date range.
