Does your apartment have several bedrooms that are all different in size? If yes, then everyone can pay by square footage. However, if you share the room with your girlfriend, it won’t work. Even if your live in a master bedroom with her, you friend will probably pay more than your girlfriend. I heard there are websites that let each roommate bid the max they’re willing to pay for each room in the apartment. You can try one of these service. Or you can simply divide the rent between three of you, but utilities will be covered only by you.
