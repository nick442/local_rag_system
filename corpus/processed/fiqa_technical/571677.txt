Hey, I'm sure its been asked before and I've read around a bit online, but wondering your guys opinion.. You could say I was sort of a late bloomer in terms of maturity/awareness. Well, regardless, I've found myself extremely interested in stocks and options and would love to get a CFA some day (like most other people on this sub). Only problem is, I'm not nearly qualified on paper for a career in finance at this point. I work in a back office support center of one of the largest insurance companies in the world. I began interning there a little over a year ago, made myself familiar with all their products, taught myself tons of concepts etc. I got Bloomberg Certified (not that thats an accomplishment or anything). So I think I have a decent understanding of concepts/valuation. But I don't have any formal modeling experience, though I have played around in Excel a bit. I studied abroad spring semester of last year and interned at a strategic communications firm that worked closely with private companies, which I thoroughly researched along with legislation, policy, etc. I'm wondering what, if any, options I have to transition to a career in finance. I'd assume MBA so far based on my reading, but I'm wondering if anyone thinks I could make a half decent case for say, an entry-level equity research role. I'm based out of the greater New York area though, which probably doesn't help my odds. I know I have a lot left to learn still, but I think I am actually interested for the right reasons - I love the markets. I think I know how to research/analyze decently and could do the job. But I know I'm not a compelling candidate on paper. Any ideas for breaking in? Or should I just sit tight for a few years, get my MBA and try to transition then?
