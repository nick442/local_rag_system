That's actually pretty sad. Seems like he may have gotten tangled in with the wrong people, probably to deal with his debt, and ended up being killed for it. Word to the wise, don't take on debt to basically launch your business. Taking on a loan AFTER you've shown your model works and you have a real (sustainable and stable) cash flow in order to grow is more acceptable. Edit. Apparently his wife died a few years ago from breast cancer too. I think he had a lot to prove, and followed his dream in a misguided direction.
