I think you can also order online and pick up in store at locations that don't have food delivery to your door. It's actually a nice service. Do the shopping at home, see how much you're about to spend before committing and pay online. Then drove to the store, everything is bagged and ready to go. No more walking up and down aisles and being shocked at your total when you get to the check out.
