It's nothing new in the US as well, but now it's Amazon so it's way different for some reason. Amazon Prime Now has terrible selection for groceries, so hopefully it's changing with the buyout of Whole Foods. I actually did an order last night because I needed some eggs and other items. They didn't have regular eggs, only egg whites in a container. And they never have any real meat for sale, only processed food and a limited election of fresh produce.
