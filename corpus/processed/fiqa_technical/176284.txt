The term business credit normally refers to one or more credit cards which can be used to make purchases on behalf of a business. A business credit card will usually have both the business name and the card holder's name printed or embossed on the card. In most cases the cardholder will have provided a personal guarantee when applying for the card. A personal guarantee ultimately makes the card holder liable for all charges made on the card.
