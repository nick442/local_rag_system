"The title obviously implies it's an opinion piece. I don't how this escapes you. Unbiased articles are rare and emotional digs/crying about leadership happen to be majority of ""news"" these days anyways - including the NYT. Is an obvious opinion piece wrong? No. You missed the entire point of the article starting at the title."
