govt debt and money printing is nothing to the amount of debt in circulation in the private sector (41 trillion). it was the private sector that created the inflation and bubbles. giving students 1 trilion to pay off all student loans isn't inflationary, it would be deflationary. because the banks created the credit out of thin air to lend to the students for college, if you pay it back, it closes the circuit. Govt would have 1 trilion in debt, but that's nothing, only a trilion dollars. it can get paid back in tax revenue from economic recovering by the private sector no longer burdened by debt.
