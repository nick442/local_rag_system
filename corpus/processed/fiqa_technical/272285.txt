Ok just the first paragraph then. Whatcha got? Wait til 2018 and dont be shocked when there is alot of losses for those against Trump. Maybe then it'll hit you that the dying legacy media that hates Trump and LOL gave him a 1% chance of winning on election night, and who normalizes hate and violence against Trump and his supporters, are on the wrong side of history. Trumps fan base is huge. People are afraid of being attacked or thought less of because they might agree with him. Its a disgusting thing the media has done.
