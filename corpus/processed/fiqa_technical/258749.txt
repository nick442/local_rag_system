Thats true that they love to report gaffs, but I dont just watch the Aussie news, In fact I hardly watch it at all, I tend to read most of my news online from a variety of sites, not just reddit, and watch a few different US news programs. I also see how he acts in Debates and such. Anyway my point was more to find out if other people have risen to power while not against redditors beliefs. People got hung up on the Romney part though.
