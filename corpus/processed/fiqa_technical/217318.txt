One reason is mergers and acquisitions. The large companies that make up the S&P500 continue to grow by buying smaller companies. This enables them to grow at a faster rate then just organic growth. Another reason is that many of the large companies making up the S&P500 operate on a global scale or at least not just in the USA. By doing so they access markets with higher GDP growth rates. By entering new markets they are able to grow at a faster rate than the USA GDP growth rate.
