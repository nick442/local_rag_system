"As someone who has to clean up tech press releases into something more readable for a tech audience, I would say that the Microsoft one is better as it contains actual usable content. The recent trend in PR to send tech press releases to tech writers and omit any of the technology from it is one of the most annoying things to have happened. The Apple press releases (Nokia Siemens Networks etc) read like the sort of thing you send to the tabloid press, not the tech press. The sort of people who need to know ""everything"" about tech are not being served by these content light fluff pieces."
