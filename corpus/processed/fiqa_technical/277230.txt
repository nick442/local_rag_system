Even if you're working from a liveable wage, people will still want extra luxuries that wage can't afford. Paying higher-ranking positions more will give incentives for employees to work harder and earn promotions just as before. As for your second question, ideally, the changeover would be implemented over a period of 3-6 years, to allow the market time to adjust. Failing that, some compromise solution may be reaching. Say, a more modest raise to $12, which would still drastically increase the average American's ability to make a living. However, given that California's recent raise in minimum wage to $15 has, by all indications, worked out quite well so far*, it seems like expanding that rise to more states should not be out of the question. Granted, what works for California may not work for the nation, but overall, i'd say a $15 minimum wage is pretty reasonable. * http://irle.berkeley.edu/effects-of-a-15-minimum-wage-in-california-and-fresno/ https://economicrt.org/publication/effects-of-a-fifteen-dollar-an-hour-minimum-wage-in-the-city-of-los-angeles/
