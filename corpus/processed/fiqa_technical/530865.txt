Not sure that political leadership ever has been a strength in the U.S. Expedience and serendipity seem to have had as much to do with anything the federal government has accomplished for which any politician could take credit. Or as Churchill so famously apocryphally said, *You can always count on Americans to do the right thing - after they've tried everything else.* With all of SCOTUS's decisions eviscerating even Congress's weak attempts at limiting campaign contributions, we've developed the federal government we deserve: an ineffectual one whose members, all of whom spend more time fundraising than governing, are more concerned about furthering their own careers than what's good for the nation. They come into office as populists, promising lie after lie. And they serve only their own self-focused interests. Whoever can give them the most money wins. No matter what they tell us.
