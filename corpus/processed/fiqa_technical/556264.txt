> The Facebook IPO wasn't a debacle. It really depends on how you see the markets. If they're just a way for companies to rip off gullible investors, then sure, it wasn't a debacle. But everyone except FB lost out of this one, and it wasn't just that the price went down - it was also that NASDAQ's systems failed badly, causing significant additional losses and impending lawsuits. I don't think NASDAQ could be happy about these results. I'm really doubtful that early investors are happy about losing a chunk of value overnight. I doubt other companies who were trying to go public in this calendar year are overjoyed by this.. ..and frankly, I doubt that FB, overall, is happy about this result. Lots of people there have stock options, options that they can't yet execute. Lots more people there have options but decided to wait. Some people who sold a lot of their stock are personally happy - but is this good for Facebook as a company? I don't think so. After having an almost exclusively winning profile, they become a public company, and stumble really badly right out of the gate.. it'll take years to erase the bad perception created by this. So unless you're one of a tiny number of FB insiders, this _was_ a debacle.
