Sort of yes, sort of no. All Teslas actually claim to be completely out of charge while there is actually still a bit of juice in the battery. They do this because fully draining the battery damages it and shortens its life span significantly. But that's just a few percent of full battery capacity, and not what's being discussed in this article. The thing being discussed in this article is that Tesla used to sell one specific model that had about 15 % of it's normal battery capacity artificially locked away. You could pay Tesla a bit extra at any time and they would unlock the full potential of the battery via a remote software update. That particular model sold pretty poorly, unclear if it's because customers didn't like the artificial restriction or if the range on that model was simply too short, but either way Tesla stopped selling it not long after introducing it.
