Yes but your janitor make 100k because he is in NYC. He would make a lot less elsewhere. That said is ludicrous that the country should cater to NYC issues. NYC should fix its issues instead. Cost of living differences are the big equalizer among states and areas. I mean I'd love to live in NYC but cannot afford to. So you move to somewhere where you can realize your other goals. If for the janitor NYC living is the dominant goal then he gives up the tax breaks for the higher income. You can debate if this is a fair trade or not. But the trade off existence is not automatically bad.
