"You should read up on FTAs. But be aware that they now I think kept secret. previously, they were intentionally made to be ***so complicated and contradictory*** as to be almost incomprehensible. for example, look at the difficulty in figuring out [what public services are exempted](http://www.iatp.org/files/GATS_and_Public_Service_Systems.htm) from GATS mandate to privatize- and what isn't. But, basically, ""everything that you cant drop on your foot"" is a service. To understand TiSA, you first need to understand GATS, its predecessor. Here are two short videos- probably clearer than most. GATS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oR5ecPE0dE (GATS is also arguably the real reason US healthcare is so terrible now.
