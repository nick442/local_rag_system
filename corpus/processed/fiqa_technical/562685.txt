If your worried about fitting in (which will be less of a concern as an intern) try to talk with the interviewers about what THEY enjoy, like about the company, hobbies, etc. One job interview for example I spent nearly the entire time talking about the HR managers son who was in the NFL. Or if they like hiking, biking, aircraft..whatever. They need to like you to hire you. Good luck!
