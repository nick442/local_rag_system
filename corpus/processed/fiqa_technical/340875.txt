The classic reddit throwaway comment. This is not an issue of frailties of statistics, but of cheap methodological reporting. The statistics may be rock solid, but without adequate reporting on methodology, including sampling, we must interpret with caution. That said, 500 hiring managers is not a bad sample size provided it is truly random (unlikely) or intelligently stratified (possible). You can get fairly stable results without needing 5,000 respondents. It's probably around a 4-4.5% margin of error - notable, but not terrible.
