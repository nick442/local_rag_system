"> Sounds like you live in a fantasy land where everyone has infinite do-over lives and market forces are magic panacea. No, but way to attack a straw man. It's much easier than actually forming a rational argument. > Clean air and water is a public good No, they are not. > We shouldn't leave issues like this to crop up from short-sightedness and cognitive biases of private parties left to their own devices. Only a complete dumb fuck would paint a private/public dichotomy as short-term vs long-term. Politicians don't have any more of a long-term vision than any other person. > If the US had been run the way you want, we'd have had prevalence of leaded gasoline, paint, and lead in drinking water for decades more. And we'd have higher crime rates due to the brain damage caused by lead. Bullshit, because the government wasn't listening to the scientists telling them about the harm of lead in the first place. You're talking out of your ass. > Making all roads private and for-profit creates a profit motive in acquiring lands that are strategically important in transportation It's almost as if more resources would go towards things that are more widely used. > opening up opportunities for monopolies and collusion Oh look, more talking out of your ass, complete with the ""answer to no one"" nonsense that only exists in the fantasy world in which consumers consistently harm themselves and no legal framework exists to stop unlawful behavior. It's fucking retarded. You have neither evidence nor even economic reasoning to support this. > Law and law enforcement is a matter of trust. No, *your* monopolized version of law is based upon trust. It's based upon the notion that you can hold an all-powerful entity accountable for its actions by appealing to that very same entity with a vote that makes no difference on the margin. And that's not trust, it's a religion."
