> who owns walmart? shareholders - people. your neighbors. who benefits from their lower prices - same. Great, same people that are doing well right now. Nothing changes if they are less greedy and more helpful to their workers. > im a libertarian. Yeah yeah, everyone is 'free' to do whatever. People can get jobs elsewhere. Prices can still be low and people can still make tons of money, just slightly less money for those at the top and slightly more for those at the bottom rungs. Like I said, it just boils down to treating your workers fairly. > your arguments are the same as those who support trade barriers, tariffs, etc. Not really, but I don't think those things are necessarily bad if they serve to stop abuse or cheating.
