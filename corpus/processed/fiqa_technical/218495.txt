I'm not mad at anyone, I am aware of what a business large and small have always done and will always do. This is why we need to make some changes to the law. If your company turns a profit at some level, you must be required to spend X dollars on your peoples benefits be it through direct compensation or healthcare/whatever. I don't see a problem with a private company picking up the tab for their employees if they have the means to do so. Why should you and I pay for Walmarts employees?
