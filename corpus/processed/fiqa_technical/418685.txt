Some discussions don't need to be had. I've had plenty of time to research and form my viewpoint. I was in military intelligence, I am extremely interested in history and politics, and I am currently going to a school that many people consider to be pretty good. I feel like I know the issues and the events pretty darn well, although I am always learning something new. I have come to an opinion on the matter that is my own. Im happy to live in a society where others can have very differing positions. However, you came across as pretty hostile in your reply, so I have no interest in talking with you about it.
