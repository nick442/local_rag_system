"It depends on what you're shopping for. Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are often very good for some things and mediocre to downright bad for other things. I recommend trying to figure out what things you want to buy now, and tracking the price for 4-8 weeks. That will help give you a better price anchor to know when a deal is ""good"" vs. ""not good""."
