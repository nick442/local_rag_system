I'm in an industry where we try to do this every day. For a long time, I worried that the automating of my job would eventually put me out of work, but I later found out that the automation process always introduces new bugs and issues into the system. Also, since my company is always expanding its present products, new opportunities for growth are always opening up as well as the need for new talent and people to fix whatever issues arise. This isn't to say that automation will never make my job obsolete, but I've found that it keeps me on my toes and forces me to continue my education in my field, all of which is a good thing.
