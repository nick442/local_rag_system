When I was looking for positions and they brought up salary, I always gave a range with what I wanted at the low end and then add on 20-40k to the high end. Example 90-130, oh, wow, we can't pay 130, would 95 be ok? sure, that's in my range, sounds great. My 2nd job MANY moons ago they asked the same question, I gave a range (too narrow) and they gave the top end of the range, I knew I asked for too little.. My current company has salary bands which encompass a job title and a salary range, and the job title's ranges can overlap: ex: Junior 20-60, Regular: 40-90, Senior: 60-120, Lead: 100-160. This allows for regional variances in cost of living and for raises without a promotion into a new band.
