">I mean, if this were the mortgage market, you would be arguing to banks ""What the hell made you think this homeowner would keep paying you 6% interest on this money when you're not providing any kind of value twenty years later?"" That's not how pensions work. A pension is your money. The value is the value you've put into it over the years. $400 a month for 30 years shouldn't go away just because you aren't putting monthly amounts in any more. There is either capital left in the account, or their isn't."
