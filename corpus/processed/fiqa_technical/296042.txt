Poor Pakistan, still don't get it . . . Ok Sure the US will not forget, but the US will also not forget you have Nuclear weapons. Now the problem is this, that US is now completely under Zionist and Jewish control, the Jews control politics, religion and most importantly the Economy. You can have happy fucking Hanukah on the white house lawn but Christmas has to be happy holidays. Now what ever else we know about the Jews, the one thing that holds true is they will never shut the fuck up, so long as a Muslim nation is in possession of a nuclear bomb. Their greatest fear is a nuclear of the Middle east, you see they like their enemies to be civilian and unarmed, preferably women and children cowering in the rubble of their bulldozed homes. So what Pakistan needs to understand is that they will never do enough and can never do enough, because enough for the Jews means Pakistan should become another Palestine. So they will sell drones and weapons and technology to the Indians, bad mouth and run a proxy propaganda campaign and try to destabilize Pakistan till eventually they manage to get a weak corrupt civilian government in place that will give up nuclear weapons and then, its game over for the Pakistani people. Had it not been for Iran not having nuclear weapons and Korea having nuclear weapons, the United states would have attacked Pakistan a long time ago. For Pakistan, you have a decade at best, by that time you had better have ICBM tech.
