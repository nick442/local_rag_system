And they will be with any governance that gives the people a voice. I wouldn’t have it any other way. But special interest groups need to be treated like spoiled children who haven’t learned boundaries: 1) Call them out on their hypocracy, being inconsiderate, and when they are bein ridiculous. 2) If they have good ideas, listen to them 3) If they are willing to work with you, work with them 4) Teach then that there are boundaries When a special interest group gets what they want, they dive in to grab as much as they can. Then other groups try the same. The conversations and decisions must instead be controlled, slowed or halted when they pull more than was agreed upon. We have unfairly favored certain special interest groups throughout history. Right now, we have a Christian extreme and their opposition acting like spoiled brats, and the corporate interests being handed the keys to the kingdom. It is no wonder we are experiencing worse fracturing! When sharks smell blood, they frenzy, and we’re feeding with little constraint.
