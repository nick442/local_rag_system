Thanks. I was trying to keep it pretty simple. I would mostly agree with you, and 100% on the first part. That gets as much into cost allocation methods as anything else though (a topic I just didn't feel like going into haha. You could do a whole managerial accounting course on it). My caveat is the only time when C-suites screw up transfer pricing and division economics are if they don't fully understand the cost allocation going on behind the scenes. I've seen too many get bogged down with analysts pressing against unprofitable divisions without FULLY taking into account the intricacies of various costing methods (some of which are better than others!). I think 90% of the time the C-suite gets it. I've just seen a number (ESP small companies) who don't, and end up really screwing things up. Again though, GE is the master of accounting.
