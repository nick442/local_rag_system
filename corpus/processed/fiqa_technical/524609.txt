> This is all mundane chit that barely affects you in real life. If you think this is important, look in the mirror and seriously re-evaluate your life. I don't think it's important. I was just letting you know that calling out your accuser is great motivation for some people to go dig up stuff. There are plenty of people in this world that get satisfaction from that. Beyond that, I'm one of the few people so far that has given you genuine feedback to your original post. So to add to that feedback, I hope that your comments in this thread don't reflect your conversational skills. They are overwhelmingly negative and judgmental, and I hope nobody would pay money to be subjected to that.
