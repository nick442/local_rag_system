That is one of the most unfriendly term sheets I've come across in awhile for a seed round. Preferred shares with dividends (cumulative I'm sure), 60% stake (reduced if paid back). Any talk on participating preferred? Did he set a cap? What is the valuation for buyback to 20%? For $50K your buddy better hit up every lost long family member before jumping into bed with this asshole.
