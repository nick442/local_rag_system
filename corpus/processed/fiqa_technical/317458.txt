"Anyone who has ""Always"" instead of ""Only when using app"" set in their location privacy settings in iOS. Have a look in your phone - you may have more set that way than you realize. It makes sense for some apps - such as one of my home automation apps which uses my phone as a presence detector for geofencing. But it doesn't make sense for other apps. Yet I think the default Apple applies when an app requests to know your location the first time, is ""Always""."
