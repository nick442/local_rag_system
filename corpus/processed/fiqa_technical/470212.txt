"Gotta ask, before I log out for the day.. what would constitute ""scientific methodology"" regarding political analysis? Now that we are in tune with reality, these guys do a decent job. There are plenty of other bias checkers out there.. try to use those. Whatever you do, avoid highly biased things like Breitbart or Drudge. there are left-leaning media which are also highly biased, but NYT is not one of those. Have a good day."
