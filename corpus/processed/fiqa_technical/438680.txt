"I'd not heard of being able to withdraw penalty free before. So I looked it up. It might be penalty free, but it's not tax free. So if your marginal tax rate is 25%, and you withdraw 10,000 from a regular IRA, 1/4 of the money will have to come from taxes. Personally, unless you're in a huge hurry to buy the best screaming deal ever seen in your jurisdiction, I'd not touch the 401k.. but I would slow down 401k investing to be the minimum required to maximize the match, and throw the rest to saving for the house. Also, your pronouns are ""I,"" not ""We."" If you'd like to be married, I would put off buying a home further, in case your future spouse doesn't like the home you pick."
