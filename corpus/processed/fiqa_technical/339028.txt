"Okay, so you don't know what other options are available, understood. No need to be a dick. In other industries, deals and transactions are invalidated, reversed, refunded or other measures taken all the time when they're based on invalid information. Hence, why I was asking what options there are for these situations. I know that if I saw CSCO go down 40% and the info scanned on official sources that I would dump a ton of money into buying it up if I had it available. I mean, hell, it's Cisco Systems who practically owns the internet. They'll be back up from that hit and fairly quickly. To find out that was all just because some over-worked programmer put a comma where there should have been a period would have me on the warpath if trend was actually the other way. With the amount of money that flows through such a system, there has to be some kind of process for dealing with these things. If you don't know, then no worries. There's no need to jump on me for asking a question when a simple ""I don't know"" would suffice."
