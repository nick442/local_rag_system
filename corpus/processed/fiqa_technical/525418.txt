"> I hate automated checkout systems. I have mixed feelings about them. When they work well, I really do enjoy them. But some are definitely flaky. For about 10 items once I had the system stop me and ""require assistance"" on over half the items. The guy who kept having to come over and swipe his hard to let me continue just shrugged and said ""machines are acting up today."""
