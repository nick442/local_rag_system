Because, compared to other professions, there is. Actuary is borderline the definition of a trade skill. A high paid, high skill trade, but a trade none the less. That is why the pay structure works the way it does. That is why it is mostly on the job training. All the things you think are appealing (paid for passing tests, high base pay) are also directly related to the fact that there is a defined ceiling. Sure, some actuaries break through, and make it to the top of organizations but guess what; most of those that break through are no longer doing actuarial work and are not being promoted for their actuarial skills. They break through *despite* the trade nature, not because of it.
