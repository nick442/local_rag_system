"You literally just said ""Why control prices when we can change incomes?"". If you want to change the incomes of everyone working, you have to add money somewhere. The monetary system is not a zero sum game. You don't have a fixed amount of money. The disparity of wealth has nothing to do with actual money. It has to do with real hard assets, which you have a finite amount of and ARE zero sum. I'm done with this pretend discussion as it appears you can't have one or stay on the same topic between comments."
