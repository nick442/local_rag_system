Since your credit score is much better than hers, you should apply for the credit card yourself alone to get the best chance of approval for your card of choice. Once you have the card, you can add her as an authorized user, which will get her a card of her own, tied to your account. Most banks will begin reporting to both of your credit reports, which should help her credit score over time. Keep in mind that you are solely legally responsible for the debt; your girlfriend will be able to make charges and will have no legal responsibility for the debt. Make sure you are comfortable with that. For what it is worth, in general, I recommend against combining your finances with someone who you are not married to, but it seems that you have already done that, so adding a shared credit card to your finances shouldn't be any worse than what you are already doing.
