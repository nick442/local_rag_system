"Someone told me that the main protagonist in Michael Lewis's, ""The Big Short,"" Dr. Michael Burry is shorting the student loan bubble. I don't know if the investment banks have already set up student loan traunches and if he's got CDSs on those, or if he's just shorted the Apollo companies, Strayers, etc."
