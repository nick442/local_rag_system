You are correct, our founding fathers were not stupid enough to 'claim how great the president is based off square miles under control of a party'..what kind of stupid fucking statement is that you just made? It's called a system of checks and balances dumbass. And it's not empty land..it's land worked by farmers and blue collar workers.. yeah, that's right, work.. something you know nothing about. Crawl back in your hole.
