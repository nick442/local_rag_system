All banks allow online banking. HSBC is reputed the most international traditional one. That said, opening a bank account in a 100% online bank would get you to near 0 cost, and is probably the preferred option. Every online bank is very similar to each other, so I won't make any recommandation here. Exemples are ing-direct, boursorama, Fortuneo. I'm afraid none offer english service, and it might be difficult to get in line with a decent english speaker. All theses banks will likely offer a gold/premier mastercard/visa, so travelling will not be an issue. The fees should be <2% for foreign currencies (it vary slightly), and <3â‚¬ if you use the ATM in none euro ones.
