"Gladwell's arguments (which this piece maybe doesn't make the best case for) aside, there *are* good reasons you specifically shouldn't hire somebody from Harvard. For starters, the culture there holds as a quasi-religious doctrine that ""these are successful students, therefore, they must succeed,"" which leads to things like grade inflation and [widespread cheating](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/nearly-half-of-new-harvard-students-admit-to-cheating-8804898.html). But apart from all that, hiring Harvard grads means you're hiring people who think [the same as everybody else](http://chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/brown-and-cornell-are-second-tier/27565), and massively exposing yourself to groupthink. You'll miss out on the competitive advantages that can come from covering a wide variety of perspectives, backgrounds, and habits of thought."
