"In many ways I agree with you, I just don't understand why you feel the need to call people who smoke weed ""losers."" All the things you mentioned are healthy ways of stress relief, and I'm happy you're doing well with those. I'm a basically daily user of some of the things I mentioned and I have a job, why does it matter what I do on my time off? I've had issues with depression and do see a psychologist, and the aggressive way you position your argument isn't appreciated. Your reasons for judging people I sincerely don't agree with. Weed in particular shouldn't raise insurance rates (but that's a different conversation for a different day, I can appreciate if you're a business owner that you take exception to that), I don't advocate for high driving so with that being said it doesn't cause accidents, there is no proven link to marijuana killing you (smoking isn't good for your lungs in general, but there is also edibles and vaping that are much healthier for you), and I hate when people smoke cigarettes around me so I agree with you there. Especially with your last line is where I take exception. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in your mind a weed smoker = jobless person with 0 motivation, which just isn't true. While there are people who fit that bill and perpetuate the stereotype, it isn't everyone. That being said there should be restrictions on when and where you can have weed, I completely agree with that."
