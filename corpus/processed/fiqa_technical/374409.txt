This was a good move by Amazon. If you don't already get your groceries delivered, you should really give it a shot. It's often free delivery a few times for new signups. Your produce, meat, everything is picked from the very best. It's delivered in a fridge/freezer truck to your home. I just have them hand bags off to me, quick and done in a few minutes. The amount of money i've saved from using grocery delivery is amazing. I'm a single guy, i don't shop all to well myself when i'm actually in a store. I grab expensive chips and stuff I didn't plan on buying. This way I plan out meals, google recipes for what's on sale, and don't even need to leave the house the entire time. Amazon's trying to do exactly this. That's great, but it's so cheap and awesome right now, you should really give it a shot to see what all the fuss is about. edit: talking about king soopers, safeway, etc. I've tried all who offer it, service and experience is great across them all so far.
