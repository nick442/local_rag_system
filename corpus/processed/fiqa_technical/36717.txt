You do know that a 42-U.S. gallon barrel of crude oil provides about 45 (not a typo) gallons of petroleum products. One barrel of crude oil, when refined, produces about 19 gallons of finished motor gasoline, and 10 gallons of diesel, as well as other petroleum products. Most petroleum products are used to produce energy. So not all of it is reflected in pump prices.
