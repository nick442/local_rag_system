It's easier to hold hate groups accountable than it is countries. Not that Saudi Arabia isn't guilty of the things you say they are, but not all saudis are guilty of this, and the people of SA didn't choose to be there. However every member of the hate group chose to be in that group, and said hate group exists for a specific hateful purpose, whereas a country does not.
