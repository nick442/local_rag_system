"A lot of these aren't so much cliches as they are just slang, idioms, or turns of phrases. There's nothing ""corporate speak"" about ""deal with it"". You can say ""it's our biggest profit-maker"" but ""it's our cash cow"" sounds more casual and everyone gets it. ""Rubber meets the road"", ""stepping up to the plate"", ""perfect storm"", ""lipstick on a pig"", ""facing headwind"", ""move the needle"", ""put a face to the name"", ""my 2 cents"", ""burning a candle on both ends"", ""drinking from the firehose"", and really most of these aren't even BUSINESS cliches. They're just good old fashioned regular cliches that EVERYONE uses. Most of them have rural origins and honestly, exceptionally normal."
