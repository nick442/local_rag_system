Utter poverty, to start with. BIA and other Federal and Indian agencies provide all the basic needs on the reservation; UBI, if you will. The result is complete dependence, incredible corruption, and social devastation. Situations vary, but generally, reservations are the most poverty-ridden places in the country. Among other things, it's UBI - just enough support for basic needs, and no more - that created the reservations. So you tell me: Have the economies of the reservations grown? Just as one example: 80% of all the money that flows into the Navajo reservation flows right back out because they have no economy. UBI has done *nothing* for the Navajo economy, but it sure helps the surrounding States.
