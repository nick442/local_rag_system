I think what you will see is Amazon turning into a Sams/costco style where they have warehouse shopping centers to directly compete with other club memberships. If they get buildings added to the shopping package they offer, prime memberships will skyrocket and then the days might be numbered for Costco and Sams. How do you compete with a company that offers shipping at a loss to them and can now compete with all your in store options.
