I have a discounted cash flow that's monthly. My annualized discount rate is 8%. 1)What is the formula to turn the annualized rate into a monthly rate? 2)What is the formula to find out the NPV of monthly cash flows? For example, if I get $1000, $2000, and $3000 in months 1, 2, and 3, how do I calculate how much each of those are equal to as a present value if the annual discount rate is 8%?
