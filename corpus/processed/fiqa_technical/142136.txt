"> The Author clearly has no freaking idea what the hell he is talking about. I have an idea of what's going on. And my experience comes from earlier in my career, when I acted as an execution trader at several hedge funds. Rebates are offered by the exchange so that the exchange can make money. It isn't a public service or some great sacrifice. Let me tell you how it works: Somebody at XYZ exchange/bank takes you out for a nice steak dinner. Then maybe they take you to the strip club. There may be some blow involved. If the broker is particularly nice, they'll pay for an experience in the *actual* ""champagne room."" Then you go back to your desk on Monday, look at the flows you're disbursing to various brokers and exchanges, and make your ""adjustments"" based on how much you enjoy hanging out with the broker/salesperson. Oh, and of course the ""rebates."" Which to you barely make a difference, because you're just an execution trader. You aren't in it to make money. The analysts don't know what you're doing, and there's a good chance that the PM doesn't, either. It's easy to do, because tracking ""best execution"" is beyond the comprehension of the SEC. Oh, if they only knew..and could actually act on it. But we all know they don't really want to, because almost to a man they're each waiting for their turn at the revolving door that will usher them on to a lucrative private sector career."
