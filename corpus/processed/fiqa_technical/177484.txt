"Monetary policy has always been in play. The Romans frequently debased (that is, increased the alloy/base metal ratio) their coinage and the U.S. went off the gold standard numerous times, especially during wars. Really the gold standard was only adhered to when it was convenient, so historically it did not play the role that Austrians wish it would. Basically just because gold was historically used as currency does not mean that it controlled the money supply. For example, most sovereign transactions were simply recorded by symbolic ""money things.""* And even if the gold standard did automatically protect the value of money, inflation is a hell of a lot better than deflation anyway. You want to reward people for putting their money to work, not sticking it in a mattress. *For further information on the history of gold currency and money in general, see section 2 of this article from the LSE: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268098000159"
