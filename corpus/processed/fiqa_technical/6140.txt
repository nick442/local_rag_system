Yes, asset inflation is still inflation. Economy = consumption + investment + government - net exports. So you increase the money supply to the wealthy what happens? Not in increase in consumption, their basic needs are met so they invest it. Everyone invests their extra money, what happens? Price goes up for stock and real estate while the yield on those investments goes down. You have people buying really expensive assets with great leverage because their is no alternative. So inflation has increased, you are just to poor to notice it. We also live on a deflationary world. Production increases while demand remains constant. So what happens? Price goes down and marginal companies go out of business. Leading to more consolidation, lower prices due to greater market share, more companies cannot compete and the cycle continues. The only inflation comes from overseas, where you have growing economies. Here we have almost no population or wage growth, so that is deflationary .
