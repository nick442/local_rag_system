Well first off, I would advice you to do this research yourself. You should not base your selection off someone's opinion such as mines. With that being said, these are some factors I suggest you consider and research before talking to an offshore bank account: Now, when opening an offshore account most offshore banks do not require you to be present at all. You can open an account simply by calling them or filling out their application online.

Just think of what your local bank requires is generally what they will ask as well.

It all depends on the type of account, the nature of the account, and the business associated with the account.
