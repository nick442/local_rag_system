Yes it is. I work in pharmaceuticals. The company I work for right now doesn't deal with drugs directly because it is a contractor and the main expenses are wages, rent and IT infrastructure.much like a lot of other companies. But the previous place I work for does contract manufacturing. How these guys stay in business is unreal. The cost of building a ~1000 sq ft clean room can easily be over 6 million, on top of the land and building that it is on. Then operating the room is in the thousands a day. So whenever the room is not being used, the clean room it's bleeding hundreds of dollars an hour. On top of that, the fridges and freezers that is used to store specimens are insanely expensive. A regular fridge to store stuff at 2-8Â°C is upwards of $5k. Then you need to pay contractors to get it monitored 24/7. Oh shipping the specimens to other labs? Each shipment costs at a minimum of $150. FedEx gets very little of it. The boxes it is shipped in and the temperature monitoring costs a ton. That's not all. The lab(s) are also expensive to run. All that is for a small pharmaceutical company..doing PRE-clinical stuff. If you up that scale, and hire better qualified/experience people, the costs goes up exponentially. 1 gallon of water that I used to use costs $50 or something (including the corporate discount that we got). It is insanely expensive to run a pharmaceutical company.
