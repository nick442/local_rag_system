How is that a victim mentality? You are being obtuse. Every business pays taxes. Why is it a big deal that walmart paid taxes? > How about Walmart and other large large employers just shut down. Why are you being stupid? What does this have to do with anything? I don't care what companies shut down because other companies will take their market share. that's how the economy works.
