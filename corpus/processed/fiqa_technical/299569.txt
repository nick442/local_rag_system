This isn't your standard finance job. They likely bring in a ton of candidates and set them loose trying to find people to buy stocks. The ones who are not good at bullshitting people into buying the stock just get cut with minimal lost to the company (that is why they pay minimum wage). Some people are amazing at sales and they can convince people to buy a bag of shit, so they will become very rich. Most other people don't do so well and they get cut pretty quick. As a career choice, I don't like this because there are other opportunities where you at least get paid okay in the early stages. Minimum wage in NY sucks ass. And if you suck at it, you get cut after a month or two and your commissions probably suck, so you'll be broke. At least, I-Bankers that get cut still have some money in the bank.
