"The problem with these services is that they resell a random assortment of programs at a pretty high price. Buying the programs a la carte adds up quick, especially when a SD stream of varying quality costs as much or more than the DVD set when it is released (don't get me started on the HD up-charges). That's per show, per season. It makes it really expensive to catch up on a season, when you are essentially ""buying the seasons"" to stream them, when all you want to do it ""rent them"" instead. The way this is not like steam, and the point I think OP is trying to make, is that stuff is all over the place. People don't want to have to jump between Hulu, CBS.com, iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, etc. Plus, some places have some things for free, some charge a monthly fee, some charge per-view (rent), some charge once per show/season/movie (buy), etc. Some offerings that are free are actually sold for a fee through other services. Right now, it's sort of a mess. I'm not even sure what the right model is (buy, rent, season pass, ad-supported, etc) and I'm sure there will be competing models for the foreseeable future."
