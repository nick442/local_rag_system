Yes absurd. But those fat cat business owners need to pay their share! I mean my 70 year old Korean dry cleaner and his wife have been screwing the state out of their fair share of the till for a long time. But seriously, the tax is really horrible for the small business with small margins and large volume. Dry cleaners, restaurants and convenience stores are just a few examples.
