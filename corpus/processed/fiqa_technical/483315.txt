McDonald's buys exclusively chopped and ground meat. Part of the process is to douse all meat in ammonia to kill pathogens. It evaporates away, so there should only be trace amounts more than what existed in the meat to begin with. But I'm sure it does something to the flavor. The meat at a supermarket (if ground in house - those tubes of beef don't count) won't have gone through the same process.
