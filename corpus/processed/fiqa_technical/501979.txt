I doubt it. They do not have a monopoly over anything. Their purchases of Pixar, Marvel and LucasFilms are all complementary to their core business. What they have bought is merely the rights to an assortment of properties. If they want to make back their investment they have to execute, nothing is certain and customers still have plenty of choice for their entertainment dollar. Abc is just one network, and compete with FOX, NBC, CBS and cable networks as well. ESPN is mighty, but Fox has been expanding their regional coverage tremendously in the last few years, individuals teams and college conferences have also been creating their own networks. Pixar still has dreamworks to contend with, and that does not preclude new entrants into the market. Marvel competes with DC/warner brothers and lastly LucasFilm's value is in the properties that they own, Disney must still execute to make money.
