This isn't some new revelation. Pensions have been around for a long time. And the bankruptcy code is complex and has developed over a long period of time along side it. There is a strong reason why secured creditors are favored over unsecured creditors - because we want creditors to actually make loans and finance operations, investment, expansion, etc.. If you eliminate the secured creditors' priority, then loans don't get made in the first place. The company can't offer pensions let alone salaries because the company isn't likely to exist or at least it would be much smaller. The claims of employees are valid. Nobody is questioning that. But they are just *lower* priority than those of secured creditors who only made loans on the promise that they could recover some assets if ever the loans go into default. This is also another reason pensions have gone out of style in favor of 401ks. It is foolish to rely on whether a company will exist 10, 20, or 30 years down the road. Companies are always rising and falling in the economy and there is no reason to expect one to just exist in perpetuity.
