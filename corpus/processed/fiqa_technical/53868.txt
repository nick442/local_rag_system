"> So, are you against Trump? Yes or no? Yes, I think you would categorize me as against him but I don't think I'm against him but against the things I see him doing things that I do not think will make life better for the average American. > ..according to VOX (known fake-news anti-Trump ""news"" site).. Vox does spin things left but that doesn't make their reporting fiction. They directly quoted President Trump after that meeting when he said, ""I'll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market. That includes price-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what's happening."" I think the quote is very clear that President Trump changed his position on Medicare negotiating with drug companies. Do you disagree? > ..the amendment by Collins and McCaskill was passed last month and is sitting Trump's desk to be signed soon. I don't know why you bring this up. Their amendment is about streamlining the FDA and has nothing to do with my issue with President Trump, that he first supported and then opposed Medicare using its market share to get Americans lower cost drugs."
