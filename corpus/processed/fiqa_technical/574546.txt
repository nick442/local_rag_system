Looks like a great service. Honestly, if the following 3 things were different I'd join at the C tier without hesitation: 1) 24 hour service (most of my customers are in Europe and Asia). 2) If you did active calendar management. 3) Outgoing calls to confirm appointments, etc. were included in the minutes.
