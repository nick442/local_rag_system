">>Have enough funds to run the business and pay yourself the first year, plus 30% >This is going to vary wildly depending on the particular business. So much so that a rule of thumb would be impossible to define. Absolutely. One of the things that varies ""widely"" is what amount constitutes the **""pay yourself the first year""** -- which will fall anywhere on a wide spectrum from the low end that is essentially below poverty level (someone young, used to living as we used\* to say ""like a college student"" -- needing only enough to cover a minimal ""survival"") to someone who has ridiculously extravagant needs (married with a family, McMansion mortgage and multiple ""new"" status vehicles, etc) that they expect to maintain -- and then the additional 30% grows in proportion *on top* of that subjective base figure. \* I wrote ""used to say"" because we are talking about *back in the day* when ""living like a college student"" meant minimalist ""bare-bones"" needs, akin to a monastic/ascetic life: a shared small dorm/boarding house room with minimal furniture, NO partying, ZERO ""amenities"" (certainly no water parks with ""lazy rivers"", no ""food courts"", etc -- nothing like most US colleges and universities have today)."
