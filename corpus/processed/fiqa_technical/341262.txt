The pharma company gets paid for the use of a drug, regardless of what they are used for. FDA rules prohibit pharma companies from promoting (in any fashion) the use of their products for non-labelled uses. This includes situation where there is some scientific and clinical evidence for the products use, but they do not have formal approval yet. In these situations, doctors are allowed to use their judgement on what would work for their patient. If the doctor chooses to use a particular product for treatment, then they can. However, payers (i.e. insurance companies) can choose whether or not to reimburse a drug for off-label use. If they don't, then the patient would need to pay out of pocket.
