"Corporate bankruptcy is yet another program that can benefit the wealthy at the expense of the little guy. A few years ago I had a trading account with a large company known as Refco. They filled for bankruptcy and I was shocked to learn that my personal funds in my trading account were seized and used to pay of ""secured creditors"" which were companies like Bank of America. I was lucky to get back 3 cents on the dollar. TL:DR - large companies use bankruptcy to screw over the little guys"
