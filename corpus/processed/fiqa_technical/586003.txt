I know on my commute I use the Sticher Radio app which allows one to stream podcasts. I listen to a lot of Public radio shows. Plus I send $10 a month to my local station so I feel like I'm helping with content production and bandwidth costs.. So I'm using my iPhone to listen to my own custom radio station.
