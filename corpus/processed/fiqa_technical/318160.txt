"When heavy trucks are charged more to use the national highway system, does it strike you as an incorrect application of pricing power? When an industrial company consumes large amounts of electricity and demands consistent power delivery and is charged more, do you see utility providers taking any advantage? This is far more of an economics question than a political one. You have supply (bandwidth), and demand for that bandwidth. In traditional economics, the intersection of supply and demand curves generates ""price."" Here, we have limited supply of bandwidth, and given the free to deliver business models of many pro-net neutrality supporters, essentially ""unlimited"" demand. Yet we are saying that we cannot use price to regulate any of this. We know what happens when you do not use price to regulate supply or demand. Either too little supply is provided, or too much demand is generated. You see this in single payer systems healthcare. There is no price, but supply of healthcare is limited (some call it ""rationing""). You see it in private insurance, even when there is price: You get limited supply at a given price. Pay more, and you get more supply. In tech, when you cannot change price, you again limit supply (""throttling""). If you do not allow the price mechanism, then you have to be prepared to accept supply limitations (throttling). It simply cannot work any other way, unless we have some alternative theory of economics that we can apply."
