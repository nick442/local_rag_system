As a point of comparison, the starting salary at Microsoft for a new college graduate is six figures. For senior positions it's easily much higher than that. That's similar to Apple and Google, except that Seattle has a far lower cost of living than Silicon Valley. Somehow, I don't think adequate pay is a problem.
