But for every hard working, risk taking, successful person, there are another ten that failed (and had to spend a few years recovering/repaying what was lost). It isn't just hard work. It isn't just intelligence. It isn't just risk taking. It isn't just luck. It is a combination of all of those. I think the prevalence of individuals with those characteristics descends in that order. Making luck the bottleneck of success.
