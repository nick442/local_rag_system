"I mean, this seems like a pretty bad situation, but I've had liberty mutual for home, car, motorcycle, and umbrella policies and I'm pretty happy. For the past four years the prices have been the best I can find (and I'm about to save 30% on my car via their ""RightTrack"" OBD device) and every time I've called their Customer Service has been polite, responsive, and extremely helpful. I'm not trying to lessen your own issue; but this does come across as quite the hot take."
