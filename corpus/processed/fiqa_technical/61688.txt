As a previous employee at Target the cashier's were all doing things wrong..you cannot buy AMEX or Visa prepaid cards with target giftcards or you get in big shit. You are also not supposed to sell giftcards for giftcards. This should all pop up automatically when the cashier rings it up..so i'm confused.
