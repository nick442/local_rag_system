Quoting here what I said through modmail: > > looks like automoderator went down the shitter again. > this happens from time to time, it means basically our 'firewall' gets temporarily disabled. I've asked the reddit admins multiple times wtf is up, to no avail (of course). > Basically, what you're seeing rn is all the crap that we automatically filter most of the time. I've removed all of the reported posts just now.
