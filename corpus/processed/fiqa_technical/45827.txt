I still have one every once in a while. The thing is, at $6.99+ for the average fast food value meal I'm already almost paying restaurant prices. I have local bars (ATL) that offer $5 burger night, $6.66 burger night, and the average price around town is about $7.99 for a real burger. Fast food joints need to scale back their pricing or step it up if they want to compete with restaurants and bars.
