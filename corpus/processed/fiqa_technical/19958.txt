Either way, letting these humongous institutions fail would have undoubtedly produced a worse result (best case scenario complete credit freeze, i.e no mre credit cards. Worst case scenario, even the most financially sound banks fail as part of a financial domino effect and we're back to trading deer skin for beaver pelts). The best way to prevent these kinds of situations is to never get in them in the first place. Placing graduated capital constraints on larger and larger financial institutions (i.e. the larger your balance sheet, the greater the percentage of capital you must retain to offset risk) is the best way to protect against financial collapse. This way competitive market forces would remain intact, while simoutaneosly reducing risk. Basel 3 addresses some of these issues, but I speculate more will need to be done to prevent another collapse from happening in the future.
