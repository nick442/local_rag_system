Agreed. I've always held Leaders and Managers as separate roles. I've seen a lot of Managers who can't Lead at all, but every Leader is able to Manage. From my experience (which is only about 10 years across financial industries), Managers have been senior team members with an HR function. Not really defining vision, motivating, and driving their talent. They just hire/fire, and write reviews.
