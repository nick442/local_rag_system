There was some sort of deal like this at LaGuardia, at least I think that's where I was flying out of. They had like 5 restaurants in a big area and I was starving so me and a co-worker are shuffling around trying to figure this whole deal. They had cooks/cashiers or at least that's how they appeared and they were useless, just stared at you like you fucked their mother in front of them when you asked a question. Eventually we figure out how to order go to sit down. Sit down and some little ass hole sever is like if you order from a machine you can't sit here. My co-worker sees me get hot instantly. He's like it's cool man. I quickly say, no fuck that guy. He doesn't need to be such a dick. Making sure I'm loud enough to hear me hoping he'd want to take a shot at me. Not finest moment. Then I saw Hannibal Burress chilling waiting for his flight. All was right in the universe I suppose. I just don't understand the point do one or the other why both? It's not like people aren't already pressed for time. Or just treat people with respect because that's what got me so angry.
