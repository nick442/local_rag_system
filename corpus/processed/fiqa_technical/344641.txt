She said he's been in business for 3 years and I've Googled it and found it to be accurate from the paperwork I've seen that's public knowledge. I know this isn't a get-rich-quick thing bc hard work and money went into making and building not only a business but a brand as well. Brand building is a lot harder than business building. Anyone can get a loan with decent enough credit and open up a shop: it's keeping people coming in that is the hard part. I understand all areas of this business except for the growing part. I've never known how to grow weed or the technicalities it takes to maintain healthy plants and things. I'm just looking to invest in something I believe in because weed shouldn't be illegal and the medicinal reports state that it's far from a gateway drug or anything of the sort. I do wanna thank you for (so far) being the nicest reply to my post. We seem to have some haters and naysayers on here who like to just start shit and while you may find it hard to believe that I'm trying to just get rich, that simply isn't the case. I believe her and I believe in her so I know what she's trying to do is all legit
