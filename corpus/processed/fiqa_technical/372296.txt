From a stats perspective, a sample of 100 should be more than enough to grab a normalized distribution. While the tail end (less than 1 percent) might not have granularity, the article is supposed to capture the experience of the majority of candidates, which a sample of 100 should do fine. That said, knowing plenty of Amazonians, some love it, some don't. The article probably has bias in the people who chose to respond, but the sample size is fine.
