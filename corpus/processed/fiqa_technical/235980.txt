Don't forget how the author, in only three sentences. (1) Scolds the CEO for steering away from tablets. (2) Trash talks their latest tablet product. (3) Notes how the company has been trying to market tablets for a decade. I guess you can write an article that appeals to everyone if you take every possible viewpoint at the same time, and hope your readers are idiots.
