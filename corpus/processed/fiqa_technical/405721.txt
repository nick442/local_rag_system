Sure, just outsource everything that doesn't justify a $70k salary - book keeping, it help desk, janitorial, etc. Hell, outsource software development if you can maybe only employ a senior architect and outsource the rest. Be in b2b Sales so you don't need any front line b2c customer service needs. Make sure your goods are digital so you don't need warehouse or logistics staff. Make sure your revenue is recurring and drafted from the customer automatically so you don't need any accounts receivable staff. Sure, you can use this model - it works great for something like a credit card payment processor, just like it would work well for a boutique financial services firm or a SaaS software company.
