Would be interesting to compare with how it used to work in the pre-internet days.. Newspapers: You paid for the physical object, the printing, the delivery. If you didn't pay, then you didn't get the object, you didn't get the content. Radio, television: Free broadcasts, paid for by advertising. No paywall. Cable, satellite: Pay for installation and subscription, which delivers content. If you didn't pay, no content. The internet basically delivers content for free, so I'd think it's very difficult to implement a paywall, since you'll be undercut by others who are willing to deliver content for free (or something almost free). About the only caveat would be that delivering the internet itself isn't free, so if your content was attached to the ISP, it would be more similar to the newspaper / cable model than the radio / TV model.
