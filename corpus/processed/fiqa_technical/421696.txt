It is better to have it than to not have it, but the valued added is very marginal. Also, you can't get the CFA charter without work experience in the finance field (I think 5 years) so people doing a career change cannot get the CFA charter. The most value actually comes from passing the CFA level 1. It is a big signal that you are interested (it is evidence of interest rather than just a statement of interest), because it is expected to take 300 hours of studying from someone with no financial experience to pass it (i.e. it's like taking ~3 finance courses in college).
