LOST SG is a high-tech, top-rated 60 minutes escape room where players have to put together thought-provoking clues, solve seemingly abstract puzzles and race against time to escape from a locked room. Pay attention to every little detail in the rooms, because even the slightest object could be the key to your escape. Using the latest technology, LOST SG brings your advanced gameplay with the next generation immersion and realism. Spanning over 2500 sqft with 5 different rooms that can accommodate up to 12 players each, our outlet at Peace Centre can take up to 56 players at any one time.
