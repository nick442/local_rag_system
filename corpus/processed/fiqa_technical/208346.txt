Seriously? This is what my taxes go to? Telling private companies how loud their commercials should be. If their commercials are too loud do I also pay of a dude to call them up and fine them? If they don't pay do I also pay of an attorney to represent them? And if they lose in court do I pay of a jail to house them? Why not just be a big boy and turn the volume down when it's too loud. What's next, I buy a CD and it has to be a constant level? If one track is louder and it upsets me I can ask the government to regulate how loud CD's are!! **FUCKING REGULATE IT YOURSELF, WITH YOUR GOD DAMN REMOTE CONTROL!!** How fucked up is America? We are talking about something so pointless here.
