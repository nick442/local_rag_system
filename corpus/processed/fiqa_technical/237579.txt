That's what I tell others to do. And for the most part it's what I've done. Before the crash I knew something was wrong. Interest only loans was the real kicker for me. Then I started looking at the people I knew and the loans they were getting and I knew things weren't right. Not everyone should qualify, yet I knew people with bad credit getting jumbo loans and people making meager wages buying big homes. I got out and then my husband joined me when things started going south. I picked the dot com burst right, too, but my husband fed me so much shit about being out that I got back in just to shit him up. I lost my shirt. This time is different. And it feels bad to me. We can't do QE to get out of it either. Europe is still not out of trouble either. The only reason the market here is up is because of QE. It's a fake economy. If manufacturing were booming I could see a justification in the market increase. But it's not. Hopefully I'm wrong.
