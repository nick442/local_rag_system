"You missed my point. The only thing stopping me from living my dream is your desire for taxes. I agree we are spending stolen money on many bad things with military being pretty damn close to the top. But it still doesn't change the situation for those of us who would rather be left alone. This doesn't mean that everyone who agrees with you can't donate to your cause. But those of us who don't agree should not be forced to go along with your schemes no matter what they are and how much you think it will be good for ""all"" of society. [But if we had reasonable expectations everyone could prosper.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKInjcrJc8E)"
