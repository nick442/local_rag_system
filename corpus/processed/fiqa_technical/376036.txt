Well you you purchased the shares at a weighted average price of $1.94 per share (350k at $2.00 and 50k at $1.50). The shares are now trading at $1.50 assuming the market hasn't changed since you last purchased stock. So you're down $0.44/ share from the stock but you have received ~$0.16/ share in dividends. You are down $0.28/ share which means on paper you have lost $64k on your $775k investment (down ~8.2% of total investment). So I'd say the investment is not performing well no. If a stock pays a dividend it usually should not dip 25% unless something is up with the business. I can not think of any example where an investment can be said to be performing well while at the same time the stock price decreases unless you are shorting the stock.
