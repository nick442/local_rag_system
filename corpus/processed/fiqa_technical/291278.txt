Do you need such a detailed budget? I have found that a detailed budget creates two problems: I would suggest starting simple, and adding complexity as you discover you need it. Create a budget with just a few categories Then, I enforce my budget with my auto deposit. My required expenses, which I have a pretty good notion of the total amount get paid from one online bank. Enough money goes in and I electronically pay. Retirement money and e-fund money get deposited into the brokerage and credit union where I keep those piles at. Finally, my optional expenses go into a second bank (I am using simple.com at the moment) and I spend from there with a card. They have a nice reporting feature, and if I want to save up for a toy or something I save up there. Bonuses and other extra income end up there as well. This way, I really only have to monitor the last account to see if I can have fun or buy a new item. My bills and retirement are different pools of money, and I don't carry around a card that can access that money.
