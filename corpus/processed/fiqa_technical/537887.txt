Not entirely true. Argentina walks away without the ability to get credit in the normal way, but with other (more expensive) avenues to get credit if needed. However, they also no longer have to pay the bond debt, which frees up a fair amount of tax income to go to the things they were previously paying with debt. Singer comes away with.. nothing. He's out the cost of purchasing the debt. He's out the cost of litigating. He actually came away with worse than nothing. He lost bad.
