I don't about where you are, but most apprenticeships in the UK are places like supermarkets, retail, McDonalds and they're oversubscribed anyway. Seems to me almost everything is oversubscribed. Working in retail or McDonalds is no longer a part-time job, it's an apprentice opportunity. It's been like that since apprenticeship wage has been lower than minimum wage, and apprenticeships have weak regulation so almost any job can be classed as one. Thus companies are turning as many low end jobs into apprenticeships as possible.
