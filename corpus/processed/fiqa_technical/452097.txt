If it were me, I would create a website for him. Take a look at all the other local plumber websites and identify the things they get right and wrong and then do or don't do those things, as appropriate. My feeling is that when someone wants a plumber, they are often anxious and may be in a hurry, so the first thing you need to say on that site is something that is brief and reassuring. The text needs to be clear and easy to read - no white text on a black background, or text placed over a picture. You also need to answer all the key questions they are likely to ask - how much, how soon, can I trust you to do the right thing, how much experience do you have? Basically, you need to put yourself in the shoes of that anxious customer and say the things that will strike a chord with them - obviously, any promises he makes on the site he then has to deliver.
