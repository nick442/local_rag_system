You are correct, kids are entitled, they don't know what hardwork is like. All they want to do is open their hands and receive. I told my 16 year old cousin what would he do if I've given him 1000dollars. He said buy video games. I mean for an 11 year old I can accept that. But for a 16yr old going to be 18 soon? It's not even about blue collar or white collar jobs, is work is work in general. Bad parenting + entitlement = decrease financial & social status. Also, for those who doesn't understand about health insurance. People only need health insurance hoping that they get sick. Insurance companies are not charities. They are here for profit. Why would insurance company sell insurance to sick people. I don't know why people down vote your logic when is pure reason.
