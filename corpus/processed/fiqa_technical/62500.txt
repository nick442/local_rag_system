Aren't K-Mart and Sears essentially competing against one another? Why not merge the 2 store. Call it S-Mart. Smart shopping. blah blah. Have a section of the store that sells simply electronics, tools, fridges, make it the Sears portion kiosk or something and then just merge the Sears soft lines and clothing into the K-Mart part.
