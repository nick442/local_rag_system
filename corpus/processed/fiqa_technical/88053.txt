I can't believe I didn't mention Spartacus. It started fairly cheesy but it's been amazing since the second half of season 1. I'll have to look at the rest of those . Well I've seen Awake and loved the premise, but it went too far into cop procedure for me, but it's a shame it got canceled. It was good.
