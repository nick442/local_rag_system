>leptokurtotic That's a term I don't hear tossed around too often. I would tell you given the fact that you have assumption about the shape of the distribution it is relatively easy to correct for kurtosis, but I'm not near PHd math so I am sure you are capable. One question, do you always assume that shape? or just because of the sample period? I only ask because over the long term we generally assume the returns of stocks are normalized on a weekly or monthly scale. Or do you assume the shape because the leveraged short fund creates it? Did you write the article you linked?
