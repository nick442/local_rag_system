The time horizon applicable to the price target is always specified by the broker or bank which published the research report. You will find this information in the disclaimer, which is present on every research report. Usually it is 12 months, but some firms give 6 months price targets. However, you should never rely on the price target alone and always combine it with the following details (to name a few): Are the analyst's estimate above or below consensus estimates (or company guidance), did the analyst rise or lower its estimates. What is the rating on the stock (Buy, Sell, Hold..), when did he change his rating or price target. Does the firm do business with the company? (which may influence a bullish tone and optimistic price target).
