"Fair enough. I used to travel a lot (within a 100km of my home) and ended up eating at a lot of McDonalds. Ones that hadn't been renovated for the new ""look"", were near a border or were in a Walmart tended to be shittier. Ones in downtown used to be pretty consistent but I guess that probably has a bit to do with them being busier as well (no shitty McChickens that are crunchy because they've been heated too long). Location | Food ---|--- France (Paris DT) | Good, fresh (as can be), slightly smaller portions US border (pennselvania) | sloppy as fuck, tons of sauce Italy (Rome) | Pretty good, like france except normal portions Germany (Frankfurt Airport) | pretty shit, stale burgers, stale fries, flat pop [armenians working there don't give a fuck] Malaysia (Kuala Lampur) | Acceptable, some local options on the menu Denmark | Pretty good, but different from NA McDicks. Different batter used on fried chicken, mayo tastes like grocery store stuff (for better or for worse) Sweden/Norway | See denmark London (Heathrow Airport) | Good, see italy Sri Lanka (Colombo DT) | Some odd topping choices, got a McChicken with cheese, not my thing personally Toronto DT | Hot food and fresh (as can be)"
