"Excellent sagacious analysis, Whale. I agree with every single thing you have stated; however, I took great heed to one remark you made: Apple ""[is] a great company."" Apple is NOT a great company. Apple may be worse than Amazon. The only difference between Apple and Amazon is that Apple knows its strength (technology) and does not veer away from it one iota. Apple has been vying for a stronghold on the technology industry since its inception. Oh yea, another thing that makes Apple a shitty company--keep in mind, I am typing all of this on an Apple phone (the irony)--is the fact that they store a majority of their revenue offshore--in countries that practically have a ZERO tax on money--which has allowed Apple to dodge taxes in the U.S. for years. It's sad that a multi-billion dollar company that operates in the U.S., with $250 billion in cash, dodges paying their fair share of taxes to the U.S. Treasury just because they'll be taxed at 35%. Could you imagine what would happen to average-Joe citizens like you or me if we avoided paying taxes? HINT: this isn't a trick question."
