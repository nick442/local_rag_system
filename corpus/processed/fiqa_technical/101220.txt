After several hours of trying to get various import methods to work (see comment to other answer), I ended up just adding all the splits by just gritting my teeth, against the inefficiency of at all, and entered them manually. The process took a couple hours, but at least now I have clean data. Duplicating an existing transaction with splits and just changing the date is (a lot) more keyboard efficient than editing an existing transaction and adding the splits (Alt+N, L, 1/1/2011) even when accounting for the overhead of deleting the now-duplicate imported transaction (Alt+N, D, Alt+D).
