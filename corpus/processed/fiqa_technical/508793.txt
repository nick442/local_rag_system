There was a huge amount of creativity in the 70's . This lasted well into the early 80's . There were many good dramas and series produced . Whilst there are a few produced these days there are not as many as then . There are some good British programmes , some German , the odd French programme . But there is , with a few exceptions , a huge amount of crap that comes out of the USA . There are a lot of repeats of good old programs - these are what I watch - not anything new . I usually watch programs that are 15 to 25 years old . Trouble is that I have often already seen them .
