"Depends. I am not an expert on this but I do know that ""beef"" (cows) do not just grow on trees. Beef is raised and has inputs (labor, hay, corn, land, medical care, weather, etc.). If the input prices have increased throughout the system then vertical integration can't help you and may even hurt since most of these costs occur before you receive the final product."
