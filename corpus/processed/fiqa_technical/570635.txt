The need for innovative Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics is paramount. Our youth needs to develop a mastery of these technologies beyond the classroom and fluency in skills to go from college to career. STEM and education collectively imparts skills and design based learning to urge children towards curiosity, innovation, and thirst for knowledge for these subjects. By exposing students to these STEM-related concepts and giving them opportunities to explore, they will develop a passion and hopefully pursue a job in a STEM field.
