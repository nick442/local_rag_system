It's a bold strategy cotton. As a CEO he has every right to speak his mind on things like this, but I really can't see this having anything but negative consequences for his business. It seems like an ill thought out off the cuff comment which could potentially now snowball through various right wing communities and lose him some customers. I'm sure there are a lot of CEOs and business owners out there who have strong political views - especially in the current climate - but ultimately the vast majority suck it up and remind themselves that a customer's political allegiance doesn't make their money worth any less.
