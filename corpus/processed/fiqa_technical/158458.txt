Yes, your assumptions are correct. The industry realizes that the equilibrium price of product A is $10. The government decides to increase the amount of people who can access product A. They do this by subsidizing $5 of the $10 dollar cost. However the industry reacts by increasing the cost of product A by the amount of the subsidy (so product A is now priced at $15), because the industry knows people already can afford paying $10. This is not exclusive to medicine, it is also happening with higher education. Here is a paper that examines the effect of government subsidization of college tuition. The study finds that as financial aid increased, there was a 102% correlation with the increase in the cost of tuition. http://www.nber.org/chapters/c13711.pdf
