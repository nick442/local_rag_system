Appreciate your frank sharing. It's rare to hear from the other side, and it's especially enlightening when it is honest to heart sharing and not some mere rhetoric. :) I get a feeling it's the same situation for lawyers in other countries and also for accountants as well. Gee, reading your post makes me feel pampered as an ex-engineer /consultant in the tech industry. * gasp * By ownership of law firms, do you mean to have law firms setup by companies such as Costco and not necessarily owned by a someone who is also a lawyer by training? How does that necessarily make legal fees lower? Competition? About overtime for exempt employee, it applies to almost all other industries. Unless the employees speak up or go on strike, employers (with no scruples) will tend to squeeze empoyees dry. Speaking of which, unions do not apply to exempt staffs right?
