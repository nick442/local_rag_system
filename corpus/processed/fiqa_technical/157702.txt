From everything I have read I still cannot be convinced of Whole Life Insurance Good! You have a brain! but it seems to be the first thing any financial advisor is trained to sell. The commissions on whole life are sick. The selling agent gets upward of 90% of your first year's premium. I imagine that the regional and district managers split the remaining 10%, but that is speculation. This is why there is typically a 15 year surrender charge on whole life. The LI company is not getting any of the money! You may want to reevaluate any financial adviser that promotes whole life. If it was me, I would fire them the moment the words came out of their mouth.
