> Besides just doing what pharma companies do normally, which is raising prices astronomically for drugs which have no generics available, was he really the bad guy in other terms or did he just come off as a massive dickhead? He just comes off as a massive dickhead. He did run his funds/businesses illegally paying off the fund with other money, but the drug price raising thing was totally blown out of proportion and taken out of context. People didn't lose access to their meds, the price was nothing for majority of people. It was only on paper that the price had risen astronomically. That said, it's his personality that's the big problem. The guy just has a bad smirk constantly on his face that pisses people off. He's arrogant, young, smarmy, and smug. He's also pretty knowledgable and semi-successful. He will also treat people like shit and not give it a second thought. All a bad combination if you're going to be a public figure.
