Correct. However, when a comment is highly upvoted, contains factual information, & doesn't aim to show any clear bias, then it is more often than not a correct response. However, in your case, a clearly biased opinion that contains no factual information, AND is downvoted leads me to believe that it is not a correct response. If I were in your shoes I would open my eyes. Don't so easily follow manipulation and lies just because they have led you to where you are today.
