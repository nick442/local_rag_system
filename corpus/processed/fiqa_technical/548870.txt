This becomes a problem of infinite regression. A person is *lucky* if they have non-abusive parents. A person is *lucky* if they don't get into a car accident at 17. A person is *lucky* if they are born in the United States versus the third world. A person is *lucky* to be born in the 21st century versus the 8th century. A person is *lucky* to exist at all. Luck is undoubtedly an important factor in success. It has to be. But how are we interpreting luck? Is luck just another word for things beyond our individual control? Just for complete randomness? I don't think anyone would argue that luck isn't important. However, we can't have that mean that people who succeed don't deserve their success. One person might start a cupcake bakery and be extremely successful. Another person might work just as hard at their bakery and fail. The former person could have had a better location, better name, better advertising - hell they could just be a better baker period. The point is that as long as that success is earned through individuals rewarding your value - there should be no problem with *luck* being a factor. The only time luck should be an issue is when a person is *lucky* to know the right political connections so they earn their income through political opportunism rather than market forces. The randomness of luck is actually what makes it fair - nobody truly controls it. It emerges based on the actual wants and actions of other individuals either buying your products, patronizing your store, or paying your wages.
