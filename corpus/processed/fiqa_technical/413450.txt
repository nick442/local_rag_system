>You keep speaking annually. No one gives a fuck about annual costs. You have to earn the entire degree, so the total cost is what I am concerned with, and what I was speaking to. Yea, and those in state costs are insanely low, nominal cost of 20-30k with scholarships routinely under 15. No cheaper conference in the US, so not really sure your point. >Everyone else in finance laughs at you. If finance professionals are leeches on industry, you are the parasites on the cocks of leeches. I'm sure - that's why they pay us hundreds (or thousands!) of dollars an hour to tell them what to do.
