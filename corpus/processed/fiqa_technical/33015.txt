Ok, cool, feel free to browse this post and all responses. By all means I realize jobs are your paying customers, but my thought is if the site were trafficked enough by job seekers, like indeed is, you can dominate and set the tone to better aide job seekers and boost the economy with job placement. I think the job posters are abusing their paid privileges and bs'ing too much waste their time and job seekers time. I think a form field with more questions and restrictions in the template will do a lot of good. Imagine a 40 hr week sifting through job sites currently. It's hell. https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6thr7k/if_you_could_change_the_navigationcategorization/?st=J6LFPY6J&amp;sh=4ca9e3fa I also posted in user interface design and will get that link for you to gain that feedback as well.
