"The answer depends on what is your portfolio's objective. If you are operating a multi-asset class portfolio (i.e. your portfolio has both bonds and stocks) and are targeting absolute returns, then yes, comparing a stock's beta (or correlation) to a bond benchmark makes sense. What you do with this stock's ""bond beta"" information further depends on what kind of return profile you want your multi-asset class portfolio to have. If you want stocks that appreciate in price when bond prices decline, then of course you want to buy ""negative bond beta"" stocks. If you are operating a purely relative equity portfolio (i.e. you are benchmarked to the stock market), then comparing the ""bond beta"" is of little use to you. Hope this helps."
