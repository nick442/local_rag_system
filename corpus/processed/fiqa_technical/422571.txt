Question for peiple in the industry already! Just completed an 8 month work term at an energy trading firm as a quant Got offered a permanent in risk doing the same thing. Salary of 70,000, so not great but can lead to a transition into trading. Question is do i put off school and take it since its permanent? Or would you go back to school knowing that you had gained great experience and try the job market after completion of the degree? Thanks also thinking of doing cfa level while in school. Tldr: finish temaining seven classes or take a full time position where i did a student term?
