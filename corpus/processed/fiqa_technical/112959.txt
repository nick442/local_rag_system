It seems to me that having a market factor in a risk advantage for a bank that's backed by its own government is not a subsidy. There's no actual transfer of wealth (e.g. from the Dept of the Treasury) to the banks, it's a just benefit of market pricing which is based on the collective opinion of those who make up the bond market. And if the author of the article is stretching the definition of 'subsidy', presumably they're doing it because they're trying to make a story here, and not because they're reporting an actual financial transaction.
