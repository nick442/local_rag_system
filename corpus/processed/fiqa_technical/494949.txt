I got so excited 'cause I knew which episode you were quoting. That podcast is the best; I'm always so excited for Thursdays. Yeah, they are taking advantage of the situation, and acting rationally in an economic sense. Of course they're going to make money from it. The operating cost is fairly low per passenger, like $16 an hour per passenger per this site, $3,200 per hour cost average and the A320 carries 200 people (http://www.opshots.net/2015/04/aircraft-operating-series-aircraft-operating-expenses/) . There are certainly other cost associated, as well. But, does that necessarily make it not good news? I get that it isn't 100% philanthropic, but how often is it ever? Maybe it is a good of two worlds. They get to help people get out of a dangerous area, and they make a little money too. There was an /r/relationships post today about a girl that couldn't get out of Miami because her boyfriend had the car and was refusing to leave, so she was trapped. She couldn't afford a plane ticket and all of the buses and trains were sold out. She could be one of the people that could benefit from a lower priced ticket. Idk. Maybe it is a money grab, or maybe they're providing a necessity like Levitt's water example. I just hope it helps some people.
