I don't have hard data on this, but I seem to recall something else going along concurrently with Quinn's term. I think it was referred to as a 'great recession'. Receipts for 2009 and 2010 were less than 2008, but by 2011 had begun to claw back. Sales tax took a bit longer. That said, I completely agree.
