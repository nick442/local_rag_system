"It's just poor writing. Developers like to presell the houses and so on the lots, they advertise the very rough estimate for how much the final house will be selling for. The ""with the completed homes selling for as much as"" 500k means that the developer is selling most of the houses in the 400k range (or they have at least one sale at ~500k)"
