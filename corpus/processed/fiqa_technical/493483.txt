I have children. I’m not saving a dime for their college tuition. With the exception of some technical degrees, I think college is not a great source of education. When I reflect on where I obtained the most knowledge I come up with two major sources: work and my own self education. I have a Master’s degree but working has, by far, taught me more than any school system. That includes bagging groceries, baling hay, painting, factory work, engineering, and programming. Doing something, working with others, making mistakes, and then learning from those mistakes educates more than listening to someone preach in a classroom. My own interest in history and economics has also expanded my knowledge more than any classroom. If my children learn anything from me I hope it is this: think. Watch, listen, read, and then think. Think for yourself. Don’t let others think for you. I believe there would be a lot less heavily indebted college graduates if they would have thought for themselves instead of having others think for them. Soapbox = off.
