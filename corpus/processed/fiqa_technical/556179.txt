Jeebus.. I don't normally agree with this guy, but he's talking sense. Regulations used as entry barriers are stopping the formation of small business. Crippling student loan debt is destroying our young workforce before it has a chance to get started. And another housing bubble is scaring first time home buyers out of the market. All so a select few can stay comfortable and add another zero to ridiculously sized balance sheets.
