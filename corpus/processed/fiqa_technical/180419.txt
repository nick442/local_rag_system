"Ya, I mean if your really wanting to gain ppl's respect it might be a good idea. What you WANT to be is a leader, not just a manager. Ever wonder why most ppl hate their bosses?? It's bc they aren't leaders. Just from experience, since your young and wanting to gain the respect of the employees..you will gain it 100% more from your work ethic than any kind of job title. And if you do have eventually tell someone what to do, don't do it as a ""boss"" but a leader. Show them what you expect, show them you believe they can meet that expectation, then help them achieve it. Instead of yelling or fear mongoring."
