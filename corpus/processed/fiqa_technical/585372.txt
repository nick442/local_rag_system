It would probably be smarter to keep Peter Thiel's interests and yours aligned. Thiel is a real intellectual and tactical heavy hitter. He has a high success rate in varying complex industries. He controls Palantir. When he makes moves, he usually wins. Remember Gawker? Remember his over $1mm donation to Trump at the last minute? Everyone in the media, everyone in his silicon valley social circle thought there was no way Trump could win. Thiel saw differently, committed, and came out on top. Its very hard to imagine his reasons for voting for Trump. But forgetting that you are there as a businessman and being petty against Thiel seems like a bad idea.
