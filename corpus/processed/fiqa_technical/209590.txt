"So I don't know where I stand on the livable minimum wage practically, I was just stating the argument that I frequently see made. To your point, jobs are always going to pay as little as possible and people are always going to be desperate to not be homeless. ""The invisible hand"" is what created tenements and child labor. So, idealistically, the real minimum wage is lower than it has been since the 60s, and we should make adjustments because no one should work 60, 70 hours to make ends meet. But if I had an answer that didn't result in what it looks like Seattle is facing I would probably be working on that instead of armchair speculating on reddit."
