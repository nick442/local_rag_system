The idea of government is a good idea.. the organism of Humanity coming together to pick a single unified direction for itself. It's kinda like how I like to think our cells evolved to work together in such a unified manner. We just are still working out the kinks in our systems. IT hasn't really taken hold yet, will be fun to see what a technocracy looks like.. soon.
