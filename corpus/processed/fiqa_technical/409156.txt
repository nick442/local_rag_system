"Like I said, the heat index is just a ""how it feels"" calculation. I never said the heat index determines evaporation, just that the calculation for getting the heat index is based on humidity and temperature. The dew point (based on temperature AND humidity) is what governs evaporation. The dew point is the temperature at which water will evaporate given a specific relative humidity. In other words, you can't calculate the dew point unless you know the humidity. If your skin temp is lower than the dew point, water will condense on your skin. It doesn't matter if other things are cooler than your skin. Water may condense on those items more quickly, but it will still condense on you."
