Sounds like what you really need is a budget instead of a loan. I like following the four budgeting rules recommended by the team at YNAB. They even have software that helps you through the method even though you can use the method by itself without needing to buy the software. I'm not affiliated with them..just a happy customer! Following these simple rules has allowed me to stop living pay-check to pay-check.
