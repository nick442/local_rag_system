However, we don’t need to and we haven’t removed power from the government for this solution. We have removed lobbying rights for certain special interests. I think that is important to note. The government isn’t malicious. It just needs adjusted, realigned, maybe having some fat trimmed off. In some cases it may require more power. Every issue should have solutions suggested on a case by case basis. No need to throw the baby out with the bath water.
