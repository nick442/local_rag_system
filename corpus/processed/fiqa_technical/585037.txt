Technically yes, but getting investigated also depends on the connection that can be established. If you learned something from information obtained at work or by affiliation (family/friend), you probably can't trade. If you (hypothetically) stumbled across information perhaps by eavesdropping or peeking on some stranger's conversation, it'd be hard to find the connection unless you went and told people how you came about it.
