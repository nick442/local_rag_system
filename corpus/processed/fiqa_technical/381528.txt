> these two seem to be intertwined, Yes > and CRB seems to precede the trend in unemployment. Looks to me the other way. based on your weekly CRB, the inflection point seems to be May 2011. Looking at unemployment, early 2007 is the inflection point with an upturn about March 2008. I'd say CRB reacts.
