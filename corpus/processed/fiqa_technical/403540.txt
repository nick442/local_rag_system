I remember when the whole 'Supersize Me' effect hit McDonalds hard but they reworked their menu, invested in refurbishing their chains and branched out to the McCafe range and other more diverse products. Personally I dislike their food and never eat there but I think they have some smart business people in upper management which will get them through this slump.
