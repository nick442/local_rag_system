Makes perfect sense here. Australia is basically a nanny state that is constantly babying it's citizens and trying to protect them from such things as alcohol and tobacco. The best idea we've come up with is to tax these things at such a high rate that people have incentive to stop using them. A few years ago we passed an incredibly heavy tax on mixed drinks (vodka and lemonade etc.) in an attempt to curb under-age drinking. It now costs around $65-$80 for a case of Vodka Cruisers. I wonder how much cheaper *those* are in Las Vegas. Even more recently we passed a heavy tax on tobacco, raising the price of most packs around $3-$5. And in addition to this we pay a tax (GST) of 10% on all purchases.
