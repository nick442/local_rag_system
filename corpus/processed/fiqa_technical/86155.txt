"The U.S. economy has grown at just under 3% a year after inflation over the past 50 years. (Some of this occurred to ""private"" companies that are not listed on the stock market, or before they were listed.) The stock market returns averaged 7.14% a year, ""gross,"" but when you subtract the 4.67% inflation, the ""net"" number is 2.47% a year. That gain corresponds closely to the ""just under 3% a year"" GDP growth during that time."
