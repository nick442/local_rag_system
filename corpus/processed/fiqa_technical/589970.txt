"If you're really a part-time worker, then there are some simple considerations.. The remote working environment, choice of own hours, and non-guarantee of work availability point to your ""part-time"" situation being more like a consultancy, and that would normally double or triple the gross hourly rate. But if they're already offering or paying you a low hourly figure, they are unlikely to give you consultant rates."
