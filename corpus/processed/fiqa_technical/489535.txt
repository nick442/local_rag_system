Level 1 and level 2 are more equation driven and fairly straight forward. If you have a solid grasp of all the formulas and equations presented you should pass. The curriculum of level 3 is smaller, but from the practice tests and mocks, I've realized that you have to know the material better. Level 3 requires the synthesis of material, where anything from any section can show up anywhere. Also it doesn't help that I'm not in portfolio management, so maybe 95% of the material is new to me.
