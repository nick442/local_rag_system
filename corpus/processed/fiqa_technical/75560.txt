"How much do you know about execution trading? If I were to come up with some simple guidelines, I'd plug your Bloomberg feed (I'm assuming you have one) in order to pull up the average daily volume of the securities in question. From there, you can measure the ""days to liquidate"" figure, which you can then take to create your own distribution regarding what looks ""difficult"" to liquidate vs. what won't be a problem at all."
