The economist is arguing that in the short term nothing will change, but in the long term Britain will be excluded from any future benefits. The treaty signed by the 23 countries is pretty wide ranging in its powers. It could develop to be a new European union not including Britain. For now it looks like a good outcome for Britain; they stay within then free trade zone and free labour zone, but retain full control of their budget and regulations.
