I think Buffet is a strong indication that the writing is on the wall for Walmart. It may take a few years, but the peak has happened. And Walmart doesn't have the executive culture to pull off anything that will gain ground against Amazon: Amazon's thing is to continually reinvest money into expansion and forgo tidy profits. Walmart is a cash cow to make the Waltons and gang a bundle of money for their debauchery.
