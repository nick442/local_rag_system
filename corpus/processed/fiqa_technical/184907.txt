"There's a subtle difference. An MLM is allowed/legal if you can buy products at price A from the company and re-sell them at higher price B to your customers. Pyramid schemes almost always disguise themselves as MLM's. In Herbalife's new report they said they met the FTC's guidelines of earning at least 80% of their revenues from ""real customers outside of their distributor network"". In fact they said the number is closer to 90%. I find this particularly interesting because this number was real close to 0% less than a year ago and it magically has surpassed 80% in a short amount of time. Doesn't really add up."
