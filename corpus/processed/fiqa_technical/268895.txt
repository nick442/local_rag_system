"I think this advice to carry a balance each month is nonsense. You're just wasting money that way. Personally, I have always paid off my credit cards every month for as long as I can remember, and my credit score is only 8 points below the max. The bigger factors by far are: It might be good advice to charge a small amount each month on your credit cards each month in order to keep seldom-used accounts active (remember, longer payment history is better), but there's no reason not to pay off the balance to avoid the interest charges. In short, the ""ideal balance"" to carry month-to-month on a credit card is zero."
