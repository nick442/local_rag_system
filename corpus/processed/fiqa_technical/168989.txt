>If it leads to lower employment (for example by destroying most independent coffee shops) and the expatriation of profits then how is it good for a country? Automation/efficiency are destroying low-skilled jobs (food service), but create many more high-skilled jobs (software engineering). This sort of destroying low-skilled/creating high-skilled jobs cycle has been going on since the industrial revolution. By automating low-skilled jobs and producing cheaper goods/services businesses have created our high standard of living which is generally deemed a good thing for society. It's just a fact, that the evolution of our economy 'forces' people (who might not desire/be capable of) improving their education/skills to do so. It is a process that has been going on for quite some time, and if anything is accelerating.
