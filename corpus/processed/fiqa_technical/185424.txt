yeah because boycotting works (insert sarcasm here). Anyway, everyone knows that gov'ts need money but when they are spending that same money for stupid stuff like spying on the people that pay them, it can make people feel less than comfy with the situation. The bottom line is that the purchased politicians keep these loopholes open allowing US companies to make moves of this nature and then appear on TV and deride them for being law abiding. Sure it violates the spirit of the law and it's pretty unethical BUT...it's legal and they wrote the law so there's no crime being committed. I would guess that EVERY citizen would love to pay zero taxes. How can we be mad at the companies that have found a way to pull it off? If you can't beat them, join them.
