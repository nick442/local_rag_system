Whilst I'm on the last people, perhaps on this earth, to get emotional over the demise of a large corporation, this has me worried. The juggernaut that is Amazon shows no sign of coming to a hault; they already have a complete monopoly in many sectors, what's the situation going to be like in 5,10,15, even 20 years? Give credit where credit is due: Bezos has acheived more in one lifetime than what many of us could do in 10.
