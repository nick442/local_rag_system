"I work for 15 years now for the same company and I have no fear about my career or finding a job, even when I am in my 50s. Why? Because I am an expert in a narrow field and have skills TO DO something. I am a techie. But I am a techie in a field that is not changing much and I keep updating myself. I also ignore what my boss tells me to do, and I always go into areas or develop areas that I think have potential for the future. It's very important to pick a field that is not changing much and you think there will always be a demand for it. I hope my son will become a doctor, or a techie like me. In the last 25+ years of my employment, I saw many people let go. They were all ""paper pushers""."
