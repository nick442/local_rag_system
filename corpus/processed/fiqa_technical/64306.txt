>as opposed to an organization with its own prerogatives Do you think USADA just appeared out of thin air and started banning athletes for doping on a whim? In order to comply with the World Anti-Doping Code and Olympic regulations, the U.S. Congress recognized USADA as the agency in the U.S. that would handle testing, adjudication, and punishment of U.S. athletes in any sport (including Olympic athletes) that is a signatory to those Codes. Since being given that duty by Congress in 2001, USADA has policed these sports, and has punished hundreds of athletes - 99% of whom you've never heard of. That anybody would now criticize them for doing their job is simply a reflection of Armstrong's long-time strategy of publicly smearing, legally attacking , and even physically threatening anybody who has dared raise or follow up on the widely-known rumors of his rule-breaking. And in the end, it is not the rule-breaking itself, but the revelations of the sociopathic behavior he has engaged in to try to keep the lid on his secret that has ruined his reputation and brand.
