Yes, I read those links. I also read Edmunds' other blogs about the car. I also watched the CR talking cars episode about it. Which is why I recognize that they were very favorable. Both entities loved the car, kept the car longer than they normally keep their cars, and were sad to see them go. Edmunds found that the car's depreciation was significantly below average. Both entities had issues with their car which were fixed for free and with as little trouble as possible and a high level of service. CR stresses that their reliability survey of customers shows the Model S to be average reliability, not below average, and this is for a early production car from a new manufacturer. Edmunds stresses that many of the problems were ones which were fixed on their car and the fixes have been applied to all later production cars. And neither of them are anything but positive about the driving experience. Perhaps you should read them again, instead of reading the one quote the page-click-driven media has chosen for you from them.
