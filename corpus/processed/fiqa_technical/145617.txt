>God you suck Well maybe. But the point stands; there is an optimum price point which would maximize profits. It's possible that lowering price could make more money as people would switch from analogs or not buying the drug at all. Note I don't necessarily agree with any of this; we need more competition in the drug market through patent reform and other measures.
