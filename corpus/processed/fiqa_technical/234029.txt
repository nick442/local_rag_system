I'm going to reply to myself because why not.. but seriously, it's almost a couple months away from 10 years from the time the fed opened up the discount window. 10 years after the financial crisis of 1907, the Great War was almost finished.. 10 years after the deflation of 1920, the market has morphed into something completely different and the Great Depression had already started. A little less than 10 years after the crash of of 1929, the world had completely changed, the US looked completely different, and Germany invaded Poland. 10 years after the cuban missile crises, America was winding down the Vietnam war. What do you think of America during those two periods? I think of almost 2 different types of people. Volcker was in charge of the fed for less the ten years. The fed before and afterwards was completely different. And now I look at the US today vs the US when the fed opened the discount window in 2007, and it's basically the exact same. Idk maybe it's just me.
