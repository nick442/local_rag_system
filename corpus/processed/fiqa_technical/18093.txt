"Once again, this depends entirely on your definition of ""rational"" as it comes to money. The idea that the ""rational"" thing to do with more money than you can spend is to maximize the amount of money you make that you still can't spend is arbitrary, and really comes down an expression of personal values rather than any kind of rationality. It's not at all inconsistent for Mayweather to feel that the value of making good investments is to demonstrate his ability to make good investments. Again, not about some utility function to maximize value, but about power, success, and telling the world to fuck itself. Look at the top-voted comment in this thread. > I have a feeling its because he doesn't know what he's supposed to do with checks. Then look at this one, down in the middle somewhere below yours: > Like most fighters, before 2006, he fought under a promo company, Top Rank. He would get his guaranteed purse for fights and that was that. Instead of taking an $8M payday, he decided to cut out the middle man (Bob Arum) and bought out his contract for ~$750K and decided to promote the fights himself (Mayweather promotions). Instead of just getting his purse, he now got a cut of every revenue stream involved in a fight (PPV, Tickets, broadcasting rights, etc.). Mayweather is saying to the world: ""You look at me and you see some guy who can't even read a cheque. But the joke's on you. I know what I'm doing so much that I can throw away more money than you'll ever make just by not cashing a cheque, and I don't give a fuck."" He's also a woman-beating asshole, of course."
