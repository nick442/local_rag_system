"The secret is: you need to learn things in school, and be able to apply them in the real world in a way that creates value to someone. It doesn't matter if it's CS, Physics, English or Swahili. Or you can create value with no degree at all. In reality, it's far easier to ""create value"" by taking STEM fields, as you say. But students should never look at a degree as the answer to anything."
