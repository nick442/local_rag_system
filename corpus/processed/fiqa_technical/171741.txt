"The thing you appear to neglect is that: Many people don't have a choice of when they retire. Another issue is that ""work 'til I die"" people are often 20-50 years old. If they changed their minds or were forced to retire (see above) or came to a realization later in life that they would like to retire, they've missed their chance. They've lost decades of compounding interest because they thought they knew everything in the world when they were 23. Forced retire savings hedges this 'common' mistake."
