In their early iterations, they didn't have the same legal challenges. Those started when they rolled out UberX. When they first launched in Chicago the service was close to what's now Uber Black. All of the drivers were licensed chauffeurs and the cars had livery plates, so legally they were the same as any car service you could call for a ride.
