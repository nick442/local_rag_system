I always thought that it was strange that within a few minutes of meeting him, a friend of mine who is a part-time model was offered a job and then was being flown to London/Paris a few weeks later. I mean, maybe this is completely irrelevant and perhaps that's just how it works, but I always found it strange that she had his private number on her phone. Surely he has people to handle those kinds of things?
