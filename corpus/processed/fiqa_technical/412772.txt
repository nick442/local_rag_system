"> I'm sorry you never learned that we should work to live, not live to work. Its truly sad. I'm not in this group, but there are lots of folks whose work is actually something they are passionate about and they'd do it anyway. Not everyone is secretly pining to work as little as possible(though a lot of people are, I'm sure.) Don't slam it with some aphorism about how we should ""work to live"" when some people feel their work is their ""purpose""(the musks of the world). Just different goals. Your friend in Thailand sounds like he has a wonderful life, I'm not knocking it."
