"Don't underestimate the impact of ""stealing from [your] retirement"". If your retirement account growth averages 9%, you're effectively ""borrowing"" from the account at 9% interest. Look at how long it will take you to pay back the retirement account, and calculate how much ""interest"" you're paying on that money at 9%. If it takes you 3 years to pay yourself back, you will have lost over $3,000 in opportunity cost, compared to $1,300 in interest on a 4% loan. If you don't pay yourself back (because of extra expenses that come with home ownership), over 35 years, the opportunity cost of the 10,000 you withdrew is over $230,000."
