"The Bank of England will simply increase some numbers in a computer. It will then buy UK Government Bonds (debt) and other financial assets from their favorite banks and investment firms with the newly created money that they just pulled out of thin air. It's a win-win-lose. Your government wins by getting more cash to waste, the elite global bankers win by getting more cash to swim around in, and you lose because the money supply inflates, so the small amount of cash you have now has even less buying power. It's the perfect scheme for the government and banking elites. They steal your money from you without you even noticing and just pretend it's a normal part of life. But I expect all the Krugman worshipers to tell me why I'm wrong, throw around some obscure keyensian terms like ""liquidity trap"", and tell you why this is all good for you and to just shut up, accept it and keep quite."
