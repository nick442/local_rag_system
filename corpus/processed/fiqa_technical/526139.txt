This is good and bad. Good because flex time policies are taking over and workers aren't being punished for being 15 minutes late in the morning. Bad because it's also eroding the 40-hour work week, and leading to an environment where workers are expected to always be on in some capacity. This means blackberry at the dinner table and answering emails before bed.
