I think it already came in 2008. An arbitrary definition of GDP growth hardly means we aren't in a recession now. Numberous metrics were used to identify recessions and we aren't out of woods just because the most widely accepted definition says we are doing mildly better. Any illusions of recovery are created by stimulus spending. When we run out of those bullets we are fucked again unless we have real solutions before then.
