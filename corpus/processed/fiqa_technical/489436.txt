I disagree. The plan asset return assumptions aren't any crazier than many other states. It's the liabilities with enormous payout guarantees and lack of existing asset contributions upfront that create the pension liability. Go look at the financials. As for IL being mixed red/blue, it is really not. It's a largely democratic state and a similar thing happened to IL that happened to California. In 1986, when amnesty was passed by Reagan, it created a bunch of new citizen voters of hispanic descent and the state went Democratic ever since. It affected California in a large way, and IL was affected also.
