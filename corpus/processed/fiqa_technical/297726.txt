Going into a business with the potential to grow is the high risk/high reward option. If it pans out, you could do brilliantly, but there's a very real chance you'll work like a dog for years and have nothing to show for it at the end other than debt. Even if the business is successful, if you aren't careful with the structure, you might not benefit. Do all the research you can, so you can understand the risks and opportunities as much as possible. Then you can evaluate whether it's worth it. Welding is something you can always go back to if the business doesn't pan out. If you go with the business plan, have some criteria for success or failure. Don't end up caught in the sunk costs fallacy. If the business isn't going to provide a better life than working, pull the plug early.
