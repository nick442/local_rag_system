"Yea I pretty much the same.. but I'd argue that if you play a record in a room with large speakers then you can get some ""reverb"" or ""feedback"" effects on the actual turntable and/or needle. This can be annoying or pleasant depending on what kind of music you are playing of course.. but I kind of like when it happens at bass or lower mid range frequencies. Of course this all depends on size and shape of the room, volume the music is played, position of the speakers, what kind of furniture the actual turntable is on.. It's kind of similar to how different kick drum setups can sound different very different rooms.. well smaller rooms at least.. you don't as interesting resonance and ""reverb"" effects as the space gets large with acoustic drums.."
