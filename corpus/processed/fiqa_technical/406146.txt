> hire a cashier for 31k/yr when they can spend the same to buy a ordering kiosk that will be faster, not mess up orders, never be late or sick, not have an attitude, won't quit, doesn't need Healthcare, doesn't need unemployment tax, and will maybe need a repair every now and then? There's a reason that self checkout stations are becoming more and more popular at places like Lowe's, Walmart, and local grocery stores. If you can hire a single employee to watch over the 4-8 registers, instead of hiring 4-8 workers, you're cutting back on a lot of expenses (salary, taxes, benefits, etc.). I imagine there's a higher level of shoplifting with those stations, but it's probably more than made up for in the $100,000+ in savings each year you don't have to pay someone to run a register.
