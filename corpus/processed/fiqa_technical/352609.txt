Definitely see your point. One of my customers started as an owner/operator of a frozen yogurt shop that became popular, and now he has three. He says he works less hours now but his stress level is *higher* because he employs young people. (He actually has a low turnover because he pays well). Still, some people graduate high school not knowing you have to wash your hands after handling money, and chocolate toppings on the floor need to be cleaned up before bugs are attracted. He said he spends a ton of time explaining things that 18-22 year olds should already know. He told me if he had it to do over he would have just kept the one store and ran it himself. The point im making is that some people would prefer to keep it simple. The only reason im expanding is I think there is room to bring in my good friend as a partner. Ill end up making less money for a while and maybe equalizing in the long run but the business will be able to stay open five days a week even if one of us is gone. Ill be trading income for time without disrupting my customers.
