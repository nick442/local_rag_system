"I think the key to this question is to think about how people tick. The underlying assumption in any decision that measures monetary value or other economic principles is that we're rational actors in a global marketplace. Life isn't a ledger or a taxi on a meter. If you have time on your hands or enjoy the act of driving when you run your errands, that diversion to save a dime on gas isn't a net loss, it just is. That may be a different story if you need to get your rental car returned so that you can fly home -- in that case, you're ok with getting hosed by the gas station strategically located between hotels and the airport. Our motivations are deeper than that. Some people get a feeling of satisfaction or security from always getting the ""best deal"". Some folks visit a particular gas station because the clerks are friendly or the coffee is good. Others want to pay more -- they buy ""premium"" gas from Exxon/Mobil because they are premium people who ""buy the best""."
