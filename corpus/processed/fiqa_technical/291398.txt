I do think you know how communism works. You are looking for the word 'socialism,' I believe. Examples: Communism Healthcare - Government is the ENTIRE healthcare system. So you get only one source. Socialism Healthcare - Government regulated/augmented healthcare system/market. You'll get different sources from the market and some standard services from the gov, but it all needs to meet standards and regulations SET by the gov.
