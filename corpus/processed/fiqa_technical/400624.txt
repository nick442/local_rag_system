I never understand the mindset of infrastructure being paid for through private investment. On a municipal level it makes sense that development fees can help a city pay to replace a bridge that leads to the development or put in some new parks, but considering that infrastructure like rail lines and dams are the big concern, I don't really see private entities taking a big interest in them. It would've really helped Houston if private investment was funnelled into stormwater management while developing into a major suburban centre. Based on the evidence shown, those private investors didn't have major concerns for improving the city's infrastructure and just did what they had to in order to be allowed to put in their development. Infrastructure belongs in the public sphere. Things like rail, highways, dams and coastal protection are in the public's best interest. What does a businessman have to gain by paying to electrify a rail line or put in new traffic signals at an intersection?
