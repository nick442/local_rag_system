Yeah, but he got a lot of karma as well. If a lot of people go read an article and like it some will give an upvote. Someone told me that only about one out of ten page views give a vote, ie, if you got 5 upvotes and 5 downvotes then probably 100 people clicked on your link. So if he had a karma of 150k, he'd produced a million and half page views. But I'm sorry The Atlantic got involved in this because I always liked them and used to subscribe. I'm disappointed they would get involved in cheating. If they did they need to be banned.
