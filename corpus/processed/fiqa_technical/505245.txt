When shipping is charged, it's often a profit center, however. At my old place of work, even a reasonable 10$ shipping charge on a small sized item would yield better profit then the item itself and it's atrocious margin (3-10%). Large enough outfits negociate truly mind boggling deals with the delivery companies. Since we had a truck basically parked out back for most of the day constantly being filled with outgoing orders, it cost significantly less for them to ship our stuff then usual and the savings were passed on. This got even more ridiculous when we got to drop ship items from our suppliers, but still charged the customer for shipping.
