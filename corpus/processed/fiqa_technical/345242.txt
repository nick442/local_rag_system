Broadly these days PAN and other details are shared for quite a few transactions, say applying for a Credit Card, Opening Bank Account, Taking a Phone connection etc. In most of the cases the application is filled out and processed by 3rd party rather than the service provider directly.

Since one cannot totally avoid sharing PAN details to multiple parties.. It helps to stay vigilant by monitoring the Form 26AS from the Govt website.
