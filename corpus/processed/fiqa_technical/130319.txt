Why are there taxi regulations in the first place? I mean if Uber was able to provide such a comparable service without taxi regulations then why do we need them? Obviously the people have spoken with their wallets and I don't think Uber has killed or seriously hurt someone(correct me if I'm wrong). As far as I'm concerned the only reason these regulations exist is to make cabs more expensive and give the local government more money from cabs as a service. But Uber actually creates a lower burden on the government because they have ride sharing which means that less people are on the roads which is definitely a good thing. Please tell me I'm wrong. I'm genuinely asking.
