The essence of your question is whether it's worth 1000 to you to spread the payments over half a year. The longer payment plan is just a loan and buying the loan costs you more money. The question is whether you think the loan is a good price. I suspect it's over-priced. The classic financial analysis would be whether you could get a better return on the loan (opportunity costs). But we are talking about what are presumably not terribly big sums of money, so it may make more sense to analyze this amount of money in more personalized terms. In that case, remember to consider the convenience: is it significantly easier to budget with the 6-month plan? Watch out for other costs to the loan, such as late penalties and other loan fees. If you find the periodic payments convenient (or you have a short-horizon, high-yield investment), then the 6-month loan might work. Otherwise, if you can afford it, it makes more sense to buy the phone upfront.
