Yeah, I'm introverted & have social anxiety.. I love what I do and from my 3 years of experience I think I seem to be really good at it, but I don't like the being managed aspect.. I haven't had a chance to do a two way flexwork gig or anything, just on call vacations and mandatory office presence, emergency work from home, unpaid OT.. I should note we live in Canada. This is from job postings here. I have had recruiters contact me but I am skeptical, nobody seems to even look at my skills. None of my work projects are public and I was the company's only developer for 2 years so it kind of sucks.
