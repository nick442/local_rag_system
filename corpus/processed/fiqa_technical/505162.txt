Because of methods like the [Double Irish Arrangement](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_Arrangement), which is used by the likes of Apple, Google, and many others. It makes headlines for a myrad of reasons depending on the publication and the market. Bloomberg/wsj/etc will publish it because having low tax overhead is good for business and good for shareholders. The politics and possibility of regulatory change are also pertinent and may influence markets. Other publications may publish for different reasons. There is a growing backlash against such forms of tax evasion. The more complicated the tax evasion, the less likely smaller firms may have access to those methods. It doesnt look good or feel right when medium fries are stuck paying our high corporate tax while the biggest fish swim free.
