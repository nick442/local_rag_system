Bullshit. I asked for a study, You know research. I care little off your logic..Are you mental? Every Nobel winning economist, most professors and renown economists will tell you that the tax break didn't create jobs that wouldn't have been created otherwise. You talk about History, may be you should learn it carefully, Reagan raised taxes, the new deal didn't materialize out of thin air. Show me a study from a well known research or else with all due respect please STFU, and let smart people make decisions.
