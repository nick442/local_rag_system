''that WE THE PEOPLE did not become owners of the PUBLICLY TRADED companies.'' This statement is inaccurate. The government received stocks, corporate bonds and the likes for every company they helped during the last financial statement. One article I read even suggest that we made a return on our investment with the capital gains , dividend and interest we received. Also dividend is a form of income so you're not giving a new idea you are just changing a word. How would you calculate those dividend? With what money would you pay such a program?
