There is no matrix that is going to work for you because people value qualitative things differently. For example, if I could afford a van Gogh painting, I'd only buy it if I could flip it for a profit. It's worth very little to me intrinsically. Another person might find it worth millions of dollars simply for aesthetic reasons. If you wish to try to quantify your desires, you have to do so yourself. However, I would say it's being too analytical about life, which isn't a money-collecting game unless you make it one. Can you afford your future? Can you afford to lose your job for a time? How much do you want to save? Once you know those sorts of answers, you know how much you can spend on lifestyle choices.
