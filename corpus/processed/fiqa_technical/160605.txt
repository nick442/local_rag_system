That's a bit more nuanced than it seems. The argument is that on balance, the government does not create wealth through value-added services, particularly when compared to private enterprise. That voluntary trade creates mutually beneficial outcomes, but involuntary taxation is at best a wealth transfer and at worst inefficient use of capital that leaves people worse off than they would be without it. I mean..your characterization isn't totally unfair, but it isn't exactly right, either.
