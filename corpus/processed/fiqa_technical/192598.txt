Nop>So? That means he should be dirt poor? No. Maybe he's been there for 30 years and got raises. Janitors do way more than clean toilets. My ex has a great government job in science 4 years of school. She does the same repetitive task that you can watch a YouTube video and be an expert. Way easier than being a janitor. She deserves to live good, a janitor doesn't? There are so many I'll thought out things in your post. First off fucking get it through your head that middle is middle. That means that there will always be lower and upper, with the lower being worse off and the upper being better off. Maybe what you want is a higher standard of living across the board, starting with the lower class. Actually I agree esp starting with healthcare. However, higher standard of living won't make the lower class equal to the middle class. I am sorry your ex's job can be outsourced to a robot and there is no need to be outraged this will happen soon. If not then it actually requires a skill or a thought that she trained for and your argument is invalid. I am not sure why you think longevity at a skill-less job should be rewarded. Or should we fire all the old janitors and higher young ones so we pay for the job performed and not some longevity bulshit? I am not sure WTF you think someone who spent time acquiring knowledge and a skill necessary for their job should be paid the same as one who didn't learn anything and works a job that doesn't require any skills. Even communism wasn't that delusional.. Finally the janitor does deserve to live comfortably, your ex possibly deserves to live well and you need to improve your English.
