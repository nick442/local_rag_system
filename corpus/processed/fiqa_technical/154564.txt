>I agree. That's why I require that my employees sleep at the office so they don't waste time driving back and forth. Much more efficient. Sadly, the Department of Labor disagrees, so its a no go until the lawsuit gets resolved. Goddamn guvermint regulation getting in the way of us job creators. Quite the straw man there. There's a vast gap between efficiently using your employees and virtual slavery, and you went for the slavery side. Which is a silly argument, unless you're accusing 3G or Kraft/Heinz of slavery. >cough http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tim-hortons-class-action-1.4167739 cough. So first of all, that has nothing to do with unrest about the product or values. This is a dispute between franchisees and corporate, not between customers and the chain. Second, your link is about a lawsuit that's just starting and currently unproven. Third, it alleges that the parent company is not using the advertisement fund properly, which not only has nothing to do with the product/values, but also seems like an incredibly difficult thing to prove - how would the franchisees even know how much TH's is spending on advertising? Your link doesn't even attempt to address any point I made. It's just an article about Tim Horton's and a specific group of people being angry. It mentions nothing about customers. It mentions nothing about product quality. In fact, the only relevant piece of information to the discussion at hand is that product prices have gone up, but restaurant prices have stayed the same, which would suggest that the customer is getting a better deal!
