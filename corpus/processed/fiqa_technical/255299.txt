"What exactly is your ""fair share"" of what ""someone else"" has worked for? - Thomas Sowell If socialism was such a great idea, why does it needs to be enforced? Bottom line: Socialism and even Communism only worked in one place - the Israeli Kibbutz, where people joined out of free will, and expelled for not participating. Now look at the status of the Israeli Kibbutz today. Lastly, some basic services offered to the public (""socialism"") are good. Not much beyond that. Capitalism works on it's own and allows that."
