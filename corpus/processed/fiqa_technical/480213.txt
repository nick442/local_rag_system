Sigh.. this is what irritates me about democrats. They say that they are scared that African Americans are not going to have good enough access to healthier foods and they want to impede on the market. African Americans have just the same opportunities as any other race, so why is that an issue? So then they go further saying that a higher percentage of minorities are at the lower income range. My answer is free market competition. The more competition, the higher output of innovation and value the market produces. This lowers prices while increasing value. Not trying to get too political, but I really think we should keep the chains off of business and let them innovate
