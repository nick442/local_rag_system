Do you mean commercial real estate lending or corporate lending? Sadly private equity is really difficult to get into without an investment banking background. You will be competing with people who have investment banking backgrounds and also MBAs from top 5 schools. I have friends at HBS, Wharton, etc and they all told me how difficult it is even for them. It's not even guaranteed at that level. Obviously, nothing is impossible but a huge challenge.
