Let me try to explain my viewpoint on this, because to come right out with it would lead to an onslaught of downvotes immediately without consideration. Suppose you have a Methodist church that needs a new pastor. The qualifications would include, among many other things, a basic understanding of and belief in Chrisitianity. Hiring someone who didn't subscribe to their religion would defeat the purpose of the job. You could say that religious beliefs are inherent to the position, which is accounted for in our legal system as an exception. On the other hand, imagine an atheist organization of some sorts wants to hire a new chairman. Other qualities aside, what do you think would be the one trait required of said position? Atheism, obviously. Would it be wrong to deny someone this job if they were a strident Baptist? Not really. The organization is promoting atheism, so said candidate's beliefs would cause an issue with their overall goals. I guess what I'm trying to point out is that if you're specifically a religious company (or specifically *not* a religious company), it would make sense to hire along those lines. This lightbulb company has chosen to organize itself strongly around Christian employees. In a way, they've dug their own grave by limiting their pool of applicants to, it would seem, rather zealous adherents. It's one of those situations that's unfortunate, but I don't necessarily think there's a basis for it to be *illegal*. If he was a long-term employee of theirs and they had wrongfully terminated them, that'd be a different situation altogether. This was just a job interview.
