"The complaint isn't based on facts. It's based on pure protectionism. Boeing doesn't even build this class of airplane. **The Bombardier C-series would compete with the 717 which Boeing hasn't built in over ten years**. >*""In the Delta Air Lines deal, the airline began talking with Boeing about used E-190s and used Boeing 717s. Boeing had 19 E-190s to dispose of, having committed to take them in on trade as part of an order with Air Canada for the 737 MAX. Delta purchased the 19 E-190s, but rejected the 717s because none was available during the period it required and there were not enough used 717s in any event. Delta called the 737-7 MAX uneconomical vs CSeries, rooted in 1960s design and an inefficient shrink.""* >*""Delta testified Boeing never offered any new-build aircraft because Boeing doesn’t have an offering in the 100-125 seat sector and it didn’t have any available delivery positions in the period required.""* Secondly, Boeing holds the **[#1 spot on the most heavily subsidized companies in the US list](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/top-100-parents)**, so even if their allegations were true, for Boeing to suggest that another company benefits from subsidies is a case of a very, very, very large pot calling a teeny-tiny kettle, black. Lastly, to respond in kind to Boeing and the Trump administration, the Canadian governemt should be **cancelling it's $2,800,000,000 Boeing Super Hornet** order and exert pressure.. perhaps a 220% tax would convince **[Air Canada to dump its $6,500,000,000 order for 61, Boeing 737 Max airplanes?](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-orders-61-boeing-737-max-jets-1.2460560)** You know, to be fair because Boeing is heavily subsidized and all.."
