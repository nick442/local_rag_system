Demand is also a rule of economics and always exists. It is the advertising/marketing efforts that fulfills the assumption of economics of perfect information. It is the entrepreneurs/ investors estimation of what the demand will be once consumers have perfect information of the product that creates companies, spurs investment, and creates jobs to carry out the plan. All of this is based on the idea that the investment of time and money will generate a return. To use a different product as an example; there is always demand for food, with consumer preference for say pizza. I'm not creating jobs by sitting on my fat ass at home wanting someone else to make me a pizza, and drive it to my doorstep. If there isn't a pizza place I can make myself a PBJ sandwich and no jobs are created. It was the entrepreneur/ investors who hypothesized there was a hidden demand for fatasses like me wanting pizza that made the plan for building a pizza place and then investing money which was used to hire employees based on the assumption that the demand existed, and my fatass would spend money giving them a return on their investment.
