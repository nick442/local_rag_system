> He seemed to be pointing out that the Fed may accidentally make things worse by looking at averages instead of drilling down into the quintiles. I think this is exactly what he's saying, but he doesn't provide what his solution would be if he was running the Fed. He's spoken about it in some recent interviews. There's one with Bloomberg that was 60+ minutes long and he's basically under the impression that we made our bed, there's no going back now. Nothing the Fed can do at this point but let the markets do what they need to do. Tightening too fast now might cause the next recession (starting with the high yield credit market IMO). On the other hand, no tightening really ties their hands when the recession comes and they're left with either another round of QE, which may have the opposite effect of what is intended, or just sit back and watch the fire.
