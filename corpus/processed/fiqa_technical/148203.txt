Which banks? What about those that don't have the same products/rates/services? There's only a handful of institues that could match, even just closely, to what WF provides. Customers wouldn't have much real choice, and it'd look like the gov't stepping in and taking one business' money and giving it to another. For the receiving bank, they would take a hit too likely, as the term for which they'd have the new funds wouldn't be long enough to see returns on anything before they had to turn the money back over. Meaning they'd be eating all the normal cost of their services without getting the normal return. Fines work well because they hit companies where it impacts only them-net income. You want better compliance, create bigger and more persistent fines. You don't like WF, move your money somewhere else.
