Ok look, so you didn't read it. Here's a blurb for you to ponder: The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule. Some are quite graphic, with commands to chop off heads and fingers and kill infidels wherever they may be hiding. Muslims who do not join the fight are called 'hypocrites' and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter. So wait, are you saying that an infinitesimally small number of muslims read the Koran?
