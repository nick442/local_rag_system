But maybe smaller shops are able to offer something else to differentiate, to make up for their inability to match Amazon's return policy? For example, maybe it lets them charge less or provide custom goods. Amazon is taking away that avenue for differentiation. I get Amazon's point: they want to provide a consistent experience. But it's pretty convenient in that it hurts smaller sellers more than bigger sellers and Amazon is the biggest seller of all.
