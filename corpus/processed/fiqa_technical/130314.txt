OTA channels. You only lose MNF compared to basic cable. I listen to the radio for baseball games. Which works out pretty well, since I hardly ever actually watched baseball games when I had cable. I'm always surfing reddit or doing something else around the house when they are on. And on the rare occasion that there is a game on that I want to see and it is on cable only, I go to my local sports bar.
