"You probably bought the stock near the peak because ""it's been up a lot lately."" That's the easiest way to lose money. You need to go back and do some basic research. The stock appears to have been expensive around 75. Why is that? The stock seems to be in a ""comfortable"" level around 45. Why is THAT? Maybe it's too expensive around 45 (based on the P/E ratio, or other measures); maybe you should buy more at 45, where it is cheap, even though 75 is too expensive. The key is to study the stock where it is today (45-47). Ask yourself what you would do at TODAY's price, and today's ""fundamentals."" That will also save you from paying 75 for a stock worth 45, and should save you from paying 45 for a stock if it is only worth 35."
