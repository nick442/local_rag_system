Jordan Brand is still synonymous with high performance and style. But the retro releases have gotten out of hand. Perhaps if they stuck to original colorways and not the myriad iterations that have been released in recent years they wouldn't contribute to their own ubiquity. That ubiquity may be the reason it is underperforming. Jordan brand releases no longer come with the side of FOMO that they once had. Another reason it may have underperformed is the price point of their flagship shoe. $185 for the XXXI?! You're not going to get a lot of working class parents to buy those for their kids. Even weekend warriors like myself that grew up in the 80s/90s with disposable income may find it hard to justify the purchase.
