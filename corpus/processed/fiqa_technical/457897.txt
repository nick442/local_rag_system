Running a sandwich shop and, say, a software consulting service are quite different things. I had two employees at one point, following the kind of thinking in the article. But I found what that meant was that I had to spend more time being a manager and salesperson and much less time doing the work I enjoyed. To make it viable I would have had to scale up to the point where I had at least one salesperson and maybe a manager, which would have required more income-producing staff to support them. Instead, I scaled back to just myself, and have been very happy with that decision. The article also underestimates what can be made in consulting or IT contracting. Rates well above $100/hr are common for people with expertise (as opposed to commodity providers), and billing at least 40 hours a week is not usually a problem. It's certainly true that a one-man operation is much more likely to put a ceiling on your earnings, but (a) that ceiling can be a lot higher than the article suggests, and (b) depending on the business, breaking that ceiling and earning much more is certainly possible in some businesses, for example where you have the opportunity to sell your work in product form rather than hourly.
