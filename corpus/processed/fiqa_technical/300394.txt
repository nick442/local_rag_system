"> What if you felt you were cheated by the bank? I could ask a judge if I were. My subjective feelings are of no relevance for the validity of the contract. > What if you had something terrible unexpected happen to you financially? Then I might get bankrupt as a consequence. I did try to make certain that I can pay my loan even if something terrible happens to me. That's why I live in a much smaller house in a less fancy neighbourhood. > Also a loan is not a promise. A loan is a contract. Every contract is a binding promise, establishing rights and obligations. That's the whole point of a contract. > The contract has outs for all parties. Under certain conditions, a contract can have termination clauses. But by far not all contracts have them. And from a loan contract there is no ""out"" -- it is just that if you don't have any money to pay, you don't have any money to pay. The whole concept of bankrupcy is just there to regulate the proceedings if you don't have the money to pay your dues -- not a convenient tool to cheat on your contractual obligations. If it can be abused to this end, it needs to be reformed."
