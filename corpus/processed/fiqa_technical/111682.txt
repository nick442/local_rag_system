Thanks. I'm more shocked than anything, that the majority of people are so strongly opposed to a perfectly reasonable suggestion: that a dubious blog which can't pass the test of basic academic credibility, and outright states it's own methodology is unscientific, cannot be taken as a credible source in an argument. People got unreasonably upset about it and they won't even say why.
