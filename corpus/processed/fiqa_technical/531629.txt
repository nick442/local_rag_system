I got caught up with Zynga's 'Mafia Wars' for a while, but I kept having technical issues with the game, and Zynga made it damn near impossible to contact them with issues. Even when you jumped through all of their hoops they usually did nothing, or held up more hoops until you finally gave up. My wife had many of the same types of problems with 'Farmville'. Zynga's disregard for customer service killed our desire for their games. Now I couldn't care less if they go bankrupt. Seriously, customer service, will make or break a company; and since Zynga doesn't seem to care enough about their customers to provide good, responsive customer service, then they can go to hell as far as I'm concerned, they've permanently lost me as a customer. Honestly I've never known a company that was harder to contact with product, or technical issues, or received less satisfaction when I was able to contact them. It doesn't surprise me one bit that they have lost large numbers of customers. Maybe they just don't realize that the people who play their games are customers, or at least potential customers.
