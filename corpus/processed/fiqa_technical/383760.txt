Agreed. I use online banking for everything I can. The only thing that holds me back is when there are insane fees on using online payments. So really it's the companies with these fees that are slowing us all down.. And the older generation that refuses to try to understand debit/credit cards and online banking. My grandma will only use cash and checks.
