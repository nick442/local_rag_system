"The problem I have with this argument is exemplified by the following statement: *""Focusing on share-restricted hedge funds between 1999 and 2008, Sadka and Ozik found that funds with recent inflows on average earned an additional 5.6 percent annually compared to funds that experienced outflows.*"" Funds that are doing well tend - on average - to see customer inflows. Funds that are doing poorly tend - on average - to see customer outflows. It's the concept of ""hot money."" The authors here imply that it's the fund inflows that prompt the outperformance, when - in reality - outperformance prompts fund inflows."
