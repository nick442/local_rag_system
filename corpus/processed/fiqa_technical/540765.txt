Most likely the account funds have been handed over to the government of the state in which the account was established. Generally it can be recovered if reasonable proof of ownership is provided (which you seem to have). You should try going to http://unclaimed.org/ and selecting the account's state. That site is run by the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators, and generally selecting the state will take you to the web site of the particular state's unclaimed property department and give information on how to find out about the funds and/or file a claim.
