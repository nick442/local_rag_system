"In the UK, one quirky option in this area (OK, admittedly it's not a passive) is the ""Battle Against Cancer Investment Trust"" (BACIT). Launched in 2012, it's basically a fund-of-funds where the funds held charge zero management charges or performance fees to the trust, but the trust then donates 1% of NAV to charity each year (half to cancer research, investors decide the other half)."
