"It's been pretty crazy here, every YouTube pre-roll, every banner ad, etc. It's really annoying hearing people say, ""we at big tobacco support cancer research and think it's great, but this bill is flawed."" As if they would stand behind a cigarette tax law with slight changes.. I enjoy clicking them just to cost the No on 29 people $0.16. Take that!"
