"I hope you're not blaming the banks for the housing price inflation. It's called supply and demand, and is mostly caused by people, possibly like you, who have unreasonable expectations about the future value of real estate, and thought it would keep rising unrealistically forever. The bank's ""crime"" was to lend money recklessly, to people who could not really afford it. The buyer's ""crime"" was to buy a home they could not afford with the expectations that it would go up in price and they could either flip it or refinance. The real ""criminals"" might be the real estate agents who convinced the buyers they could afford it, and helped them find an avenue to get the money. There were (are?) a lot of unscrupulous, or simply bad, real estate agents out there. But they, too, were naive enough to think houses would continue to rise. tl;dr. We are all to blame. Calling owners ""slumlords"" and blaming them and the banks for your misfortune will only hurt you and make you forever the victim."
