That's awesome! You're going to want to learn how to fly a small technical one first. Once you are comfortable spend couple thousand and start with basic maneuvers, as the size of your drone has changed! Do you understand the legal responsibilities as a small business owner and have you taken any business classes? I'm a vet as well. Private message me man. I know a lot about business.
