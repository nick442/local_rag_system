They get insurance when they believe that the cost of replacing the boat does impact their lives. We are also assuming that liability insurance is something you will purchase, since if your boat breaks loose and smashes into a $1,000,000 boat that is cash you probably don't have. It will also cover you if somebody falls on the boat. In your comment you mention that the cost will be $2,000 for 4 years. The issue is are you willing to save $2,000 by foregoing insurance but risk the $10,000 boat.
