Can confirm. I lived in Arkansas for most of my life so far and recently moved to Orlando. The market and income difference in Orlando are insane. I am lucky to find an apartment that doesn’t cost as much as two houses in Arkansas. If I wanted a $250k house in Arkansas, I could probably get a 4 acres and a 4 bedroom here I’m lucky to get a 1 bedroom townhome, and that’s still driving an hour to work! It’s ridiculous.
