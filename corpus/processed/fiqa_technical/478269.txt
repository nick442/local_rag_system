>Big deal in all they made around 85 billion dollars off subprime loans. Source? I would estimate they've lost more than $50B on subprime loans and much more indirectly from subprime (they're stock dropped 90% due to the crisis) and they've paid out more than $50B in subprime related penalties to the government. I don't think I could find a single intelligent well-researched person who would say subprime has been profitable for the banks, it's clearly counter to all evidence. Why are there so many communists in this sub?
