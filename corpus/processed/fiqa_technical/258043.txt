Why are self checkout lanes always available? Because people don't want the do extra work. Sure this is coupd be a good idea in a small convenience store setting, but not a large grocery store. It just seems like a complete logistical nightmare, especially with produce. With massive upfront construction costs or refit costs, and then add in the new maintenence, preventative maintenance, and monitoring costs. Do you truly see savings when cashiers are cheap? On top of everything, you are still going to have lines. A week''s worth of groceries doesn't bag itself.
