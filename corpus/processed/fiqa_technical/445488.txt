If we're talking about a very small business (I'm picturing an office with 10-15 employees), I wouldn't want to work in any small business environment where I was unwanted. And for businesses that small it doesn't make any sense to try to legally force them to hire someone they don't want to work with everyday. If I'm a non-white person, I wouldn't want to work somewhere where they're so racist they didn't want to hire me because of my skin color. Actually I wouldn't want to work there as a white person either.
