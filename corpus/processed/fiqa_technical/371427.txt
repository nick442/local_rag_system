"> You ARE naive in that you are concerned about employees who have already choosen for the most part their career fates. You call me ""naïve"" for being concerned for my fellow man? How is that ""[naïve](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/naive)""? Read what I wrote. I don't disagree with one word of your predictions or your statements about the economy. These people are absolutely fucked. I have never said otherwise. _It simply makes me sad that all these humans will suffer._ That doesn't make me naïve - that makes me a decent human being. The fact that you are willing to call me names simply because I express concern for these people speaks for itself. The fact that I've been downvoted heavily for saying it speaks badly of the compassion of the people reading this subreddit."
