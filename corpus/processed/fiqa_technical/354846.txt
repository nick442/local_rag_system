I guess it depends on what you mean by 'too big'.. IMO, the amount of Data collected aggregated and controlled by Google, FB, MS and Apple.. is more than a little concerning. It's not the size of the company or specifically, how much money they have that causes me worry, or even the fairly obvious monopolistic-like stranglehold they have on their respective markets, but rather the profound influence they have on the USA and indeed the world at large. Google and facebook can 'paint' trends, create forces in the markets and politics with what equate to simple or minor changes to the way their softwares interact with the us.. the population at large.
