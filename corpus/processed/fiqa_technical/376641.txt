"I'm not sure if you know much about electric motors, but there isn't much to service. There are so few moving parts, and they endure so little wear, that this will very likely be a total non-issue for Tesla. The transaxle will be the thing to possibly need extra servicing, but I'm sure there's a ""normal use"" clause in the warranty that precludes damage from overheating due to heavy loads, etc."
