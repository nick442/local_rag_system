"Noted.. the tricky thing is that some people are quite literally living paycheck to paycheck, even without any extravagant spending. If you're in this boat, and something comes up, like a broken tooth, or a transmission, or something else, and you think, ""Well, I can pay this big bill today, then my check get deposited in 2 days, so I can pay my phone then, even though it'll be a little late, and so on and so on. You weren't going to bounce anything, true, but then the bank took an extra day to deposit a check FROM ANOTHER BRANCH OF THE SAME BANK.. and now you owe them $35. I'm not saying we shouldn't all be financially responsible, we should. It's just that things can be really, really tight for people. ""Just don't spend it,"" literally isn't an option. I honestly have been the best about money when I only had an account that I had to deposit by mail.. I had to plan enough ahead that I couldn't get too low. I'm thinking I may go back to that system, just for that reason."
