It's also fair to point out that Medicare and Medicaid are taking the most expensive citizens out of the private market. If you don't have those, the cost of insurance would go up as wealthier older people sign up and increase the risk pool, and hospital prices would go up as poor people fall back on our only truly socialized healthcare - emergency rooms. Without death panels to filter out the unprofitable even in emergency rooms, you'd really want to subsidize those groups even with a market based solution.
