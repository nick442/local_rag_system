Ah, I see. You are coming at this from a political standpoint rather than a business one. One can not like Trump and think Zuckerberg is wrong for not going. Your bias is you won't do anything that appears to be supporting Trump, same as Zuckerberg. I have not now nor have I ever voiced support for Trump. The government has some serious issues with technology and application of technology throughout the various agencies. Most are some sinkhole of bureaucracy that have different standards and systems in place. Not to mention the widespread tech illiteracy. There have been several attempts to change this, though this is the first time those who actually do it for a living have been brought together this way. Zuckerberg's understanding of integration and scalability could be of use in this capacity. And then you have the tech illiterate making laws about our technology.
