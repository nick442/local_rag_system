Think of it this way. A billionaire may have a net worth of $1B with an income of $300 million per year. In the most likely scenario, (s)he is spending at most $50 a million a year. Now they have the same income as 6,000 separate people making $50 thousand a year. But those people are going to spend maybe 90% of their income. In other words the 6,000 average people are putting an additional $220 million (more than 4 X the billionaire) back into the economy to generate activity and growth.
