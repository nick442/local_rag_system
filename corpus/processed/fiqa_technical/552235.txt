The problem is I can't do anything with those morals. I can't grow my company with it, I can't pay my employees with it and I can't buy things with it. You should he as moral as possible, but when you are so moral that you start making moral choices that just doesn't cost you money but can sink the company or increase the workload on your employees you've done an disservice to your employees.
