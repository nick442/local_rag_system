"Again, you're welcome. It's also important to note (it really cannot be overemphasized) is that the taxes that were increased were/are virtually all the REGRESSIVE ones. The rate of FICA taxation for example on rents, interest, and other ""capital gains"" (i.e. non-payroll income) -- were initially 0%, then later became 0%, and currently are 0%. Meanwhile the FICA rate on average & median payroll (wages/salaries of ""workers"" and ""mid-level managers"", etc) increased from 1% to 15% -- that's a 15x increase, or put another way, it is an increase of 1,500% during less than a single working career (the cost of absolutely NOTHING ELSE in the history of our society increased at anything like that rate; not even education and health care costs, nor even ""housing"" at the peak of the bubble -- and in actuality, just about everything else {including the notorious ""gasoline"" sold by those ""evil"" petroleum companies} actually DECREASED during the same time frame). And then, during virtually the SAME time period, those other taxes increased in a similar (if less egregious) fashion. For example in my Midwestern state, there was no sales tax at all circa 1950. A bit over a decade later, when it was first instituted it was initially set at 3%, but applied only to a select category of goods; subsequently the rate was increased (to 4%, then 5%, then with the addition of various county and municipal ""sales taxes"" to 6% and higher), and more critically, the goods and services that are subject to the tax has increased as well (many of them already with ""hidden/buried"" excise taxes -- so a large portion of the sales tax is actually a ""tax on a tax""). When you realize that as wealth increases, the average expenditure on taxable goods tends does NOT tend increase in anything like a directly proportional manner (i.e. while a person making $50k a year, may pay more than 2x the total sales tax than someone making $25k a year {simply because a big part of the $25k a year goes to ""basic necessities"" of food, rent, etc}, and it is even possible that the person making $100k a year pays a simple 2x in sales tax of the $50k person.. but the $1M a year is HIGHLY unlikely to be paying 10x the sales tax as the $100k a year person) then you begin to realize the way that the ""regressive"" form of those taxes work -- basically ""hobbling"" the middle class and preventing it from reaching ""upper"" middle class status. Now to be ruthlessly blatantly forthright, it is NOT simply a matter of blaming the ""rich"" -- because the lion's share of those ""taxes"" were and are being used to ""redistribute"" money to an ever increasing number of non-working people (either retirees, or ""disabled"" former workers, etc) -- the vast majority of which were things ""demanded"" by the general population. Hence the TANSTAAFL reality. The means that the ""rich/elites"" have used to milk & bilk the system may be *indirectly* linked to those taxes, but in general are actually much more likely to be based on other things (access to leverage/credit & the socialization of bad bets/losses, avoidance of ""wages"" and emphasis on ""capital gains"", etc). Doesn't mean the elites/wealthy AREN'T gaming/scamming the system (indeed, many of them are) -- but at least a significant part of the ""blame"" for the burdensome tax system lies with the people themselves. As another example of the same thing, take ""healthcare insurance"" -- people want their ""insurance"" to not only cover the rare, large expenses (cancer treatment, major accident trauma, etc); but also to cover their ""annual checkups"", etc. -- and then are shocked (shocked I say) when their insurance premiums go UP. Well, what do people expect? If virtually everyone goes for an annual checkup, and that checkup costs per policy are say $300 a year, then how can premiums NOT go up by approximately $300 (+ administration costs)? Did they expect the money to pay those things to magically appear out of nowhere? Seriously; you demand something and eventually (one way or another) you are going to pay for it. --- So in your father and grandfathers eras, they were able to support a larger family in no small part because they were NOT paying for all of those ""safety net"" things. In addition, for what little ""safety net"" *did exist* at the time, the people collecting on it were [demographically tiny versus the larger working/paying class](http://www.ssa.gov/history/ratios.html) (i.e. in 1940 each retiree on social security was ""supported"" by nearly 160 workers; by 1950 the ratio was a tenth of that 1 retiree supported by 16 workers; by 1965 it was a quarter of that {1/40th of the 1940 ratio}, 1 retiree to 4 workers; and currently {2009} it is a 1 to 3 ratio {and set to get a LOT worse as the ""Baby Boomer Bulge"" retires en masse in the coming decade+}.) So basically, your single income job still IS supporting a large ""family"" -- you just aren't supporting them *directly* any more {instead you pay the government, and they get checks ""from the government""}; and the ""family"" you are supporting is probably NOT biologically related to you (i.e. they are someone *else's* kids, parents, etc). And then, just as importantly, since you are no longer *directly* supporting a large family, YOU have essentially ZERO control over the hows/whens/whys of how the money gets spent (whereas your father and grandfather DID get to decide) -- instead the monies are being tossed as ""entitlements"" to the recipients, who, since they have been told (and certainly WANT to believe) that they are just getting ""what they are due"", don't feel that anyone has any RIGHT to tell them how to spend it. (Sorta like as if when your father and grandfather were working, as if their wife, and each of their kids {as well as great grandpa Joe in the back bedroom, and maybe the ""disabled neighbor"" Dave} was LEGALLY GRANTED a government mandated ""allowance"" of 1/10th of your dad/grandad's paycheck -- and instead of your dad/grandad getting his full paycheck, the government required his employer to cut several paychecks paying those ""allowances"" directly to the wife, kids {whose checks would go directly to their schools}, grandpa joe, neighbor Dave, etc -- and they {other than the kids} were then able to spend it on whatever they wanted, and your dad/grandad wouldn't have been able to say ""boo"" about it.) Because when it comes right down to it.. that's what has happened; there's just multiple layers of official/bureaucratic ""obfuscation"" in the middle that hide the transfers under various euphemisms."
