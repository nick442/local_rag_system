"The title of the article is totally misleading. It could just as easily have been ""taking food stamps away from Americans hurts the poor"". It's just a ramble of statements with nothing specific to support any of them. There's no explanation as to why NAFTA is not benefitting Americans. And at points the comments are contradictory - he mentions that free trade supports growth.. well duh. Save yourself 30 seconds of your life and take a pass on this post."
