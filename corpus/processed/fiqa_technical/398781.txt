There seems to be a contradiction here: Home warranties not worth paper they're written on and: What struck us is that the HWC [..] immediately had the unit replaced. There is a huge difference when you buy the insurance yourself and when a bank forces you to buy one. Because in the latter case, the insurance is not for you, it's for the bank to protect their collateral (which is your asset as well). It becomes obvious when a claim comes up, because the insurer is not negotiating with you, it's negotiating with another large financial institution. And as far as the stereotype of banks being ruthless behemoths goes, in this case you happen to benefit from being on the behemoth's side and the insurer simply can't brush off a bank as much as it can brush off a person like you. As you've put it, a house in Phoenix without AC is not worth much, so the bank could not let that happen. Because in case of another foreclosure they would have to fix the AC anyway.
