I'm not being clear enough. I'll try a different tack. What sits *behind* the concept of corporate personhood that gives it such flexibility to pick and choose what parts of natural personhood they want? Bar them from financial involvement in politics? Oh no, that would violate their First Amendment rights, *just like a natural person being muzzled*, can't have that! Write off expenses before paying tax on remaining income? Oh yes, we definitely must keep that, nevermind that a natural person isn't treated like that. Okay, so there is a huge difference between corporate and natural personhood. Even with a [history of corporate personhood](http://www.npr.org/2014/07/28/335288388/when-did-companies-become-people-excavating-the-legal-evolution), what I'm missing is a walk through of the arguments that established the collective rights of an assemblage of natural persons rises to the level where those rights must be secured the same as a natural person. In layman terms, what steps were used to reach that conclusion? Without going to law school and then slogging through the actual historical decisions?
