I'd argue that zoning laws are not even I'm the same boat as taxi companies. Also, again, good on Uber. If the market is broken, and normal citizens can't do shit about it, I'm glad that something or someone could. Look. There is no reason that a taxi medallion in NYC was considered a good investment, in a competitive market it wouldn't have been. There is no good reason that the number of cabs on the streets of NYC were the same two years ago as they were in the 60s, despite rampant pupulation and tourism growth.
