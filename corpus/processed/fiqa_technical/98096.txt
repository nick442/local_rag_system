"because bankers are crooks is a very close answer. Just accept the truth that financial industry is the only service industry that could turn into giant parasite chopping pieces from real economy. I am not anti-financial, because greed is not banker's fault, but just one significant part of human nature. Every human being has greed and fear built in it. But financial industry is the only one which is built on exploiting greed and fear. Governments are throwing gasoline canister into that fire in desperate extinguish attempts, trying to ""regulate"" but only making it worse. With all that ""counter-cybercrime"", ""counter-terrorism"" and ""counter-everything"" efforts, ordinary people will be hurt as always."
