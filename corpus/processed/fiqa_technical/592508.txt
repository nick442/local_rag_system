">My point was more that I've seen, firsthand, people not take financial responsibility for their dependents or for themselves, and that they can't be trusted in investing in any future. I agree.

The compromising moderate in me wants to say ""lets find a way to replace social security with something better."" >Given I'm still in great health and in my 20's I probably ought to look into getting more/real Life Insurance, as well.
