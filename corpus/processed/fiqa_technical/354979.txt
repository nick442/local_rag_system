Just so you know, when you started off with being angry about being down voted, you sounded like a stupid teenager who is just saying bullshit to sound big and I assumed just as much (sorry). You should not worry about upvotes/downvotes as they dont not mean anything and so you should not let it get to you. You're going to get downvoted a lot on reddit, dont worry about it. I actually moved from Australia also to the US so you obviously have a better view then I do here ( im definitely talking out my ass here :D). So i know that china has more phones available then iphones but are iphones really that popular ? By what you say, it sounds like apples market dominance is extremely high there. Haha, from what I have read, I always thought that chinese workers worked in pretty bad conditions and there would not be any opportunity to play games while at work.
