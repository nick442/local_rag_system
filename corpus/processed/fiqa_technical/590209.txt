Why is OP still using BoA? I got a large check when my grandfather died, my credit union told me that there'd be a delay because it was so large. I said no problem. Then a lady called me later that day to make sure I didn't need some of the money immediately. I again demurred, but they really went the extra mile. Why? Because local credit unions actually give a shit about their customers. Anyone who uses BoA for banking gets what they deserve. How many more stories do you need to read?
