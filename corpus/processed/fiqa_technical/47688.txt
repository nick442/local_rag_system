First of all, the picture says it all. This is written by some young girl that is clueless to the world. Yes, I looked her up, but besides creating some things of her own, what start ups has she worked for. To say they make you slave away seems pretty off base. Second, I work for one of the top software companies in the world. They work the hell out of people, seldom hand out raises, etc. I am lucky that my position is not overworked like many of the others here. Meanwhile, I worked for a start up, friends worked for start ups, and we acquired TONS of start ups where I work. At the start up I worked for, I used to put in some crazy hours some days, but I could take them all back by leaving early other days. Everyone was relaxed, nobody was micromanaged, there were parties and work functions, beer Fridays, and it was just a great atmosphere. We also had awesome coffee. I can't drink the swill here. Other start ups that I have known had foosball, pool tables, basket ball hoops, and other things making it fun to work there. It has been my experience that start ups are generally where you want to be, and not giant corporations that are very well established. The people that were acquired all tend to hate it here when compared to their previous jobs.
