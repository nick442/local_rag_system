"Can confirm - when I owned my business I would outsource some of the ""lesser"" work to a guy in the Philippines - he was more than $15/hr. This was about 5 years ago, I don't remember exact rate, but I think was about $25/hr. And it was worth it. I had a guy in the US too, who was great and worth every penny, but I couldn't afford him for everything so I used the guy in Philippines for the smaller stuff. I would feel terrible and insulting asking my guy here to work for less. He was worth what he was asking."
