Are you looking specifically at financial services; or what the people in your company's finance department do all day? Investopedia has a layman overview of most Financial Services jobs: http://www.investopedia.com/university/financial-careers/ Corporate Finance is essentially divided into capital budgeting and working capital management, with dozens of titles for people doing these two things. Not to be confused with Accounting, which is tracking everything. The two are often housed together because finance needs accounting for their starting point on anything.
