You should plan on your monthly payment (Principal + Interest + Escrow) being a conservative percentage of your take home pay. No matter your cash savings, if your housing is 60% of your take home pay you are going to have trouble keeping up on the house. My target for housing is that a 15 year, fixed rate mortgage should be under 25% of my take home pay. For some people, they find that too conservative. I think the exact percent is a risk/reward preference. Some people like the 25% number but look at a 30 year mortgage. Whatever you do, don't buy a house at the limit of what the bank thinks you can afford :) Historically, they have been more willing for me to spend my money than I have been.
