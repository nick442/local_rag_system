"Do you need the capital? If you not, are you considering taking it to help you grow faster? To lower your downside risk? In terms of deal structure start with your financial model and evaluate your payback period and IRR.. Think if you were investor how much of a split would you need to compensate the risk you are taking. Generally the investor will want to get 100% of their original investment paid back plus a annual 8% ""preferred"", return and after they are made whole 80% of proceeds, but I've seen restaurant deals at 50/50 splits and no preferred return. I'd try to ensure you get a salary and/or management fee. Make sure you retain control and rights! Don't sign anything without legal review."
