"Just a real-world counterpoint, in the UK, we negotiate the ""before tax"" salary as some number of pounds per period of time. Out of this amount, income tax is typically deducted and this calculation is quoted on the payslip. (Like most of the rest of the world.) However, there's another grade of income tax called ""Employer’s National Insurance"". This is calculated just like the other forms of income tax, paid by the employer directly, but the employee never sees this on their payslip and it is not part of the negotiated salary. https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-rates-letters/contribution-rates So say you're an employer and you've budgeted £1000/month for a potential employee's salary. You'd have to offer that person £878.73/month salary to bring the amount you'd actually be paying to the £1000 you've budgeted. Why they do this, I have no idea. https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/4917/what-is-the-rationale-for-employers-national-insurance-in-the-uk"
