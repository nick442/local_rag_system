"> How does Equifax lose sales after a breech? Unless their data has been corrupted or falsified, it's still good to sell or charge for each credit pull. That might be true (it might not be - I don't know how flexible demand is between the 3 bureau's). But it isn't true for most breaches. >all three are above their pre-hack prices. Sure. But they lost a lot of money after the breaches >I don't think the penalty should be ""death"" but considering their total assets is $10B, I don't think any fair penalty would allow the organization to survive. If they were Apple with $820B market cap, then yeah, the $70B would be a harsh and fair, but survivable penalty. To make it ""fair"" (if there is such a thing) you'd want it to be proportional. So if it'd be 70B for Apple, it'd be about $850MM for Equifax. That's how you'd want it done if you want it done by operation of law (as opposed to markets and courts)."
