Most rural areas are almost 100% red so you and your family/friends can be the exception but it's definitely not the rule by a long shot. The majority of rural areas continuously vote red over and over in spite of any logic or rational ideas. It's difficult to have sympathy for a group so opposed to their own well being and well being of others strictly based on an ideology that doesn't have a basis in reality.
