I've never forgotten mine either, but it's a constant fear for me. Couple of friends of mine have. I honestly don't know which machines beep and which don't, but I've heard of people forgetting their cards in ATMs, cigarette vending machines, train ticket machines, McDonald's express order machines and some others I can't remember. The screen of these machines always reminds you, and I think it's hard to forget it, but evidently it does happen. I still use my cards, it's not like I have a crippling fear every time I use it, I just made a habit of always carrying cash and using it for small stuff. I live in Germany, cash is (still?) Accepted everywhere.
