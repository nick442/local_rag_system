I think you misunderstand my point. My post *is* rather vague. I'm saying that making an open post countering the company's public stance on diversity is unwise and is an inappropriate way to address any real concerns in general. If it is merely an opinion you'd like to voice, there are many other social outlets which would be more appropriate for personal use than the company's internal network.
