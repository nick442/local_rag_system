Putin thinks Russia is the only country in the world and it can exist independent from others but it is not like that at all. None of the russian people deserve such communist attitude. It is not the 80's or earlier, Putin is not Stalin or maybe he wants to be just like him - a dictator or a fuhrer. What is this dictatorship or something? It's 2014 and it's a free world.
