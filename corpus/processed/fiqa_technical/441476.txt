> Michael Preiss was happy to escape the corporate grind after being laid off by International Business Machines Corp. in 2001. He became a contractor, earning more than $100,000 a year from steady assignments helping companies figure out how to do things faster and cheaper. > That work eventually dried up. The past decade has been a revolving door of outsourced jobs for shrinking pay, fear that any day at a company could be his last, and reminders that full-time employees live in a different world, even though they often sit at the next desk. Mr. Preiss says one manager reprimanded him because co-workers complained that he laughed too loudly. An experienced tech contractor that does process reengineering who earns less than $50 per hour? Something doesn't add up. Many industries have contractors who are taken advantage of. In tech, contractors are often making 50-100% MORE than employees. It is highly lucrative, a huge portion are contractors by choice (I am yet to work at a firm that didn't try to offer a lowball permanent position).
