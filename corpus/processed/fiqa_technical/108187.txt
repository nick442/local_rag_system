">All you have to do is survey the main cast of characters in finance and politics to assess the generational culpability. Dimon, Blankfein, Geithner - all Gen X. **Ummm, excuse me? But you're so full of SHIT it's coming out your ears.** [Baby Boom: ~1946. ~1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boom_in_the_United_States#Definition_of_the_boom_years) [Generation X: ~1964/65.~1982](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X#Date_range) **And as to your specific ""cast of characters"":** * [Jamie Dimon, born **1956**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon) -- BOOMER. * [Lloyd Blankfein, born **1954**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Blankfein) -- BOOMER * [Timothy Geithner, born **1961**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Geithner) -- BOOMER Shall we go on? * [Bill Clinton, born **1946**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jefferson_%22Bill%22_Clinton) -- BOOMER * [George W. Bush, born **1946**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_w_bush) -- BOOMER * [Barack Obama, born **1961**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) -- BOOMER and of course.. * [Ben Bernanke, born **1953**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke) -- BOOMER Heck, let's even throw in.. * [Paul Krugman, born **1953**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman) -- BOOMER * [Larry Summers, born **1954**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Summers) -- BOOMER ..and the list goes ON and ON (and the culprits are ALL Baby Boomers). --- You're right.. Gen X wasn't ""raped"" -- Gen X was ""molested and abused in every way possible"" by it's older Baby Boomer siblings (who were EVER only concerned with ""getting off"" themselves -- hence they appropriately were called the ""me, Me, ME"" generation their entire live). And of course, nothing in that generation has changed -- they are STILL in charge, and are now ""molesting and abusing"" the NEXT generations -- their own children & grandchildren in Gen Y (and the still literal children of Gen Z, many of whom have yet to even be born)."
