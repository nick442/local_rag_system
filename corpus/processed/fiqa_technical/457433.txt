I'd imagine societies will tend to glorify whatever their economies require - after inventing matches, starting fires with sticks is no longer glorified as much. After a colonial empire collapses and they are no longer getting agricultural tributes from their colonies, I'd imagine they'd start glorifying agricultural work again more than their recent history.
