It's not that I won't debate with people with opposing viewpoints. I simply do not have the time, no matter my inclinations, to take on countless numbers of logical fallacies from people who are the ones who made them in the first place. Do you spend your days in 9/11-truther forums? Why not? If you're right, why not debate them? Same thing.
