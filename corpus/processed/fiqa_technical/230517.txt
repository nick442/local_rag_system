Which explains why my job as a high school English teacher did not sustain my family and I without part time jobs, summer jobs, and getting into some debt. My wife stayed at home with our three children for the first 11 years. When I finally began a new year-round teaching job at a youth prison, we could finally own a nice home and decent car. But it was very difficult. We returned birthday presents and I worried a lot about making enough money for our family. We did not have health insurance for the first seven years of our marriage because we wanted to be able to eat.
