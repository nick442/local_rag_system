>1) Everyone is going to get sick. Which is why everybody has an incentive to cover themselves with THEIR OWN insurance policies. >2) Most medical issues happen by chance.

Which is why it's so important that people have a strong financial incentive to stay healthy - i.e. not being healthy is expensive, and people should feel those expenses personally. >4) It is morally the right thing to do.

It is expedient. >There is no death spiral yet. You're just buying the Republican talking points. I don't care about any political party's talking points.
