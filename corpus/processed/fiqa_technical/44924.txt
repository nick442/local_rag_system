I'll check them out I'll ask though that he seems, from your synopsis to be criticizing how those in developed, 1st world, nations (especially educated it seems) to how these discrepancies came about but I didn't see anything about why they did. Why isn't it that educated Africans are ignorant as to why they are thriving while destitute white nations are not. Chimps may pick better stocks but we aren't living under their rule. Educated people can certainly get things wrong but the overall culture and society they produce is far superior as evidenced but their success vs the lack thereof for African ones. I don't see how South Korea falls into this? How is that analogous. Also not understanding how low growth and exploding populations in poor nations bolsters your argument.
