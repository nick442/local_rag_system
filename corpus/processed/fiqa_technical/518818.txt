It doesn't matter what industry. 25% *is* high growth. Especially for a company of that size. Their Debt/Equity was flat from '14 to '15, decreased in '16, and has decreased again LTM. And they aren't issuing equity, so how are they financing themselves? Their inventory turnover has been greater than 8x since 2012 because a lot of their sales aren't actually held as inventory. So with AWS as the huge growth engine, along with Amazon Prime, and a significant portion of sales not tied to inventory, I'm not sure why you think the key driver of this equity will be inventory turns. That's just such a value play and frankly, I think, not that relevant to Amazon's future growth potential. Almost all high growth equities are valued on a FY1 P/E ratio. That ratio is comped out on other metrics like same store sales (retail), average monthly users (social media), etc. and some sense of how those metrics convert to future earnings. I personally think this method makes sense. Due to the compounding nature of growth rates and the high variability you are never going to get seriously comfortable with you future earnings projections. You basically say what are earnings going to be for the next 12 months and then express growth potential beyond that, the quality of NTM earnings and your uncertainty by adjusting the P/E.
