"This is a poor example really. It's not necessary to measure inequality from the position of a janitor. It's more illustrative to measure it from the educated middle class, who have also fallen sharply in household wealth relative to the 1%. This trend is more surprising and disturbing as it runs counter to the great 20th century trend of a rising middle class. If you want to understand inequality just look at the rate of investment and the relative rate of return achieved by the 1% Not only is the wealth of the 1% increasing, it is increasing at a faster rate. Needless to say that difference compounds over time. Until we have an extended period of the wealthy losing money at a faster rate than the less wealthy, inequality will rise. And also needless to say, that scenario is forever and always unacceptable to the 1% It's easy to talk about solutions to inequality right up until someone asks ""How are we going to make the wealthy less wealthy in a relative sense?"" At which point you realize there are no serious efforts being made against inequality."
