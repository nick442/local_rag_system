>I agree that double taxation makes no sense regardless of individual or corporation. Having said that, it's my understanding that Murca offers corporations tax credits on foreign taxes paid to avoid double taxation. I'm pretty sure that a similar vehicle exists for individuals as well. My issue is entirely with corporations paying off legislators to avoid taxes that they have an obligation to pay in the country that they operate. Context, friend. The statement you quoted was in reference to the issue of double taxation. Hence the statement was made in attempt to indicate that no issue with the responder's stance on double taxation, but in fact the paying for and receiving tax concessions. The statement certainly could have been more comprehensive in identifying legislators as equally culpable in its part. Your attempt to cherry pick a statement out of context is disingenuous. Bro, do you work for Fox?
