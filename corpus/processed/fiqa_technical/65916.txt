"None. The first ""caja"" that ""required"" a rescue from the spanish government was Caja Castilla la Mancha. This ""caja"" was a special entity created by the spanish local government and had politicians in the governing board. This politicians were from the ruling party of that region, at that time PSOE (socialist party of Spain). The funny part is that the president then, Zapatero from the same socialist party, went to London for a G20 meeting and his main reivindication was that the world governments needed to fight against tax paradises. The same week he was there spreading this message it was known that directors of Caja Castilla la Mancha (remember, politicians from the same party) had set up a special entity in a fiscal paradise so their speculations would be cheaper. Obviously nothing happened to those people."
