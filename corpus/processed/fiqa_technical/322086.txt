you're correct in that email & www is one of the reasons for the decline in first class mail. but while convenient to get electronic statements, and payments, I don't do them for the following reasons. there's no float on your funds, two a bill by mail is a legal document, in many cases with electronic payments if there is a dispute you have to request in writing, by mail the item(s) that in dispute. lastly, like any business these days, its not like they're passing on any savings to you for the costs they've saved by not using a friggin stamp. its like the self checkout. shouldn't you get a discount for checking out your own groceries? also i'd be remised if i did not point out the sorry state of the adoption and availability of broadband in this country. 15% are still on dialup. anyway.
