">I for one cannot understand why government workers (including Police, Sheriff, Fire, Highway Patrol, etc.) deserve a pension of 80% or more after working 20+ years. Because (a) workers are pretty sure that government will be around N years down the road, so will accept pensions from it, and (b) it's usually cheaper in terms of political cost to give a government worker an IOU and say ""my successor will pay you the rest of what we agreed to pay you years down the road, and coming up with the funds will be his problem""."
