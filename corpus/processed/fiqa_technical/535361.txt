Yeah its just scary. I'm glad you said no. I'm not saying it couldn't work. But I legit don't know anyone who has done it and been successful. My mentor in the business quit a year or so after I did and he had been hitting it hard for 4-5 years. He made a little money off of it but nothing compared to what he was putting in. I can honestly say I learned some great things from the materials they promoted but I can't honestly give them credit for referring me to others work. They had their own books the founders had written which were good and all, but they mostly were a regurgitation of all the other successful leadership books they promoted. Good for you though. If you know anybody getting involved in this make sure you tell them to stay away. It's so scary how these companies are allowed to do business with the failure rate they have for people who sign up.
