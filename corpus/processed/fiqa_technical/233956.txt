Anybody who feels Whole Foods quality is not about to **immediately** take a huge, enormous crash, is in complete denial. Amazon didn't buy the produce section of the dollar store, they bought a big name in **quality**. Now, they must immediately run that name into the ground. Sure, people who used to produce shop at Walmart will see this as a step up in quality, but cutting costs will come long before raising prices, and those costs are not just *shipping.*
