I doubt balsamic onion gastrique is a very scalable product. But really, I'm confused about what's replacing dirt-cheap burgers for the low-income market. All of the products that are replacing them by this analysis are more expensive, which indicates they're probably capturing a different sector of the market. So the question is what are their former customers actually eating now, and has the low-income bracket fallen so low that not even dollar menus are affordable? Or is there some sort of cultural shift occurring in that demographic?
