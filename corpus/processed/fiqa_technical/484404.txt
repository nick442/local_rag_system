Great idea! So lets make Trader Joes in locations where people need living wages, like the ghetto, because that has been working. /s You make a store that makes a premium selling to the upper middle class, and can afford to pay their workers more because of these better margins from their abnormally higher prices. It doesn't work in areas where cheap food is a necessity. These kinds of stores can't sell in all economic classes so these stores giving living wages don't solve any issues we have regarding wage. Gentrification doesn't work so I don't see why I keep seeing articles talk about Trader Joes suddenly solving our minimum wage debate. If I see a company that rivals Walmart in price, yet can give a living wage while still being profitable, then we have something. Costco is what comes to mind, and to be honest it's probably the best example we can take from a good business that is able to give a decent wage for unskilled labor while still being profitable. The issue is, not everyone can afford to spend $100 to buy 20 jars of nutella to save 10 cents a jar to rival Walmart's savings.
