Are you daft?? In most US cities it’s **illegal** to run a private bus/mass-transit business. However, here’s two examples if it will get you to STFU: https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/09/the-unique-genius-of-hong-kongs-public-transportation-system/279528/ https://thedetroitbus.com http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/28/google-buses-corporate-shuttles-popular-poll/ Notice how Google and other companies that use buses for employees have to do it at no cost, because governments made it **illegal** for them to charge money for mass-transit services.
