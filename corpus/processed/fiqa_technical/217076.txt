"I'm a big believer in to-do lists, particularly dividing them up into weekly, monthy and of course, yearly goals/objectives. Not only does it press you into thinking ""what do I want to achieve with my time"", you start pursuing goals in more structured, coherent manner. I reccomend everyone, especially those with a predisposition to being easily distracted to start up a list, you'll be a lot more compelled to see things through to completion as opposed to making to empty, hollow promises to yourself/loved ones."
