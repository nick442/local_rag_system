Contact the bank where the money is being sent. They should have a record of it, and they will know what happened to it. In some, maybe even most, banks accounts are never truly closed, they are just made inactive. If that is the case with this bank the 300 euro may be sitting in the account as a credit. If they have the money, ask for them to send it to back by reversing the transaction. If it has been too long they may have another procedure for refunding the money. They might even send it by check. If they already reversed the transaction, contact your bank to determine where the funds went.
