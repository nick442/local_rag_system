I'm extremely suspicious of the assertion that tenure is a good proxy for quality of teaching. I'd like to see some sort of backing to that claim. Also, I'm not so sure that performance measurement of students is all that difficult--after all, thousands of secondary institutions do it every year and generally do a pretty good job. There are certain basic skills that primary school-aged children need to have, and we have reasonably good metrics to determine if they have them. Gaming the system only occurs with improper alignment of incentives, which is clearly a difficult challenge but not one that I think is insurmountable.
