It's self evident that you're shrieking and not making a salient point? I agree. No one said shit about apprenticeships. This is about formal secondary education which is not required by 5 states (as I said) to take the bar. I don't think I'm the one that can't read. It's also fucking hilarious that you're accusing me of having no reading comprehension skills when you pulled out the 90% number like it was so sort of revelation when I'd already mentioned it in my original comment. Kinda pathetic if we're being honest.
