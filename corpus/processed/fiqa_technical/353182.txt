The majority of illegal immigrants do not work in the field of agriculture. That being said work visas to fill needed niches such as field farm work can be applied for and permitted so that farmers can have the LEGAL foreign workers they need allowed into the country given any legitimate demonstrated need for that industry. The problem is that then these workers would be much more protected then a class of workers who are essentially illegal immigrants and who do work off the books and out of sight and management of the federal government's ability to track them and if need be offer them actual protections as foreign workers on a visa work permit.
