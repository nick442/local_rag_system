The government employs 13 million people. Not even including that small time construction guy paid to redo the sidewalk at the city hall. Or money given in grants for research employing scientists. That's 1 out of 10 good paying jobs. But yeah let's pretend increasing taxes on less than 1% of the population, and 500 companies out of 28 million is worse than lowering it, and firing chunks of 13 million employees.
