"Summarized article: Facebook will pay $10 million to settle a proposed class action lawsuit from 5 users who claimed their names, images and other information were used improperly in advertising called ""sponsored stories"" without giving compensation or a chance to opt out. A sponsored story is an ad that appears on a user's Facebook page that shows another friend's name, profile picture and a ""like"" by the friend as an implied endorsement of the company. The district judge ruled that economic injury could occur through the use of the user's name and likeness in Facebook advertising. The case, filed in California, reached a settlement in May but the terms were not disclosed until recently. The proposed class action suit could have included almost 1 of every 3 Americans totaling billions of dollars in damages. The $10 million settlement will be given to charity. * For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit"
