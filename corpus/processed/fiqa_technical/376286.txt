I'd recommend getting online quotes from several insurance companies. During the process of getting a quote, you will be asked for the year/make/model of your car. You can put in one of the cars you were thinking about buying and get a quote. Then start over and try with a different type of car. This should show you how the insurance will compare between different cars. I've done this in the past when I was trying to make a decision on a car purchase. It takes a while, but seemed worth it to me.
