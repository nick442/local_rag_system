Yes, as I mentioned in another comment my girlfriend has a Nook (which I bought her) and I had an older Sony e-reader my mom bought but never used. I wasn't aware you could lend on the Kindle but i know the Nook has that function. It just seems so much easier to hand them a paper copy than to make sure your friend has the same e-reader as you and that they bought it from the same source as you. I guess it's good everyone and their mother has either a Kindle or a Nook - it makes it much easier to share. But sharing a physical book is as easy as pointing to your shelves and saying 'find one you like.' I'm not as avid a reader as I used to be, but I still buy about one book a week (most of them history related). I put them on my self and read through them, much slower now than I used to. In some books I'll make notes in the margins or put post its to save quotes I like. I know you can do something similar with the Kindles but it just seems so much better to do it in a book, you know? Maybe I'm a bit old school. Plus, lighting a fire in the fire place, pouring a glass of scotch, and sitting in a huge high backed chair by the fire just doesn't feel as classy with an e-book, hahah.
