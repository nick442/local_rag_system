"But WhatsApp started up after FB and Google owned chat. They just saw an untapped market in crappy hand held devices and went after it. I suspect their plan all along was for acquisition and they executed that marvelously. They were not ""worth"" $19B, but FB was willing to pay that much to prevent Google from grabbing half a billion sets of eyeballs. So.. no monopoly."
