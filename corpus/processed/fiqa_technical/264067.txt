well you had it a bit backwards. the more liquid a market is, the less important the idea of insider information becomes. this is the opposite in less liquid markets - such as low volatile stocks about to announce earnings. knowing the earnings would net you a much larger percentage than, say, knowing if the ECB will cut rates of not. the change will be a much larger % and as with currencies, it is more important to know what the major players are planning - as in, central banks and reserves, carry trades, etc.
