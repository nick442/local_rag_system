"Just like I've been banging on about around here: once the market realised his tax plan isn't coming, his great deregulation is either not coming or going to be smaller and not quite as stiff as it should be, the hot air will come out of this ""Trump bump"". I'm not saying it's gonna be a big crash. But it's going to come back to reality and the market will realise that, just like most new presidents, he has limited ability to fuel a sustained stock market rally."
