because it's not cheaper? it's virtually free to run a private chain (no transaction fees, no competition for mining), it doesn't require even a millionth of a fraction of the maintenance resources, and you maintain total operational control over it (bitcoin could crash, it's encryption could be broken, 100's of things could change which would totally shitbrick your internal infrastructure). lastly, if you want, you can destroy the chain (say if you are sharing private documents with another legal firm, you can destroy the chain when the case is done, the documents wont be floating in a public chain for perpetuity). the mega chain is a very stupid idea because it forces everything to be hosted by everyone, which very quickly loses feasibility, instead you will likely see an increase in very specific use case chains.
