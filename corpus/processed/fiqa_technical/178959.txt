I don't agree. Over regulation acts as a natural barrier to entry so that only the richest of companies can afford to be in compliance - effectively shutting off markets from entrants and small business owners. Going to one extreme or the other is harmful. That is why I am a believer in promoting free and open markets with laws and regulations that discourage monopolies.
