If the buyside was showing demand, what's wrong with HFT for reacting with supply? The example you gave is akin to me going from car dealership to car dealership yelling loudly about what car I want and the price I'd like it at - would you be upset if someone heard you and decided to sell their car to you later down the line? In this case, the buy side trader is being **stupid**. This is a major critique many people have with Brad K. Instead of serially going from exchange to exchange, he could have sent orders to all exchanges at the same time (parallel!) and likely received much better prices. In my opinion, the HFT player here is simply facilitating price discovery by reacting to demand - as a market maker that's his job. [Here's a good article. Let me know what you think.](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101551570)
