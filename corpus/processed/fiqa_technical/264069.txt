Hang on, hang on.. I am willing to bet there are a lot of farmers that do it for the money, and a lot that do it because they want to provide a better product (e.g. free range pigs) along with the money. My point was they're not mutually exclusive. Same goes for pharma. And frankly I've contracted in the industry. I've seen heads of R&D get tipsy and come to tears thinking of the kids they've seen with fibrosis in poor countries. I never said they're a charity - they're not - however, I've seen them do amazingly charitable things when instead they could've just given back to shareholders.
