its not so much that NFIP is a problem, as it is that it subsidizes building there. Without it, there would still be government bailouts/relief aid. The problem with a privatized system instead of a fair assessed insurance price is the extra 20% tacked on to premiums to cover insurer profits. Basically though, there has been some privatization of flood insurance in US areas, and premiums are skyrocketting. Its politically difficult to raise these premiums, and all of the insurance companies believe in global warming/climate change. Its easier to privatize and cause even higher premiums, than it is to vote for the one who will raise NFIP premiums.
