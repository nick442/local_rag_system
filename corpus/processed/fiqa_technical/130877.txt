"In addition top the great answers above (esp Joe Taxpayer: ""if traveling is your passion, do it!) let me add my two cents: I recommend always having TWO vacations planned. It's a wonderful way to go through life: It doesn't really matter how long until the next vacation, or how expensive it will be. Just that it's planned and out there makes for extra happiness and good money management. (Can you tell I'm in the same mindset? I love vacations.)"
