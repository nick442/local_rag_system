If HSBC is an option for the country in which you're living I found they have very comprehensive banking services which are very helpful as an expat, including easy wire transfers initiated online. One key aspect is they will honor your US credit score which is helpful while you build a credit history in the new country. If you have enough on deposit with them you may qualify for the HSBC Premier program which then gives you all of those free of charge. That being said, I think their customer service and bureaucracy is horrendous. So once I had established myself locally I switched to a better local bank and use wire transfer services. If you happen to be an expat in Canada there are now starting to be other options with TD and RBC.
