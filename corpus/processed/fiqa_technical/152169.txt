> There were a lot of companies that cut full time jobs in favor of part time. 1) No, [employers didn't cut back full-time employees although some did cut hours of part-time employees to get them under 30 hours](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/yes-some-companies-are-cutting-hours-in-response-to-obamacare/). 2) My objection is not about part-time but that the ACA would not somehow make your company drop insurance. Your company dropped it's plan because it chose to.
