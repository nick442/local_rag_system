"Generally speaking you are not allowed to falsely represent models in a material way with a general model release. For example, you can't take a stock photo and put them in an ad that says ""I support puppy mills,"" making it look as though the model in question holds such a political view. Sexual misrepresentation is covered under this as well, so this model definitely has a case that her image was misused. (The same would not apply to statements generally not considered sensitive like ""Shop at Safeway!"" or ""Dr. Gavrys gives great smiles!"" as long as they do not appear to be quotes from the model.) Beyond such legal shenanigans, however, a large multinational corporation such as Burger King should really be hiring their own model for an ad campaign such as this, who knows exactly what she is getting into, simply as a matter of responsibility and good taste. It isn't good PR to choose some poor individual and misuse them in a way they find humiliating, since you can certainly find a model who would sign on for such a campaign in good faith."
