I inherited nothing and have retired comfortably in my 50s after some hard work, tradeoffs etc., however I am quite certain that there are millions who are more intelligent, harder-working, talented and haven't had my luck. Good luck can get you there, bad luck will stop you, in either case more completely than inheritance, contacts, diligence or talent. It's worth remembering that the best luck is good health.
