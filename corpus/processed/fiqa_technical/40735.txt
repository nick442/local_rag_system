> you should never hire someone to work for you unless you would work for them Sounds great in theory, but that one thing assumes a lot of organizational and cultural debt has already been overcome in your organization, which isn't always the case. Too often a less than ideal rewards system turns the success of peers into an economic or political threat, or even if such problems were solved, the culture that remains turns it into an ego-related threat. Avoiding it almost requires you having to be in love with them, but even among spouses, it doesn't always work that way..
