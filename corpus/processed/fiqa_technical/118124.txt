That 2t is if you invest the money for a decade before cutting checks, which is the methodology with which I mentioned I disagree. From the article: > After spending a little quality time in Microsoft Excel, I’d say it’s somewhere the ballpark of $1,350 per household, or $1,000 per worker.* If you divide $1000 per worker by ten years, you get $100 per year, which is what I said and which the title mislabeled. Edit: I see what you mean, I typed households instead of workers. Thanks for pointing out my typo, I edited the comment to correct and show I misspoke originally. Also I put 200b instead of 2t. Either way, the point is it is $100 per year, not $1000. I should’ve paid attention when commenting, but the point remains valid
