"Why are you labeling people who criticize you as trolls? Anomander wrote a response that included more insight than your article. He said that you're writing style was a little weak but essentially agreed with you. Instead of accepting his insight and perhaps building on his response, you called him out for accidentally leaving the ""s"" off of she. That kind of pedantry more closely resembles troll like behavior. You instantly went into defense mode, saying how experienced and successful you are and that people don't know what they're talking about. Your comments aren't getting downvoted because people are jealous of your success, but because you're acting like a self-righteous, know-it-all toddler."
