I am waiting for the day China and India doing military exercise together, right the next day after Trump say China is a threat to India. lol. 9not a real military exercise, but a diplomatic showcase.) This is the exact same thing when US did military exercise with India, thinking they have successfully realigning India, the next month, even bigger military exercise with Russia. Both India and China are not naive, they certainly know what US role was during the 60's and 70's vis a vis today's scheme. Both countries know they have bigger fish to fries than punching each other in the face because some american told them so. Not peace or detente, but certainly not state of war like in 70's anymore.
