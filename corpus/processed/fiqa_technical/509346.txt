What do you think of the argument that corporations shouldn't pay any tax, since investors pay tax on the dividends, and if the corporations paid too, that would be double taxation? Of course, not all corporate income goes to pay dividends. Much of the rest is deducted as business expense. Is there some corporate income which should properly be taxed?
