"There are healthy people and there are sick people. Each are that way because of their genetics, behavior, and (somewhat) luck. To some extent health insurance is insurance, and covers that luck.. But mostly the Affordable Care Act and healthCare.gov are about health care.. It's a scheme to allocate burdens, not to insure against risk. Healthy people dont think this is fair. ""When I invest time at the gym, invest money and time on healthy food, invest in learning healthy habits.. And someone else doesn't.. Why should I have to pay for their heart replacement? The freerider chooses to risk heart disease while I foot their bill, I pay twice prevention for myself and a cure for him, while he increases the cost for us all. "" Genetics is a touchy subject, but.. if someone has a hugely expensive heridatible disease.. Should that person and their spouse bear the burdens of having and raising their kids? If they can't afford to do so, should the rest of society have to take money away from their own families to finance that family's reproduction?"
