Wow that's new and exciting. But I think that humans have that potential to bring out something that uniquely is their own in whatever they are making. Yes armies of man and women working routine jobs will eventually be replaced by software or robots. I guess then those people will need to use creativity or learn new skills and adapt to what is needed. Probably new trends and new needs and new problems and opportunities will emerge. I doubt that automatic future is so very close. It's more like specific in some areas of business models, but not overall phenomenon that will change world to be unreconizable, at least not so soon.
