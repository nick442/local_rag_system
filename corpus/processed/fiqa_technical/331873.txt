I've worked at companies with free meals before and though the perk is nice, people eat way too much of it. Maybe it's a survival trait we held onto where if food is free we over eat it. For example; my colleagues eat pretty healthy and so do I. But I like ice cream in the summer so every week I stock our work freezer with various ice cream sandwiches, drumsticks, etc. they're cheap so it's not a big deal but people who normally wouldn't eat ice cream are now eating Neapolitan sandwiches in the morning and another after lunch. It inspired others to start catering our mornings with coffee cakes and stuff. Everyone loves having this stuff around. Now, nobody is unhealthy or overweight, they're managing it well. But just that example alone of providing free treats shows how willing people are to perhaps over indulge or engage in behavior they typically wouldn't. If you put free stuff in front of people they'll eat it even if it's not a normal part of their diet. I think you're onto something here. If you know they'll overdo it, put the cheaper and healthier veggies on the front.
