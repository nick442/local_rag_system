> why is it that in the soviet union, which redistributed wealth to an extreme had a population that was equal, but all equally poor? Yes, welfare programs are exactly equivalent to communism and also the downfall of the Soviet Union was a direct consequence of their welfare programs and totally unrelated to anything else. Furthermore Ayn Rand was right, being poor is evil and poor people are holding the wealthy back from achieving their potential. Let's remove all the taxes, trickle down economy is a fact, that money is going to go directly into the poor people's pockets due to ECONOMY, so we don't need to worry about like one or two percent of the people hoarding all of it and/or using it to influence new regulations that help prevent other players from entering markets.
