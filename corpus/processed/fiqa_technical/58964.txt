From the IRS: You do not include in your gross income qualified distributions or distributions that are a return of your regular contributions from your Roth IRA(s). It's not just that the particular money you take from the IRA isn't taxable. It's not counted as part of your income at all, so it won't have any effect on the taxation of other income.
