"> What's their benchmark for considering the deal ""done""? Getting out employee checks with the name of the new company? Well, there's usually about an 18-month consolidation window after the deal closes to combine operations before the market really starts wondering why you're burning through cash supporting a closed M&A. That's going to include the removal and/or consolidation of redundant business units from HR, to marketing, etc. From an IT perspective though, the business *usually* completely ignores the fact that modern white-collar businesses are essentially different formulations of businesses leveraging IT or severely underestimates how reliant they are on technology. That is, the consolidation of business units needs to include the consolidation of IT for economies of scale to be realized. It's fine and dandy to say your direct reports are being consolidated under business unit X but what if your HR program PeopleSoft and theirs is successfactors? How much time and money is that going to take to select the best system and get all of your shit in one place? Rule of thumb? 4x whatever the buisness thinks and 1.5x what the IT guy says. What about your identity platforms? What if, god forbid, you are an entirely IBM shop and the acquired company is entirely Microsoft? What about those old fuckin mainframes plenty of insurance companies and banks are keeping around? All that data needs to get moved/consolidated/etc. I'm there to annoy the shit out of the business so when the board says ""did this ever come up"" our VPs and CIO can say ""yeah, here are the documents"" and then they start firing management. :D"
