"That's bullshit. If money is ""created"" when bank makes a loan, then money is ""destroyed"" when customer repays the loan. Eventually these two processes even out, so money can be ""created"" only temporarily. You can roll over the loans only to a certain extent, at some point chicken must come home to roost. Current cycle of credit expansion just continues for so long, people lose common sense view and come up with nonsense ""theories""."
