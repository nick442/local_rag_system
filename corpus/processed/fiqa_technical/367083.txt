The problem with fighting Net Neutrality is the name ‘Net Neutrality’ itself. It means nothing to the common person and requires effort to illicit a response. It’s a branding issue. Whenever politicians wants to slip some miserable piece of legislation through they wrap it in ‘Freedom for all Americans’ bill. We need to play dirtier and call this ‘INTERNET DEATH’ or ‘FREE HD PORN REMOVAL’ if we want people to pay attention.
