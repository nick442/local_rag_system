Is that really true though? He brought in via hedge fund when the stock was multiples more in 2004. He loaned it a bunch of money, many billions. He gets the Sears commerial real estate via Seritage but anyone who seen commercial real estate lately knows the market is flooded with excess square footage, retail is being stomped in general, and that Sears/Kmart strip malls in many cases aren't the prime areas anymore. I can see him making out better than the average Stockholder who keeps on holding onto it but nowhere near recuperating his investment. In fact, the average guy could and would have dropped it long ago with an simple website login, these big investors don't have that luxury of dumping stock on a whim so they go down with the ship. http://fortune.com/2017/03/31/sears-eddie-lampert-net-worth-hedge-fund/
