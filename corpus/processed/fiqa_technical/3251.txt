I got down voted for my comment. But, this is exactly what a lot proponents of higher capital taxes argue. That, if you are not a hoarder of wealth; then, you should not worry about a high capital gains tax. And, again as the video clearly demonstrated. Capital gains prevent labor gains; where the lower and middle classes earn.
