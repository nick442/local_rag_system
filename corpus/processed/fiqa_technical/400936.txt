Drive thru is a good determinant, as is price point. it looks like Wikipedia considers Five Guys fast casual, but I have a hard time thinking of them that way. To me, fast casual signifies a certain level of sophistication, beyond a peanut/trash covered floor and guttural yells from the counter any time a customer walks in to the restaurant.
