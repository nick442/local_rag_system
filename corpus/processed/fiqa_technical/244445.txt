Yes, I do in fact want someone else's money is always a popular question. The question is, if two wolves and a sheep vote on what's for dinner, why would anyone think that's legitimate? If I came to your home with a couple friends, and we all voted on if your stuff should be our stuff, how is that legitimate?
