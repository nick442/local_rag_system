Maybe the retailers will learn that their only competitive advantage is their employees. And they will stop allowing employees to be such surly douchebags. Seriously. Who the fuck wants to talk to a Target employee, for example. They're miserable people who don't want to be bothered. I'll be glad to see them all fail with maybe just a few left who can actually do customer service well.
