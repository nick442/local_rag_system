>Not even close. 1.1Trillion/year deficit is NOT related to taxes, it's related to increased spending Really? I kinda thought it had something to do with [losing 2.6 million jobs in 2008](http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/09/news/economy/jobs_december/). Now that's a lot of revenue gone! Oh also the bush tax cuts >How much in additional taxes could we take in? 100 billion conservatively? So almost 10% of our deficit? I'd say that's a good start. I do agree we spend way too much on the pentagon, but pretty sure that went up a lot without our two unfunded republican wars. There's also the unfunded Bush Medicare prescription drug plan. You can't seriously think putting those people back in charge will lead to good things.
