Right. One thing I’ve learned is that there is no such thing as a mild recession until long after it’s over. The downturn in 2001-02 was the worst one since the Great Depression at the time, according to many reports. The same thing was said about the one in the early 90s. People who were around for the recessions in the early 80s and before that can probably say the same thing. There will be another recession, probably soon, and it will probably be worse than people expect. Until another economic cycle comes and goes, then it won’t be so bad anymore. I do think 2008 will persist for awhile as this cataclysmic event, much like 1929 did several generations ago.
