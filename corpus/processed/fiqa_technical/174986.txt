I think we are just close to point where there are so many people working in the job market that youre not going to have any more hiring going forward. Trump had some hype when he came into office that rippled onto the market resulting in these stock market gains and then the job growth as the after effect. but now that is finished. the stock market is at huge valuations, and its hard to see increases in corporate profits from here (given that the credit market is going to cut down the supply of loans going forward) that could spark another hiring rally.
