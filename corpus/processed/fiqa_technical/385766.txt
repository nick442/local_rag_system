"Hi I'm the writer thanks for the read and the comment. With the statement you quoted, I'm trying to dispute the claim that ""people these days can't afford a house because they would have to pay their entire salary just to afford the mortgage,"" which I think is quite common in some circles. The data makes no statement as to whether home ownership is more affordable or not, but simply shows that those buying property are using around the same percentage of their income to pay for it, which the data clearly shows to be true. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N As it turns out, home ownership levels have remained within ~5% of their 1980 levels based on percentage of the total population. I think there is an major classification flaw when comparing only sales because a great deal of people inherit property with no sale ever being made."
