Is there some evidence in the article or elsewhere that the purpose is to kill off these competitors rather than simply to compete? Competition is normally considered good in these kinds of situations, as it cranks out better efficiencies (for which an argument can be made here), but taking actions specifically for the purpose of killing off competition is not good because it reduces the pressures on efficiencies. Killing off competition by artificially lowering prices below real market value is considered dumping, but I don't really see evidence of that in the article. Is there some hidden somewhere or is the article just trying to make a point without any basis? I do have concerns about the Amazon play, but sensationalist or bias-driven reporting won't help me puzzle through them.
