I have spoken to a lot of people that are in the workforce, that have a CFA, and the consensus I have gotten from a lot of them is that it *can't hurt* to get your CFA, but it also sometimes isn't extremely relevant to have, or may put you above a different candidate. I would suggest figuring out what you want to do within the workforce first and see whether or not a CFA is going to be a requirement and or a necessity for wherever you would like to work, I also would recommend on not waiting too long to get it.
