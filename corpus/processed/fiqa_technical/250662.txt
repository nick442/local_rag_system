It's more like, asshats never let the government really try to help these people. Welfare was reducing poverty up until the early 90's when Clinton significantly reduced welfare benefits. Since then we have only continued the trend. If you want to say welfare is a failure, you should really limit your data to periods where we were actually providing a realistic amount of aid to families and not the last 20 years where we gave them an increasingly smaller share and wondered why they weren't getting ahead.
