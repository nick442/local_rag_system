As you haven't specified country, will try and answer more in general .. Whole Life Insurance but it seems to be the first thing any financial adviser is trained to sell .. The commission structure is such that it makes more attractive for a financial adviser to sell Whole Life. Plus for most buyers its easier to sell Whole Life compared to Term. The way Guarantees are worded differ from Policy to Policy, most of them DO NOT give any Guarantee, its the Adviser misquoting. Where there is Guarantee, it would be similar to a Interest on Bank Deposit / Debt fund. Plus there are various terms used in the Policy, the Guarantee may not be on Sum Assured, but on the Policy Value that would be low. In essence, you are right on investing the difference into any save instruments like Bank Deposits, Certain Debit Funds, Government Bonds, Retirement funds etc that would essentially give you more returns than whats promised in the Whole Life Policy.
