">""I have decided that your legal enterprise should not be allowed to make money"" is terrible! That's not what's happening. They're simply saying that their private company service won't be the one to enable that money making. You can't claim this is government retribution just because it's a big company or a ""government-sized"" action. >If you are in favour of this then you should be in favour of the phone company, the electricity company, and gas company to deny service to anyone who's ever been accused of being a paedophile. PayPal is not a utility. You're making incorrect comparisons."
