"what an asshole. here's the line he's hoping you won't read too closely ""By 2002, Fannie and Freddie had bought well over $1 trillion of subprime and other low quality loans."" BOUGHT as in private lenders made the loans and then sold them to Fannie or Freddie. As 60 minutes recently documented many of the megabanks were routinely forging income statements and pushing people toward loans they knew they could not afford. Yes Fannie and Freddie contributed by providing a convenient place for the bankers to stuff their fraudulent loans but even the trillion he speaks of is a drop in the bucket compared to the size of the derivatives market the banks built on top of the subprime loans. He's either a fool or a shill and probably a little of both"
