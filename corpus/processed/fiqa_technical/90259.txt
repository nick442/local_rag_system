Indeed! I actually travel to the US a lot, so that convo might actually happen ;) Which state do you live in? I fear you are right when it comes to waging war. I believe the modern world is now in a post-war state. Physical war is no longer feasible among the great powers, and so the battleground is now dominated by a literal war of ideas. I think the Russians are great manipulators - but there needs to be someone out there for them to manipulate. And while the Russians are the ones watering the garden, the seeds of extremism was sown by the elites. Those who were willing to condemn entire peoples to poverty and ignorance in the name of wealth. In the end, I think the elite are fundamentally short sighted. The revolution will come for them too, no matter which side wins. I just hope we will manage to create a revolution that leaves everyone else better off in the future. Thank you, and best of luck to you too! Know that you have brothers and sisters around the world who fight beside you.
