> this tech boom is different I remember hearing that so often last time, lol. There is a lot of consolidation among the big 4 or 5. Amazon for example doesn't turn a profit, or give dividends. so you buy it for growth. after amazon eats the grocery sector few options are left. the remaining consumer sectors are smaller and either already being consumed by very entrenched rivals (media) or already being eaten by amazon(consumer goods). I don't see an easy next move for them. real estate? health care? other countries?
