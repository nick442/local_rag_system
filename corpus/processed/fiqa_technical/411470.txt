Why shouldn't I bring it up? Freight is one thing but if there's an interest in increased commuter rail or other passenger rail, areas where businesses would use freight rail if it was extended to them or anything like electrifying the system, then it's far more likely that the government will have to be shelling out the money instead of private organizations. It takes huge capital investments and years to extend something like commuter rail and businesses probably don't want to wait potentially decades to real the rewards of a risky venture, so it will be left to public investment to extend systems into some areas that may become hotspots of activity after rail reaches them. It's not all about the freight lines.
