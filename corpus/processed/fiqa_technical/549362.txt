My problem with your argument is the idea that we make a decision and reap the benefits sometime in the near and measurable future. Where as the actual outcome of our decision may not be realized until many other decisions are made afterwards, thus making the number of permutations very high. While I agree there tend to be people who can make better or more informed decisions given a situation, I think you give them entirely too much credit given the long run possibilities of outcomes. My ultimate point being, no matter who you are, you are limited to being able to consider so many steps ahead or combinations at a single time. And there are certainly people who make bad choices but get good outcomes, and vice versus. Since we don't see one person, or a specific model for making decisions I have to believe that one simply does not exist. So call it luck, kismet, or informed decisions, I think at a certain point people make decisions and reap the rewards of those decisions independently. Maybe more often than not the informed win, but there have been plenty of smart people out there, with brilliant models and ideas, that go down in flames. Likewise I've meet some pretty dumb people who happen to be at the right place at the right time and turn the right knob. Not sure I was clear in explaining my point, its been a long day.
