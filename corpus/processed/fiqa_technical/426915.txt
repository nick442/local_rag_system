I disagree and as kind of a millennial I have an opinion on this topic, not that I want to make something out of this. But there is w people Killeen with the quality of ads. Some of them are just not that well targeted to millennials. Like for example if you look on tv you have a bunch of these ads that have a lot of old people. Another category is pharma ads. How are you going to get something out of pharma from guys who are still in their 20s. No one has enough problems yet and there is another dynamic at play there as well. That dynamic is that a lot of the advertisers want to get so called old people money. This is stuff like retirement savings, there Medicaid money etc, all the stuff they spend on tgrir bills. Given how the demographic pyramid is right now there is a difficulty for the advertisers to justify spending money in a wear that targets the Young folks. That happens now and it's going to be like that for the next few years. This is going to be something like a overall economic change so everything and everyone is going to see how the change takes place . So the advertisements are part of it but really they are a small part of the puzzle There isn't a good way to make people but things differently, it's all about what pays the most to advertisers, demographic groups be damned
