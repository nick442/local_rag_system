"That's very specific to you tho. Although I actually don't buy clothes / shoes online either (even tho standard sizes fit me just fine), I usually buy books, electronics & misc household provision stuff on amazon/ebay as that's the stuff that tends to actually be much cheaper there than at local stores. I dont think tshirts / underwear whatever is actually cheaper than at h&m/c&a/random ""ikea for clothes"" type retailers."
