"Jesus, my man, you need a hug or something? Down on your luck? You're inferring a lot about my personal beliefs (I lean pretty heavy socialist) and coming pretty hard at me personally as though I'm stepping on your throat somehow. That's not what I'm saying or my intention. I'd certainly prefer a socialist society where we take care of one another over sole self interest. You're right; I don't think we make a serious effort to champion socialist ideals in the US (not sure of your country of residence) anymore and I wish we did. That's decades of conservative politics and policies effectively making socialism a dirty word, as well as having communism as an enemy for decades while vaulting the ""wonders"" of capitalism (which I don't actually hate, but think needs boundaries and an understanding that we're better if everyone has basic needs and opportunities met) have made socialist ideals something of a pariah. But, the key of all of that is people; they're the biggest issue with any system. If we were compassionate capitalists that championed fair competition and understood not everyone starts from the same point or has the same journey, we'd be better off. If communism wasn't riddled with cronyism and favoritism and people really shared in the means of production and wealth, maybe the world would work. But, that's not the case because people, perhaps not necessarily evil, are kinda dicks and have self-preservation ingrained in them; whether that's economic, social, or personal."
