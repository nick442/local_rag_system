If you want to close the card, close it. The impact on your credit score will be minimal, if any, and the impact on your life will likely be even less. First, as you noted, the history from your card does not disappear when you close the card; it will stay on your credit report for as long as 10 years. By that time, you'll have many years of on-time payments from your other cards, and the loss of this one card won't be significant. Because the card has a low credit limit, it won't have much effect on your credit utilization numbers, either. Finally, your credit score might just be high enough that a small drop will have no impact on your financial life whatsoever. In my opinion, hanging onto a credit card you don't want just to try to attain some type of high score is pointless. Close the card.
