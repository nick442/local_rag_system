How about stopping the board of directors and CEO's from doing billions of dollars worth of share buybacks so that employees can be lifted out of poverty by paying them literally $10,000+ more! ex 1) Amazon: $5 billion in share buybacks, 340,000 employees = ~$14,000 per employee ex 2) Wal-Mart: $20 billion in share buybacks, 2.2 million employees =~$9,000 per employee ex 3) Mdconalds: 20 billion in share buybacks, 1.5 million employees = ~$13,000 per employee So tell me again how much these companies cannot afford to pay their employees.
