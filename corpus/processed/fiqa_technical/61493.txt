"Yes and no. Losing high-paying jobs to other countries does take money out of the economy. I have read a few times that this is a small contribution to the hard times ""Main Street"" is currently going through. Compared to the 2008 crisis and its effects, this is probably fairly small but is still a negative influence on the economy. If the outsourcing continues unabated, I believe the effects on both the economies and competitiveness of the western nations will become more pronounced. However, I do see the pendulum swinging back so we'll get back some (but not all) of the lost jobs and wages. Where we'll land I can't dare predict. This is just my opinion, of course. Swing by for a beer someday and we can talk some more :)"
