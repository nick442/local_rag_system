> Do you really think that private corporations are incapable of providing their own roads, street cleaning, clean water, etc.? No - I'm saying if they use it, they should pay for it. If they want to opt out of paying taxes, then they can opt out of using the roads, FAA, GPS, weather forecasts, protections from fraud, police, street cleaning, clean water, etc.
