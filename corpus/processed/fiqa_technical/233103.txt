Thanks, that was super helpful. Here is what I took from that. Any criticizimes? Money- sell to government (microgrid > traditional infastructure) Safety- educate Nigerian citizens on the dangers of exposure to high voltage electricity (something us as Americans take for granted, but an un-educated Nigerian may not understand) Jobs- use the opportunity to train Nigerian workers to work on and in the future set-up these microgrid systems (will help with sustainability and expansion in the future) Sustainability- excess energy produced by microgrids could be sold to neighboring communities and other countries. This money can be reinvested into development of microgrids Expansion- start small with a couple of community's as proof of concept and once those show benefits over community's with traditional infrastructure start expanding at exponential pace. (The more community's with microgrids the more successful the power grid)
