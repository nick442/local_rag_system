"I don't know why you shut it down from a C&D letter. If anything you should have seen it as them asking you to remove his name and any trademarks from your site. They don't own ""fuck you"" being printed on clothes. Sounds like you pulled the trigger too quick. Bet there was plenty of money to still be made with that site. Maybe someone more resilient will pick up the torch."
