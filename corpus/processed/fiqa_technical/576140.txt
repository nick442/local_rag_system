Beers, I can see the math, which you are right about. My point is that the Republicans were voting to favor the banking lobby over the lawyers’ lobby, and the Dems were voting to favor the lawyers’ lobby over the bankers’ lobby. I believe that neither party, at large, was voting for the consumer. I concede that some individual Dems may have been voting for consumers, but overall this vote came down to bankers vs. lawyers (the two potential primary beneficiaries of the outcome).
