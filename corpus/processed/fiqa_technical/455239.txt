> I think all taxes are theft, no matter who they come from. That is a matter of opinion. Obviously, I disagree with that sentiment. Do you have a reason behind it? > Again, you haven't really substantiated any claim about your financial situation. I have scanned in a tax summary sheet from my CPA. I took off all the personal identifying data. I would be happy to share it with you, but I am not sure how to attach it to posts like this. Any ideas? > Additionally, I'm sure someone of your financial stature would have enough time to go on Reddit. I am an owner, if I want to sit at my work desk and reddit - as I am doing right now - I can do that. Not what I typically do, but I just got off travel, and trying to get back into it. Plus, I am procrasting a little bit, because we have some big projects coming up! I am still human! > Literally take your pick and we can begin Okay, I will pick a topic that I am more familiar with - Defense R&D. My position is that, while there are many companies that do R&D in the world of defense, there is also much innovation that comes from the government itself. GPS is one such technology. And while there are many very innovative companies that have built onto and done some amazing things with this technology, if it weren't for government investment and R&D, it wouldn't exist. > And yes, even people who advocate only higher taxes for the rich will end up with higher taxes for me (I.e. Bernie Sanders) What part of Bernie's proposal leads you to believe that?
