I choose lifecycle funds because I am placing faith (perhaps foolishly) that a full time fund manager knows better what to pick than I. The same reason I go with mutual funds in general apply to to why I also have the lifecycle funds. Presently my diversification strategy is really just index funds and lifecycle funds. The radio advice guy Clark Howard often promotes them. http://www.wacotrib.com/none/content/shared/money/stories/clark/0601/060425money.html (I count in the intimidated group)
