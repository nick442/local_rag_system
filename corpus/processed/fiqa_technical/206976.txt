in my office the joke is more that they're wearing suits at all. Nobody here wears a suit. Slacks and a shirt, bonus points for a fleece vest (once you earn the right). If you find that your coworkers do wear suits though, my tip is this, no matter how much you spend, take it to a tailor. Always. A $200 Men's Wearhouse suit that's been nipped and tucked by a tailor will look better than $1000 off the rack one that hasn't been.
