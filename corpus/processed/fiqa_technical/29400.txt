This is only true for countries where we don't have a tax treaty. If we have a tax treaty with the country then you would get foreign tax credits if you repatriated the money. The reason US corporates do this is because US corporate tax rate is the second highest effective rate in the world at ~40% depending on the state you're hq'd in. So, if they want to repatriated cash from Canada they'd repatriate at the US rate and then receive foreign tax credits for the amount they paid in Canadian taxes. On balance they'll have just paid the US rate.
