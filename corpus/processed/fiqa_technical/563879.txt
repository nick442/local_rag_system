It's the truth. It's not dodging if it's legal. Shitty? No doubt. But, the main problem with that is that smaller companies and individuals aren't able to do the same thing. That's why it's wrong; it's only legal because big companies can lobby representatives to make it happen. Small guys have no love. The 35% corporate tax rate argument is mostly bullshit because most large corporations don't pay anywhere near that. It's only those without the tax shelters that have to worry about it.
