First, gather the information you have on her banking history. She may have accounted for that money and moved it to a new account or otherwise spent it. I don't expect you'll have much banking documentation from the 1950s, but if you do, then start there and trace the money. To the extent you can, you may try to contact the banks in question or their successors. It may be difficult to trace them through mergers or closings. Again, it's very possible that she spent or transferred those funds and there is nothing to find anyway. There is also a risk that if the money went unclaimed for too long, then the bank was obligated to escheat any remaining balance to the state of Ohio. You can try contacting Ohio Department of Commerce about unclaimed funds and attempt to locate anything that may have rightly belonged to her. You will need to gather documentation to do so. You may be able to receive the funds from the state, if it has received them.
