It looks like the interest rate on bonds from 1995 is at least 1.41%. If it is from the earlier part of the year, the interest rate is 4%. Even if it is the latter, I'd say it is worth keeping, although you could likely do better in a CD, it would lock your money up. I'd consider it a part of my bond allocation in my investments and up the equity a little. You can use this link to get actual prices and interest rates: http://www.treasurydirect.gov/BC/SBCPrice
