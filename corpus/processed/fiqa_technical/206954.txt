Little pisses me off more than knowing I worked my ass off for shitty employers for decades to enrich lazy rich fuckers who have continuously turned the screws of oppression on me. They need to pay. Why would additional tax breaks inspire an uber rich person to make legitimate investments in the greater economy if they already have so much cash they don't do anything but inflate the stock market? Stupid economics. When a person with needs has money they spend it on needs until their needs are met and bolster the economy. The majority with constant worry about money with no hope for relief in sight while richies get preferential treatment is mean and cowardly economics. Does anyone really wonder why there is so much hatred, violence, suicide, addiction, disenfranchisement..?
