"I was surprised to learn that ""blocking and tackling"" was supposed to be a football metaphor. I always thought it was referring to a system of ropes and pulleys ([block and tackle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_and_tackle)). I always thought it was just a synonym for ""execution"" / hard work, since block and tackle is a symbol for direct, physical labor. This is what I get for avoiding sports in high school."
