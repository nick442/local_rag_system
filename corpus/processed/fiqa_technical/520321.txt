So long story short, you predict Amazon will build up customer loyalty by treating them well, then screw them over when the time is right? Only the dumb customers will stick with them then. If they try to screw consumers over, it will just create favorable conditions for an outsider to easily and quickly win their business. Therefore I doubt it will ever happen.
