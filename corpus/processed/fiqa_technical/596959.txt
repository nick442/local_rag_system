It isn't as simple as just borrowing money. This is more of an economics question but there are reasons to borrow money (simple example being when the economy is growing too slowly) and reasons to increase taxes (basic example being when the economy is growing too fast). Check out monetary and fiscal policy on investopedia or youtube, this should give you a good understanding. Now one more thing to consider is the 'risk' of governments defaulting on their loans. In a simple sense, the more debt a government has the more risk there is to default. This means people who lend the government money will want a higher interest rate, making it harder for the government to borrow money.
