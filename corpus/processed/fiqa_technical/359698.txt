The government multiplier effect is zero sum. You will see a multiplier in the short term, but taxpayers will have to pare back spending in the future to service the debt, reversing the initial multiplier. The funding burden for education and infrastructure spending should fall more heavily on those actually using it - more tuition fees, toll roads, etc.
