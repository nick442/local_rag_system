"I read Rich Dad, Poor Dad and I must say, found a lot of value in it. And I like to think I have a very good understanding of finance - both personal and corporate. Econ major, have worked at several major brokerages dispensing financial advice for a living, including at my current employer. But I do remember, back in 2005, when I read Kiyosaki's book, signing up to be contacted by a ""Rich Dad Coach"" - or something like that. Basically, some guy at the Rich Dad company who would be a financial mentor or sorts. Long story short, the Rich Dad Coach asked for my credit score, which was high, and proceeded to recommend that I max out my credit to buy a house to flip in ""1-2 months."" Now, it's true that it could have worked. But was it good advice? Fucking hell no it wasn't. And I think he wanted 5k to coach me through the process. I could have made money doing it, even with paying him 5k, but SPECULATING by taking out personal lines of credit is not consistent with anything in the Rich Dad book. Showed me right there that while the book's advice may be good, that organization was just out to make a buck at the readers' expense."
