"Whether or not PayPal itself reports to the credit bureaus, the collector **will**. That said, you can demand the collector ""validate"" the debt, which if you were scammed could make for an interesting scenario - PayPal *doesn't* normally play the role of a creditor, so the very fact that you ""owe"" them money is an unusual situation in and of itself. I'm not entirely sure how they would go about validating that debt - They haven't provided you any goods or services, you don't have any form of loan outstanding with them.. The legitimacy of the ""debt"" consists **entirely** of them siding with the other party in a he-said-she-said dispute. I'd be interested to hear what the collector replies with when you demand validation of the debt!"
