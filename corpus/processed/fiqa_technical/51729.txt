"It seems like if that were true, then if everyone were in one group, you'd get the biggest discount of all. My preference has been for single payer, but recently I saw a guy suggesting single-group, multi-payer, or SGMP. This was just a comment from a physician in a medical journal, and I don't have the link and haven't been able to find out anything more about it, but it seems intriguing. It had something to do with insurance companies bidding to provide coverage services. edit: [Here it is](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1211514#t=comments): > JOEL SPALTER, MD | Physician - Infectious Diseases | Disclosure: None > FAYETTEVILLE AR > October 02, 2012 > Single Group Multi-Payer > True reform resulting in universal health insurance and access to care is achieved by state mandates for insurance with replacement of individual or group underwriting with underwriting by ""Dutch auction"" for a percentage of the single group consisting of all of the residents of a State – Single Group – Multi-Payer (SGMP). Each successful insurance company would be responsible for payment of the percentage of the total costs for medical services equal to the percentage of the population insured. This preserves the integrity of the bidding process. > States are free to establish the public contribution to premiums. SGMP prevents exclusion of insurance for pre-existing conditions or due to genetic background, absent individual underwriting; guarantees maintenance of health care insurance independent of place, or even existence of employment; assures equality of access to providers due to a single established remuneration scale; and assures patients' choice of providers free from any empanelling by insurance companies. Market forces will govern providers' attempts to gain and hold market share. > A single group eases statistical comparison, with EMR, of 50, State patterns of care."
