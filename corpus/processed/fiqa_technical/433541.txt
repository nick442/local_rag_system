Firstly, tax credits are not confiscated taxpayer dollars, they are taxpayer dollars which are NOT confiscated. Secondly, all forms of transportation (and energy production) receive billions in 'confiscated taxpayer dollars'. Sometimes when the future is clear (electric vehicles), it's worthwhile to provide temporary subsidies to jumpstart an industry. Tax credits are an excellent way to change taxpayer behaviour. If the government prefers electric vehicles as one way of reducing air pollution, tax credits seem a remarkably cost effective way of doing so in comparison to some of the other options people discuss (higher taxes on gasoline, for example, or more restrictive regulation on car manufacturers).
