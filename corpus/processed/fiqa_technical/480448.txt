"As I pointed out in my other post to you, the 3.7T is entirely misleading, the actual quote from the article was ""The banks achieved this gigantic rip-off by secretly colluding to rig the public bids on municipal bonds, a business worth $3.7 trillion"", and there is no business on the planet worth that much. He deliberatley attaches the value of an entire asset class to banks and fraud to make it sound much worse than saying they apparently stole x million a year. Instead of reporting the actual numbers that were reported in the numerous other places I already gave you, he chose to exagerate. The rest of his article makes the same style choices. It's sad you cannot see this by comparing his article to pretty much every other article on the topic."
