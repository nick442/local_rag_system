To be honest, all that they might be able to tell you is to keep saving. Your income seems like it will vary week to week thanks to commission (and I'm still very curious how at 18 you found a job making $96,000 a year at minimum). Right now because you have no savings, start stacking that up. You're going to want an emergency fund on the side as well. Even though now you may still live with parents, you still may run into issues where you'll need money on hand. It's much better to dig into an emergency fund than get a loan. Plus, when moving out, you won't be living paycheck to paycheck. Best rule of thumb for this is to keep an emergency fund of roughly 3-6 months of expenses. Right now because you're so young with so little money, there isn't a large reason to really open up an IRA or any sort of investment account. Unless you're actually guaranteed $2,000 a week, then things are different.
