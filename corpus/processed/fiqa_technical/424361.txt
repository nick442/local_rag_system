"Though I agree that there is quite a bit of corruption in the financial industry, I do not think that the psychologist is being fair by comparing people in the financial industry to the ""pedophiles"" that he has tried to treat in the past.. First of all, close to 25% of humans(but I think this statistic is particular to Americans) suffer from Mental Illness(whether they (or their peers) acknowledge it or not). TLDR: There are sick and twisted humans beings in every industry, every country, every city, etc."
