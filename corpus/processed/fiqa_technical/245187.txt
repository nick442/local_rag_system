"Thats cool but also sounds very illegal? on quite a few levels. I Imagine its a huge conflict of interest for a government entity to contract services from an employee within that ""branch"". You're also lying to your employer and obfuscating the source of the services (just because no one cares right now, doesn't mean its not a lie). And i dont know how it works in the public sector, but with most companies anything you make while employed by the company is company property and they would have grounds to terminate you, sue you for damages, and take possession of your software."
