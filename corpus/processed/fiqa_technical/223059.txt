I know fuck all about the taxi industry but if I had to answer I'd say the taxi industry isn't a good place to put your money. EDIT: It's not a good place to put your money if you want decent returns. Obviously there's a profile where every kind of firm fits but there's generally better alternatives than this particular industry.
