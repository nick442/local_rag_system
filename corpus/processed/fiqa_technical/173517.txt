> If the buyside was showing demand, what's wrong with HFT for reacting with supply? In my example, HFT isn't actually adding supply/liquidity. They're just grabbing it and flipping it. > The example you gave is akin to me going from car dealership to car dealership yelling loudly about what car I want and the price I'd like it at - would you be upset if someone heard you and decided to sell their car to you later down the line? Not the same. The equivalent would be me yelling about wanting to buy a Porsche 911, and you buying them all before I can finish my own purchase, then offering to resell them to me at a higher price. >In this case, the buy side trader is being stupid. Maybe - certainly if all this could be eliminated by avoiding market orders. This is a major critique many people have with Brad K. Instead of serially going from exchange to exchange, he could have sent orders to all exchanges at the same time (parallel!) and likely received much better prices. He did do this at his time at RBC - sent orders to all exchanges at once. The result would be apparently liquidity (asks at the market) disappearing and his orders getting filled at higher prices. >In my opinion, the HFT player here is simply facilitating price discovery by reacting to demand - as a market maker that's his job. I think that's a misinterpretation of what these particular HFTs are doing. >Here's a good article. Let me know what you think. Interesting. It certainly goes against a lot of what Lewis wrote. And I suppose that's the problem.. very few of us are actually qualified to say what is actually true. I know little about market structure and, as I said, have no involvement in high liquidity stocks. The fund managers next door to me also trade pretty illiquid stuff that I strongly doubt any HFT ever touches, and they're value investors anyway, not arb HFs or something.
