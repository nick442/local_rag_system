When 0.1% of the population has most of the money and half the population can't afford rent and healthcare because there's just not enough money to pay them then we have to steal it through taxes. Better than it being stolen with pitchforks. Someone finds a better way to get money out of the Cayman Islands and fueling the economy I'm all ears.
