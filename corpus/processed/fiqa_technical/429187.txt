I think so. Where we are, the store-bought diapers are similarly expensive, so we pay something like a 2-4 cent/diaper markup for the honest diapers, including shipping. I found the honest diapers were a lot better at containing blowouts than pampers, and it's a lot easier to tell when a diaper is soaked through. Given a free pack of each, honest diapers and pampers, I'd put the honest diapers on my kid's butt first.
