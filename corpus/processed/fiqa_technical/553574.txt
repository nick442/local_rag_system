"Thing is, it's already explained in the letter, in the end of the first paragraph: ""Teslaâ€™s annualized delivery rate should exceed 100,000 units **by the end of next year**"" (emphasis mine). When I first saw the number I got excited, but then I read the actual sentence, realized what they meant, and it's still impressive but it's not 3x increase in production YoY (which would be absurd to expect, esp. when Tesla's trajectory has been just-under-100% increases per year so far and into the mid-term foreseeable future). *Then* they explained it *again* on the CC (Elon said *something like* ""we'll exit next year at a 100k rate, but it's hard to tell how steep the curve will be, but we'll probably have over 60k deliveries..I think..yeah probably""). I emailed the author of this article and he still believes that Tesla has ""unequivocally"" stated that they will produce and deliver 100k cars in 2015..but that's simply not correct. I have some people who know press contacts within Tesla working on hammering it out, though their efficacy at press communications has not been ideal at times in the past. If Tesla did unequivocally state that they would deliver 100k cars next year, after delivering just over 35k this year and 22k last year, that would be enormous news and should have sent the stock to $300 today, up 30-50%+ instead of the 4% it did go up. But it didn't send it that high, because that's just not what's happening. I'm extraordinarily bullish on Tesla, but 100k in 2015 is just not what's going to happen. 100k+ in 2016, though, sounds about right. And is in line with every other estimate everyone has done for the past several years, including Tesla themselves. So yeah, this number isn't really news, but it's nice to see them reiterate it."
