This sounds like a pump and dump, just with a product instead of a stock, and it points to the need to regulate the medical supply industry pricing structure. Because actual consumers are not involved in the market price, the price can be wildly inflated: Think bottled water after a natural disaster; the price would go up if it weren't for price controls put in place along with State of Emergency decrees. It's usually not supply that is the issue, it's the inability of the consumer to self-regulate demand by either limiting use or finding other sources to fill demand. Our Health system is not one that the consumer has any control over, and so control must be mandated.
