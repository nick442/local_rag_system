Not saying I agree with it, but I can see the logic in it. A drug company has to basically make all their money back (and hopefully profits too) in the 17 year window that patent exists. They make projections on how many they will sell in that time, and figure out a cost from there. If the patent is extended, then the cost to develop that drug can be divided over a longer period of time.
