> or requiring a telephone number (that can subsequently be banned) The article states: >One Lyft passenger, identified by seven different Lyft drivers as an Uber recruiter, canceled 300 rides from May 26 to June 10. That user's phone number was tied to 21 other accounts, for a total of 1,524 canceled rides. So Lyft already knows the phone number. The bigger question is why they allow the same number to be used for so many different accounts in the first place. And why didn't they ban the accounts tied to it at least after the first 100 or so cancelled trips.
