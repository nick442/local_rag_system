I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole -- it's definitely too far gone. People who have not gotten out yet are crazy. Their physical presence is no match for Wal-Mart, and their online presence is no match for Amazon (nor Wal-mart at this point). How often do people under 35 go to Sears for something? And when do people go to Sears.com as a first resort to buy something? I'm going to guess almost never for both.
