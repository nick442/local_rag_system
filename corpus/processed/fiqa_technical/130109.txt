One last thing.. Would you mind making up a spreadsheet of *ALL* of your finances? Income, expenses, etc. If you do not want to share it publicly, I would be glad to help you via PM. I am doing quite well with money and fixing past mistakes (make only $12/hr, work overtime just to pay bills, but have $10,000 in credit, with no balances, etc.). Let me know! :)
