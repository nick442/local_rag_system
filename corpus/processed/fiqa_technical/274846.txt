The thing is, corporate taxes aren't paid on revenues or costs; they're paid on net income. Meaning no matter what happens, any investment the company makes that improves their net income automatically means more money for the company. So let's say 12% vs 14% tax. A 2% increase in tax means a 2% lower net ROI on the investment. But so long as the incremental improvement to your bottom line is there, the investment is sound, with or without taxes. EVEN at a 50% corporate tax rate. You hire one more person at $60k/yr and they make $120k/yr in net income for you. You still keep $30k of the profits. It's an incremental increase regardless. And if that person doesn't make you money? Say the incremental benefit is 0? Well your net income just dropped $60/yr. And you just paid $30k less in taxes. Meaning the true cost of that hire is $30k to your bottom line. Where it hurts business is that your retained earnings don't build up as fast. It makes the next investment harder to make is all. And as a corporation, if you're not paying dividends you need to keep reinvesting your retained earnings./
