My recollection is that most traditional reader systems charge like 5%. For squareup there were two different pricing schemes 1. 2.75% per swipe. 2. 0% per swipe but a $275 permonth charge. When I did the math the flat fee only made sense if you're doing over $2500ish per month in business. These fees seem pretty minimal to me.
