Nope, don't do it. Basic math shows this..as you pay down your HELOC, you will pay less and less interest, eventually you will have it paid off. Look at what your RRSP will be worth even using a low rate of return over the next 20 or 30 years. It will likely show that it would really cost you a LOT more if you cashed in.
