Hate to link this trolls article, but seriously. I own that real estate, pay me not to recline. First off, that is what is wrong with people, when selfishness over a few inches trumps common courtesy. How about, I can see you're tall and are being cramped into a small space, I'm not going to be an asshole and crunch my seat on top of your knees. No, it's I paid for this seat and I will take every inch possible, regardless how many people it inconveniences, and if you have a problem why not pay me. Hell, do you fight with the person next to you over the armrest as well?
