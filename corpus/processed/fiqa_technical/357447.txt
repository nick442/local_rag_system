I'm 40 and been carrying student debt for nearly 20 years. Because of life events and various circumstances I've had to defer several times. This means my balance history looks like a rollercoaster. At this point I just consider the Department of Education to be akin to heroin addiction. I feed it as regularly as I can. It starts to get painful when I can't. It requires an ever increasing amount to get that fix. I'm financially fucked and it's my fault. And one day it'll probably kill me. But I just keep trying. What choice do I have?
