In Trader Joe's case, I'm not sure the quality is any lower. Trader Joe's whole business model is to have a top quality store brand and only sell that. Customers are happy because their store brand is really good. Trader Joe's margins are better because it's a store brand and their inventory costs are lower because they don't have several similar things.
