On top of that, don't impose a hierachical accountability system. Create a culture that pushes employees to commit to personal accountability for their actions and behaviors instead of exhausting yourself holding employees to the fire. Provide an environment that prompts employees to walk the coals themselves. Culture is everything to an organization, no matter its scale and size.
