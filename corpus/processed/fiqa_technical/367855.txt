Basically, a bunch of non-algo/HFT people read Michael Lewis' book, which is largely an advertisement for a new exchange and some hand-waving about people cutting you, so they come to this sub and talk in analogies with zero understanding of actual market microstructure. They're inevitably called out and either resort to sticking their fingers in their ears or deleting their comments.
