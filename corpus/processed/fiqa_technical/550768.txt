In Canada, when doing a debit transaction there can be the option to select which account the transaction is to be performed that would be where you'd have the choice to select a savings account. Some banks may offer interest on a chequing account if certain conditions are met. I remember seeing once that there was a minimum balance of $1,000 at all times and a few other things that may make it less than worthwhile for the low rate offered. Another possibility is to see if your bank will automatically transfer funds from savings to main if needed. I've had this happen a few times where money would be transferred in so I could have a purchase or cheque go through.
