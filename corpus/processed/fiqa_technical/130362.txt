It's not stealing from people who create value. Or create jobs. Taxing money earned by dividends isn't harming anyone. Simple math says if you're paying 10m in taxes it's because you didn't use your wealth to create jobs. And someone who paid 10m in taxes isn't going to decide not to buy that 10k ring because they paid 20m and only have 40 left for the year. Walmart makes 15b a year they're not going to create more jobs or wealth because they made 20b with a tax cut. Lowering taxes will only be beneficial to the middle class due to the fact they are the ones stimulating the economy. It's easy to live paycheck to paycheck making 120k a year when you actually get to enjoy life.
