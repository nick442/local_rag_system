Personally I think as long as they aren't breaking any monopoly laws, then size isn't really an issue. To put it another way, I'd be more concerned with Google Search having a 90% market share than with one company owning Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, and Android. The latter makes for a really huge company, but it's all different products and they all have competitors.
