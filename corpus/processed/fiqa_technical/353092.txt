No, look: Say a company needs to get $100 per solar panel to make a profit. But a consumer only wants to pay $80 for a solar panel, otherwise it isn't worth it. So, we have two options: 1. We offer a tax reduction to the consumer of $20. They now pay $100 for the solar panel, and get $20 back. The customer has now effectively paid $80 and the company has got $100. Or, 2. We give the company a subsidy for $20 per panel. They now sell the solar panel for $80, then get $20 in subsidy. The customer has now paid $80 and the company has got $100. You're against the 2nd option, in favour of the first. Have I understood you correctly?
