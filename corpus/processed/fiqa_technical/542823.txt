Meh I can see it working in 10 years. A lot of grocery shopping is done by parents for their families. As the generation raised on amazon and easy/cheap delivery of goods gets old enough to all have children they might really like the idea of grocery delivery. Kind of feels we're taking a step backwards to the milk man haha.
