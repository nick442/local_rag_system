Ah - sadly I have no money. Mostly just curious after watching The Big Short last week haha. I find that line of insight interesting though. I've been seeing a lot of mall closures in Canada as anchor tenants like sears leave though. Kind of makes me wonder whether franchisees will start closing stores like footlocker and food court restaurants since they operate on such small margins, and the leases usually seem to be written around the presence of foot traffic generating anchor tenants.
