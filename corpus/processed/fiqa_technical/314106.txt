The dynamics of land value tax are oppressive. It's up to the owner if they want to make the maximum money from land. The tax is telling you what you must do with the land. It also sets the authorities up as infallible. Banks get earning potential wrong all the time. There is also the assumption that if you have land that you have wealth. That's not true. Many peoples land or house is their wealth. Money they can only access if they make themselves homeless. or move to a cheaper neighbourhood, and then we're back to gentrification and ethnically cleansing the poor from high value areas.
