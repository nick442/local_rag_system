That isn't how it works, and that's definitely not the way it should work for either business or personal taxes. A business is free from taxes only if they have made a net loss over the year. This is **very** different from simply having less cash at the end of the year than at the beginning. A business could have less cash if they bought assets, paid off debt or any number of reasons and still pay taxes. On the other hand, they could end up with *more* cash at the end of the year than they began it with and still be free from taxes, as long as they made a net loss for the year. The cash balance has nothing to do with whether they pay taxes or not.
