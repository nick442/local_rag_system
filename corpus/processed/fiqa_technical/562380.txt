The first thing I did when I read this was compute how many people on just those two bus lines traveled on a yearly basis. It computes to about 0.02% chance of death when traveling by bus. Which is exactly the same as what the National Safety Council says your one-year odds of dying in a car accident is (1:6500) Can we question the safety of our cars too?
