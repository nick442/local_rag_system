There is no more US supplier for most industrial commodity and consumer goods. for eg. I want to see how pentagon buys printer and printer's ink. Or imagine price of computer if pentagon has to buy every component american. (eg. there is no more US screen maker.) essentially, Pentagon will have to go back to 80's technology.
