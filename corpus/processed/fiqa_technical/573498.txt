You need a proof of address and also they ask you for a letter from employer. But usually you dont need any of that.. there are always correct answers to all the questions, but you still need an address where they will send you your papers along with debit card etc. So need to rent a place or have some mail forwarding service would help. Here is what people usually do in London: Go to a branch of lets say Lloyds TSB that is not in the center of London, use some far away branch, Like Morden or so. Say that you arrived a month/week ago and looking for a job.(not laborer) Say that need your account to send money from abroad to support your living during the Job search. hand in your passport and your account will be ready the same day, while you can wait for your card 1week. Your pin number for the card +2/3days Hope that helps.
