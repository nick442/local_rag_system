Many of the allegations against Uber might be true, and that's terrible. But what about the ones against Taxi drivers? I can't speak for England, but in Latin America you have many more sex assaults in taxis that in Uber drivers (proportionally, of course). Usually these are partial / subjective reports. We need to see all the info in one place to be able to form a good informed opinion. Usually these servicios (Uber, Grab, Lyft) are banned in those countries where we need them the most.
