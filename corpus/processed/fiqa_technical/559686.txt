Let's say you've got an idea for an instrument that could be used to hedge non-depreciating assets (commodities for instance) with benefits including getting rid of the basis risks associated with the futures market. What would be some suggestions on how to market the idea without being left out of the loop? I work neither in a bank nor at a trading house, but as an analyst in the shipping sector and therefore don't stand to benefit directly from my own idea if I were to share it with a party that could make use of it. Hope this is the sort of question that's within the scope of this thread. Any insight in how such issues can be dealt with would be much appreciated.
