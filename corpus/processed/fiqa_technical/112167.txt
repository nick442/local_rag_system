The state has been running a deficit for at least 15 years. Many want to blame Rauner (he didn't pass any bills to help, but arguably brought the issue to the forefront.) But at this point it's basically systemic and baked into the structure of the state. There needs to be major changes but no politician (or not enough) want to pursue long term solutions. It's all about immediate political power. There are rumblings of Illinois being the first state to file for bankruptcy.
