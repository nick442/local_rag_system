This comes back to the money deal. You have to pay people and pay for supplies (jet fuel is expensive, quite literally each airlines highest expense is fuel). Government paying for flights would be met with stiff resistance. Carrying it out would be difficult. People have to go to airports, park cars somewhere, how many planes are we diverting to help with evac? How many people are we diverting? How many flight plans have to change? Other routes may experience issues. There is so much planning that goes into this. It would be a nightmare to do in the short term.
