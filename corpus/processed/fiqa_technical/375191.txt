Pro's Right now your electricity is charged based on how ComEd projects you to have used it. So you probably get charged for daytime electricity that you are actually using at night. At night the demand is lower so the cost of electricity is lower. ComEd will be able to better predict usage and plan outages/maintenance during times that are of lower impact. (Less inconvient outages for you) ComEd will better be able to see spikes in usage that trip and cause black and brown outs. This will allow them to make adjustments to reduce the impacts of these and possibly avoid some altogether. (Less chance of having to deal with hours of stifling heat with no AC or fan) ComEd will be able to invest in equipment to more accurately meet their needs instead of trying to guess what it needs. This should make your power more reliable, and cost less. This technology has just started to be exploited. I look for this to be like the cell phone. New devices that will leverage the technology could revolutionize your home. CONS Companies do not like to surrender revenue. Look for an increase in cost for lower peak times (if they can get it through CUB) Quite a bit can be deducted from your energy use at the level they will report at. In addition this technology has potential to be like a cell phone added ability to help and to collect information. It is not well tested in wide distribution. There are quite a few unknown risks.
