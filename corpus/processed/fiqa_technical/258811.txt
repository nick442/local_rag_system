Ideally, warranty returns should be handled by the manufacturer because in theory returns give them feedback to improve their products. If a certain model of DVD player is always being returned 6-12 months after sale, there's a problem with it, and having the returned, failed units on hand provides the engineers with evidence to improve their products. Of course, with razor-thin margins and price pressure, the ideas above are a luxury and pretty much a thing of the past, I guess.
