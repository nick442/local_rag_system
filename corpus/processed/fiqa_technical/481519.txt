"So this has been true.. Forever. I mean can we agree that there is enough corruption to be the dividing line between the 1% and the rest of society? The system is built to protect the rich and grow the wealth of the already wealthy. The middle and lower class are being farmed like animals while food quality is disgusting due to FDA ""failure,"" medicine is becoming a periodical subscription because modern disease is trending towards ""lifelong"" sicknesses, health insurance is a for profit business that now has more investments than banks and while millions suffer and are bled dry of any savings. Keeping the middle east in turmoil is how we get cheap oil. Peace means they have the right to negotiate their exports. While desperate, we basically take it for free. EVERYTHING. IS. BASED. ON. MONEY. Everytime I use quotes, just think: What if this is designed? I mean follow the MONEY. Medicine benefits if you're just sick enough to pay up every month and not die. The FDA approves all kinds of sickness inducing trash. Why? Isn't that their one job? To say oh this isn't healthy. It causes cancer. We will not allow it. Apparently not. What big pharma paid the FDA to allow crap food. The reason it's crap is because it's cheap. The food industry like McDonald's wants cheap food so they can become global billionaires.. I mean c'mon."
