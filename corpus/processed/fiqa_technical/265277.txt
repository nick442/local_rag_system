"In other words, does the market have control over sale numbers or do I? You both do, just like for the bike. You have control over the price you ask, and the buyer has control over the price they pay. If the two do not align, no sale takes place. Your question uses the words ""sell"" and ""sale"" ambiguously. You can decide to ask for any price you want. You cannot actually sell anything until someone agrees to buy what you are offering."
