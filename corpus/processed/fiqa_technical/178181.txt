"There are a lot of good answers, but I will share my experience. First, a savings account needs to be for savings. If your in the US you have ""Regulation D"" to deal with and that will bite you on the rear if you go over those limits. Specially easy to do if your purchasing from a savings account. Next having an ""Income"" account and a ""Spending"" account can be a very good tool to build a nest egg. So for example you get $1500 into your income account and then move $1000 to your spending account then budget based on that $1000. This is an amazing thing to do, so long as you have the discipline to never transfer that extra $500, and pretend your broke when you run out of the $1000. That being said there is no reason that you can't do that in one account. It's all preference. My wife and I use YNAB (an envelope budgeting system) to do just that. We don't need the separate accounts. We are no more likely to ""not spend"" in one account then we are to ""not spend"" in two accounts. It's all just self discipline and what you need to do. This does lead to the situation we call YNAB broke. It's when we have to start choosing between ""going hungry"" or getting that new DVD, even though our bank account has $5,000 in it. It's even harder when you choose ""go hungry"" and have to follow through with it, even though you have enough to buy a used car in your bank account. But rather it's ""YNAB broke"" or your spending account is empty and your income account it full, the result is the same. It's up to ""you"" to have the self discipline not to spend. Rather that's in one account or two makes little difference."
