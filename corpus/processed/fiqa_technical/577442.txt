I'm simply pointing out that most automakers (successful and not) have primarily focused on how to build their companies, gain market share, and try to anticipate consumer wants and trends. You are correct in saying, by definition the successful ones have done better. As well, yes, Tesla is not catering to the minivan users of the world at the moment (although it's expanding into SUVs). But it has no reason to, that's not it's market at the moment. I'm saying that it's impressive that the company knows it's market and is willing to sacrifice profits to a degree to make it more attractive to its market. Ironically, what it's doing is actually using something that is generally appreciated by the majority of consumers.
