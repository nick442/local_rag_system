I ordered a dishwasher from Sears last week, but decided to cancel the order on Sunday because I found a better deal that didn't require Sears' $170 installation charge. I got a call last night confirming the delivery and reminded them I canceled the order. They apologized and said they'd remove it from the system. I got a call 11am this morning from the delivery guy asking what my apartment number is because he was outside with the truck. I felt bad to tell him I was at work and the order had been cancelled. He then applogized and proceeded to tell me his boss was an idiot.
