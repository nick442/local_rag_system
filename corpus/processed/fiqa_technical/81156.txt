>so it is a bit of a catch-22. Yeah it's definitely a trade off that can pay off. I guess I shouldn't be so self rightious about it. I made a similar trade but I spent those years in the Marines. That was instrumental in me landing my current kick ass position (due to professional networks, not direct experience) but that isn't a prerequisite for the job. Regardless, it's definitely something that needs to be fixed. Not nipping this in the bud could turn into the single greatest management failure of a generation. We should all work to correct it once we are in positions of influence.
