"At times the issue seems to be one of reading comprehension and general information processing. Regardless of length or depth, an email allows for both clarity of message and a persistent record to refresh from. Yet people default to these hugely inefficient meetings. Modern meetings also seem to suffer from an issue with mob rule. Very rarely do meeting ""coordinators"" do anything but kick off meetings, instead of acting as a whip/coordinator. Everyone puts more value on a faux-friendly workplace than an efficient one, so no one is willing to be the heavy that keeps the meeting focused and on schedule."
