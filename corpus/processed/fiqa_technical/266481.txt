Not sure if you mean that your SO stands to inherit $18 million or has inherited it already. I would hope that her family already has a team of financial advisors at that point. The name of the game at that asset level is protection. You have enough money so you want to keep up with inflation and generate some income. Most of my firm's clients at that size have at least 50% in tax-free municipal bonds the other half is about 10% in aggressive investments (private equity, aggressive stock managers), and 25% in conservative stock investments, 5% in international investments, and 10% in alternative investments (long/short, GTAA, hedged equity) . They also tend to have quite a bit of income producing real estate. Make sure you meet with a financial advisory firm the specializes in high net worth clients. I work for an independent RIA so I may be biased towards independent and fee-only firms but it seems like the best arrangement. You pay a percentage of assets under management and get objective investment advice with no commissions. For $18 mil anything over .50% as an advisory fee is a ripoff. You all in investment cost should be less than 0.90%. Also you should look into a high net worth insurance broker. You current insurance salesman will be in way over his head. Feel free to PM me with specific questions. Also, if you want to hire my firm that would be great haha!
