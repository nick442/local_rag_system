"Yes I know that. Then please tell me how this article relates to business. I doubt anyone even clicked at it, it's a link to ""stock picks"" subreddit which then links to ""crypto"" trading blog. This is definitely nto business related post even if everyone is downvoting me to hell. Sidenote: This subreddit is full of spam and almost nothing relevant to actual business can be found so this is a good moment to unsubscribe which I have just done."
