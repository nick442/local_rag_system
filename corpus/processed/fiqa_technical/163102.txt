Ah, that's the colloquially known Thomas Crown motive. The issue with that is that money is objectively quantifiable to a point, so one can do a risk/reward analysis for the potential profit vs. the potential dangerous of robbery when money is the motivating factor. Risk appreciation, on the other hand, is more difficult to quantify. It's even more difficult when one considers that there's a direct relationship between pleasure from risk and potential danger. In short, it would change from person to person, so I can't imagine trying to use inductive reason to form any broad conclusions.
