He partook in exactly the behavior he condemned in his neighbors, and he managed to live beyond his means as a multimillionaire. It takes a special kind of greed and stupid for that. It doesn't matter what he did 42 years ago it matters what he's doing now, and what he's doing now is fear mongering his own employees so that he doesn't have to pay slightly higher taxes, when he's already admitted that he has all the money he'll ever need. He didn't get successful in a vacuum, he got successful in a system which helped fund his success because 42 years ago the people who were where he is today were taxed more so he could get where he is today. But his opinions aren't what I'm mad about, I'm mad because he is greedy and a bully and a liar and a hypocrite of almost incomprehensible proportions.
