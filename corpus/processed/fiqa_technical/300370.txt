Wrong. In 2013, 41% of the total federal government's expenditures supported just Social Security and Medicare, per social security #s. Over 27% is spend on medicare and health. Military spending sits above 15%. Corporate subsidies in 2013 sat around 110 billion per year, so 3% max. Medicaid was expanded by the ACA and now consumes 26% of total state expenditures. Further, CBO estimates that the country's major health-care programs (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA) will grow to 14% US GDP by 2039 -- twice the 7% average over the past 40 years. EDIT: also wanted to point out that General Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that improper payments as a result of fraud, waste, or abuse in the Medicare program totaled nearly $50 billion in FY 2013. Bear in mind corporate subsidies in 2013 was $110 billion. Medicare ~~fraud~~ improper payments alone was 45% of total corporate subsidies.
