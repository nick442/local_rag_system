"This is a good explanation of what you meant. ""fair inequality"" is extremely vague. Ideally, one would want as little inequality as possible, but we both know that this is un-achievable and also undesirable from a motivational aspect. Thus, you want just enough inequality to encourage people to work harder and/or get advanced degrees so they go into other fields."
