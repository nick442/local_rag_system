It's very, very slowly turning into a shopping area. But with how strong places like the Cherry Hill area is right now, I don't see it really hitting critical mass. The only thing special they have going for them is the Bass Pro Shop. Which is a weird situation by itself considering it can take up to 6 months to get an FID or a new set of pistol permits. I want to see Cabela's drop a store right in the middle of Cherry Hill, or Bristol, PA and completely destroy Bass Pro Shop.
