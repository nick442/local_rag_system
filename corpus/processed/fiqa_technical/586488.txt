I agree with the consensus as far as getting a cheaper car, paying with cash, getting a more fuel efficient car, etc. But I'd like to point out, you should make sure you really need a car at all. I ride a bike to work! If I need a car, I can use Zipcar or City Car Share or borrow a friend's car, rent a car, take the train, ride a bus, walk. But mostly, ride my bike. Burn fat not gasoline! ;)
