I don't know about this particular person, however I have an example about my friend. Born in a very rich family he went to Harvard and the worked 2 years for Goldman. Now, I should mention, he is a rather bright fellow, and a great human being as well, but when asked about his studies and work experience in Goldman he described it as not very challenging.
