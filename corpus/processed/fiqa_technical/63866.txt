Typically you can not buy gift cards with gift cards but in most stores this is a function built into the cash register, I find it hard to believe that targets system would not restrict it if it was in fact against their policy. I worked for Home Depot for 5 years, they have a strict gift card/store credit policy that prevents such things from happening.
