Well that is another story altogether. Cynically, I would say that having HK as an international financial center under Chinese sovereignty makes it easy for officials within the CCP to launder money outside the country, because most people with money in China want to go elsewhere, or because they feel uneasy about their chances of being shot for corruption. Why, even Xi Dada has his two flats in the Grand Hyatt here.. But HK is in trouble because this might not be reason enough..
