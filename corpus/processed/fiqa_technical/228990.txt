Why should one of the most profitable companies in the world, with over a million employees be forcing their workers to work less than a full 40 hour shift, and thereby deny them the basic benefits all other fulltime workers get? Why does costco turn such a nice profit while treating their employees with respect and paying them well, all the while providing great customer service...? Just because you've seen unions put out poor service, does not mean their non-union equivalents are any better. Capitalism is merely a tool that is supposed to benefit the people. As soon as capitalism starts to harm the people, it's time to put some rules in place to level the playing field. Unions are a means for workers to keep their employers in line; yes, they do sometimes go too far, but so does big business.
