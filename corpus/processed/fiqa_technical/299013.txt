"That article seems to be making the argument that GDP isn't a good measure of consumer welfare and confusing that with ""GDP has no meaning"". It's still useful, though. I mean.. what company sits down and says ""hmmm.. I've reached the ideal level of output, I'm going to work on making my product better and cheaper now!"" .. generally, making something cheaper comes with making it accessible to a wider audience. Economic output rarely goes down just because you're getting more value for your money. In theory, that'd be included in measures of inflation rather than measures of GDP."
