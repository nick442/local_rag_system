Steve Jobs was only good in marketing and taking advantage of ideas invented originally by many gray people. For example, the Apple II was totally invented and created by Steve Wozniak who was mistreated by Jobs. When Steve Jobs came with his own ideas, they were total failures: Lisa, Next, Newton, and even his ideas of how to run Apple computer (almost went bankrupt and lost control of his own company.) On the other hand, Elon Musk seems to make new products on his own. But, again, not blaming Elon, those ideas were first researched and conceived by many gray people.
