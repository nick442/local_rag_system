The problem with a little bit of deflation is that it can turn into a lot of deflation very quickly. That id the risk of the so-called liquidity trap. a place where the Fed truly does lose its power and depressions become possible. The US housing market is in a secular depression. People aren't buying despite record low rates because they assume the house will be cheaper next year. Now imagine that across the entire economy. The longer you wait the cheaper things get. It *sounds* groovy but the problem is that it isn't just you waiting..it is everyone waiting, all at the same time. So the economy, such as it is, grinds to a halt and jobs vanish and things get even cheaper. It is a cycle that is extremely costly to get out of. The last time we fell into a depression it took massive new government spending programs plus a world war to fully pull us out of it. Some people might make the argument that you need a good long depression every now and then. They may say that, in fact, the Great Depression was the catalyst for policies that set America up for 70 years of solid economic growth. I'm not so sure. I do look at our current situation with bailed out zombie banks and I have to wonder if just letting them all fail may have been better even though the short term pain would have been severe. We'll probably know in about 5 years if they did the right thing.
