Its definitely safe. Should be no question there. But it's still gross. I'm extremely sympathetic to your latter point. I've worked in butcheries and it drives me nuts when people act like trimmings are somehow some awful thing that shouldn't be eaten (if I had a nickel for every time someone complained about kobe burgers..). The ammoniating process is gross though. I don't even mind the high pressure water used to clean the carcasses, but the processing after that is gross. There are other options to not waste that meat. IMO and all that's what stocks are for, though there's a huge financial difference between using that meat for stocks and using it in grind. There are also alternative means of ensuring safe product. Purely culinarily speaking I don't think grind is the appropriate usage, but hypothetically an emulsified product (i.e. hot dogs) would be reasonable. But the product that's actually made is pretty gross. Smells awful, and tastes awful. It really isn't fit for human consumption, and only works because it's sufficiently diluted.
