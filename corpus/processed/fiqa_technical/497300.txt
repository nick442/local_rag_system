"From https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Banc: Banq (also Banc, banc-corp, bancorp, or bancorporation) is an intentionally erroneous spelling of the word bank, but pronounced the same way. It has been adopted by companies which are not banks but wish to appear as such, and satisfy legal restrictions on the usage of the word bank. .. For instance, if the original company is known as Bank of America, then the new investment banking entity may be known as Banc of America Securities LLC. If the original company is known as Bank of Manhattan, then its insurance business might be known as ""Banc of Manhattan Insurance"" and its holding company might be called ""Manhattan Bancorp"". This practice originates from legal necessity: Under the laws of most states, a corporation may only use the word ""bank"" in its name if it has obtained a banking charter under state or federal banking laws. So, ""Banc of America"" is the subsidiary of BoA that doesn't have appropriate licenses to be called ""bank"". Wonders of complex regulation :)"
