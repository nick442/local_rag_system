I believe you are talking about Public Provident Fund and National Savings Certificate schemes in India. PPF -> Deposit money -> If you want to take a loan after 3 years, you can take out 25% of the balance in your PPF account. NSC -> Money locked for 6 years and can only be encashed after 3 years, you cancel your deposit and encash all your money. Money is safe in both cases, because they are secured by the Indian government. But interest(8.75% at present for both in 2014-15 financial year) is compunded anually for PPF, but half yearly for NSC. So you get a higher interest rate in case of NSC. So if you can lock in your money, without any need for withdrawls, choose a NSC for higher returns. Tax rebate wise, both are same.
