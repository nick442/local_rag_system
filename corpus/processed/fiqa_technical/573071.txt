do I have to pay any tax? Technically this would be treated as Gift from non relatives and taxes as per gift tax rules. There is a limit of Rs 50,000 per year to receive funds from non-relatives. Note if the amount becomes Rs 50,001 then the entire Rs 50,001 is taxable. If you are again giving this money to your friend, then your friend is also liable to pay Gift Tax on the money received. It is best recommended that you have your friend open an account.
