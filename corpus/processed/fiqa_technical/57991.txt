Yes, it's true (from a BB perspective). This isn't the 80's where M&A's are the money makers. This isn't the 90's where IPO's are the cash cows. Going forward the new products, especially the OTC derivatives market and FI are going to be where a lot of resources are pooled and where revenues are generated. Ask yourself the question, why do you want to go into equity research as opposed to another product?
