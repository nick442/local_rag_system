How in the world is it the perfect vehicle to hide theft? Every single transaction is publicly recorded and the best you can do is try to obfuscate that. Yet even if you get away with a crime today, the ledger is open for anyone to analyze, study, survey, and if you are caught later down the road with that wallet (such as an cached file on a computer) you will be linked to the crime you committed. Plus you can't do anything nearly of any size and cashing out means revealing your identity through the exchanges which are under constant surveillance. So please, tell me again how it's the perfect vehicle to hide theft -- because I'm sure the silk road chief who is sitting in jail would love to hear your tips.
