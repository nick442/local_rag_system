I agree with everything you said except that increasing employee wages will raise prices. It can lead to that, assuming upper management receives the same level of compensation. The fact that unrest within Walmart ranks is taking place, is a symptom of what we can all see when we look at the numbers. The upper management is being overly compensated at the cost of employees. Employee wages can be increased without the cost being shifted to the customers by decreasing upper management's take home. it's one part ethics, two parts good management, manage a company through equidible graduated work reimbursement.
