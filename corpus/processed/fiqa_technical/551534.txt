It's a decent sounding theory, but there are a lot of things that just.. don't actually happen when the government doesn't provide/heavily regulate them. They're called market failures. Things like roads, electric, water, fire, police, health, military.. good lord, we've seen what commercial military organizations (blackwater) are like, and it's not good. Business has *one* imperative: to make money. A key thing to keep in mind is that good business decisions are very often not good human decisions.
