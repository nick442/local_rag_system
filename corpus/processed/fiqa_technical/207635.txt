"> Youre grossly underestimating how many people use marijuana regularly and responsibly also for medical needs. What percentage would you guess actually use it for medicinal use in a city like Los Angeles. I bet the numbers are pretty small. Its mostly people who want to ""escape"" and get high. > Theres a reason why your opinion is becoming more unpopular and that's because marijuana prohibition was founded on lies and racist polices not facts. Or that tons of people here use and don't want to see that its not necessarily a good thing."
