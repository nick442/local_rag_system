I understand that. How about this then: charity begins at home. His warehouses have many faults, including lack of drinking water and people being penalised when they are ill. It's good that he'll give some of his fortune away to charity, absolutely. At the same time it's also bad that this money was earned at the expense of his employees welfare at a business that he runs and he has the power to improve. People are being a bit too literal in this thread.
