For me, I factor in a couple of things. First of all, there are occasional opportunities for me to get more money at work, that happen infrequently. If I'm in one of those periods, I pretty much value my time at my salary, as far as doing something that I'm not great at or enjoy. I also am more likely to buy food to fill me up, park in a parking garage instead of walking 15 minutes to park for free, etc. But, when I don't have extra incentives, I tend to think more of my budget, and think about things from there. I might spend 4 hours to fix my microwave, when it might come down to only saving $50-$100, even though my time from work would seem more valuable.
