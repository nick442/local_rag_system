We have always tried to be reasonable in the pricing of our parts. We also try to keep the catalog pricing and stock availability up-to-date. Sometimes this doesn't work out as well as we would like Henderson Motorcycles. There may, from time to time, be price increases not reflected in the catalog. And as you might expect, sometimes we run out of an original part and we do not have a source for more. The purchase of a large lot of original Henderson spare parts that had been the basis of a thriving motorcycle repair business for our company.
