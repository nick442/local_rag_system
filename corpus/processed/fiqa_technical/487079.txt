"No sweat. The ""next big thing"" I'm trying to promote is the crazy idea that the people who own the means of production (aka ability to design, write, code) should recognize that they themselves are a factory, and make and sell their own products. You knowâ€¦ business. And to stop letting themselves be taken advantage of by con men offering ""free"" money."
