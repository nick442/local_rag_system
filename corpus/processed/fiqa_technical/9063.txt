Missouri. There is silage use here, but the capital costs are prohibitive for all but the largest producers, and grass is cheap to produce compared to most silage crops for us. It may be that silage is something we should look into. I know most old farms here had silos, but almost all have fallen to ruin, and the only ones left are at large dairies. I can't think of any that are used for beef. Either way, rotation is cheaper than hay or silage. We don't have any problem producing grass most of the year.
