FedEx pays as little as it can get away with to employees, because it CAN. We are in an employer, not employee, favoring market. Of course they pay less. But the Post Office is antiquated. If it wants to survive, it needs to adapt to the times. The reasons it is kept around seem more sentimental than anything else. I used to work at the Post Office, and I definitely didnâ€™t make $5.00 / hour more than anyone. Unless they were waiters, who depend on tips. I still want to see how we know government employees are making $5.00 / hour more than they should.
