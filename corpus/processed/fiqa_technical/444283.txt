"Hypothetical question w/ no actual ability to implement, so pick a hypothetical answer. I'm guessing you feel they're milking tragedy for ratings. Assuming a non-cynical perspective for a moment: Psychology 101; talking through stressful thoughts helps reduce stress. It's not a new phenomenon, since radio of the 30's talk show hosts have historically played ""the voice of the public"" who talked through stressful times & even helped people come to terms with major stressors such as war or other disasters. Talk shows have always instilled a sense of community; yes it's somewhat contrived, but in truth certain shows have certain defined viewpoints that speak to aligned social groups. People feel better, even if nothing tangible has changed, and that can be a good thing."
