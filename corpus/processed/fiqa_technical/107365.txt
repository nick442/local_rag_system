"Ok, now if someone could explain to my why Argentina didn't do the following: * Set out a schedule of payments for the 100% of the debt, and pay everybody (Mr. Singer included); * When they hit the haircut % amount, declare ""default"". The parties that had agreed to the haircut would be fine, as they had already agreed to the haircut. Mr. Singer would be left out to dry for the rest of the money, due to the default. It would technically count as a default, but only the vulture-funds would experience the actual default, and so the markets would see that haircuts for the majority actually apply for everybody, and henceforth encouraging all bond-holders to negotiate hair-cuts rather than encourage vultures to buy nonds for a nickle and demand the full dollar."
