Oh I don't think its about money, though Saudi's show the middle finger to US sanctions opens the way for many more countries to do business with Russia and the economic benefits thereof. It the world telling America its opinion no longer matters This is about Russia exposing an American Israeli nexus in the Middle east and spreading terrorism and wars because of Israeli influence. That is far more damaging because when its just America and the Fed and Israel left and no one to buy those funny money US treasuries, because a confused America and an Apartheid Israel can't sell US $ 20 trillion of debt to each other
