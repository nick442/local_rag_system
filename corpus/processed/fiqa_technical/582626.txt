The Muscat Overseas Group established over four decades ago, is committed to the growth and progress of our nation. As the Founder and Chairman of the Group, I have watched it grow, from humble beginnings into a force to be reckoned with. It is with a sense of pride and satisfaction that I look back on the years of vigorous effort and struggle.
