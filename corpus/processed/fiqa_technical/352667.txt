From a quick google, apparently 5% of government contracts need to go to women- or minority-owned small businesses, with another 18% going to small businesses more generally. If your company was bumped, it was b/c they were on the bubble in terms of quality/price, and inevitably the only reason were able to contract in years prior was b/c of the rules discriminating against large businesses over small businesses. The more concerning take away in all of this, is how on earth is it a struggle to hit the 5% target without any sort of affirmative action intervention. A bit of an eye-opener on the extent of systemic racism / inequality of opportunity that exists today. We really should be doing more to support minority owned businesses, and more importantly addressing the apparently inequity in opportunity in our business culture.
