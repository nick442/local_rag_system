Who offered who what? You're pretending industries are fungible. They aren't. Apple and Microsoft are not related to the MIC or big oil. Energy is a demonstrated input in every other sector in the world. Why not include (for example) agriculture in your math? It's 100% dependent on energy costs. You're isolating individual industries as if they exist outside of the greater supply/manufacturing chain and pretending that they can be swapped for one another based on the single metric of market size. Apples and oranges. Except in this case the world runs on oranges.
