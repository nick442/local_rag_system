Why are they trying to demonize Seth Klarman. He's a value investor buying distressed assets, not some nefarious puppet master. Is having their bonds fail better for Puerto Rico or anyone? Seth Klarman didn't bankrupt Puerto Rico. You can't make someone take a loan, and a default is bad for all parties so why the finger pointing.
