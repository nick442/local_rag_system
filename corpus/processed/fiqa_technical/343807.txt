Frankly, things that would have seemed crazy to me as little as 5 years ago: Moving most of my assets into precious metals, and since I can't afford (and don't think I have time to properly stock) a farm where I can be self-sufficient, looking at moving out of country to a place with a healthy economy that isn't too dependent on the US. The other reason I'm looking at moving out of country is that the Federal Government seems to be preparing to transition into a police state - which makes some sense given probable large-scale riots when the economy collapses. I don't think that who wins the Presidential election will make any difference to what the government will do.
