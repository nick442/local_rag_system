The unstated bit of info is that most minimum wage workers who want to work full time aren't able to. The employers prefer part-timers who get fewer benefits, and whose shifts can be altered at the last minute to match up to real or forecasted demand. If you are a retail clerk or fast food worker, you generally can't get a full time job and with the constantly shifting hours you find it a challenge to get a second part time job because you can't tell the hiring manager in advance when you'll be available to work.
