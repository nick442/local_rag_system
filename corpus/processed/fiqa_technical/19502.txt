">There was a good quote in the article about how Google, Apple and Amazon combined employ fewer than 1/3 the people that GM did in 1980. Yeah, that was from [the Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/10/death-steve-jobs?page=1) First, that is only a total of their DIRECT employees (numbers from Wikipedia on each company): * Amazon = 33,700 * Apple = 60,400 * Facebook = 3,000 * Google = 31,353 So, that is NOT including *indirect* employees, including any and all subcontractors.. to wit: * Amazon -- sells lots of stuff, but lets just think of the BOOKS alone: there are LOTS of authors, publishers, printing industry people, etc -- who are NOT direct employees of Amazon, nor even indirect ""contract"" employees; but whom Amazon's business model has doubtless helped to increase TOTAL sales of their products. (And then of course, there are all of the Amazon ""affiliates"".) * Apple -- sells stuff, but basically no longer manufactures anything at all (so comparing it to GM would only be valid if one looked ONLY at GM's engineering and sales personnel, and ignored it's manufacturing people, or if GM had likewise ""subcontracted"" all of its manufacturing to say Toyota); just about everything that Apple sells is made by subcontract overseas manufacturers -- like FoxConn (which employed over 900,000 people in China in 2010); and of course that is NOT including the component manufacturers. And of course, this is also ignoring the entire software industry that has built up around Apple's products (Mac and iApp developers). * Facebook & Google -- likewise, there are a lot of ""indirect"" non-employees who nonetheless are in many senses laboring for these companies AND be compensated by them (whether App developers, affiliates, etc). **I find it VERY notable that *theEconomist* entirely ignored firms like MicroSoft (92,000+ direct employees) and dozens & even hundreds of others software companies like Adobe Systems (9,000+), etc -- not to mention countless thousands of consulting companies.** At it's absolute PEAK employment in 1970, GM had a little under 400,000 employees. If you add in Microsoft, Adobe, and a handful of CAD software companies, then ""high tech"" employs at least that number. Add in the (domestic) sub-contract employees, the consultants, affiliates, and on.. and they employ far MORE people (even domestically) than not only GM, but GM + Ford + Chrysler combined. Add in the worldwide employment, and there is no comparison at all.\* And even then, all of it is beside the point. Yes, you cannot ""eat"" software or an iPod.. but likewise you cannot ""eat"" a car. What is chiefly critical is whether a nation can FEED itself, and the US production of foodstuffs has never been higher, nor -- on a long term comparison basis -- have food or energy costs ever been lower (even with all of the disastrous effects of monetary inflation). \*What the US's current problem is, is DOMESTIC employment -- and that is mainly a result of various TRADE, MONETARY and TAXATION policies -- it certainly isn't the direct fault of private industry (and definitely not the fault of ""technology""). I mean good god, how many times does the Luddite meme need to be proven false."
