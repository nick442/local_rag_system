"I don't live in Pennsylvania and I don't know anything about this particular tax, but just the name says that it is a ""local"" tax. TurboTax covers federal and state taxes, not local taxes. Many places have city, township, and/or county taxes that you are required to pay in addition to state and federal taxes."
