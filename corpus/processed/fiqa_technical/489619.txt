"That doesn't answer either of my questions. For the first, you've given me a quotation (which I've seen several times before and cannot find the original source - if you know it, please cite it) that consists of opinion and speculation, not a definition. For the second, it could be inferred that you mean to tell say you would support reverting to a monetary system based on exchanging precious metals, which Mr. Jefferson passingly implies his tolerance of. However, if this is what you mean to communicate, you're not doing yourself any favors in helping me understand your position by basing it on a minor aside in an unsourced quotation about something else. I'm very much on board with the movement within OWS that's pushing for socioeconomic justice. But most of the people I see shouting ""end the Fed!"" really have no clue as to what they're talking about. This sort of willingness to act on ignorance is damaging. *Edit*: If the OWS reference was weird, it was because I was previously reading a banking story from one of the Occupy subreddits and briefly forgot where I was ;) Nothing changed except a spelling error and this note."
