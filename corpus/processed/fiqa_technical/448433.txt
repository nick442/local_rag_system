"Can someone please clarify if Norbert's gambit is the optimal procedure to exchange CAD to USD? I'm not sure I'd call an arbitrage trade the ""optimal procedure,"" because as you point out you're introducing yet another point of risk in to the transaction. I think buying the foreign currency for an agreed upon price is the ""optimal procedure."" If you must use this arbitrage trade, try with a government bond fund; they're typically very stable."
