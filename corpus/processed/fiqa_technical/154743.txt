"This ""article"" is pretty shit, but the one point it *should* bring up is that unemployment numbers do not include previously self-employed people that are actively looking for a job. Because I'm not on unemployment, I'm not counted as unemployed and looking for a job, even though I am. Also, unemployment benefits run out at a certain time, so the government can write off self-employed people and people who's benefits have run out. That doesn't mean that those people aren't still looking. If you think the government doesn't cook the books in their favor.. well then I have at least a century's worth of history to show you."
