"FRM, but IIRC ""Risk"" is more of a reporting role in most banks nowadays. Meaning you automate some tools that generate reports, and your job is to make sure the results are numerically consistent with industry standard (read: wrong) methodology, and capital rules. Learn how to calculate VaR 20 different ways, some less useless than others, however mostly fundamentally useless. Expected shortfall, so basically if there is a VaR break what is the expected loss (also useless!) as you will either by simulating based on some distribution that hopefully fits the data, or historical data which is supposed to repeat itself. So to do this fun stuff: You're gonna need to know stochastic calculus (not necessarily but you should understand intuitively the formulas you're using), statistics (hypothesis testing), some econometrics/time series analysis, but key thing is programming."
