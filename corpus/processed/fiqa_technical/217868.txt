Cash has zero value until it is transformed into something material. Cash hoarders realize no improvement in their lifestyle by gaining more cash than they need. If corporations are already so flush with cash they only inflate the stock market, why would further tax breaks improve anything? An inflated stock market only improves income for very few. People who need money will spend it and put it back into circulation. People will not hoard cash if they know more will show up regardless of their ability to perform. Less financial pressure and less resentment of the rich for their preferential treatment would create a more positive attitude among the population and improve productivity. A happier work force is a more productive work force. People should only work part time anyway so they can have a life outside of work to enjoy their lives while they have the health to do it. Slaving your life away until you can't do the things you always wanted to do does not improve a person's outlook. Life according to me. Was a reduction in unemployment compensation, medicare, medicade and SNAP payments included in the study? There may be a reduction in spending on crime and addiction as well.
