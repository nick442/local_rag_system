As littleadv says it depends on the local laws. Normally one shouldn't be too worried. Typically the stocks given to the employees are a very small portion of the overall stocks .. the owners would not try to jeopardize the deal just so that they make an incrementally small amount of money .. they would rather play safe than get into such a practice.
