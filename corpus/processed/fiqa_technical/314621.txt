I'm attacking because you have put more time and energy into defending whole foods than most people put into defending their families. You aren't merely checking your inbox, you are specifically answering THIS THREAD, and doing so within a few minutes of the post being made. That's a lot of dedication to a brand. As far as you now saying that it's the difference between a horror movie or an arthouse movie, you don't act that way. I've never felt the need to defend my media choices by camping on the inbox. I've never been personally insulted that someone doesn't like my media choices, nor have I ever insulted other types of movies. Honestly, other than shilling, there's no other explanation for exactly why you're taking this all so personally. Or why you feel the need to answer every person who says something bad about WF. Or why you can always more or less stay on a set of talking points no matter what. So I'll shill as well /r/hailcorporate!
