Thanks for the nice words. I do work in research actually, but I think there are a lots of people who would be a better AMA. As far an intelligent policy, it really is simple. The people that have been in power have decided that not enforcing the law is better off for their prized constituents than enforcing it. The Democrats liked the illegals that became their voter base, the Republicans liked the cheap labor they provided to their corporate doners. They have now wrapped all this in social justice nonsense so being practical is now akin to being racist. The solution is simply to enforce the existing laws.
