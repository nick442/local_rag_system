"Neo-Nazis nowadays attack a lot of minority's but yes i would defend jews as well. My ""other fights"" have to do with the field i work in which is registration of Chemicals and Toxicological studies. Please read your source completely because the answer why the statistic is risen and why it is not a good indicator for crime rates is in the text. I did send to you the statistic about pilitical crimes in germany so read it if you want to see the crime dustribution. Really my last post this time because i do not see any value created from posting here. Maybe something to think about for you at the end: Is a guy stabing a Muslim because he thinks he defends his country a terror attack ? What about a Muslim stabing a guy because he thinks they destroy his culture ? To me both are acts of terror ! Just towards diffrent groups but yet the news covers the one and ignores the other. Try to stay open minded and dont ignore the power of speech and the impact you can have with racial speeches like ""The terrorists are muslims even so some are nice guys"".. to me that is a talk of a ""but"" nazi as we call them in Germany. E.g. i have nothing against refugees BUT they making terrorist attacks rape our women and are highly unhygienic by shitting in the streets"" That is a 1a grade hate speech and pretty much your opinion as far as understood you. Please try to see that such things are damaging to the society and lead to mobs with pitchforks trying to restore ""order""."
