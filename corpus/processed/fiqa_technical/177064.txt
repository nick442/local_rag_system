I don't probably shit like the facts. This chart shows the US population by age. I don't really see any pyramid that I'm supposedly laboring under. http://i.imgur.com/piIUyEp.png Hell just take a look us demographics wiki page. Edit: Nevermind, I see it now, there are like a million more baby boomers than there are teenagers. I feel like I'm being ground into dust by their weight.
