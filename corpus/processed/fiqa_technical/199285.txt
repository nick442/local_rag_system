It makes sense for a lot of people - it's basically weather insurance. It's useful for farmers (bad weather ruining a harvest), airlines (abnormally high amount of snowstorms increasing cost of delayed flights), hotels (rain making people visit less), ski resorts (not enough snow) and other businesses that can be negatively impacted by extreme weather variations. If they systematically slightly overpay for this protection the speculator can make money on net helping these businesses reduce the volatility of their cashflows which is important because they need to pay their overhead costs every year. Edit: The derivatives themselves also allows the people selling weather insurance to hedge their exposure on the market.
