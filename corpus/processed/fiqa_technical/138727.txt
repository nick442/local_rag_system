">Corporations should be able to ""oppress"" as much as they want This is incredibly short sighted, and even if I kept the rest of your quote, it wouldn't change that. You are tacitly handing over control over our civil rights to anonymous people in a boardroom. We won't let the government oppress us, but Wal Marts fine? The rights we have are only effective if we are able to use them in real life. If our lives are dominated by corporations who take away our rights at every turn, we don't have access to those rights anymore. The Bill of Rights is a document designed to protect people from Tyranny. Corporations don't get a pass on having to treat people fairly because they weren't elected. How can we sit an decry Donald Trump and let thousands of people who are just like him oppress from the boardroom? Your position is born out of fear and a desire for retribution, and you ignore the consequences of setting precedent that allows corporations shut down speech they don't like."
