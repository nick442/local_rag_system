“Only 6 time in US History has the Stock Market had rallies with 9 or more days in a row of all time highs – Hoover in 1929, Eisenhower in 1955, LBJ in 1964, Reagan in 1987, Trump in 2017 and Trump again in 2017.” “Now President Trump is the only President in US History to oversee more than one Stock Market Rally of 9 or more days in a row of all time closing highs.” There are two related events like the growth in GDP and the decline in unemployment that shouldn’t be forgotten. “Unemployment is going down, good paying jobs are increasing, the US GDP broke $19 Trillion for the first time ever under President Trump, the US debt is down $100 billion since the inauguration and Americans are making money again” A healthy and growing middle-class is of a great importance to a nation like ours because working Americans have more disposable income and more capable of saving and investing for their retirements. Economies thrive when the power of government is restrained and economic freedom is promoted.
