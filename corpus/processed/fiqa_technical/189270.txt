Yeah, that's in the public knowledge. What I actually want to know is who runs the foundation after the current co-chairs Mr. & Ms Gates, Gates Sr., and Buffett are gone. Will the juniors be in the payroll? Will the juniors be living in the houses owned by the foundation? Question is what kind of relationship will the juniors have with that foundation after the seniors have gone?
