A brief time off, often 7-12 weeks is called a sabbatical. What you propose is far beyond that and unless you have it well planned out, you risk burning through all your savings and perhaps more. Most of us are planning a retirement and have some idea of the savings needed. You first need to plan this 2-3 year hiatus, and then for both of you to get rehired, and start the savings again. I envy anyone who can manage to do this while they are young enough to enjoy it.
