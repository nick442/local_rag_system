Out of curiosity, do you use any social media services (reddit included) that you would be willing to pay a subscription for? It costs money to host a website. Content may also cost money. Other than advertising, there are very few other routes a website could go down for a regular income, and fewer routes that have actually succeeded. Strip out advertising and the majority of the internet - certainly the most popular sites - would cease to exist, I feel.
