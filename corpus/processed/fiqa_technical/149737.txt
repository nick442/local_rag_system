you really have your facts in hand. are you involved in policymaking? are you a researcher? would you consider doing an AMA? actually with everybody being so hopped up right now, it might be a huge shitshow to try that.. i just would really like to see level headed, factual information out there for people. i guess that makes me kind of dumb, because people are not seeking level headed factual information at this point in the festivities. sorry I'm contradicting myself right and left may i ask, what do you think an intelligent policy would be, going forward?
