Well I guess if your idea of collusion only applies to paper money then I see where you are coming from. However, the collusion of gold/diamonds/younameit has been going on for much longer in history. Some ingenious person came up with a gold coin which REALLY started to look like money. Copper is money too and brass, silver, tin, and aluminum. It happens to be easy to carry around.
