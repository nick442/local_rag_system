"I recently bought a ticket to a really good soccer game on Vivid Seats, since Ticketmaster, the official vendor, was ""sold out"". In reality, scalpers had purchased huge swaths of ticket real estate and were selling thousands of tickets on resale sites. Ticket was $220. Fee was $50. I never go to big events, so didn't realize that was the model. As a sort of first-timer coming in, the whole thing seemed ridiculous, knowing I was paying an inflated price, and that the app charges $50 so a ticket appears on my phone."
