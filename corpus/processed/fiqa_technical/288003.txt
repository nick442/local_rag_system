That lousy argument has been debunked so many times. Advertising is a plague that now serves fraudulent activities far more than actually “helping” websites and more importantly people behind them. On average, a dollar spent on online ads actually gives you only 20p of ad space, the rest being taken by the battalion of intermediaries from media agency to google to ad exchange and so on. So no, ads don’t help websites, they feed the ad monster built by google and facebook and used by petty criminals. No one ever said we were ok to see oligarchies owning the web - as a physical infrastructure as well as on the content side of things - and taking most of the revenues while real architects of the web we know are not living from their activities. If it wer eup to me we’d be hosts and clients in a really decentralized network where bandwidth would be the fluid currency.
