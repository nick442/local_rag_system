Depending on who you trust, the Social Security fund should still be liquid for another 40 to 70 years or so, which should cover the life expectancy of most boomers. As for what happens after that, well there doesn't seem to be a plan for that yet. A plan would require making some unpopular choices. Politicians would be forced to do something with negative political ramifications in the short term to offset a problem that isn't going to explode until long after they have left office and shuffled off this mortal coil. For most it just isn't worth the political fallout. What is likely to happen? The same thing that is happening now. The Government is no stranger to spending money it doesn't have, the National deficit and debt prove that convincingly. Of course we are now approaching debt levels we haven't seen since WWII from the combined efforts of two concurrent wars and bailing out every industry that can afford to hire a lobbyist, and overuse of the old politician's trick of buying votes by spending people's own money on them and pretending to be magnanimous. Something is going to have to give. My best guess is that the following will happen in this order: 1) Increase then eliminate the caps on how much income you have to pay SS taxes on. 2) Raise the age when you can start collecting SS checks. 3) stop paying people SS checks if they exceed a certain income at retirement age. 4) stop paying people SS checks if they exceed a certain net worth. 5) Reduce the amount people get in SS checks. Of course another baby boom or drastically increasing the amount of legal immigration would also stave off the problem for a while..
