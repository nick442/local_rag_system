While I see the argument for this, I'm not sure I agree with it. I expect a member of the board to act in the best interest of the company while acting as a member of the board. However, I don't think you're obligated to have every action outside of that to be completely inline with the company. You are entitled to your own opinions. Furthermore, I don't think that Hastings gave him the low rating because he thought it reflected poorly on facebook, but because he disagreed with Tiel's political choices. The email quote in question: > I’m so mystified by your endorsement of Trump for our President, that for me it moves from ‘different judgment’ to ‘bad judgment.’ Some diversity in views is healthy, but catastrophically bad judgment (in my view) is not what anyone wants in a fellow board member. While I agree with Hastings in that Tiel's support for Trump was a bad choice, it's clear that he gave the rating to Tiel _solely_ because he differed in political views than him, and not even from the perspective of being bad for facebook, and _that_ is what's uncalled for.
