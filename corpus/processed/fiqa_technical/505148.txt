I have searched like crazy for one that appears to have been taken down. Basically, the premise was that semi-communist states were more capable of coping with ubiquitous robotics than capitalist states that lacked strong socialism with positive rights. Like, a capitalist state could do great under UR, if it could regulate markets effectively AND was guaranteeing healthcare, food, and (most importantly) education to all its citizens. It honestly was exactly what it sounds like you are looking for, but I read it a few years back and no amount of googling has turned it up.
