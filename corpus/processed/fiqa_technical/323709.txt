Correct, but it will always be harder to raise chickens than to print money. I'm not actually talking about using chickens as currency, just using them as a metaphor for the dollar bill. It is generally easier for people to think about something tangible, rather than a piece of paper that has an arbitrary value, especially when dealing with economics issues and debates.
