> Lego's durability is curbing sales. Their durability is a side effect of their requirement for tight tolerances, which is needed so that a stack of 100+ bricks doesn't perceptibly lean off-kilter. If they let up on the durability, they lose the tight tolerances, and then the cheaper knock-offs that are already sitting at the looser tolerances will be recognized by consumers as just as good, and squeeze them out from many markets. /u/fruit-based is correct: 5 years of double-digit growth is crazy for a core sales proposition that has been around for literally decades. It's a good run, it's not the end of the world to acknowledge that trend stops. Time to take a breather, retrench, and use the time to figure out how to penetrate new markets in less developed nations in Africa, for example. Not to explicitly seek to return to the double-digit growth, but solidly serve the existing customer base while steadily growing new bases. If they build an automatic brick sorter and storage robot, with voice-recognition and a tie-in to a [Bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/)-like directory to retrieve/buy requested-described bricks, then I'll grant you that they'll return to double-digit growth again, as an buying frenzy of parents go out to buy the robots and keep adding to the storage system bins so their feet will thank them later. :-)
