"And I'm reading through the pack of stuff There should be a soft copy of Terms and Conditions. If so, please put up a link. Generally 0% APR comes with some strings attached. The literature on the Bank of America site shows 0% APR only for Balance Transfers done with 60 days. On one of the comparison sites; the Bank of America card shows 0% only for balance transfers and purchases done in first 60 days. 0% Introductory APR for 12 billing cycles for purchases AND for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days, then, 13.24% - 23.24% Variable APR. 3% fee (min $10) applies to balance transfers. Which means that if you spend say $200 in first 2 months, you can repay this $200 in next 12 months at 0% APR. However if you spend another $100 in 3 month, this should be paid in full along with a portion of $200; else interest would start for all of $300. Generally 0% APR don't make sense as there are lots of hidden terms and conditions and the real benefit may not be that great. Edits: The Literature looks quite confusing. On the Main Page it says; Introductory APR 0% for 12 billing cycles Applies to purchases and to any balance transfers made within 60 days of opening your account This would mean say you do a Balance transfer within 60 days, of 120 and say you make purchases with 60 days of 120. Total liability is 240. Scenario 1: Assume you do not use this card. Then you can safely keep making payments of 20 per month for next one year. Scenario 2: In 3rd month, you swipe for 100 more. Now the Total Due will be 100+20. If you make the payment of 120, then fine. If you make a payment of only say 50; Then the interest will be calculated for [240-40, payments for 2 months+50 of current month]; i.e. on 250. However the detailed ""Terms of Conditions"" seem to limit this only to Balance Transfer of 120 in first 60 days and not to any purchases in first 60 days. With Terms so vague, my suggestion, don't get this card for these benefits. Get this if you need a regular card."
