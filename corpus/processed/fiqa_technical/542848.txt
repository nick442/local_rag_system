"I like a devil's advocate :) > Amazon made a brick-and-mortar acquisition which will now have a direct effect on consumers by trying to hamper which sites their customers try to access while on wifi and can also be seen as anticompetitive. This statement assumes that Amazon intends to use the patented technology, despite no evidence of such intent (at the time of filing, at the time the patent was granted - which Amazon has no control over, or at the time of the WF purchase announcement). Your reasoning has merit: the patent only became relevant when amazon acquired an opportunity to use it. However, it relies on assumptions that aren't necessarily correct or complete. Hence, it isn't an objectively correct conclusion by any means. By including only the fact that the patent was recently granted (timing lined up with WF acquisition), the author promoted the idea that the patent is part of Amazon's plan with WF going forward. Amazon may *now* have plans for using it in connection with WF - or it may absolutely not. There is presently, working from the article itself, no evidence to suggest any such plans exist outside the author's mind. (I have zero doubt that they have *considered* using it, btw, I refer to actual plans to implement.) I may be old fashioned or uncool, but the correct way to ""frame the situation"" is **always** completely and accurately, including all relevant information. This allows readers to review the information and draw their own conclusions - even if the journalist *also* shares his own conclusion."
