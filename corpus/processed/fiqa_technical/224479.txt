No workplace is perfect. There are probably a lot of things they are doing that seem wrong or don't make sense. The problem is figuring out when it is something that matters, and when it is just an annoyance that can be lived with and hasn't yet found the resources to get fixed. So be a bit humble, even if you see things you know are wrong, you should not necessarily think you work with a bunch of monkeys. On the other hand, you may be starting your first job working with a bunch of monkeys. Good luck.
