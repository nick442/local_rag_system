MBA and CFA aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. MBA teaches you a broader set of skills and, more importantly, gives you access to a network of alumni that can open doors for you. Network is perhaps the most valuable part of top MBA programs. CFA is a gold standard in finance and would give you a set of useful skills for wealth management. If you can get into top 10 business schools I would say do both. Otherwise, if you are absolutely sure about money management, then go for CFA. It’s cheaper and you can still earn income while pursuing it.
