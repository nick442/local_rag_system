He offered a 15% stake. He showed willingness to move from his original position by moving to 20%. This left the door open for further discussions but if the last shark wasn't offering royalties or something else to sweeten the pot, he wasn't going to budge much more than maybe to 22.5%. You give away too much too easily and a seasoned negotiator smells blood and goes for it. Every round of negotiations needs to offer a bit more but less than the additional offered in the previous round and not without receiving something in return (so after increasing by 5% to 20% he would not have added another 35% based on their arguments, he would reason why an additional 2.5% would be the most he could offer without additional consideration..if he jumped from 15% to say 40% too easily the other negotiator would be looking for an additional 20 after that) . So he went from 15 to 20 (in response to the 75% equity stake) and did nothing to seem pigheaded or unreasonable while setting the tone for the next (and last) negotiator. The last guy wasn't willing to walk away and Jonathan showed that he wasn't going to be pushed into a bad deal.so a deal got done. Dunno if that makes sense but his cogent assertions coupled with strong but fair negotiating skills (and a product that at least one person saw value in or any negotiation would be pointless) won the day.
