"Lol, wtf kind of question is this? First off, there is no single ""derivatives market"". There's listed derivatives (ETD's) and OTC. Then you can break each of those broad markets down into forwards, futures, options (includes all exotics such as binaries, single barriers, double barriers, one touches, double no touches, knock ins, knock outs, reverse knock ins, reverse knock outs, window barriers, etc), and swaps (including swaptions). All of these are product specific (FX, FI, Credit, Equities, Commodities, etc).. so its more appropriate to look at derivatives with respect to the market they are in rather than all derivatives across all markets. Now to your question.. your question makes absolutely no sense. Are you wondering what the daily volume is? Notional outstanding? Total exposure?"
