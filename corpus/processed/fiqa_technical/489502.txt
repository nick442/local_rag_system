MENA is big and Arabic is a huge advantage in finance right now given the interest in Middle East development projects, sovereign wealth, commodities like oil, and the regional volatility that makes all those things such high risk and high reward. Someone with your credentials could easily transition to an equities research role, or even a geographic or market research role covering the region. You'll likely have to start at an analyst level and work up if you don't have past work experience, but definitely look at the big investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, and other investment advisers that have holdings in the MENA region. Another option is the management consultancies. Great money to be made and lots of firms. Oliver Wyman, AT Kearney, McK, Bain & Co., Strategy& - all have big interests in the Middle East and will pay you well. I also studied conflict in MENA, primarily Egypt. Good luck!
