They didn't have enough money to cash everybody out. And at a $100B valuation, a lot of people wanted out. Note that they only earn a billion dollars (only 1% of the initial speculated valuation), and most of that needs to be reinvested into the company to keep it going. They need to spend money buying Instagram and other patents/startups, etc to ward of competitors.
