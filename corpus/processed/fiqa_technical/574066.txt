My experience has been that it is hard to be in recovery and be in school at the same time. Separating yourself just won't work. Try and go to a target school, a school with a well known business program. But above all, keep the faith. Been sober for 2 years, if I can do it you can do it. Don't forget why you are, to TG, CH, and HO.
