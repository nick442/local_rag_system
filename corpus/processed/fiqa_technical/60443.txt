Rich tax evaders are entitled leeches who claim extraordinary results enabled by their community/city/state/republic as wholly their own. They violate the social contract that asks members to pay their share of the cost, as determined by tax code, for public goods they enjoy. They refuse to contribute toward improvement and maintenance of infrastructure that magnify fruits of labor and investment. If they find fault with the way the military is run, they should get politically involved. If they just don't want to pay taxes, they should move elsewhere and renounce their US citizenship. I don't see what's heroic about tax evaders.
