"I've seen the same happen with several companies, with programmers engineers, salespeople, managers, etc. Both companies end up paying more, and in many senses (because it *always* takes time to get ""up to speed"" in a new company) losing out because of it. It's inane, really, how little most managers/owners really *value* their employees. Probably one of the scariest things I've ever heard is in privately-owned companies where they say ""we treat all our employees like family"" -- which I always want to laugh at, and say ""My God, I would hope you can do better than THAT.. [because, hell, most 'families' are dysfunctional and pretty much screw each other up/over at just about every opportunity]."""
