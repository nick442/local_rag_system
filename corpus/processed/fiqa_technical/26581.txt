"The only thing I'd be concerned about is whether or not the credit report site offers a loan consolidation option right next to the statement that ""too many installment loans are lowering your score."" If it is, then the site stands to get a kickback for referring you, and you might question whether or not the advice is correct. But if not, then take that statement at face value and look to consolidate. Just run the numbers to see what it will cost (or save) you."
