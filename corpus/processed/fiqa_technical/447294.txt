The only way I've seen mezz work for more than one cycle is the hard money model. Stay away from glory assets. Maturities of a year or two max. Have the stomach and wherewithal to foreclose quickly when the borrower defaults. Keep the (C)LTV under 70, where the V is not aspirational. Unitranche is generally better because it simplifies and, therefore, expedites things. All that requires sitting on dry powder while your competitors are busy and then it will cost you relationships in your other funds/divisions when you ramp up. This is why most lenders succumb: they tie their managers' careers to the short term, which, to be fair, is much easier to measure. This also applies the broader mezz market beyond RE.
