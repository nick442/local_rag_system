It's a terrible company to work for in north America. I'm not even surprised. A buddy of mine worked for then in Canada. They would hire you for a contract. By law you can only have a person in contract for 5 years. After that they must hire you full time. So what they do is tthey fire/let go ppl around the 4 year mark and re hire them shortly after (restarting the whole contract process, Cutting benefits along the way).
