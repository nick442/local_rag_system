Not in the long term, of course not. But take a cross-country flight in coach, after the normal check-in process at your destination, stress over a lost bag or two, and then with no turnaround time deliver an address, run a meeting, or work with sensitive materials. As others have pointed out, an hour or two of coach isn't going to dramatically impact one's ability to do that although the flight could very well leave a sour taste in one's mouth if you had a baby screaming through most of it or some other adversity that could have been avoided if you flew business/first.
