Learn from others' mistakes. Pick a hero, or 3. Study them closely. They were people too and faced similar challenges. I'm doing one of the hardest things to do per economic textbooks and general business mythology, which is starting a healthcare service provider (doctors, nurses, etc.). Anything is possible if you work hard enough. And try not to let it consume you haha.
