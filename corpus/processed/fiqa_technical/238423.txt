Unless you're eating live turkeys, you're saying that simply raising things give us the right to abuse them. It doesn't matter whether its for food or not, that part happens after they're dead. Maybe I'll start chopping off my cat's toes for shits and giggles--I am, after all, the one raising it. Do you maintain the same sentiment towards the abuse of dogs before slaughter in South Korea and China? What about bears tortured for their gall bladders? I mean, that's what they were raised for.
