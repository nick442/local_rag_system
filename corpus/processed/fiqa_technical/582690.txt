"I think you're missing the point. In terms of profit margin, the trucks actually pay a larger percentage of their gross in overhead - that is, their net is a larger proportion of their gross than it is, on average, for restaurants. They pay more for inspections, they pay for commissary services and many other things (and licenses and permits) than restaurants typically pay. What you are proposing is a law that would also bar another brick and mortar restaurant - in your own words, one that ""sells the same product for cheaper due to the lack of overhead"" (say, for example, a chain fast-food restaurant). Are you saying that new businesses shouldn't be allowed to open next door to established businesses of the same type? Or does your argument only apply to food trucks? I am not a flag-waving libertarian or anything, but I don't think that choosing which types of business model to protect should be on the list of things that city governments should be doing - especially in the case of states like California and Texas, where the state vehicle code clearly states that the ONLY regulation a municipality may enact on otherwise-legal mobile vendor are rules that serve the public health and/or safety. Not competition. Just because some people may not agree with you doesn't mean that they are either ""simple minded,"" or misread your point. I understand your argument very well - I just don't happen to agree with it. That doesn't mean I think you are ""simple minded,"" either; I just think you're a name-calling jerk."
