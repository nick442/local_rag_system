"For 8 years the Left shouted, ""Bush's fault!"" Before he was even president, when he was just President-Elect we already saw, ""Trump's fault!"". But when the economy is strengthening it's ""Obama's fiscal year."". Dear Lord, you should be in the Olympics with the skill of mental gymnastics you must do everyday in order to maintain your Idenity Politics narrative. Lol"
