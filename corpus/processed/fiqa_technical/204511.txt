Your cheapest option is to pay the penalty on $ 60,000 now, and pay the remaining $ 40,000 this coming January. I assume the penalty will be 2.15% of $ 60,000, or $ 1,380. My logic: The effective cost of the money is 3.186% - 0.8% = 2.386%. Thus, it is worth paying the penalty if and only if you can save at least 11 months of interest by paying the penalty. Eight months of interest differential on the $ 40,000 will be about 1.6%, or $ 640, which is less than the $ 860 penalty you will avoid on the $ 40,000.
