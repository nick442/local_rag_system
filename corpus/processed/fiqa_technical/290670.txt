I get the point you are trying to make, but Walmart is a multi billion dollar company, this would never happen, even if Amazon tried, Walmart could outbid them. Net neutrality protects the small companies that can't throw around millions of dollars. If you were to create a startup to compete with Amazon or Walmart, without net neutrality they could pay to throttle your website and effectively kill your business.
