I don't get why a section of people are getting better pay or benefits, be they public or private, is a problem. They're performing a service for the public and the public pays for that service through their taxes. Complain about government workers, refuse to maintain or raise pay rates in order to attract better workers. Also, there are pay freezes in sectors of federal and lots of state governments. Who's wages are getting higher?
