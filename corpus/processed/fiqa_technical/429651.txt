This. My Economics is a B.S, which is why I was required to take a bunch of statistic and econometrics courses. It makes it much more quantitative and you should even walk out with knowledge of a few statistical softwares and maybe rudimentary knowledge of a couple programming languages (most likely R, Stata, SQL, maaaaybe Python). You get out what you put in, of course. I used R and Stata, I took it upon myself to do some stock analysis with Python. You should be able to leverage it for a job. At my school, it was even in the social sciences department so the pre-reqs were the same, super easy to throw on a second major within that college. My second major was poli sci, you should consider adding a second one, too.
