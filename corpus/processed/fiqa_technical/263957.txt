The trouble is that you're conflating crime with success. There are plenty of successful businessmen who have done absolutely nothing to you. Indeed, there are many whose only crime is that they provide goods and services that people want more than yours. Yet you would punish them as surely as any wall street banker who deliberately defrauded the people. Indeed, you would punish them with crushing taxation even whilst you fail to punish those who committed actual crimes and actually do deserve to be punished. This is why you're being ignored -- because you're attempting to disguise your greed as righteous indignation, and when someone points it out to you, you feign ignorance. I'm sorry, but we're not going to live our lives for you. You need to get a job.
