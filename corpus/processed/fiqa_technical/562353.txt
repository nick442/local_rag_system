Yeah. CEOs that make $1/year aren't doing it as a labor of love. It's because they'd exceed a threshold (I think it's around $75k salary) that makes their capital gains taxes jump. If they have a significant amount of money invested it costs them far more in taxes than their salary would otherwise be worth.
