>France is the epitome of bureaucratic sclerosis This is ironic considering France is one of the few countries in the world well known for the very high quality of it's bureaucracy. When a project gets decided in France, it gets done. Infrastructure is excellent. French highways and french roads are very modern. All french major cities are now connected with fiber optic cable. Just look at the state of american infrastructure, the very slow and expensive internet, the roads full of potholes, the collapsing bridges. It's a complete shame. You talk about bureaucracy. Don't even get me started on the american healthcare system and the billing process. You should travel more before having judgements like that.
