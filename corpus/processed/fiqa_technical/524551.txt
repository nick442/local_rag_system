Previously, advertisement volumes were not allowed to be louder than the peak volume (as opposed to the average volume) of the corresponding show. Obviously, the loudest point of a show isn't immediately before the commercial break, so the difference in sounds was very large. This new regulation should change things for the better. However, I can see TV content producers putting very quiet parts right before breaks to maintain the difference in volume that advertisers rely on to draw attention.
