"It's not abnormal for a company that is as young as yours seems to be. It seems (based on what little I know), that you have debts, or accounts payable that were formerly covered by the $200 cash, but now aren't, because you paid it to yourself. For now, you're ""entitled"" to pay yourself a draw or a salary. But if you continue to do so without earning money to cover it, your company will fail."
