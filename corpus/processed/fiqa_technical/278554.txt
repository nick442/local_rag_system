"> Sometimes that requires more time other times less. True story: I was at a job interview once, and a manager told me, ""I don't care if you work 30 hours a week or 50, as long as your work is getting done."" I thought about that for a second, and asked him, ""Do you have a lot of employees who regularly work 30 hour weeks?"" He sheepishly replied, ""Well, no. And if you did that, I'd probably give you more work."" I got the job, but left after a few months when (among other things) they announced mandatory 48-hour work weeks."
