"Rather than automating it, why not just create a listing that you maintain and display on your site yourself? That way you don't have to give out credentials or anything else. It also presents a bit of a marketing opportunity. You could group contributors by the size of their contributions and thank them publicly. For example, maybe your top contributors could be members of the ""Heroes Club"", and you could come up with jazzy names for other groups. It's a way of publicly acknowledging their contributions in a way that they appreciate, and perhaps it motivates others to up their own contributions to get into one of the more prominent groupings. It becomes a competitive ""one-upsmanship"" thing, if that makes sense. I understand your desire to be transparent, and that's admirable, but see the marketing and public relations opportunity it brings to you as well. I hope this helps. Good luck!"
