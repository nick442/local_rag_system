It's interesting that the most upvoted comments miss the point entirely. They did not have tax/insurance escrows. They make the point that they were not *required* by their loan docs to have escrows. Further, they make the point that despite not being required to have escrows **AND** being current on taxes and insurance, B of A paid the taxes in duplicate and **forced** insurance. I have several mortgages with B of A from acquired companies. I have been current on insurance on all accounts with the same insurance provider since before the four years or so BoA has owned/serviced the accounts. At least once a year BoA either notices me that they are going to or actually does force place insurance. If I don't catch them in time it can be 8-10 phone calls over several months to get credited back properly.
