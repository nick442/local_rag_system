"It's helpful to remember that Charles Ponzi started with a legitimate arbitrage (international postal remittances). Once purveyors of arbitrage reach a certain scale, there's a natural tendency to become lazy and just forgo the arbitrage and just use new investor money to pay off previous investors. Banks wouldn't be any different if it weren't for central banks and government participation. Indeed, the primary reason that the FedResInk came into existence is **because** of ponzi-like bank failures (bankers call them ""a run on the bank""). Neoclassical economics is about using the synthesis of state sovereignty and central bank monetary theory to keep the system they've developed intact. ..and, as fun as it might be to sit back and calculate just how much debt can be created from a life-time of labor proceeds (a couple million for the average person-- completely hypothetical back of the envelope inflation excluded, 4.5x10^14, which is still in middle of the trillions), it would be wise to keep in mind that the last banking crisis, while fundamentally caused by the inability to collect future labor proceeds, was precipitated, not by individuals, but by repurchase agreements propping up extremely leveraged positions made by and between massive investment banks. So, the thing to remember is that fractional reserve debt issuance banking is like a 10 to 1 transistor that has a fundamental tolerance requirement on the source signal, but that when the source signal fades, it can draw from the surplus signal created by the 10 to 1 amplification (up to a certain point and then the transistor goes up in a puff of smoke)."
