"Thanks for the response. I apologize I should have specified about the govt. job, I was referring to was a state job. More specifically it was 3 jobs with the California BOE as an Auditor 1 and Business Tax Rep. and also another job with the county assessors office as an Audit/Appraiser. The state jobs were my best bet because of connections but they can only do so much since its a govt. job and people are cracking down on nepotism. With the little amount of research I just did, the pre-requisite to take the PMP certification is Four-year degree, 4,500 hours leading and directing projects. and 35 hours of project management education. That seems like a bit much and a somewhat vague as to what counts as relevant ""hours"" so i'll have to look into it more. But as of now, given my experience the PMP is not something I can't obtain until I have those hours under my belt?"
