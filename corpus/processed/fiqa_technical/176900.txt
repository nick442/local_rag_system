While I respect the views of others, animal rights activists are some of the craziest out there. I understand that it is wrong if a pet dog is abused and neglected, but this is a different story. These are turkeys that humans bred for the sole purpose of killing and eating. Sure, what these employees are doing looks pretty brutal, but soon enough, all of these turkeys are going to be dead and cooked on tables all around the world.
