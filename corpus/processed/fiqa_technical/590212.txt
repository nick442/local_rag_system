"I think you'll find the vast majority of people don't like their first job and/or just see it as a stepping stone towards something better. With that said I highly recommend you stay for at least a year unless you're truly miserable. That year will let you learn not only more about your field but also office life in general and the politics/networking/traits it takes to be successful and move up the chain. Staying for less than a year can also be a red flag when you go to apply for your next job as companies can see you as ""shaky"" and not want to take the risk of hiring someone who will leave so soon."
