"Set aside any perceived positive aspects of being owed a refund and weigh those with the negatives. What are the reasons you should not have your money tied up with the IRS? You'll see that Uncle Sam does not have a good track record as a financial institution: Many thousands of refunds every year are delayed for many months due to IRS systems glitches. Yet, many people count on that refund which is not always guaranteed within the stated time-frame. You have no legal recourse. You cannot sue the federal government for the money you lent them when they decide not to pay you back for an extended period of time. Yet, if you decide to delay paying them, they have all the power and will use it to charge you fee's that no corporate / private institution would get away with. ""owing some tax money is better than having a refund from a ID theft/fraud/security aspect"" Again, there is zero financial incentive to lend free money to Uncle Sam, he is not a bank. The only time interest comes into play is when the refund is overdue. Even then, it is not an incentive / doesn't come close to the penalty burden on you if you don't pay your taxes on time. I would ask the followup question: What sane person would engage in business with such a financial institution?"
