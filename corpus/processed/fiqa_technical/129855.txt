"It's viable for you, but the ""investor"" is either stupid or willing and able to write off the investment as a gift for a friend in need, knowing it will probably end the friendship. The banks make their money off of indebtedness, with the highest returns being on the highest risk loans . If the bank isn't willing to give you that debt on your own, it's because they already know it's a bad debt. In this case, trust the banks. If you can't come up with the downpayment on your own, you won't be able to meet your other commitments on this contract."
