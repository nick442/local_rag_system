140 to 113? That doesn't even begin to equal the mess they created. This borders on criminal negligence but they'll get their wrist slapped and move on. IMHO, a proper punishment would be jail for the CEO, CFO and CTO. White collar crimes should be punished as severely or more severely than violent crimes. Edit: as a small business owner I'm responsible for the whole financial cost of repairing someone's credit if I have a breach. Will they repair the credit for 130 million Americans?
