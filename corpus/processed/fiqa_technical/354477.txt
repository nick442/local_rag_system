No, index arbitrage desks typically aimed to profit from arbitrage opportunities between index derivatives (mostly futures) and the underlying. The desk I worked at was a market making one that provided customers exposure to their index of choice. Inventory management was one of the things we did, but not the main, or only one. Also, names for the desk varied across different banks on the street.
