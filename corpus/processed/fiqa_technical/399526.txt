You need to stop what you are doing right now and cut off contact with them! This is an extremely common scam. Here's how it works: They give you a check, maybe even a certified check. Usually in payment for something they are buying from you. The check happens to be for more than the sales price. They ask you to refund the difference, and pressure you to do so quickly. You will see why in a second. The check deposits fine and the money shows up in your account. Assuming the bank wouldn't do that if it wasn't a good check you let your guard down and pay them. In a couple of weeks, the bank detects that it is a fake check. They remove the money from your account, and may even report you for prosecution to local authorities for passing a fraudulent check. Meanwhile the person has the money you gave them and you can't find them because they gave you a fake name. To add insult to injury they may also have the property you sold them. You feel like a chump. Variants of this scam include them asking you to cash a check for them and you get to keep a part of the proceeds for your trouble. Sometimes it is presented as a work-at-home scheme. If you feel you absolutely must complete this deal, and you shouldn't. I would suggest you ask the person for a couple of forms of picture ID and tell them you need to make sure they aren't a scammer and you are going to do a background check on them with your local police to protect yourself. I predict the person will disappear and never contact you again about the money. Also, I suggest you talk to your bank immediately and inform them you think you might have been a victim of a scamming attempt so that you don't look like an accomplice when this is all said and done.
