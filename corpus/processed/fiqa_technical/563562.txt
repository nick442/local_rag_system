Pulling out of your way to get to the gas station does not take 0 seconds, and playing on your phone is likely not what you were going to do anyway. When you're on your way to work and you need to get there in a certain amount of time and decide you need gas, you need to leave earlier to get there on time. Or when you're on your way home and all you want to do is get home after a long day, you're sitting in your car at a gross gas station instead of being at home. You know this is the case, but you're trying to make up glib rationalizations for your complacency. And you're speaking out of ignorance since you haven't experienced both ownership cases, whereas those who have experienced both ownership cases will say that EV charging is by large margin a more pleasurable experience. But by all means, keep cutting off your nose to spite your face. Spend more time filling up, more money, send that money to terrorists, give yourself poorer health, do all of those things, just so you don't have to admit to someone on the internet that maybe they've exposed you to a new way of thinking about transportation. That'll teach 'em.
