That's because the telecommunication companies of America were given over $200 Billion in tax breaks to bring broadband to every rural area of America in the 90s. Instead they um, they did nothing. I have family that can barely get a cell signal on their phone and can only get dial-up but can literally see Buffalo from their backyard. At night they can see lights in Canada across the lake. On the plus side they live in a big beautiful renovated farm house and made plenty of money investing off Baron's and other printed reading material, raised a valedictorian and can still collect the items they like on eBay.
