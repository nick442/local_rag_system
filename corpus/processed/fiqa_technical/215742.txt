Imagine someone is hammered and you predict they will have one hell of a hangover tomorrow. Tomorrow comes, but instead of sobering up, they decided to drink even more. So, you were wrong. You predict again - now your hangover will be even worse. Wrong again. This goes on until they simply drop dead. Substitute debt for alcohol and you have our situation exactly. We have no tolerance for the pain associated with sobering up, nor do the politicians have any incentive to sell it to us. By trying to eliminate the business cycle, we have destroyed ourselves. The seeds were sown by Greenspan, and while it has been theoretically possible to alter our course, the political realities have made it impossible in practice.
