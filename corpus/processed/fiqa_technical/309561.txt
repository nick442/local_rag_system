Canada does not have tax lien certificates. Instead, they do tax deed sales. Because the process is much further along, often involving local sheriffs, it is much closer to a U.S. foreclosure sale/auction process than a tax lien as you are likely thinking. The laws and processes vary by province as well, so you'll want to contact the provincial government tax offices to get the details.
