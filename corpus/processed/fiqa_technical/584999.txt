This is a general rule of thumb that has worked for myself, as well as my Father, Brother and Sister. We all own separate businesses. Mine is B2B, my Father is a freelance architect, my Brother is a plumber, my Sister is a CPA. This is pretty much standard practice for what is required from a franchisee for a franchiser, as well. It may not apply to all businesses, but that can be easily determined by anyone reviewing this list, unless they're complete idiots. So, thank you, Mr. Obvious.
