I worked in auto finance years ago, what dealers tend to do in refinance the negative value of the customer current car to the new one. So if a car is worth 30k they may finance it for 35k. Finance company will do as not to lose the dealer and customer is happy to get a new car. I had one customer call on a car he financed for 85k, car brand new was worth 70k. Told me how he was looking to pay out the loan and go to the competition for better rates. Before offering anything I did a quick value check and no way was it worth it for us to reduce the rates. Told him good luck and he needed to pay X amount, he asked me if I'm not going to offer a better deal, I told him no. He blew up telling me the dealer told him to call 6 mouths later and the financial company would reduce the rates if he asked for a payout. Customer also had a car that dropped its value like no tomorrow, so it book value was around 60k. So over the refinance limit. 6 mouths later get a call from collection, telling me just a heads up this guy's cars was sold at the auction as he couldn't make repayments for 30k. Guy was also told by the dealer he could just hand the car back in but wasn't told he still needed to pay back the difference in the loan once he did. My god some people had no clue.
