"You can get on boards by having good leadership skills and knowledge, being invited, and having good connections. You can often start by joining the board of some ""smaller"" groups such as a small non-profit once you have enough relevant experience where you can actually dish out advice. This is in addition to your normal job where you presumably are doing well and are respected. It all starts by having enough skill (and/or connections) that someone recognizes that you can provide value at the Board of Directors level. Or you know someone who just wants a ""yes"" man for his (or her) company."
