It's not mostly individually damaging, unfortunately. As the obese spend more on health insurance claims, we as the entire health insurance policy holders pay the price with higher premiums, since no health insurance company will pay that difference out of their pockets. With that said, instead of a ban, I'd rather see a soda tax, similar to cigarette taxes. You drink more, you pay more so when you start looking for health care related to your obesity, at least you contributed to a fund that can benefit everyone.
