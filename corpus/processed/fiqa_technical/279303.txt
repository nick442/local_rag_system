Over the long run, yeah I agree that that the technology consumers have and their real incomes have gone up. However, people donâ€™t live their lives in the long run, their experiences are firmly centered in the short run. People marry, have children, move, start work, lose work, suffer health problems, divorce, homelessness all in the short run. When you zoom in from the long run view, life and individual fortunes seem a bit more dependent on luck and relative positioning than long run technological or economic trends. This is exacerbated by our political system where money seems to positively correlate with the ability to wield political power. Folks with political power can engineer changes that can improve their bottom line through zero sum political games (think taxes, regulation, etc) and maybe even turn a short run advantage (starting a successful business, generating wealth) into a longer run advantage (eliminating taxes on inheritance, potentially cementing family wealth for generations).
