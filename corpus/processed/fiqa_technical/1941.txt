"> What kind of bullshit is this? >> Between October 2008 and July 2014 the working age population grew by 13.4 million persons I'll explain about what kind it is. The working age population is defined as [The civilian noninstitutional population consists of persons 16 years of age and older residing in the 50 States and the District of Columbia who are not inmates of institutions \(for example, penal and mental facilities and homes for the aged\) and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces.](http://www.bls.gov/lau/rdscnp16.htm#cnp) Note that there is no upper age limit on this ""working age population"". The large majority of people are retired by the time they are 65. The labor force participation rate for the 65 & up group is under 20%. So how much did the population aged 16-64 grow from Oct 2008 to July 2014? By 5.8 million."
