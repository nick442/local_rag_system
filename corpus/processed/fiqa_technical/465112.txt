That depends on the sort of trouble you are facing with regard to the model. If it is a vanilla problem around model flows or treatment of certain everyday line items, I find that [ASimpleModel](https://www.asimplemodel.com) helps quite well. If it is vertical specific (tech in this case), I recommend that you post your question on the appropriate forum on WSO and a tech banker/investor might provide some insight.
