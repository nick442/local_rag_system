"I was simply saying, contrary to your ""only a fool"" comment, the fact that White Supremacist groups publicly praise Trump makes it pretty easy for the common person who doesn't really follow politics to make the connection. Doesn't take a ""fool"" at all. You pretty much also just confirmed what I said by stating there are commonalities between their platforms. So I'm not sure what you're arguing against here. And if you're trying not to be rude in this thread, you should try harder."
