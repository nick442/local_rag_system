"Every car company does this and its frustrating as hell. Something much more prevalent -- even commonplace -- is the car you booked not being able.. not just car (much more common), but car type. When I travel I book flights/cars weeks if not months in advance. I travel on the company dime and they don't care if I get a Mustang convertible, Charger RT, etc., whatever. Again, booked weeks/months in advance. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to get off a 5-hour flight, take a 30-minute shuttle ride to the airport rental center (here's looking at you, DFW) and get there to be told I'm getting a Kia Sorento. I know it sounds snobbish, but I paid for the upgrade, I've still got an hour drive to XYZ, and I want something fun to drive. And they know, and I know, that bitching and moaning does absolutely nothing. If X car isn't on the lot, I'm not getting it, unless Jesus Christ himself comes down and brings a Hemi with him. I always see first timers there -- dads screaming at the desk agent with the wife and kids waiting on the benches, obviously exhausted and embarrassed -- trying to get the Tahoe or whatever they reserved. ""Let me speak to your manager."" I have seen this maybe 5-6x, and every. single. time. the wife ends up calming the husband down, wife apologizes to the desk agent, and they take their Hyundai Santa Fe or whatever. It's like the twilight zone every time I see it. ""Is this family still here from last time? Nope, new family."" TLDR; Convertible wasn't available, got the moped. Kind of like a convertible, I guess."
