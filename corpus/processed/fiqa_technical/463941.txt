I just made a separate post for this, but since it's Moronic Monday I suppose I suit the occasion with this repost.. I'm applying to work a few major banks as an analyst, and my understanding is that a numerical reasoning test is part of the application process. I'm trying to get ready for it, as most of higher-level education has focused on reading and writing with little to do with numbers. Therefore, does anyone recommend a good numerical reasoning test prep program? Every online program says they're the best, perhaps someone here has actually used one and found it the most helpful. Thanks in advance.
