"In 2001, Argentina defaulted on it's debt, and started negotiating a ""haircut"" with it's debtors. As a result, a lot of the debtors sold the bonds they had a fire-sale prices, thinking better get some back than nothing. One of the guys that bought those cheap bonds was Paul Singer AKA ""Mr. Vulture Hedge-fund"". I'll speculate here saying that Mr. Singer saw that the bond conditions gave him a way to force Argentina to pay the full value of the bonds notwithstanding it's default or negotiated haircut. Argentina did negotiate a haircut with about 97% of it's bond-holders. This meant that although they would lose out on some of the money, they would still get some back, and Argentina could work its way back to its feet eventually. Mr. Singer and friends were the 3% that did not accept the haircut, and took the country to court to get 100% of the bond value back. Now, the plot thickens. I don't understand if Mr. Singer knew this or not, but the bonds also had a post-2001 condition that said that no bond-holder would be worst-off than the highest bond deal Argentina offered anyone. Which basically means, if they pay Mr. Singer 100%, they have to pay everybody else 100%. Now, it was well established that Argentina could not pay 100%, and is not able to pay 100% of the debt, hence the 2001 default. Meanwhile, Argentina was paying out the hair-cut bonds, but holding out on Mr. Singer and friends as they still didn't agree to pay 100%. The courts ruled that they could not do this, and had to pay everybody. Since Argentina cannot pay everybody 100%, it is defaulting on the debt."
