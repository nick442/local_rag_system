"*""At our current rate of pay, New York City Police officers are still among the lowest paid big city police officers in the nation,"" said Patrick Lynch, head of the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union.* *The special-ops sergeant who made $265,059 is the highest paid policeman so far this year. His pay includes $115,394 in overtime. Besides the aviation director's pay, it also outstrips Chief Financial Officer Michael Fabiano's earnings of $257,814.* $265,059-115,394=$149,665. (not including OT) Assuming they work 40h/w @ $149,665 = $71/hour.. whereas a $35,000 salary puts you at $16/hour. Even $70,000 puts you at $32/h. How much do big city cops make??"
