This is very similar to what was asked in this question: Scam or real? This is a real winner of a scam, because it always finds someone gullible enough to fall for it. No stranger sends you money just to be a nice guy. This version of the scam is one I've seen on job-hunting sites. They'll promise you a job, and then they say they'll send you a check for equipment and supplies, but you need to send most of the money back to them. As long as they find victims, they'll continue to find more refined techniques to stay ahead of the authorities, and it'll change just enough that people won't recognize it for what it is. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!! I hope this helps. Good luck!
