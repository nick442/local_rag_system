"Scienctific consensus does not = truth. And never has. The list of junked science is long. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories Global warming is too. http://web.stanford.edu/~moore/Boon_To_Man.html ""Increased CO2 is greening the planet. Based on satellite observations from 1982-2010, CSIRO found that rising atmospheric CO2 levels correlated with an 11% increase in foliage cover across a number of arid areas in Australia, North America, the Middle East and Africa. Performed in collaboration with the Australian National University (ANU), this study determined that the fertilization effect occurs where elevated carbon dioxide enables leaves to extract more carbon dioxide from the air, lose less water to the air, or both during photosynthesis."" http://www.thegwpf.org/rising-co2-level-greening-planet-earth-study/"
