I can't. I really can't. I mean, when I can grab some microwavable chicken strips, white rice, and white corn, and prepare that inside of a few minutes, and have leftovers, what's the point of McDonalds again? There are plenty of meals that can be made quickly. McDonalds is chosen out of poor taste and/or ignorance of the alternatives. That said, nobody's ever been executed for poor taste (though sometimes I wish they were).
