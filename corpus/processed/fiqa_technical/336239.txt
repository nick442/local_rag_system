"The difference it that the headline I suggested removes the editorialization of the news. It is one thing to not have space for all the info. It is another to edit your headline to alter the meaning of your point. Someone dismissing a headline because it lacks a source is one thing (and with the words ""survey"" you at least expect to find the source in the article). Someone walking away from a headline wrongly assuming that ALL of the CEO's in the US got at least a 27% raise last year is another. I mean, this is the HuffPo. They ALL CAPS at least one word in every headline that is an action as a not so subtle demand on what you should do."
