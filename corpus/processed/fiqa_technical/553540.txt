I work from home. However I am starting my own agency (http://localgrowthdigital.com) in United States. It's specialized in E-commerce and small business. The website is not ready yet though. I am moving to Arizona and will open my office there probably. Yes, I got over $5.500 IN SALES only working online. Net profit was around 35-40% of that.
