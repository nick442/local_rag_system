"Meh, not really. While there was some idea that housing prices would continue to rise forever, the packaging of bad loans has nothing to do with optimism, that's outright fraud. If you really want to stretch the definition, you might be able to say they had a fantasy that they weren't going to get caught because..well they hadn't for nearly two decades. Honestly though, just google ""fraud housing market"" or ""mortgage banks"" and you'll find more than enough direct proof of fraud and deception."
