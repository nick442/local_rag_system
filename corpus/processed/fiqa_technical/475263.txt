"Strange, it works for me.. Here's the only part that matters: > In September 2016, a managing director at Barclays’ New York office sent an email — seen by the Financial Times — explaining that the two banks “have agreed to a 1-year ban on hiring any JPMC employee by Barclays” in key areas such as in corporate and investment banking. > The email, sent to more than 20 senior colleagues, goes on to say that following a review of pending offers by Barclays to JPMorgan staff, one “unfortunately will be pulled from Wealth UK”. > However, five days after the initial email, the same New York-based Barclays managing director sent a six-line message, telling recipients to disregard the original email."" So basically all just conjecture as to which email was their ""real"" stance on the poaching issue - Was the first one the real thing and the second just a CYA; or was the first one a huge mistake by a managing director, and the second probably included the phrase ""will be spending more time with his family""?"
