The simple truth is the mighty US military machine has been defeated by a bunch of towel heads with rocket launchers, because the Military Complex cannot balance the cost of war in such an asymmetric conflict where attrition means Billions of dollars for US and 2 goats, a mud hut and a baggy assed wife for them. Plus they got no Oil . .to grease the wheels . . .so we simply lack the motivation to win . .what is a Win? 2 democratic goats? The afghan government is totally corrupt and the military totally incompetent and more willing to shoot us than their own country man, they fucking hate us. Pakistan would be glad to be rid of the US influence, except for a few corrupt politicians and generals who are on the US payroll, Pakistan would for once be undivided and able to lend its full support to the Muslim world and all their struggles unhindered and confused by American double standards and an idiotic orange imbecile. Every single US ally will know that the American contract is best used for toilet Paper and those countries on the verge of going nuclear will see it as their only option. If the objective is to disarm Pakistan and denuclearize it by destabilization and political forces or out right conflict, if there is one country in the world that knows for a fact that its survival depends on Nuclear weapons and the will to use them, it is Pakistan Perhaps it is time to admit, this is a no win with no real objective except saving face.
