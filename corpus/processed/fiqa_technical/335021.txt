Maybe try Flow (Getflow.com) or Proworkflow (proworkflow.com) I use TaskWorld for my projects and Trello to keep track of my kids' assignments (4 kids in 4 different grades!). Several of my clients have used Asana. If none of those options provide all the features you need, check out Product Hunt. I remember seeing an app somewhere that allowed you to identify free time and bump tasks based on priority but I wasn't able to find it when I did a search. So- can't help you find it but there are some great apps out there. : )
