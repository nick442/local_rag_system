.. why? Why do you keep disparaging people for paying minimum wage then keep raising the minimum wage? its almost like raising the minimum wage makes things more expensive for everyone, including the person whose wages you raise, so that the minimum wage is never actually enough.. .. huh. Isn't that interesting..
