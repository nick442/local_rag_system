Everyone understands the necessity of those bailouts today. But I still contest that they were a net negative for the common man and a HUUUUUUUUUGE positive for the bank executives. In fact, the fallout from it - the conceptualisation of TBTF and GSIB etc - is basically a blank check for these banks. Oh yes, so many stringent regulations that we know for a fact that these banks will flout at the first opportunity available to them. And then, assuming it doesn't bring the global economy to its knees, someone will slap a billion dollar fine on them and let them go on their merry way.
