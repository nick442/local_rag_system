I do! What are you trying to explain to me? The situation (as I understand it) is that GS bought a bunch of PDVSA debt in May, on the secondary market. New sanctions went into effect a few days ago on new debt issued by VZ or entities like PDVSA. So GS did a deal in May that would still technically be allowed today. It was a dirty move then, and its a dirty move now. But legal. So, what did I miss?
