"This article is silly. We have a functioning labor market. Wages are balanced by supply and demand. We don't need more regulation to ""fix"" it. I think the market is effectively bifurcated. You have skilled jobs being well paid, and candidates can easily switch. For instance entry-level Computer Science grads regularly make $60k and have multiple offers. If you're highly skilled, life is good, economically. I think the jobs that require trade-skills are also under supplied. The roofer in the article is an example. These folks also get reasonable pay and steady work, certainly enough for a middle class lifestyle. If you're a low-skill worker, then life is much harder. There are job shortages, wages are low, and employees suffer. One complication is that many students go to college, but graduate without marketable skills. This leaves them to compete against low-skill workers. So college grads suffer from ""low"" wages, and non-college grads suffer from increased competition. I'm surprised so many people still take on college debt to get degrees that offer little to no wage premium. Minimum wage hikes can help a little. In Seattle they found no job loss from the first small minimum wage hike (and an increase in employee well-being). The second hike was larger and created significant job losses (enough that total wages paid were flat). I think this means that some jobs don't generate enough value to be paid $15/hr. The TL-DR is get skills to lead an easier economic life."
