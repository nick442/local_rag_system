You'd only be left with €2,000 in the bank, so paying it off completely in a lump sum now would be unwise. However, dropping, for example, €35,000 onto it is a reasonable option. That would give you still €42,000 is the bank (an excellent emergency fund), save you a lot of interest, and greatly speed up the repayment schedule. (Changing subjects: how much interest is it earning in the bank.)
