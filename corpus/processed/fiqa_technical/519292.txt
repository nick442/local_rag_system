> Should he take the time out of his day to condemn every group that might like him individually? No. Just the violent white supremacists when one of their group just murdered a women and seriously injured 19. > He condemned the violence on both sides and political violence in general. What more do you fucking want? Condemn the murderous terrorists more than the counter-protesters? > Do you want him to flog himself publicly and apologize for being white? Now i know you are being disingenuous. No one has suggested that. > Should business owners and public figures issue public statements condemning any white supremacists that might be patrons or admirers of their work? It's preposterous to assume so, so why assume the same with the president? Did these patrons just murder someone? Then yes. Yes, you condemn them and distance your self from them. Especially if you complained about the previous president not condemning muslim terrorists. Here is actual terrorists and he isn't condemning them.
