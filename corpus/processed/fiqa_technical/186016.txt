">I don't know of a country in the developed world with legalized cocaine Currently. It *used* to be legal in the US (just as was Heroin). And the ""drug addict problem"" was no greater back then than it is now. IOW, criminalizing it didn't solve the ""problem"" -- if anything, it simply made the problem a LOT worse (much as prohibition did with alcohol). **EDIT: BTW, you're wrong, [possession of certain amounts cocaine is legal (or overlooked) in several countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_cocaine).** *And please don't descend into some BS semantic argument that ""Well, Mexico isn't REALLY a 'developed' country.""* >It would be a bold step to have cocaine become industrialized like alcohol in the US Yeah, well it was a ""bold step"" to enact alcohol prohibition, and an even BOLDER step to repeal it. >Marijuana decriminalization is another story, but I don't agree with legalization of cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine. Yeah, of course you don't. You're ""trapped"" in the herd-thinking mindset (the one where you really don't have to do any ""thinking"" at all)."
