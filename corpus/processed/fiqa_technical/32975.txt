Interesting point. I hadn't considered the general market so much as the large retail locations like malls. I'm very interested in the effect of reduced foot traffic as major anchor tenants leave malls. Most food court restaurants / chain retail like footlocker etc operate on slim margins except at holidays / high spending periods.
