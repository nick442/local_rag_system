An hour isn't a long time to get your point across. It'll go by in the blink of an eye for you, and for them, especially if it's done well. So you just need to connect. Hit hard, get the points from your slide show in, and then delve in. Don't read from the slide show at the later part of your presentation, but instead go into detail from within. But for the beginning it's ok to kind of go through the points. I don't know if this will make sense, as it's 4:18 here and I'm one eye open. Hopefully you can get something from it. Knock em dead!
