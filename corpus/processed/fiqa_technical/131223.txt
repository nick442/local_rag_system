If it does happen I doubt it will be a rapid change. Just like electric cars one of the main hurdles will be getting infrastructure in place. Tesla has invested in a network of quick recharging stations around California, a Hydrogen based vehicle would similarly need Hydrogen fueling stations. Tesla and other competitors would have a lot of time to push out new designs.
