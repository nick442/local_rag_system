Popular kids probably care more about status and material things than nerds. Consequently, they're motivated to work hard to achieve those things, ask for raises, etc. As a nerd, I can't say I'm very motivated by money once my basic needs are met. I'd rather work with people I find interesting or pleasant, doing things I find interesting. Certainly I wouldn't turn down lots of money if someone threw it at me, but I wouldn't do something I didn't like or work with people I found disagreeable for more compensation. Just my opinion.
