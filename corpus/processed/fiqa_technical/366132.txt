Is their risk taking creating jobs though? When i bought Apple stok a few years ao, what entrepreneurial spirit did I promote or encourage? Why not give extra tax breaks for the sale of stock purchased during a public offering (since that goes to helping the company) but not for secondhand (less necessary) trading. Should we give big tax breaks to people who lend businesses money?
