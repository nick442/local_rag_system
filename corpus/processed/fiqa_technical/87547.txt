So you're saying it doesn't make economic sense to mine? That is very much already the common consensus within the Bitcoin community, it is too late for most to get into the mining game at this point. It is still a necessary process though because the proof of work is what secures the network against attacks. That said, Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency, and there are other coins are mined in more efficient manners.
