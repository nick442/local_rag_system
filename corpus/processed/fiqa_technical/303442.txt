"I feel sorry for these people who may lose their benefits, but it's not like they didn't know the risk in linking their life insurance and long term benefits to the company's success. Of course it's a huge risk. And it seems like a lot of these people already got more from Sears back in the day than anyone gets now at most workplaces - one guy said that he made enough for his wife not to work and to send two kids to college. Why didn't he put any of that into his own retirement funds? Another guy said he made tons of money and even that his job made him feel ""like God"". Wow. Corporations are not your family. Treating them like they are is a quick road to disaster."
