The problem is in cities where there's already a housing shortage, AirBNB rentals raise rent, and therefore its pricing out locals from living here. I'm paying a 25% premium just living in my building because AirBNB hosts have rented 10% of the building. The entire neighborhood has this issue. Landlords know they can increase the rent dramatically since AirBNB renters are paying a premium. The end result is that people have to move much farther out of the city. As a result, artificially my sub district is now affordable only by much higher class, or they wipe out the savings of any locals that previously were able to live here. AirBNB shows hundreds of listings in my area and rental prices have skyrocketed as a result.
