Anyone have any recommendations for a long term investment? I’m thinking like holding for 30 years, Iv got a bunch invested already but they are all only from my view. Lots are in the renewable energy sector such as solar wind and hydro. But I’m looking for 1 or two more maybe to put an extra 5k down on and just sit for 30 years and hopefully it grows
