The standard response is that being poor makes you unhappy, but after your basic needs are provided for then [additional income](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html) doesn't help much. Although the oft-citad $75k mark noted by Kahneman is >2x [median personal income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States) in the US and 1.5x [median household income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States). So that's actually a pretty high bar. I'd be curious to see how it breaks down by region as purchasing power varies pretty widely by geography.
