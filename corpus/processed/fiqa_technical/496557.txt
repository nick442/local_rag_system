And the weird shit is that it's actually kind of good thing for the banks to do that. If there is lot's of money around on people, it means they can invest it on something. That investment helps new businesses to emerge and employ more people. If there would be less money around, the rich dudes would still invest, but there could not be so much competition in investing, so they could ask for higher interests. This would mean that the system is rewarding someone more, not because he is taking bigger risks or because he is driving the economy into efficient direction, but because there just happens to be shortage of money. Does more money imply that more people will invest? Yes, because of inflation they have to invest not to **lose money**. Actually that's why governments maintain inflation, so that people are forced to invest.
