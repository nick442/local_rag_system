Right.. so the question is why does Chipotle sell you a meal that is clearly too high in calories and then try to put a healthy spin on it? Because people don't give a shit about healthy food or where it comes from. They want a three meals rolled into one for 6-8 dollars. Chiptole is just the flavor of the week, once you've had their 5 menu items once you realize the burrito is all that's worth getting and then it's kind of like going to subway but with fewer options and a higher price tag (i dont like subway either)
