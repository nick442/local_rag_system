"I tried to get a friend to buy something at Monoprice - it was even cheaper there than Amazon. However Monoprice insist you create yet another account with yet another password before they will let you make a purchase. Needless to say he said ""screw that"" and made the purchase at Amazon. It is amazing just how bad many of the alternatives are to Amazon, especially when the competition is Amazon where the user already has an account. An article - [The $300m button](http://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button/) - is excellent highlighting the same issue. Jakob Nielsen also has a [good report on current ecommerce sites](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ecommerce.html) - note how great the failure rate is. Back to Monoprice, I did contact them to explain that they were losing sales, explained why, pointed to the $300m button article etc. They then explained back to me that I needed to create an account on their site before making a purchase. Duh."
