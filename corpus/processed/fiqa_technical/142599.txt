I tried automation and it didn't work as well. Automation is great if you want to sell or buy when a stock drops or rises; however, automation is terrible for day trading. Specifically because it is impossible to automate a program to scan every news feed. Even then, automation is only if you want to be the effect of a rise or drop in the market. A stock rises or drops and you sell or buy. The problem that arises is that it is nearly impossible to make money off of automating trades. You need to buy the stock before it rises and sell it before it drops. There is no way any program will ever be able to do that accurately.
