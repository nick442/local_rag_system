Why not take the boycott directly to the companies that host their sites through GoDaddy? I use a Murdoch blocker in my browser to block all sites owned by Rupert Murdoch. I imagine something like this could be put together to block sites hosted by GoDaddy. A sudden sharp drop in traffic might help some companies to see the light. I'd even paypal five bucks to anyone who made this happen.
