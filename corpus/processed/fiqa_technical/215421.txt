Throwaway account was a good idea. I work in government sourcing and depending on what government you work for, what you're doing is illegal as shit. Federal stature and most state statute prevent a government employee from 1) getting paid for another job while being paid by the government for working during the same period (double dipping), and 2) being involved in the selection process of a vendor with whom the employee has a vested interest. Additionally, if you work in a position that requires you to complete an ethics form and certify it, you will be further breaking the law if you don't disclose ownership by falsifying a government document. Realistically, you're probably just full of it, but if you're telling the truth what you're doing is unethical and probably illegal. And before you get too smug, you should know that government auditors aren't nearly as incompetent as you might think. Just overworked. It might take a year or two but I'm guessing they figure it out eventually. Government procurement and auditors generally have to verify things like company registration documents, etc..before awarding contracts and any time a contract is renewed. The auditors go back and look at those documents. It won't be hard to figure out what's going on, especially if you were the PM for the project.
