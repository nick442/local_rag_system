Cheaper than a trailer park in the country? What planet do you live on? Seriously. It's not the sticks, but we are surrounded by farms for miles. The tallest building is a chicken plant. The closest major airport or train station is two hours away. I can tell you grew up in suburbia. No one who grew up in the country would ever say that. It's easy to move from the city to the country. It's extremely hard to go the other way. Also, those cheaper places you're talking about are cheap because the job market sucks.
