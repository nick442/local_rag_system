"That's an example of the Act applying to an adviser to a fund, not a fund being exempt from the Act. An adviser to a 3(c)7 fund in this case is taking advantage of a safe harbor pertaining to performance-based compensation set forth in the Act. The reasoning is that a 3(c)7 fund will by definition most likely be comprised of ""qualified clients."" The prohibition does apply to other private funds - such as 3(c)1 funds. To the extent that their investors are not ""qualified clients,"" they are unable to charge a performance-based fee."
