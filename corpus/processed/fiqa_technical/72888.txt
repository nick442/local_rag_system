"Former employee so I have a little insight. They are very scared of unionization and also losing their exemption in the Railway Act. This classifies FedEx as an Airline/railway company, where UPS is a ground shipping company. What that means is that FedEx has protections against unions. FedEx ground drivers are not employees, they are contractors. Some of these guys are not happy and the states were changing laws to benefit the workers in some way (i'm not entirely sure how it works). But FedEx is smart so they are reclassifying these people as ""Independent Service Providers"". They are forcing single route drivers to sell to multi-route/ISP owners. When you have an owner that owns multiple routes they ar eless likely to be pro-union and it also puts another barrier between the driver and FedEx."
