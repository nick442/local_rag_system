>The Russell 3000 measure of US stock prices was up by 16.93% in 2010, but CEO pay went up by 27.19% overall. this is telling since generally stocks follow earnings(not always but generally). This shows the skewing of ceo compensation with productivity increases. You know the median worker at these corps didnt see a 36% increase, probably not more than a 8% increase if that. And thats not counting the really low level people., who still havent seen their jobs come back despite corps breaking records on earnings and giving ceos raises after having their markets and banks bailed out by the us tax payer. Corps need to ask not what the country can do for them, but what they can do for the country, To borrow a quote.
