I bought after the 67% fall. They disclosed that iPhone 5 wouldn't be using their ip. But Apple is only 37%of their revenue. They have $5.54 in cash and last reported at .20 EPS. 8 out 10 smartphones use their tech. This is a no brainer value play for me with a new and upcoming tech. I'm still buying.
