When has a terrorist EVER had trouble getting onto a plane? The TSA screening is a joke, and actual suspected terrorists don't go on the no fly list, since that would alert them that they are under surveillance. All airplane terror plots that have been stopped in recent times have been stopped by other passengers on the airplane. If I was able to go from the front door, checking my luggage, going through security, through the gate, and onto my plane without seeing a single airline employee or TSA thug, I would feel significantly safer. Hell, put me on a drone with no human pilot, and have vending machines rather than flight attendants. Also, while I'm making demands, airplanes should have bunk beds instead of seats, and they should gas the cabin on long flights.
