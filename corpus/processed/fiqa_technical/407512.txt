"I dislike shopping for some stuff from Amazon because they actually suck at a lot of key e-commerce things. Their search is pretty bad for some stuff. Computer parts, for example. The pricing/shipping games-- ""Here are 82 sellers, some of which count towards the 'buy $25 and get free postage and some that don't"" This is especially bad for things like books, where used is just as good in most cases. Teasy free shipping. You have massive warehouses in my home town. You can ship any of these items same day if I pay 12 bucks for the privilege. Don't tell me you can't get it to me in less than 10 days if I select free shipping. The constant ""are you really really really sure you don't want Prime?"" Seeming random pricing. I like manga, and it's worthwhile to order 3 or 4 volumes at a time to get to the free shipping tier. But you'll have ""Volume 11: $9.75, Volume 12: $15.40, Volume 13: $9.75"". Other vendors (RightStuf comes to mind) seem to at least have consistent across-the-board pricing and discounts."
