Without using the cash advance feature of your credit card, I'm going to say no. No mortgage lender would let you simply charge the down payment to your credit card. The reason is the merchant transaction fees. Typical credit card transaction fees that the merchant pays are around 3%. If the lender accepted credit cards on a $30K down payment, they would be giving up around $900. In addition to that, the whole reason for requiring a down payment is to ensure that the buyer has some equity in their own home. Many lenders will want to know the source of the down payment and will not allow you to borrow this down payment, because they want to ensure that you are not too far into debt. No-money-down home purchases are much more rare than they were 10 years ago.
