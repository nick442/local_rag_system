>Like when I got my passport renewed, I had to send in a bunch of shit with the check. Really? I did my renewal online. When I needed a new drivers license I did that online too (and they pulled the photo from my passport IIRC). All of that was paid for by card. I think if you do a new passport application, or you need to include new photos you can't do the whole thing online and need to do some verification steps (but you can do those at post offices IIRC.).
