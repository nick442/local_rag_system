Yeah, the owner and inventor Ted does final editing of all of the pages and he puts it out pretty much the way he speaks. It's not sketchy in any way. He's been working on it for about 8 years, has FDA approval in the works for each product and is filing 14 new patents within the next year. As for the title, I was just highlighting one of the products that I personally think will do well. The website will be getting a redesign once it's in full production. For the moment he has just the nuts and bolts until he has financial backing to make sure he can produce for the expected demand.
