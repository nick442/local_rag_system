"No idea, but I am so sick of hearing about ""unfair"" pay. If you don't think the pay is fair for the job then don't take the damn job. If that's the only job you can get, well, take the job and improve your skills so that can get another job asap. All these article imply that the ""underpaid"" worker has no choice. They have every choice!! Luckily we live under an economic structure that allows you to do whatever job you want, take advantage of that!! In previous iterations of society you were stuck doing whatever your parents did. You guys wanna keep trashing our current system I'm sure we can revert to the dark ages real quick."
