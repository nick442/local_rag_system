I disagree with those that claim an HSA is only useful for those that can afford it. An HSA is useful for anyone that is eligible to contribute to one and also pays their medical bills. This is true even if you are living paycheck to paycheck and have no money left over to contribute! Here's how you do it: This way even if you don't have enough money to make regular contributions to the HSA, you still get the tax advantage anytime you make a payment. It's effectively the same thing as regular contributions but without having to guess how much you'll need. You only contribute exactly the amount you need.
