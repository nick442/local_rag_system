Yeah I agree this business model isn't really the same and why a company like GameFly hasn't taken off like Netflix. Game makers don't really need to do it. There's fewer titles than movies and people spend a lot more time with a game then they do with a movie. Also people are obviously still willing to pay $60/game for premium newly released games or else they wouldn't still be doing it. Game prices have actually gone up over the last ten years versus the opposite for films.
