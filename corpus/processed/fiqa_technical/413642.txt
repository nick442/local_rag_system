"From the article: ""Because of complicated legal and financial constraints I (Abigail) am unable to withdraw my investment at this time.."" BECAUSE: ""*I still gonna make money off this cause it's HARD to separate this asset from my overloaded portfolio..stocks go up in value and then Yaaaa! Bonanza down the road WITH THE HIGHER STOCK VALUE.. but hey, I still love those little snot-nosed children and the scrappy puppies they chase around in my park - yeah, my park as their deadbeat parents don't pay any taxes - of course I don't either, but my accountants can explain all my write-offs every year that gives me a ""No tax due"" notice and usually a refund!""*"
