Hey all, I have no idea what to do in order to calculate the wacc. It just doesn't make sense to me! And more so, understanding the circumstances in which it would be appropriate to use the company's wacc as the discount rate in the project. The Australian company tax rate: 27.5% Applicable date for risk free rates: 28/8/17 10 year rate for risk free: 2.615% 8 year risk free rate- 2.505% Credit spread for corporate bond: 95bp I just don;t understand what I am supposed to do!
