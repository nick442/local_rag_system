In the UK Ticketmaster own a site for fans who bought tickets but can no longer attend a gig to resell tickets. Sounds fair enough, but thousands of tickets appear on it the day tickets go on sale for a gig at massively marked up prices. Undercover documentaries have shown these tickets were never available to the general public at face value. End that practice & I'll be happy. Fees are a minor irritant in comparison
