TBH I wouldn’t assume that the CFA is quicker. It takes at least 18 mo if you take them consecutively, and if you fail one it’s at least another year. I did my MBA part time in 2 years, and I hear the average for the CFA is something like 5 years. If you want to go into something more quantitative/ back office focused I say go for the CFA. MBA will probably provide you with more general career options
