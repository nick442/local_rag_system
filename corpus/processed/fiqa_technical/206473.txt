Am I the only one who thinks that AC is NOT a dump? I haven't spent too much time there and I do know there is a huge part of the city that are made up of crime filled slums but in regards to the beaches, boardwalk, etc. I've lived in NJ my entire life and went to the boardwalk the other day (for the very first time) because I keep hearing about how AC is falling apart, etc. I was SHOCKED. The bars were jam packed, the boardwalk had thousands upon thousands of people on it and the casino's didn't have an empty seat at 11am. What am I missing here?
