"I agree. These think tanks are coming out with some cooked stories but no one is checking even the motivations of some. Some university departments seem also to be putting out study results with social and economic implications that are cooked. The results can't be reproduced in the studies by the social ""sciences"" and they never tell us that. I don't know if it's bias or the media just likes to go with a prepackaged (ie prepaid) story."
