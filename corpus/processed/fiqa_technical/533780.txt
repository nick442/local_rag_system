I was commenting on your other assessments. I have investments in various funds and some stocks I think may end up being bought up. Your judgements on the health market and student loans fails to scratch the surface of why we have these issues. There will be a market bubble burst though it always happens. Short any consumer stock you see as it'll likely be the most hurt by the bubble. Also any of these tech stocks with no profit.
