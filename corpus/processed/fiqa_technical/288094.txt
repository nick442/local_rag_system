I think we're well past the point that vinyl is considered a hipster trapping, a lot of people that aren't beholden to a clique enjoy collecting vinyl; almost like trading cards but for music they enjoy. It's a visceral induction of the album as a whole as the rest of the music industry moves towards playlists, internet radio, and Artist's Top 10 song splashpages. I've never subscribed to the notion that vinyl sounds more accurate, but it is aesthetically pleasing and 'warm' in tone while providing a physical token.
