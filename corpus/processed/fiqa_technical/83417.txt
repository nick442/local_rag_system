There are two solid years of Gen ed classes you can take. I do recommend taking them first for lots of reasons. Your major specific classes will mostly be upper level, and you will benefit from taking classes in a similar order as their class codes indicate they are meant to be taken (100's first, then 200's so on) at least roughly. You aren't going to get to any finance classes for a while anyway, as I can pretty much guarantee you are going to need macro and micro econ and two accounting classes before you can even take a basic finance class. So don't worry so much about your major right now.
