What's wrong with WIX? I've heard some good and bad about it. I signed up for it because it's cheap concerning how I didn't know how well this would even do at all. I was going to move to Shopify if I got bigger and had more funds to start. For the last response, how would I research how competitive the market is for organic search? Again, I'm such a noob and am starting from little knowledge, please bear with me here. Haha.
