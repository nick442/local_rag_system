"Retail stores are certainly ""winning"" and when online shopping starts winning they will switch to that, Walmart can easily deliver anything you want in 15 minutes to 90% of the US population and so can CVS and many other stores. They don't because it's way more profitable to have you come into a store. Amazon is HUGE online, they are like a giant compared to everything else except eBay, but realistically they are about like a Walgreens, which is a big retail store, but not huge. Except that Walgreens made 2 Billion dollars last year and Amazon's retail side lost money. If online shopping ever starts killing real retail they can switch to delivery super easily."
