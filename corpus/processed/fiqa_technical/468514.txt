If you pay off a debt through a collections agency, it will damage your credit. Here's an alternative approach. Settling a $10K loan for $2K, shows the lender is keen to settle. Instead of paying the collections agency, negotiate with the lender and agree to pay 2K to settle provided that they agree to: This could be a win-win for both. The lender gets to keep full 2K without having to pay the collection agency a fat commission and your credit isn't damaged. Not saying this will always work, but worth a try. Pro tip: Get everything in writing before you pay anything.
