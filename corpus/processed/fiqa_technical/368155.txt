The short answer is the drafting got kind of fucked up in the bill, and confessional and state republicans were able to launch lawsuits challenging the provision as unconstitutional, and have got a favorable ruling from a conservative district court, the district court's order has gotten stayed pending a slow moving appeal. Trump has the power to flip the governments official position and say he agrees with the district court and won't enforce pending the appellate ruling. The case is a tough one because the plain language reading differs pretty starkly with the clear intent.
