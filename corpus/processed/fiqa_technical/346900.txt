"You're right. It actually isn't too long. I've certainly read much longer articles but the author just is not effectively communicating. When the writer tells you to ""refresh your drinks.."" that's a sign that even *they* think it's not going to be a quick summary of the situation. If it were a more compelling read then I'd slog through it but the author's ramblings are not enough to keep my attention."
