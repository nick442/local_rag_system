I used to go on recruiting trips when I was in consulting and got a great look at the process and what HR values. Presentation: wear a white shirt with a mild patterned tie (dark blue or dark red with grey are good colors). Prep: Study the company's website and read the first part of their 10-Q financial report. Have a leather portfolio with a pen, notepad for notes, and 10 copies of your resume. Attitude: Show enthusiasm about the company and position. You'll want to have questions for the interviewers, even if you know the answer, and can ask different people the same question. Good luck and have confidence!
