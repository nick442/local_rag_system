> The best country is only 10% better.. No, the US is average to below average. Your calculation assumes a baseline of 0 but that isn't the case. For math we scored 487. The top score is 600 and the bottom is 331. That puts us in the 58th percentile in the full range. Don't feel bad. You probably went to an American school.
