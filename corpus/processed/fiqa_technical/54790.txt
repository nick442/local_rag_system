He's exaggerating. Smartphone usage, while lower in Japan than the us, is still around 55% today vs. 65% in the US. & their Healthcare outcomes are far better than the US, technology in healthcare is great, but it doesn't matter much if a portion of the population cannot afford or access it, the Japanese achieve these better outcomes despite having an older population than the us.
