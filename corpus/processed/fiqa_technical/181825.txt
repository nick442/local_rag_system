Would you like to make an impact on others in the community and get paid for doing it? Well, one of the best ways of doing so is by starting a group home for foster children. Maybe you want to target foster children that have been removed from their homes and are between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. You may think that this is a target age range that will allow you to really positively impact their lives. Once you have done this, you are halfway there. So move ahead and join your hand for the noble cause.
