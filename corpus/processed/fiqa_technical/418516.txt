"I am trying to set up a formula that will find interest-rate behind first pencil sheets at car dealerships. I am not a car finance expert so I need someone who is intimate with how these loans really work. The points of data I get at first pencil are: 1) Amount Financed 2) Period 3) Monthly Payment The data I need to extrapolate: 1) Rate in percentile so that I can compare to my bank's offer. I have tried this and many other stock ""find rate"" formulas with no accurate results: R=(A/P^(1/n)-1)n"
