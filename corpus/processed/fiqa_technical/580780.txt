H1B visas are a necessity if we wanna keep the US competitive. There's already a [physician shortage](https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/workforce_projections_03142017/) and if we want to keep the tech market in the States we should be encouraging workers to come here. Stopping the flow of high-skilled (desirable) workers means they'll be working somewhere else if not here meaning the next Uber, FB, or Reddit may not be in the US.
