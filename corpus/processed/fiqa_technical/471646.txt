Yep, this isn't the movies. Popular people are popular for a reason. They're likable. Outcasts are outcasts because they went against the norm, speaking from experience. That doesn't play very well in business either. I'm not talking Steve Jobs against the norm, I'm talking Dwight Schrute against the norm.
