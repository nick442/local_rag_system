Right now interest rates are pretty low and as such you won't see blockbuster interest rates in anything highly liquid. That being said you're motivation is liquidity over rate of return anyway so I don't think that is a concern. Money Market funds should give you a similar return to AMEX Personal Savings. Due to their lack of a rate guarantee I wouldn't be surprised if that is simply a branded Money Market account. Your best bet is to look at what rates you can get on any short term security and park your money in the one that best suites your needs and offers the greatest return. Money Markets are simply a great way for you to keep your cash liquid while investing you in a broad range of liquid assets (diversification is key).
