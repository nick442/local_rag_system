Care to explain why? A monopoly exists when a single firm is the sole producer of a product *for which there are no close substitutes.* While they may become one producer of *web-app enabled ride sharing from drivers in their own vehicles*, there is not one producer of on-request ground transportation. I've traveled cabs, black cars, shuttles, car share services, and used uber and lyft. If lyft dies, I still have dozens of other options. It would be like saying that if there is only one cab company that rents electric cars that they're a monopoly. Yeah, they might be the only one that rents electric cars, but they have many close substitutes (every other rental car company). So they're not the single seller. Uber would not be able to fix the price in the market because of these other options. They also do not establish a high barrier to entering the market, except for the barrier of name recognition and competition. They cannot control the quantity of the product put into the market. They meet none of the qualities of a monopoly. They *could*, however, become a part of an oligopoly, but one could argue that this already existed in ground transportation. If anything, Uber has opened up the market for competition by fighting against regulations that have restricted entry into the market for themselves, benefitting others with a similar model. No one would be crying if Uber garnered such a following that they out-performed Discount Cab, leading to its demise; Lyft is no different.
