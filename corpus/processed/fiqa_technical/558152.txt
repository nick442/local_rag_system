Agreed..all good points. Another point I usually bring up too is that auto loans are secured. You mention the liquidity aspect of the collateral involved here, which should help lower the loss given default on many of these defaulting loans. Repossessing a car and selling it likely doesn't have the same lead time and legal drama associated with it than foreclosing on and re-selling homes. I guess I should let a true ABL guy opine on this aspect of things as I am by no means an expert on ABL LGDs. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.
