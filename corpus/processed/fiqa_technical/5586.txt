the cost in general. say it's the same 4mi drive (starting and finish) Uber: $10 Lyft: $8 (before tip) When you factor in tip, lyft is probably more However, someone told me Uber just allowed tips recently so this is prob skewed now, but Uber still is a little more. However, Uber has gotten more competitive lately (i feel) b/c Lyft is growing like crazy here (Dallas).
