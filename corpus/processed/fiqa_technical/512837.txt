My point is that conflicts aren't the reason why Accenture split from AA. More money was to be had with a separate Accenture, thus the original split, thus the lawsuits, thus the IPO. This was mirrored by every other BigX except Deloitte (who almost spun off consulting in 2003 as Braxton but stopped it at the last minute due to a crappy market). Accenture has a completely different structure than the big4. Public companies don't pay as much in salary and bonus. For example, an MD at Accenture makes 250k, a Partner at Big4 makes 600k. Do the math. Also salaries are much higher at Big4 than Accenture (check out glassdoor). We do a lot of recruiting and Managers at Accenture typically come into big4 as Seniors at a higher salary. In the general category of consulting Accenture competes, but there are tranches. Accenture is definitely below big4 in bill rates, salaries and prestige (as big4 is below Bain/BCG/McKinsey).
