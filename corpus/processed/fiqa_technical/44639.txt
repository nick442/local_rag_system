">Generally-speaking, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about strictly seniority-based pay and strictly seniority-based firing; it doesn't seem to make a tremendous amount of sense. It wasn't supposed to ""make sense"" -- just as with other political things, the older, longer term members tend to participate more in union activities (having a significantly more *vested* interest); and medium term members can easily look forward to the day (not too far off) when they too will be in the position of seniority -- it is an inherently biased system. Any pressures to end the seniority-based system are coming from outside the unions and -- bar an influx of a demographic ""bulge"" of new teachers of high-merit (which is unlikely) -- the unions are likely to continue to oppose any change (as they have so desperately tried in Wisconsin)."
