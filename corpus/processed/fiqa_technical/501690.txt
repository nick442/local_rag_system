"It is a scam. Not only will it get your personal information, which could allow him to impersonate you (like, using your identity as the generous lender on a future scam), in order to fulfill the loan, a ""small payment"" for some documents will be needed. And next another for a certificate necessary for lending, and so on. Their goal is to get your money, not lending you any.

That would have been the #1 priority for someone that decided to invest using such unbelievable schema."
