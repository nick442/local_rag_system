I think we need some reform on what can be pat ended, but eliminating IP all together is a terrible idea. It would destroy any chances for a startup company to thrive. Let's say you invent a new widget (not an Android widget), but only have a small amount of capital to get started. What stops a large company like Apple, Samsung, or Sony from taking your widget and copying it exactly? They have the capital to manufacture it on a global scale while you are stuck as a startup who had their idea stolen. Without IP they could do this without any repercussions.
