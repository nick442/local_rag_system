Conservative = erring on the side of ascribing a higher EV to the business. Because if you're someone looking to acquire the business, for example, and let's say we're talking about a business that has debt which trades at a discount, it's more conservative to assume that the debt can't necessarily be restructured. To use an extreme example, as you're valuing the business, would it be conservative or aggressive to assume that the debt got magically wiped out altogether? So that's why I'm saying that it's more conservative to use the book value of the debt.
