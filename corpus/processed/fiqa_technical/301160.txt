This seems silly -- Apple will NOT buy Netflix (apple is already a content distributor. You think they think the future is in sending DVDs? No, it's buying off of iTunes!). Windows phone is DOA -- why after people are already locked into the Android/iOS ecosystem would they want to lose all of their apps and move to windows? It's not that much better to be worth it.
