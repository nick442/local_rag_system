"Its very much is a ""Amazon is taking over the world"" type article when that is far from the case. More so it claims Amazon is taking over the infrastructure but supports the claim with nothing to support that actual claim. What they try to use is nothing more than points to a company growing and expanding. A lot of the infrastructure Amazon is ""taking over"" is owned and operated by them."
