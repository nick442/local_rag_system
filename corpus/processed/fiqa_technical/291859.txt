"I used to manage a start-up fast-casual restaurant that was owned by the largest franchisers of a non-related coffee shop. None of the guys that owned the coffee shop or my restaurant had gone to school for business management. The most they'd done is advertising (and frankly they were shit at it). &nbsp; 90% of what you need to run a successful business is going to be on the front end. Knowing how to manage employees, balance your labor hours with your revenue, knowing how and when to utilize different food products, knowing trends in the area, and being able to take all of that and apply it to a crowd of people who are predominantly going to be younger employees that don't has nearly as much vested in it as you. Good management is consistency and nit-picking. You have to drill the same thing, over and over, until it becomes muscle memory. &nbsp; Have you tried talking to the owners about franchising? I'm assuming this isn't a franchise and is just a private shop. Being able to franchise this caf√© will not only give you the support you need from experienced professionals to run the same business but will also allow you to build on the customer base they've grown. You can come to the table with, ""I'll put XX in, pay you XX in royalties, and I want to have a say in the business operation as a primary franchisor."""
