I still remember a little boy who decided to deliver mail on his bicycle for a fee who got slapped with thousands of dollars and possible jail time for his parents by the government. It's time for the Post Office to let go of its stranglehold on mail delivery especially now that the dependence on it has decreased with the maturity of email and online billing and payment.
