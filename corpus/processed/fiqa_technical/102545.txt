"You are correct; Nissan's troubles are because they cheaped out and went with an air cooled pack, whereas Chevy and Tesla liquid cool theirs. Chevy uses about only 60% of the Volt's available battery range (10kWh out of 16). Torture tests simulating well over 100k worth of charges showed better than 70% range remaining, hardly ""oh you'd better drop a few thou on a replacement pack"" territory."
