Game of Thrones is a good example. But it's no where near the level of Star Wars, Pixar, and Marvel. DC has potential, but they fucked that up for themselves. 007 is much closer than fast and furious, but game of thrones, 007, and fast and furious can't be marketed to children AND their parents Also there's no visual imagery that indicates the character is 007 or Dom from FF. If you saw Zelda almost everyone would know who that is. Same with Mario or Pikachu I stand by my statement of Harry Potter and Nintendo Universes as being the only worldwide recognized multi character and multiplatform franchises
