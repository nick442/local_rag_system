Haha, I bet. I think sometimes people in upper echelons of their fields assume they can understand others just as well while forgetting that the whole base layer of fundamentals that took to get there. Definitely a human problem, as we all tend to fall into that trap on occasion. I'm a CPA so I have no intention doing the CFA, which came with its own set of misery. I just follow finance as a side interest. I definitely fall on the side of conservative when it comes to investing. When I see Tesla, red flags go up. It might pay off later, but it's not for me. I actually just switched industries myself, went from a manufacturing environment to a client based one focused on start ups. In another year or so I'll move on to another industry to plug in more gaps in my knowledge base. Depends on where the economy is at that point.
