Oh, so the government requests it, incurring a debt, and our taxes go towards paying off that debt? So our taxes are paying for the work that gets done? Just like I said? Who knew! You worked really hard to try to obfuscate that! Big business is totally doing the work out of the kindness of their heart, and not for the money the government is paying them. They are so altruistic and amazing! /s
