If you look at the shit people are saying now with what they were saying Tsarist Russia in 1917, the similarities are striking. Evil Banker Conspiracist Jews, secret societies, etc. We all know how those energies got channelled, yes? Rich people might not wear monocles at secret parties but that matters very little to the angry mob that is increasingly screaming for their blood. Unless the economy starts finally improving, I'd be a little worried about my safety if I were making $800k a year, just sayin'..
