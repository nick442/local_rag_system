Pretty obvious how you could draw the conclusions you've drawn given the source. The problem is that source is in no way based in reality. Man made climate change is absolutely real, that's not even debatable anymore. The degree to which we are changing the climate and what we're going to do about it are the topic at hand but your sources are bunk which is why your opinions on the matter are bunk too. Not going to downvote because while you didn't actually add anything of substance to the conversation, you cited your source as requested. You need to broaden your horizons.
