I just returned from overseas and for the most part it isn't TSA thats the worst part its the other parts that get added on. In comparison if I fly through to another country in Europe my items are checked through, I'll wait 15 minutes to get my passport stamped and stand in line for my plane. If you land in America from international you have to wait through customs (I just waited 1.5 hours but I know thats not standard) then I had to get my bags and recheck them through the airline, and finally I had to go through security yet again except this time instead of having to take things out of my pockets I had to remove my shoes, take everything out of my pockets and then get a complete body scan (not sure how I feel about those yet though I know many on here hate them) It really is just more inconvenient and seemingly unnecessary
