I don't know about frowned upon. But consider that a big part of your internship is auditioning for a job after you graduate. Integrating to the team and adopting their norms, to the extent that you don't look like a try-hard, increases your chances of being accepted into the group. I would recommend you aim to dress just a little better than the norm. If your team wears kakis and button down, wear a blazer. If they wear blazers, wear a business suit. Does that make sense?
