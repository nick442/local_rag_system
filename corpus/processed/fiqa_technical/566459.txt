"Your co-workers all had kids when they where 16-19? What sort of place are you working?!? In my career, people under 30 with kids were very much the minority. I've mostly worked in fortune 500 companies and your description sounds really foreign to me. Most of my coworkers started having kids in their early to mid 30s. I'm 35 and childless and not singled out by that at all. I don't see why being ""gym fit"" or having a college degree should entitle you special treatment. In my experience, neither are good indicators of a person's ability to perform. What it all comes down to is fit; ""job fit"" that is. Why are you still there? Are you trying to leave? Which part of the world are you in? In the end companies are about teams, merit is defined by who can do something the best while fitting into the company's culture and team. Just because you're the more technically savvy, doesn't mean you the best person for the job. When you're running a business there is a lot that must get considered before promoting someone. Remember, in companies, promotions are usually seized and rarely given. I mean, if you're not able to seize the promotion, why would be considered worthy of it?"
