Oh fucking face palm on my part. I meant to say, it ended 1:07 in to the round, but it was actually a 1:05 in to the round. Nevertheless, the points still valid, Floyd would of won his bet. Edit: I'm ashamed I let this bot get me twice. Gonna leave the error here so the whole world will remember my grammatical errors.
