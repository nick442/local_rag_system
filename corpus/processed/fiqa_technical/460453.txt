Listen, I didn't say I had black friends, said I had off-color friends. But, I do have a couple black friends although not as many as brown and yellow ones. I really don't make note of the fucking colors though, I could care less. It matters who they are, not their color. Why are you so racist? Look past the colors. Look past CNN Fake News. Look past the hate. Don't be a hater! The big question here is, why do you have so much hate in you? Let's talk about that. Maybe you can be more forthcoming about that.
