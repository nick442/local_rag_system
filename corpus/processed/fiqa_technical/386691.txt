>I cant think of any reason for minimum wage paying jobs to have a union. If you think the wages are too low for cost of living then the minimum wage should be raised. I like how you say something in one sentence and then answer yourself in the next sentence. What the hell do you think unions are for? They're for bettering working conditions. Where do you think any sort of worker protection laws came from in the first place?
