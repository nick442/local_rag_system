Assuming we follow the tax plan laid out by the Trump Administration, I can see, as the consequence of this tax-plan, three options. 1. Revitalize US economy. 2. Status Quo. It'll eventually just even out and go back to the way it was. 3. US declares bankruptcy. Is this what most educated people see?
