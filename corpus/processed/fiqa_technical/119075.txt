"I took the quiz that you linked too and answered with what I considered ""ideal"" answers with the exception of checking C for that particular question.. The first thing I saw was I needn't have bothered with giving the ideal answer as the result is self graded (paraphrased) as..all ""A"" great, mostly ""A"" good, mostly ""B"" you can do better, any ""C"" you probably have problems..regardless of your actual answers. Secondly my ideal answers didn't agree with theirs. Finally, neither my ideal nor theirs takes actual circumstances into account. For instance paying off your debt each month: there are quite a few cards that offer zero percent financing for extended periods of time, for those cards the ideal would be for the debt to be paid off before the terms change. Whether that should be steady progression towards zero or a ballon payment at the end, would depend upon your circumstances. In short, look at this quiz as a rough guideline, not a nuanced evaluation of your credit handling capabilities."
