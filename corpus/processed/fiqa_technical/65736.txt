"What types of delivery options are these? I worked in logistics for a brief period (like 2 years, not much) and have never heard of such a thing. I think what the person above you mentioned is that UPS and FedEx both lean heavily on USPS for shipments to rural areas that it simply doesn't make sense for the private companies to build a network to distribute to. Instead they dump your UPS/FedEx onto USPS for the last leg or two of distribution, depending on how rural the area is. Most addresses listed as ""beyond points"" in already rural areas are almost all delivered by USPS and not UPS/FedEx"
