A wal-mart successfully unionized in Quebec years ago, shortly after, wal-mart shut the store down. They're so anti-union, they'll cut off the entire revenue source instead of make slightly less money due to slightly better salaries being paid. There's a reason I never shop at wal-mart, it's a despicable company. http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2005/02/09/walmart-050209.html
