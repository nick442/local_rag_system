If you have flow through income then you arent being taxed at the corporate rate you are being taxed at your personal income tax rate which wont change so raising or lowering the corporate tax rate wont change that at all. Like he said tax rich people not corporations. If people just had a better understanding there wouldn't be really anybody opposed to it.
