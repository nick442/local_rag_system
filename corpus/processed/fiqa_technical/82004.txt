"That is the best part. Everyone is "" brick and mortar stores are dead"" bandwagon reminds of the .com bubble. The customer base that Walmart is and will continue to be is the vast majority of not only the US but the world. The thing is these people like going to the store and browsing around and entertaining the physical aspect of buying shit rather than just point and clicking. The thing Walmart is doing is playing on what Amerians think makes America.. they have heavy plans on American manufacturing and production which will be sold in their own stores which they will charge a slightly lower price for and make a stupid amount of money while at the same time buying up Advanced Auto Parts and taking over their 5000 plus stores and capabilities and then diving in ( which is a prediction) buying Blue Apron type operation and then simply taking over. Walmart does not need to get into the area of Netflix or any of the like because they can simply buy out down the road a company they can make compete in that field to hold onto the market share. Amazon is the single most inflated outrageously high stock that has ever existed because of peoples ignorance of what the internet brings. They are rightfully and smartly playing on that but it won't pan out. Walmart is smart by pushing partnerships with Fed Ex and UPS which are 2 of the largest carries in the world and employee well payed "" middle class"" people that look for dedication and respect no matter what generation you belong to. Not to mention they contract out with multiple trucking companies."
