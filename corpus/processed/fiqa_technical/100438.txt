Seems like a stupid move to me. I assume people who don't want to buy a swatch owned brand now won't do so simply because competition is culled. Movement watches simply aren't necessities but a fashion item much of the time. It's like a prominent dress manufacturer called, say, Moochi, that owns the supply of thread announcing they will no longer make it available to their competition who then go out of business. Doesn't mean women will buy more Moochi dresses - some will decide buy just what they need since they Moochi dresses are too plain, and spend more on accessories to stand out. Worse, they may be leaving open a lucrative parts market where they were still making a little bit on each watch sale. Perhaps letting a new Chinese start up come in that simply starts supplying and before they know it, start making watches that compete with them. I think the Japanese steel industry built themselves up this way, after the US steel makers gladly ceded the rebar business to them in pursuit of higher margin business. Well, the Japanese built on that and started competing on the higher end markets too.
