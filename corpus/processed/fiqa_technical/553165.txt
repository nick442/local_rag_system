It's true not everyone loves every style. COuld have said that for any style lol. Yes, I love authentic Neopolitan pizza as well, but it has a few drawbacks. 1) Not good for deliver, must be eaten instantly. 2) many not familiar with it. 3) new chains are trying to replicate it (pieology) and do it horribly, thus watering it down.
