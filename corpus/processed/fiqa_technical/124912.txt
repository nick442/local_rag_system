Essentially, yes. The parent company aggregates the business of all its subsidiaries; so there's ArcelorMittal Brazil, ArcelorMittal USA, ArcelorMittal Spain, etc. So all of their companies put together turned a profit, but the one you work for in particular (ArcelorMittal USA) wasn't profitable this quarter.
