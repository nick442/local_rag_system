"I'll take a stab at it. If you're not passionate about big ideas, about markets and companies and economies, if you can't read up on finance, companies, economies and markets for hours a day, for most of your free time for the next few years, if you're really just attracted by the ""money"" and notoriety, you should stick to engineering. There's space for non-financial majors in finance anyway.. Focus elsewhere for a while, and if finance still appeals to you in five years, consider it then. (I have a non-financial background. I realized I liked it when I realized every time I had one question answered, five more came up, and this happened over and over.. And still does, after four years. I could still leave finance, however.. You never know where your path will take you.)"
