I'm looking at this because I'm just wondering what they base their criteria on. How are they splitting their operations to have multiple headquarters especially when both are in the same country (it would make more sense if it was in another country although i'm not sure how they manage their operations. maybe they need a move like this etc)? Is one more focused on global operations while the other is on local? Their HQ is on the west coast so would they build a second HQ that's that close to their main base or move it to the east coast to spread it out? I'm just wondering why and what the reasoning is behind a move like this. The impact a move like this makes on the surrounding area is large considering the local economics and jobs etc which was outlined in the post. How will it effect traffic flows (including if freight is involved now), population concentration, commutes, etc. There's a lot of stuff to consider. Talent pools, development of the area. I'm not saying it should or shouldn't be but just because I have an idea of the surroundings my guess matching their criteria would be Reston, VA. Its on the edge of the metro system connected to the major metropolis, concentrated near engineering and computer science jobs etc, off ways to the side to allow easier commutes instead of directly confronting traffic into a city like dc, and also near the airport. There are probably similar places all around if you look for it.
