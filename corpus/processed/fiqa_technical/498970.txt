"No need, just look at the father of modern pharmacology: Louis Pasteur, the french scientist. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur#Career What a surprise: publicly funded research in French universities.. You know, the big problem, is that we don't have a dozen parallel universes where we can test various systems to see which one is best in terms of health outcomes. But even the data that you want to go and fetch for me is kind of absurd: the number of new drug discoveries? Who cares? It's not the number that counts, its the end results on public health, longevity.. etc! For instance, you can have 10 ""new"" opioid drugs, not sure that proves anything.. Capitalism is known for inventing stuff people don't really need, convincing them through mass marketing that they actually DO need it. You could achieve for instance, the same health outcomes with simple, basic prevention policies, healthy eating, less pollution.. than pump complex drugs into people's bodies to compensate for other toxic stuff they inhale or eat. Anyways, I think that quite simply, we should let capitalist firms do what they are best at: mass production via economies of scale, and let universities that are not only seeking profit do the actual research. Also, public research CAN cope with tons of ""wasteful"" research. It happens all the time that researchers test correlations that turn out to be negative. No one throws a fuss about it! That's the way research is meant to advance."
