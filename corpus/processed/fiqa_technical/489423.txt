Fast Food/ 1-hour photo mentality. Everyone needs to be pre-made and ready to go or they aren't hireable. Hence why these employers can't find talent, nobody comes to a new job with 5-10 years of highly specific experience working in the same position they applied for, at the specific company they were just hired at. Everyone has a ramping up period to one degree or another.
