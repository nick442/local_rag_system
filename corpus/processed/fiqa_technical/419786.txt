You know, I have egg on my face. I'd seen all of these reviews, and I am instinctively suspicious of a reviewer with no friends or a person with 4 friends and one review, so I discounted them. I looked at Monica's review and saw the number of reviews and friends and shrugged. Then I read all of the reviews, and you are 100% spot-on. She's hired a ghostwriter. Monica's review is her only lengthy review - the others are fairly terse, though human - and is written in exactly the same style. I'm flabbergasted, because the wordiness should have been a dead giveaway. There are a handful of reviews, however, which were clearly written by someone (you can spot dumb), but those reviewers all share the traits of robot accounts. I would really love to write a review for this place and see whether or not it gets filtered. That having been said, you might have explained away the Monica point, and I'm impressed. Thanks for pointing it out!
