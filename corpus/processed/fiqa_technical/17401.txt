Consider this, when we talk stimulus we usually talk in trillions. Two trillion in the US could be used to create a guaranteed income for all citizens at around US$8000 per year. There would be zero overhead because there would be zero needs testing. Everyone with a social security number would get a plastic card with the money on it. The large majority of that money could then be recovered by reducing the difference from Social Security payments, welfare payments, tax returns and other means tested forms of government payments. The remaining monies would largely be spent, thus stimulating the economy immediately and benefiting those at the top most of all. Win-win. Compare that to QE1 and QE2.
