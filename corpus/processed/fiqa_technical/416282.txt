Yeah, I'm aware. I'm not sure why you're fighting me on this. I was defending people organizing and protesting healthcare on internet freedom day. I'm not saying the internet isn't important but to most Americans I'm guessing healthcare would be more so. Which bears out in how the two subjects are dealt with. I doubt the democrats could create a tea party over NN the same way the republicans did over healthcare.
