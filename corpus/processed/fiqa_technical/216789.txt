"The standard is actually 30 hours a week over a given period of time (3-12 months of the previous taxable year). The interesting problem for the prototypical employer who wants to offer benefits to as few employees as possible is ERISA Sec. 510. According to the above poster, companies want to avoid hiring full time positions. However, based on employer needs, only hiring part time workers will not be feasible for many businesses. Furthermore, if employers restrict hours for the purpose of denying access to benefits, they may be violating ERISA Sec. 510, which would lead to a major lawsuit for that business. As ERISA is an opt-in class action statute, as well as a generous attorney fee statute (it's easier for plaintiff's lawyers to make the defense pay their legal fees, see ERISA 502(g), CIGNA v. Amara), it would be unwise for employers to simply refuse to hire any more full time employees. Of course, companies will be looking to avoid ""overpaying"" for benefits in any way they can. But simplistic conclusions, such as vexu gave, that they will not hire full time workers fails to grasp both the complexity of PPACA and the consequences of a given employer's actions."
