"Can an employer force a person to take a stock? From what I understand an employer can only offer stock options, doesn't that mean that the employee has to exercise that option in order for the stock to be valid? Would it be legal to fire me for refusing a bonus? Furthermore would owning stock necessarily make you an ""owner"" for the purposes of said law?"
