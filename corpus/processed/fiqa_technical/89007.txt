Im pretty sure its a moral application of the forceful basis of taxation. And most people get rich by providing goods and services, or via investing in goods in services. The rest, the hyperwealthy banksters, international weapons/ death merchants, wall street, fraudsters, the-good-ole-boys-network, etc.. that was via government, and its probably not a good idea to give them more. Pay your taxes, please. I dont want them to ruin your life.
