But how long to hold is the question..how long did this assumed manipulation go on for last time? Edit: a quick half assed check on investopedia showed that it went up for around a month from its lowest point and it's high hit on feburary 6-8th 2017. So will it stay at this point again and gradually repeat February's numbers..or sell and walk away with what it netted me.
