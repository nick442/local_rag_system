"> When did we switch the word ""image"" with ""optics""? Back in 2010, the NYT wrote that ""[although the metaphorical expansion of 'optics' into the political arena feels novel, it has actually been brewing for a few decades.](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/magazine/07FOB-onlanguage-t.html)"" They identify usages going back to 1978 at least. It's not a direct synonym for ""image"", because it's often used to refer to a specific incident or transaction, where ""image"" wouldn't fit as well."
