unless you had a distribution network and the customers to use it, IE: brick and motor stores in every city that can field orders and the volume to justify truck routes. Here in Canada there is grocery deliveries via grocery gateway (filled by longo's, a grocery chain in the GTHA) and even Walmart is getting in on it. Granted it is only in the GTHA right now, but the model could work in towns that aren't tooooo sparse.
