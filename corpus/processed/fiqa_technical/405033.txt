Unions are a joke. They were created originally with good intentions, to protect workers interests. Now, it's all corruption and overpaid high school dropouts making $40/hour for holding a stop sign. You barely graduated high school. In no situation is your hourly rate worth $150 to me. Unions need to be put in their place.
