"There is a distinction between putting a lot of hours into building a semi autonomous business and having your Accountant and Tax Lawyer find legal loopholes so you can avoid millions of dollars of debt again and again.

""What would become of an economy if 50% of a population decided they didn't like working and so took up speculating stock prices full time?"" 50%+ of the population isn't intelligent enough to even do this.
