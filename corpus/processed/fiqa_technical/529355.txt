I started an Apparel company. They started out small in their garage. They moved to my converted garage and when I got pregnant I decided to just take the leap at 5 months pregnant. Quit my zoo keeping job making very good money to making practically nothing and started a company from scratch. I had no name or really idea. But as the weeks passed I figured it out. Last year the company made 100k now that's not profit but I'm proud of it. Since I quit my job in July 2015. If you love it make it more than just a hobby. You'll thank yourself later. Good luck
