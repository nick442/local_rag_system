Seems this would help prevent the Martin Shkreliâ€™s of this world from gouging Americans. No company had bothered to produce a generic. Martin bought out a drug with a private brand name on it and increased the price from $13.5 to $750 per pill. If a reliable crowd was producing a generic, people would have bought that instead.
