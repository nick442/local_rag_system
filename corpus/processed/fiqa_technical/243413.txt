Hey, I'm majoring in a worthless field and do not expect to make much money. I've learned to find solace in the simple luxuries such as, heating,car ownership, food, warm food, meat,being able to exercise, have freedom,etc.. I'm trying to figure out what the minimum annual salary I can live on is. For example right now I'm in college and it costs $30,000 a year but I'm living *very* comfortably. Why and how will this change in the future? Renting an apartment and supporting only myself, why can't I live comfortably on $30,000 in the future?
