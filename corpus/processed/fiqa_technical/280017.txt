">""This process is terrible, I hate it, it has a damaging effect on the market, and we could easily prevent it from happening. But I choose to keep it because of a hardline adherence to ideology."" Not exactly and nothing of the sort. I think it unfair because it gives a leg up to those with access but then, such is life. I also think it unfair that kids in the middle class have access to tutors, kids of the rich have access to elite private schools, those with money have access to better medical care and so on. However, as someone may well ask and do so rightfully - ""So what?"" To use cycling as an example - Use of HFT is the equivalent of having access to better training, better gear and better opportunities. You don't ban those just because the poorer countries can't have access to those. The practice of placing orders and immediately canceling them is the equivalent of pulling a Lance Armstrong, better handled by the association than by the government using taxpayer money."
