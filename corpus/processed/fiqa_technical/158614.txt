"Theres some major logic missing from this report, it didnt mention how technology is disrupting how everything is being distributed. As businesses become more efficient with technological advances and less dependent on human capital, then so must humans become more efficient and less dependent upon an expected level of income. Whats the demand to keep a human alive and well versus the demand for needing a well paid human laborer? If you are easily replacable, then your value to the company is simply cheap labor. Best example is Walmart, the wealthiest family, the largest employer whose many employees require gov assistance to live due to low wages. The only way this business could even exist is with assitance from the goverment to support its workers. So where do these tax subsidies come from? The article responded with a great point ""There will never be “piles and piles of valuable goods” laying around with no one to enjoy them."" Whoever said that has never been to Walmart with no money. I suppose there will always be ""someone around to enjoy them"" but will there also be less and less people who can afford to enjoy such things? Walmart has already shown what happens. This article points out the old ways of doing things economically but ignores the fact technology creates abundance, not scarcity. Were not currently using that abundance to directly improve humanity on a large scale level but rather the opposite to control supply or scarcity aka profits. When the demand to maintain & control financial power overpowers the desire to care & provide for your neighbor, then the rise of inequality and narcissistic options appear. This buying power is the component of influence to being able to survive very well or simply even remain alive. If my daily wage doesnt provide for my daily needs, then how can I use technology to stay alive? How efficient can we all become before we start to share in the abundance of life together?"
