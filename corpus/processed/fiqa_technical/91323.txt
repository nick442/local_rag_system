You don't always have a choice. If you RTA, this is about loans that BoA bought from other lenders, or banks they acquired. If there is such a thing as a conventional mortgage contract that cannot be sold to another bank, I have never heard of it. Any bank you borrow from is generally free to re-sell the loan to any other bank. You agree to the contract, not the name on the letterhead.
