I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing. I'm talking about making money off loans which weren't defaulted but on but were paid back with interest. Anyway, in abstract preventing something bad absolutely counts as doing something good. The crisis could have been worse, and caused much more pain, hardship, and lost wealth. It was bad enough as it was, I'm personally glad it wasn't worse.
