I am with Joe. Just doing some rough budgeting you should be able to swing 2-2.5K per month. Here is how I got that: You gross 60K, 5k per month. 75% of rent ~1000, 75% of 600 for groceries 450, 75% of 400 for utilities 300, 500 student loan. 5000-1000-450-300-500=2750. Deduct another 250 for gas, car repairs, clothes, hair cuts and you have 2500. What else are you doing with your money? This is with no help from your partner. I'd ask the same of him, what is he doing with all of his money? He makes 66% of what you do, but is only responsible for 25% of the bills. Combined you could be rocking this at like 5K per month. This is with not working an extra job. Being a victim is a choice, you can win with money.
