"Jesus christ. ""We need to consume more or the GROWTH will come to a dramatic halt."" What about fine? What about things being big enough? What about focusing on something other then unhinged growth? Economists may often be better then most people at understanding the big picture, but man sometimes just staring at the numbers makes you so blind."
