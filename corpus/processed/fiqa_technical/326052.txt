If you want to decrease economic inequality: 1. Decrease and eventually eliminate funding the government with debt. This borrowing is pushing exaggerated growth beyond what is sustainable causing money to be put into the economy that doesn't have enough places to go except trickle up to the top without the repercussion of increased inflation. 2. Eliminate software patents, and decrease the ability of patents, copyrights and trademarks from creating artificial government enforced monopolies. This will let the regular person compete with big money.
