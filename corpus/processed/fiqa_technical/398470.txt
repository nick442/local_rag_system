Thank you for the informed post. CAT was planning on opening a new plant before the earthquake. They needed more capacity, and were formerly exporting some excavators from Japan to the North American market. They were considering expanding that plant, and they also looked at sites in Canada, the US, and Mexico. I guess they decided to keep that plant open, but just focus it on other markets. [Here](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204880404577229252169260694.html) is an article, but it is short on details. [Here](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203889904577200953014575964.html) is an example of CAT closing a plant in Canada after the labor union locked themselves out. They are moving jobs to the US for roughly half price. In this case the plant in Canada was paying an average wage of $35 ($73,000 annually without overtime) and they locked themselves out requesting more. Corporations try to maximize profit, so by definition they are greedy, but this is a perfect example of unions being overly greedy as well. That is well over a good middle class wage (assuming they are in a somewhat rural or sparse suburban area, where most manufacturing is located). They had capacity elsewhere, so they moved. Ignoring the greed of the unions wont make things better for workers, it will only end in more situations like the one in Canada.
