Hey thanks for all of this info! I've been here with the owners since they've opened and I'm slowly rising to the top, I think they'll offer me management soon because they need someone but I'm really in no rush to offer any personal business ideas to them. I'd like to learn all I need before I even consider it. As I said elsewhere I'm only 20 so this is still early days I would just like a good grasp of what to expect and you've certainly delivered that. I'll definitely check that movie out
