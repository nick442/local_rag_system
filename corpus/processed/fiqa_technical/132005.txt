In my mind these are quite different, though maybe there is some vague analogy in meta-space that is escaping me. This isn't about manipulating scarcity or demand, it's about manipulating pricing. I guess the common thread is that it's about manipulating. :) The motivation is to skirt the commercial code requirement that you can't charge people differentially by ability-to-pay by dividing the market into a high end and a low end, and giving the people who can't pay as much a less desirable product. In this case, producing the high end product is easily possible to do for everyone, but if you put it at the high price, you'd get too few buyers and if you put it at the low price, you'd leave money on the table. Similar schemes have been used in airlines to charge businesses more by assuming they have to plan things last-minute and making the high price be around changeability of tickets, and assuming vacations are planned longer out and are really being sold to a market of people with less money to spend. By controlling the character of the sale in a situation where delivery of the product costs about the same, you maximize the revenue. It used to be, though no longer is, that phone calls were done this way, too. You got better pricing off-hours even though the phone lines were there 24/7 because it was assumed that the only people who must have phone calls, especially long distance, were businesses who could afford steeper prices. By calling off-hours calling a different product, you could charge less for it and thus do the only thing you really wanted, which is to get maximal amounts of money out of business and non-business people based on their ability to pay, but by a dodge that caused the products to be differentiated, so that it couldn't be said you were charging based on ability to pay.
