Because they will make money? Trump is still rich as fuck, despite all this. He knows how to play the game, and he plays it very well. If I told you that I could go in with you on a company, and the company would fail and royally fuck anyone who loaned it money, but you would walk away with a cool million, would you do it? The only groups that should be weary of him are creditors, as they're the ones who end up with no chair when the music stops.
