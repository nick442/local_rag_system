"The Business Continuity Management standard BS 25999 is going to be replaced by the newly published ISO standard ISO 22301. ISO 22301’s full title is: ‘Societal security - Business continuity management systems – Requirements’ and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines the standard as: ""..standardization in the area of societal security, aimed at increasing crisis management and business continuity capabilities, i.e. through improved technical, human, organizational, and functional interoperability as well as shared situational awareness, amongst all interested parties.""

The following briefly describes the similarities and differences between both standards"
