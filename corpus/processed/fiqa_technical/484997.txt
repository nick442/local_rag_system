To add on to Sharkbat, it's pretty much FX-forward arb free. Three choices: 1. Invest at US LIBOR 2. Convert to XYZ at spot, invest at XYZ LIBOR, convert back to USD from XYZ 1 year later. 3. Same as #2 but you had an 1 year FX forward (XYZ to USD) #1 and #3 should have the same effect otherwise there'd be arbitrage. FX rates/forwards are off LIBOR (typically). #2 is not risk-free as Sharkbat says - there's FX risk in the final XYZ->USD transaction.
