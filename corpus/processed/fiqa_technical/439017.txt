It's also an incorrect assumption. I assume that we're looking at the S&L scandal as one of the three, and it wasn't very connected to Ivy leaguers. Only one of the Keating 5 went to an Ivy, and S&L's generally weren't run by Ivy grads. Investment banks are, especially these days, but that doesn't show a disproportionate likelihood of immorality among Ivies when compared to any other subset of the population.
