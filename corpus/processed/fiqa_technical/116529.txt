No no, not at all. I'm saying that Bezos, as head of Amazon, should work to improve workers conditions using his influence as founder / chairman / CEO of Amazon. Which is a longer winded way of saying *Amazon* should improve workers conditions. I think it's great that he's looking to give some of his money away to charity. I think it's rather hypocritical to do that whilst being accused of low employee welfare conditions mind you, but it's certainly better than nothing! If I'm still not coming across correctly, let me slip into hyperbole and extremes. Let's say a Victorian factory owner employs children in dangerous and gruelling work, 14 hours a day and they get fired if they are ill. But with the money he makes from the factory, he gives some of it to a children's hospital! I mean, that's great, but hey, what about instituting change at the factory too, if you really care about society? I think that last paragraph detracts from my point actually but I've written it out so I'll leave it there.
