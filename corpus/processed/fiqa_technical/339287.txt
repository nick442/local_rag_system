It's interesting how the sentiment of a thread or phrasing of content affects voting. I basically said: > If a company wants to take advantage of the infrastructure (e.g. police, fire department, legal system, roads, street cleaning, clean water, etc.) then they should pay their fair share. What's so hard to understand about that? Yet that gets way up and mine goes way down. Just interesting.
