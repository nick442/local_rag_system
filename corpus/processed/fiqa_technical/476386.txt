"Dov Chaney learned everything from Harvey. It is no secret that both Weinsteins favor the actresses who submit and punish the actors who call them out. But.. Harvey is not a bad guy, he actually has a big heart he just got corrupted and became a victim to his own appetites and endless access to fame seeking flesh. When I say ""not a bad guy"" I mean in high contrast to our president. It is very likely HW will be doing some soul searching.. I left the biz in a bit of a scandal myself and there are days I miss it and then I read these headlines and thank god I am out."
