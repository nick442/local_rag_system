The conclusions of this report seem to conflict with some of the long-term trends in asset management. The gradual decline of defined-benefit plans (e.g. pensions) and the growth of defined-contribution (401k) have altered the asset mix. The biggest investors in hedge funds have traditionally been pension management funds; given the long-standing decline in private sector pensions and the (seemingly) near-future decline in public-employee pensions, the funds that can only be accessed by institutional investors or accredited investors (eg all hedge funds) stand to lose. Explained another way: right now, only rich people and institutional investors get access to hedge funds. Your 401K money can't go into them, and neither can your IRA. If you're not an accredited investor (income of >$250K, net worth of $1MM+ excl. primary residence) you can't subscribe. You can only get into hedge funds through buying into a 'fund of funds' type of investment, where you buy a fund (and pay that fund) so that they can pay a hedge manager to manage the money. Think of a pass-through entity that skims some off the top and manages portfolio risk. So, as fewer people get pensions (and the pensions that they do get are smaller), these pension funds have fewer assets left to invest in hedge funds. Most hedge funds return zero alpha after fees and arguably have lower risk-adjusted returns than simpler investments. But 15-20% of all hedge funds do pretty well. Picking which 15-20%..that's difficult. Bottom line: what is Citi pushing with this report?
