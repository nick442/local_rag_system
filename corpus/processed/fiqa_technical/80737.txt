"I like this idea. Maybe we could even get dedicated lanes for this on highways. Or they could even have their own roads! Then they could pull more trailers. And to increase efficiency, we could replace the road surface and wheels with something with less drag..like maybe steel on steel? Heck, we could even have just a couple of power units for hundreds of tons of cargo. I got it, we can call them ""trains""."
