I'm always pretty surprised at how different US is from Canada with this. I think here (I'm not actually looking this up) that McDonald's is first, followed by A&W and then Wendy's. This is in our modest city (approx 100,000) we have 5 McDonalds, 4 A&W's, 3 Wendy's and until recently 0 Burger Kings.
