"P/E ratios for the whole market are rising to levels generally only seen after crashes in the market when low earnings push up the ratio. A lot of people in the market recognize the artificial effect of government easing and low interest rates have had on prices. Basically, there's more money sloshing around and there's nowhere else for it to go that earns a good return. I agree that outside of tech the rest of the economy is doing fairly well and will probably be resilient against any shock. But tech is a bigger part of the market than ever, and we could still see a big market correction and a small real world downturn on the back of it. >There were people prior to 2008 sounding alarm bells about the real estate market. I haven't seen the equivalent today. You said it yourself: overvalued tech stocks that nobody can justify the high prices for. We have big IPOs on companies that don't actually make money. Huge market caps on ""disruptors"" that are only very niche parts of their industries (e.g. Tesla). Companies like Uber that still lose money but command huge valuations. Is that enough for a crash? Hell yes - that was what caused the 2001 dotcom crash and recession."
