I can't believe they will tax robots, in Korea, or anywhere else. Yeh, sure, business will agree to that and it surely will help business. A robot tax is a tax on net income of a business. If they were serious about Robot tax, then they should have taxed machines first and long time ago. As you know, machines replace more humans than robots do, and machines have much higher productivity than robots. What's next? Tax computer programs because they automate and replace the work done by humans? Tax AI because it replaces humans who currently do this analytic work? Look, it would be silly to tax a machine or robot that does work that no human wants to do or can do. If the intentions is because Korea wants/need more money from taxes, then tax outsourced work, done by other humans, in countries where labor is cheaper. Or, simply tax the business profits because robots increase their profits. If the intentions is save jobs done by humans, then regulate robots and, for example, make it a rule that every group of robots must be supervised by humans, or customer service must be done by a human and not a robot/AI.
