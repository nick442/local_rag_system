The real idea is to get inflation even higher than it currently is to try and get more bullets in the future for the next recession. We'd like nominal rates to be much higher than before so that we can have even larger real negative rates when needed. This takes time and finesse and I'd say Yellen is doing a fine job. Every mark she is reaching for in the dual mandate is exactly where it needs to be for a perfect storm. Almost all people borrow money to get houses. That doesn't make them likely to default. What made defaults skyrocket in '08 was predatory lending and NINJA loans, as well as a group of men who actively did everything they could to make the system fail because of credit default swaps whose payout was significantly higher than the loss.
