Based on your situation, I'm not sure it should be an either/or sort of choice. The less debt you have the better, but because the HELOC is secured debt, the interest rate should be rather low. If you're trying to build a cash cushion for emergencies, it may help to figure out a few things first: Once you know how much you want to save and how long it will take, you can figure out how much longer it would take of some of the savings were diverted to debt reduction. If your credit is good enough to get a HELOC in the first place, putting some of your cash-flow toward both goals is an option worth considering.
