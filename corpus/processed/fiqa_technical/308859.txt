"Could have done a [put option](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option) if you wanted to bet against it in another way. It's not technically ""shorting"", but in a layman-shorthand it's the same thing - making money gambling on the ""pessimistic side"" of possibility. You don't actually need to borrow any shares to do that, just find someone who thinks the price at some later date will be higher than you think it will be."
