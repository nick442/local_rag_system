Watch this super late post to a 2009 thread. Thread Necromancy in action! Yes, it's absolutely worth it to get an extended warranty because electronics just don't last as long as they used to. This is ever more prevalent in the year 2013. Is it a ripoff? Future Shop (in Canada) and Best Buy (U.S. & Canada) offer warranties that are typically 25% of the cost of the product. That's a huge mark-up, massive! Yet, to my knowledge they are one of the only retailers that you can walk into the store and just drop it off for exchange. As opposed to, buying a 3rd party extended warranty that is considerably less expensive, yet it puts the burden on you to mail the product in, wait for god knows how long to receive a refurbished, repaired, or new (their choice) product. It's a gamble, an expensive one. Yet, if you're spending top dollar on a product, wouldn't you like to have some peace of mind that it will last you at least 2-3 years. Unfortunately as I mentioned earlier, electronics (or anything for that matter) just aren't as reliable as you'd hope. The Xbox 360 gaming console was notorious for being poorly made. In fact, many people not only had to take advantage of the extended warranty, but had to do so, more than 2-3 times. So make sure you do your homework on a product, before you even think about buying it. What do I do? I buy at Future Shop, Best Buy or Staples for the convenience of dropping off the product in the event of an issue. I really don't want to bother with the hassle of applying for warranty service and long mail-in / return wait period. If the product is $100 or so, forget it.and just buy it whoever has it cheapest and cross your fingers.
