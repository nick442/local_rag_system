"You probably know that the answer is, ""it depends"". If this is truly a pin money type of operation, then perhaps sole trader is for you. I incline to using a limited company for two reasons, one optimistic and one pessimistic. You are looking at a business to make some money with your talents. If your business takes off, it's much easier to expand a LTD than a sole trader. Getting credit, dealing with suppliers, hiring people, all much easier. And if things go well, you will be expanding. The negative reason is that as a sole trader (you) have unlimited liability for the debts of your enterprise. If you get sued, say your skincare line makes someone's face into a rash, you are on the hook for the whole amount. You don't want to torpedo your family if it goes bad. Being a limited company protects you from that. I can tell you that the overhead of running a small LTD is pretty light so long as you are meticulous about your record keeping. I had an LTD with two toddlers under my feet and it was perfectly doable to handle the paperwork."
