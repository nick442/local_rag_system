>Ah, the downvotes. When the headline is all that someone sees before reading the story, it's important to state explicitly the affected parties. Consumers and businesses are not the only possible parties given a regulation concerning lawsuits. Your attempted retort doesn't even make sense. Your title points at the affect on businesses, his points at consumers, then you go on to argue as if your title was more correct because there are other concerned parties, despite the fact that your title didn't mention either consumers or these fabled other parties? You earned the downvotes.
