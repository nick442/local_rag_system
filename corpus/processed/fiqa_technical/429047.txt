"This is awfully naive. ""Artists"" are people too, who need to put food on the table. So yeah, if Gladwell wasn't getting paid to write books about interesting things, he would stop doing it. He would not make it back in personal appearances. Without comparing the two, Shakespeare himself was a commercial hack out to make a buck. Art may be what sustains the soul, but money is what sustains just about everything else."
