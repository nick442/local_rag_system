The ignorant and absolutely misleading or flat out lying done by these companies to sway politicians in favor of fracking is intellectually insulting to someone whose head is not firmly rammed up his own ass. Specifically, me. Fracking is no bueno because it is no safeo. Why not also store spent nuclear fuel rods close to an aquifer while we're doing stupid things?
