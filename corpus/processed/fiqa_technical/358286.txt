">Source: I'm a state tax auditor, and my job is to make sure corporations pay what they are supposed to. Most of the American public believes that the bulk of taxes are federal income taxes. That's what they fixate on when evaluating the ""fairness"" of taxation. The fact remains that the very wealthy and very large corporations are structured so that they don't pay that particular type of tax. That's why Mitt Romney's tax returns are being squinted at. Mitt pays capital gains tax, not income tax and tripling the tax rate on the upper-most tax bracket wouldn't really affect him. You know this. I know this. But most people don't and few people are interested in learning how it works. If you want to ""tax the rich"" just create a progressive scale for capital gains instead of a flat 15%."
