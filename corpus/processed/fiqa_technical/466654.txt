Honestly this part of the show shouldn't confound people as much as it seems to be. Cersei might be repaying to pave the way for an even larger loan. She might be repaying to maintain diplomatic/trade relations or retain one of the few material allies she still has. Plus it's best to fence the merch when it's hot. Or she might be paying because she's genuinely worried about interest of all things. This whole magical war might be the end of our story, but Cersei doesn't see at as the end of hers (and no monarch would). Historically, monarchs are playing a much longer con than just the single war. King Charles II of England spent a fortune on multiple failing wars before finances got out of hand and he declared his debts illegal (it's good to be the king I guess). These days, things are substantially more complicated. Manipulating prime interest rates is a much more subtle tool that has thus far lead to more stable economies. Defaulting on debt like King Chuck would lead to a serious shock to your system, since every state is so interconnected these days. So they use finer controls to maintain a much larger economy (think bow thrusters on a container ship instead of oars on a canoe).
