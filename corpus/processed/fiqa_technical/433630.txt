Okay, I guess we can start there: My argument that taxes are a civic duty and patriotic is because they pay for the stability, safety, and basic essential services that I require and expect from a modern, civilized nation. The services that they pay for extend well outside of my basic needs, and therefor are for a greater good. They also help to maintain the success and livelihood of the nation and its people - thus the patriotism that I associate with taxes.
