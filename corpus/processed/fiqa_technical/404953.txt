It's much more complicated than that. But to be extraordinarily brief, tech companies (and pharma and everyone else) off-shore the further development of IP (etc.) once it's going to be successful. They then license it back to the US-based entity, and gin up all manner of tax benefits. (Source: I did this for a living.) The problem is that the revolutionary product that's generating billions of dollars was conceived of in the US, developed in the US under the benefits of the US economy at large, protected by US laws, often subsidized by US tax dollars, initially driven by US markets, and is owned by a US parent company. However, having used the vehicle to wealth that is the US, the company then cuts off the tax revenue to the US that's suppose to continue to fuel the broader context that gave rise to the benefits in the first place. Say what you want about US corporate tax rates. This money has been subjected to 0% taxes in most cases and no chance in US tax rates will chance that calculation.
