There must be a rational limit on where you draw the line of short term profit versus long term social sustainability. Air is an abundant resource with no scarcity thus a poor candidate for a for-profit venture. The rest of your post really reads like you have committed to the zero-sum fallacy of economics and I really don't know how to argue against it.
