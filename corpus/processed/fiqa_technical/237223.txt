The breach was discovered by Equifax on July 29th. On August 21st, someone bought 2600 put option contracts that were set to expire in September (and if the price of EFX remained above $135 until then, those options would have been worthless). On September 7th, Equifax makes the decision to announce the breach, and those put options (worth 60 cents a piece) skyrocket, earning the holder a cool $4.2 million+. For perspective, those 2600 put options were literally ten times the monthly volume of EFX options on a typical month. There was almost certainly insider trading going on, and it probably wasn't the hackers themselves logging into their (authenticated/identifiable) brokerage accounts and buying up oodles of put options expiring a month later.
