I respect your openness to different viewpoints. I'm also not the poster you originally replied to. Just an innocent, reasonable, bystander. I was snippy, but only because this is one of my biggest argument pet peeves so I apologize. Inventing an argument in order to proclaim a victory where there never was a battle. I always personally try to step aside and ask myself if the meaning of what someone is saying is at all contradicted by my stance. Inevitably, the answer to that question also exposes the reality. If he were to make rebuttal along the lines of *why yes, humans actually are able to be traded and slavery and yada yada* then I would concede my point. Since I highly, highly doubt this (and I'm almost assured you can't foresee this scenario either), an argument of this nature is nothing more than an exercise of linguistic masturbation.
