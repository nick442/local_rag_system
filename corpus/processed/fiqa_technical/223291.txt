Common sense was the foundation - the idea that you can't spend more than you take in, indefinitely, without there being negative long term effects. We've been doing that since 1958. With that as the base, then watching what is going on in the economy, not just in the present day, but historically. Looking into how the government has manipulated the economic numbers for decades. Consumer confidence counts for a lot - which is why some of the numbers have been manipulated. Investor confidence counts for a lot too - which explains the others. You can only hide things for so long, though. Borrowing from Peter to pay Paul and then borrowing even more from Paul to pay Peter so Bob thinks you're credit worthy only works until they all figure out you haven't actually got enough money to pay them back, and won't ever. As for confidence, I'm making major life decisions based on it, so I'd say pretty confident. I just hope to be reasonably well prepared by the time it all goes down.
