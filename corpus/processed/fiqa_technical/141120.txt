You can't control the number of special interest groups. You can't control their stubbornness, animosity, or lack of foresight. What you can do is limit how and when special interest groups can press their views. Create a new team whose whole job is to field lobbying before it gets to congress. They see all the new bills, etc. and boil them down to simple terms, pros, and cons, before presenting them to congress. The final version must also be signed off on by the lobbying party before it is presented. You need a second party in this group: The Devil's Advocates - a group that is REQUIRED to argue against EVERY proposal. The whole reason for this group is to ensure that no proposal passes without contest. You need a group whose whole goal is to identify the impact of each proposal, and return the findings to fielders. They also require a devil's advocate. When the final proposal is signed off on, then the fielding group presents it to congress, not the lobbyists or their supporters. The funding for these groups comes directly from the lobbyists, who must finance their bill through congress, unless special exception is made. If a ton of special interest groups want to get their form in, they must wait their turn in line. The less work the fielding group has to do to clean up their request, validate it, and discover the pros and cons, the faster the lobby request will go through. This is just a rough idea off the top of my head. What are the issues you see with it?
