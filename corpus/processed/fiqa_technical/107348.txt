If you cut taxes on the 1% highest earners, that incentivizes everyone else to become high earners! Since all that's needed to enter the 1% is to become wildly successful upon the backs of others, we can expect that between 48 and 49% of the country to become 1% of the top earners with these and other incentives. All people really needed was additional incentives to becoming rich beyond their wildest dreams!
