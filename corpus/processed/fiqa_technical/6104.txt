"You should also examine gross costs. The US per capita is paying twice what Canada does, and is getting worse results (lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality). Not exactly a bargain. A significant part of the rate of increase in costs is likely due to the shifting demographics bulge of baby boomers aging. If you look at (these charts)[http://flatrock.org.nz/topics/money_politics_law/boom_moves_along.htm] you'll see that there's a a lot more folks in their 50's than before. And [""Nearly one-third of lifetime expenditures is incurred during middle age, and nearly half during the senior years""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361028/). In the report you linked ""The medical trend reported includes the increases in both price inflation and utilization for 2009"".. so it's impossible to say how much medical inflation there actual was (i.e. is the cost of a flu shot rising faster/slower than inflation). Which makes the report a bit slimy in that it compares directly against the rate of inflation."
