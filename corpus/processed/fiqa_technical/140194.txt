Part of this is the flipper economy that grew out of the last housing downturn. People try to buy a house they can afford that needs some work, but flippers come swooping in, buy it in cash, do some slipshod renovations, and suddenly the house becomes out of reach for a lot of people. Builders are just as bad. Instead of making sensibly sized affordable houses, they all build 20 room McMansions. Upper-middle class people are buying a lot of these houses, and are putting themselves in deep financial straits doing so. They are mortgaged up to the eyeballs where all it takes is a medical issue, a job loss, or some other hiccup in their finances to cause it all to come tumbling down. If you have money (not just a good paycheck, actual free cash on hand) all of the above works for you. But even if you have a good paycheck, if you do not have significant cash reserves you really don't have any hope of competing in this market.
