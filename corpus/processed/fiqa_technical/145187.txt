The internet lends itself to the formation of tribes. We can all easily surround ourselves in echo chambers of like-minded people. It's incredibly dangerous. When we had nothing but television, our tribes were much closer to centrist beliefs. No we have fringe movements that really don't know they're fringe because they're all smoking the same ideology. Take the example of the wingnut Berkely leftists that shut down Richard Dawkins lecture. (Seriously. Richard Dawkins?) They honestly believe they're correct, and the Internet helps them feel comfortable in that belief no matter how totally insane it is. This is only going to get worse. More violent. More extreme. And eventually more dangerous and radicalized. Fake news is really just the very tip of the iceberg. Right here on Reddit are thousands of groups who share utterly fringe ideologies and think they're widely shared.
