"There are stocks that have held 100% of the exact same trend (bull or bear) on a date or date range for years. While history of course doesn't guarantee that the trend will hold for the current year, that fact itself is distinct from the question of whether history is an *indicator* worth building a thesis off of. The problem is if and when someone thinks ""indicator"" is equivalent to ""definitive answer"". Answer 2: A dozen big algo traders have disproven this notion. Answer 3: Price is not only price action itself. It's calendar, evens, binaries, cyclical psychology, etc."
