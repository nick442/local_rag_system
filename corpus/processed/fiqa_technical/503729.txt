Agreed it isn't fair, but large businesses/multinationals will **always** have the advantage of choosing which legal jurisdiction to do business in. This creates an incentive for such loopholes in order to attract the businesses to do business there at all. It needs to be harder for legislators to write such specialized tax laws, as the more complex/specialized the tax law becomes, the more unfair it inevitably turns out.
