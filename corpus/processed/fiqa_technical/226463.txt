What about electrician, plumber, welder, construction with on the job training to work specialized equipment, mechanics that specialize on certain brands of vehicles, HVAC specialists, and so on? By the way, the apprentice of the year a few years ago for welding in my Hubby's union was a woman looking to move up to engineering after the training paid by the union was complete. There are also the office jobs that train people for the specialized requirements as they go like bookkeeping. Too many don't look in the right places and are not willing to put in the extra hours and work for the paid as you work training these jobs provide for entry level applicants.
