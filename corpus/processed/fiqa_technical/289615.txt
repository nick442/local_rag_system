Except North Korea just backed down. I expect you down voting cunts to be able to pick up a rifle and a grenade since you make light of the Korean war. Your type was called to service in the spirit of a general named Macarthur. Like you, he thought he was right and affected weird appearance in the form of a corn cob pipe unlike your piercings and tattoos. He went across the northern korean border chasing north korean armies in retreat, but in his perfect moral charge- just as you act by downvoting since you must purge your perceived enemies- he met 1 million chinese soldiers hidden in the forests who chased his arrogant asshole all the way back to the 38th parallel where the border is today. Suck my ass.
