"I'm not worried about them tracking me (I'm a boring white guy who might even be flattered). But, I'm also not selfish and short-sighted.. The huge problem is the unjust abuses of other people's rights. I'm talking about people who have done no wrong, but are ""suspicious"" for bullshit reasons. It's wrong already, and acceptance of it only serves to keep expanding it. It may not affect us today, but it threatens affect us all tomorrow."
