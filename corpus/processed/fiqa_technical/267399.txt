Because as an executive you have a fiduciary duty to be present.. on the sheer chance you can spare shareholders from losing more value than they need to.. or to even improve it. Not to mention the fact that they like their newfound access to Washington.. even if they can't influence anything. I'm sure they like the limelight. Besides.. a lot of these executives don't even have any skin in the game. Most just get millions in salary or free stock. Worst case scenario it's just a giant mad hatter's tea party lol. This is assuming that what you said about Trump is correct. I'm not really energized politically. But I do know the responsibility of ceos to shareholders.
