"Proof of interference please. No ""that guy/those guys said it happened"". But an expert or authority saying: ""we have concrete proof,and *this is it*"", i.e a claim of proof backed up immediately by exposing and explaining said concrete proof. Actual proof. Not inductive reasoning. I'm asking because I stopped following the issue for a time, and *I want genuine proof*. I am not american, I have no stake in the issue and ***I am not saying there wasn't interference***, I just want solid proof, of which I haven't been sent any so far. Only insults and aggression for daring to be tough to convince. That doesn't bode well for their arguments, btw."
