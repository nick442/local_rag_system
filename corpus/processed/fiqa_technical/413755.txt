"Maybe. But if you think you can tell the difference between the parties on major policy issues, I'm impressed. Party positions on the most important issues are awfully blurry these days. Which party is for banking reform again? Which party is for foreign military intervention? Which party is cozy with big pharma? Which party represents the American working class? Etc. Partisanship is the problem. I'm a proud independent and I'll say it again: They're all crooks. Saying who's ""worse"" is like a grade school argument."
