"Your premise is false. When you withdraw money from a Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA), there is no tax due. Yes, you can read that again: withdrawals from a TFSA are tax free. They are labeled ""tax free"" for a good reason! After-tax money is deposited, and then from that point forward, no tax, no tax, no tax. :-) On a ""normal"", non-registered investment or savings account with no special treatment, your investment earnings will be taxed whenever gains are realized or income received (e.g. dividends or interest). You will necessarily have less in a normal non-registered investment or savings account compared to a TFSA, as long as the rate of return was positive, i.e. growing. Perhaps you were thinking not of comparing a regular investment account to a TFSA, but rather to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)? In the case of an RRSP, there is an up-front tax deduction, then earnings grow tax-deferred, and then on withdrawal, income tax is paid at regular rates. Even then, with RRSPs, if your marginal tax rate remains the same over time (not necessarily a reasonable assumption, but let's go with it) then you should still realize more after-tax income from your RRSP than from a normal non-registered investment or savings account. (Though, there's likely an exception case when most income came as qualified dividends and the capital itself hasn't appreciated.)"
