Although there is plenty of blame to go around for this epidemic, which really started with our involvement in the Vietnam War, I don't see enough blame in these stories for the insurance companies that have refused to pay for any other form on pain management other than opiate drugs. What is the doctor supposed to do when their patient is in pain and opiates are the only relief the patient can afford? Certainly many docs have over prescribed these mess but they don't decide what treatments are and are not available for their patients.
