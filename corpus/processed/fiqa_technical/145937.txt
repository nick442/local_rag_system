"The bottom line is that this just does not work, and as such you should not do it. Here is a question that you really need to think about: How will you handle non-payments? How will you handle it when they talk about purchases they made or vacations they went on when they have been short for the last three months? Yes, it will happen. The majority of people who engage in debt consolidation, which you are proposing, end up with the consolidated debt and more consumer debt. One cannot borrow themselves out of debt. Carrying credit card debt is a sign of poor money management and improper spending behavior. That behavior will not change if you ""bail them out"" with the consolidation. They need to find a way to work their way out of this situation by budgeting, living a more austere lifestyle, and earning more. Encouraging them to do so will serve them far better then your generous attempts to reduce the pain of their own making. In the end it is always a parent's desire to help their children. If you can afford to give, then it is well within your right to do so. It is also within your right to qualify that giving with behavioral conditions. However, if you cannot afford to give, it is best not to loan."
