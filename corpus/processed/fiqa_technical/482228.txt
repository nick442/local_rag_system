"This ""article"" is a piece of fucking trash. There is no argument here. It's just, ""well doesn't that sound ridiculous?"" No definition of ""societal value"" or even ""society"" is ever given at all. No consideration of the value of a strong economy is given; no specific, quantitative arguments are provided; and no credit is given to capitalism not only for lifting billions of people from crippling poverty to recently unimaginable wealth, but for being the only system to ever do so. Are food, shelter, and clothing basic human needs? Obviously. How do most people attain these needs? By working for a wage/salary for some company, which are reliant on a functional financial system.
