Also lawyer, but I don't do any employment law. Common law concepts like unconscionability and negligence can still be actionable, even if expressly waived, right? I've seen cases where a person signed a liability waiver but was still able to pursue a suit against the other side under a theory of negligence. The case I read stated that a liability waiver didn't absolve the defendant from his duty to take reasonable precautions.
