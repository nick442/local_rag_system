The government? It is the people who control the government; the very wealthy who make money when the rest of us are hurting. The very wealthy made money during the Great Depression and have been making it ever since. I was born in 1956 and when i entered the job market there was no job market. Things haven't changed much except for the gap between those on the very top and the rest of us.
