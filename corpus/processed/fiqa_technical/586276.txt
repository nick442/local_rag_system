"> Simply because there are cases of market failures, I do not therefore conclude that the market system is itself a failure. No, but without a realistic mechanism to correct for them (especially ones with effects as broad reaching as the financial crisis) I don't see how ""free-markets"" can be compatible with liberty and justice. If you're seeing some sort of mass organization of the public against market externalities that affect them then I'm afraid I missed that. In my experience most people don't even understand the nature of the problems, let alone work together to mend them. That's a shame you won't debate with people who hold opposing viewpoints, I was looking forward to the challenge of your air-tight refutation of ""collectivist systems""."
