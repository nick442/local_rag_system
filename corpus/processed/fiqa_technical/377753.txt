Most of the years I filed while a non-resident of the US, I didn't owe a dime to the US government. Same was actually true for Canada, though I did have some income there that was eligible for taxation. AFAIK, even if I hadn't, I would have been required to file, but perhaps that isn't necessary for everyone.
