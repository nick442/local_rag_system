> I know the last one was due to cocaine, which really doesn't make sense to me but it's a barrier that the company is not getting rid of because if you are not able to get clean even just long enough to get hired there is a good chance of other issues as an employee Yup. I was friendly with a lady at a fortune 500 who ran drugs tests. She said if you can't not do cocaine for 3 days before the test you have a problem. At this company they didn't care about pot. It was just cocaine/meth, etc.
