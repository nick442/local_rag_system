Hey Forum, I recently had an update to the app where it now allows you to find out your markup percentage. All you have to do is put in your desired profit at the end of the month and then put in how many items you want to sell each month and the entire formula is calculated for you in less than a second. Extremely convenient and extremely time-saving. You can download the Android version here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.markupmagic.companymarkup&hl=en And the iOS here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/markup-magic-profit-calculator/id1183206273?mt=8 We are currently redoing the website so you can look out for that soon enough. :) As always, suggestions and comments are always welcome as we want this to be the best app it can be for users. Take care and have a wonderful time.
