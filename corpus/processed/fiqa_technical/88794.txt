At some point, there will even be non wealthy nations with better healthcare. Anyone who is well travelled, or from another country knows how horrific the US healthcare system is. The media talks about poor people, but it's awful for the middle to upper middle class too in comparison to alternatives. It constantly shocks me this is not a bigger public issue. If only the general population realized what the alternative looks like. Not perfect by any means, but so much better.
