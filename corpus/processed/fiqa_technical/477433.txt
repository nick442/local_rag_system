"Sry for getting -73. It is fact that we don't have a minimum wage in Germany and that we developed a pretty large low income sector over the last ten years that often pays wages that are, in fact illegal in the US. And there are cases which involve workers receiving state benefits and essentially working for free in order to get back into the ""primary job market"". This last sector has a lot of fraud, often times to the sole disadvantage of the person working. But Germany also has a tradition of less transparency compared to the US. This includes all aspects of life and has benefits. Much more privacy for example. But also severe drawbacks. Like this one. Where a lot of people simply choose to ignore a huge part of the population. Though it isn't 25% of the workforce that gets such low wages. It's still big though. Your karma is outrageous."
