Again I don't know how well this applies to all finance professions but in my field a lot of what we do is effectively communicate finance and valuation information to clients. Essentially we are contracted to perform analysis, then we write a report conveying the meaning of that analysis to the client. A good amount of the work we do often has legal implications as well so our writing has to stand up to litigation and cross examination. Perhaps being a good writer won't be crucial for your position but in my opinion writing is mostly about how to effectively communicate an idea. In that context writing is very useful in teaching you how to get your message across. I hope that makes sense.
