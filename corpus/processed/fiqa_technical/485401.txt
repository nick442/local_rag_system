I disagree. The US has secret ballots. No one knows who you vote for unless you tell them. This board member publicly supported and campaigned for a candidate that potentially has interests hostile to companies the board member is associated with. I don't see it as remarkable (or even particularly newsworthy really) that another member calls him out on it.
