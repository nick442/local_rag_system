"It's not like Google did it out of the goodness of their hearts, though. Google did it so many people would consolidate their services with Google, casually forcing their users to use Google's very profitable search engine, which was and is arguably the best search engine on the internet anyway. This same idea is also what's making Google lose the social networking war to Facebook. They are trying to force fit a service that people do not want, as they did before with other Google products. It was really a win-win for everybody at that time. But that same thought process might make Google go through some ""tough"" times in the next couple of years. But they are a cash rich company who can bring in literally the best talent in the world. I'm sure they'll make management changes and adapt accordingly."
