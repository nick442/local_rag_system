I'm not that concerned. Does it suck that we live in a world where companies need to work on fraud detection? Sure. But like it or not, that's the world we live in, and regulations aren't going to fix it since it's essentially impossible to enforce. These companies are technology and logistics companies, so they need to work on fraud detection.
