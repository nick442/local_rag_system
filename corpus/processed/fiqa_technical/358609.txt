Ok, you fly down to the Nike factory in Indonesia and tell those kids that they have to stop being so bitter and do something to change their lives. Tell them that they should be satisfied with the agreement that they chose to enter. I think you should realize that change is a privilege that very few of us have. Not everyone has the will and the skill. Most times, it just comes down to luck.
