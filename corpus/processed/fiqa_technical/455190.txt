I hate to be the person who has to say this, but.. You do realize that there's a Juilliard (or Curtis, or Eastman School of Music, or even U of Michigan..) and then there's a fucking *University of Georgia*? Juilliard for music is like MIT or Caltech for computer science. The lady from Equifax wasn't quite bright enough as a musician to make it into Juilliard.
