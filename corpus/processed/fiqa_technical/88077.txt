"I found a blogger at US News as well as some people on a forum suggesting that, if you have another bank account, you may be able to do it by using that other account to initiate an electronic funds transfer (aka ACH). They say that even a PayPal payment may work. However, the former says that ""whether or not this trick works can vary from bank to bank."" You could try doing that and see if it works. I don't think there is any way to know for sure what they would consider a ""boan fide"" direct deposit without asking them, and if you ask them they will get wise to your game."
