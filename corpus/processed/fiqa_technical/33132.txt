I just wrote an article about this and how Im playing it (ALOT of long dated OotM (out of the money) PUT options). Especially with the Fed forcing rate hikes (as if they think we dont understand theyre hiking only to cut rates in a few months when a recession shows) and the economys growth weakening. I don't see a single catalyst for resuming the boom in auto sectors. (my article) https://lonewolf.liberty.me/car-mageddon-is-upon-us-and-how-to-play-it/
