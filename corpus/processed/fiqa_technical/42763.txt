"I read this so often and it's such bullshit. Do you know why robots won't replace fast food workers? Because the fast food workers are cheap. Dirt cheap. Why don't people realize this? I guess because most people earn pretty shitty wages themselves, so they don't see how $7.50/hr. is next to nothing, especially when your average McDonald's store makes $7,100 in revenue per day. 3 shifts of 6 workers means your wage costs are $1,080 for workers, ex-managers. Wages are 15% cost of sales. That's nothing. Would robots cost less? Hmm..maybe. How much do they cost to buy? How often do you need to maintain them? How much do parts cost? IT staff to manage them? Do you still need a manager to take in deliveries, and is he going to stack and organize them now? (Robots can't do that--they lack the dexterity.) Also, are the managers going to start cleaning the toilets now? Doubtful--and robots can't do that either. In other words, this ""robots are taking over"" is true but ""robots are going to crowd out minimum wage workers"" is complete and total horseshit. I think lower middle class and middle class office workers are being fed this line to oppose minimum wage increases--which of course boost corporate margins. But they're the ones at risk. You know who robots CAN replace more easily than minimum wage workers? Office workers. Secretaries, actuaries, bookkeepers, investment managers, marketing analysts, IT managers, accountants, journalists.. Don't worry, middle class America. The robots aren't coming for the people who clean your toilets, who cook your food, and who wash your dishes. No. They're coming for you."
