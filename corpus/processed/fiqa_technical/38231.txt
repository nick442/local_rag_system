"College courses focus mainly on theory. In the real world you'll need to learn the tools to gather and analyze the data. For the most part what is taught in college is pretty worthless. I remember my database class in business school was about ""database theory"". Is was a complete waste of time and money. Didn't learn a single useful thing. Learning these hands on things will put you ahead of 95% of your peers. SQL is the coding language used in data bases R is used for statistical analysis OBIEE is a reporting tool that can link to data bases then report the data Tableau another reporting tool the is more visual than OBIEE None of the things are difficult to learn. So don't be intimidated. TLDR I learned more by spending $100 on udemy then in college."
