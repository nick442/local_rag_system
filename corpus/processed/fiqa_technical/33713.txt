The perilously dumb are the ones who can't admit that we live in a certified state-corporate oligarchy. A capitalist experiment gone wrong. That the financialization of our economy since the 1980's has reduced the world economy to financial machinations on fancy spreadsheets. The world is living through the end-results of all of this misguided short-termist bullshit, so I invite you to look all around you in order to understand things as they are (versus fluff economic theories and edicts that get continually debunked).
