I'm not sure why she's blaming Yelp for her 2.54 star rating. Yes, her handpicked reviewers are getting demoted. But all those negative reviewers who did business with her AND are regular Yelp reviewers should be considered perfectly representative of her overall quality of service as is. You redditors need to be honest with yourselves..even knowing that Yelp indiscriminately cuts out new reviewers, would you choose her 2.5 star company over a 5 star rated competitor? Of course not. **She wasn't handicapped or at a disadvantage with respect to her rivals whatsoever. Every Yelp businesses gets same Yelp treatment.**
