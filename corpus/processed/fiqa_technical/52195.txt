"Don't confuse ""caring"" with ""creating visibility."" I bother to respond not because I care what Troll A or Troll B thinks, but because I want to ensure *my* message gets in front of the silent lurkers who read the comments. Of course, sometimes I just repeat a person's words back to them… for fun, to highlight how inane they are. Like all that ""bitter"" crap and ""where did you go to marketing school?"" Which gets me labeled a bitch. That's fine by me. Gets my stuff in front of more eyeballs, more people I can reach. Also… this has been extremely boring to me. I haven't been on reddit in a long time, but I remember it being… wittier. I spend most of my ""internet news aggregator time"" on HN, where the level of ad hominem attack is usually much higher. I'm home sick, and bored, and glad to get another 4,000 page views -- total of now about 16,000! woot! -- but I do wish the level of discourse were higher so it would be some kind of *challenge*."
