I bought a 4.7 inch Nexus 4 about 18 months ago. At the time, I didn't really want a screen that big - it seemed obnoxiously large. I bought it because there wasn't a smaller-screened similarly priced and specced phone. It took me about a week of use to get used to it. Now, when I try and use an iPhone the screen seems comically small. The article is an opinion piece, written by someone who clearly hasn't spent much time using a larger-screened phone. I felt exactly the same way about bigger screens *until I started using one*. The huge advantages in reading and viewing photos quickly became obvious, and I got used to holding a larger phone.
