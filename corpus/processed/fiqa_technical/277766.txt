"Capitalism doesn't have an overall goal for society or the economy. It's simply a description of the behaviour of an economy given certain legal constraints, some market conditions, and the assumption that participants behave in their own interest. It's a descriptive system, as opposed to a proscriptive system such as communism - which, btw, might well agree with your ""should"" statement."
