"I used to travel a lot for work, in '14 I spent 35 work weeks on the road, so I know air travel pretty well. Thing is, anyone who travels that often generally doesn't need to pay for a better seat. I got upgraded to first class for free about 50% of the time, some trips I'd get first class on all the flights. At the worst, you're sitting in the coach ""plus"" with larger seats, more legroom, and often free drinks. Regular fliers don't sit in the back by the bathrooms, they're sitting further up right behind first class. Either you travel infrequently enough that you can suck it up for a coach flight every so often, or you're traveling often enough that you don't need to worry about it."
