I'm not saying there arent records out there, i've seen them at various book stores I go to that now are carrying, but some of the comments will have you believe if you polled a city bus full of people many will have purchased records when in reality is probably just the people who they are close with because they hang out with people of similar interest. Sony making records indicates yes there is a market, calling it mainstream is a stretch though.
