I guess I was getting at a few things - distributed solar power now is cheaper than utility grid-based power for at least 1/3 of US homes and that ability to lower energy prices is continuing to grow. Electric Vehicles will soon be cheaper and more compelling than gas-powered alternatives. Other forms of electric transport will come over the next 10+ years. Significant change is coming in electrical production, transmission, and consumption. Climate change is not a hoax and labeling it as such very clearly reflects the lack of any sort of education on the issue. Therefore, yes, my response was emotional.
