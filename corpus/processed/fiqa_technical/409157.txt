"However this seems off because I would essentially be purposely filling out a form incorrectly. Note that the only part of the W-4 form that is required to be filled out and given to the employer is the small certificate at the bottom that you tear off. In this part, it only asks you for ""Total number of allowances you are claiming"". You don't have to fill out any of the worksheets in the other parts of the form, which actually ask for specific information. Since there are different allowed ways of computing the ""Total number of allowances you are claiming"", I doubt that any number you put there can be said to be ""incorrect"".

And you don't have to feel bad about ""filling the form incorrectly"" if you follow the IRS calculator."
