I wrote a bplan. Went balls to the wall making it detailed. Put it in a drawer and never looked at it again. My recommendation is to not go into every detail. I think the idea is to get a skeleton and then fill out a paragraph for each. It makes you think about the aspects of starting a business that you may not have thought about. Other than that, go get the book, Lean Startup by Eric Ries and read that to about 66% through.. that ought to be enough for you to get going. As you're business gets started and you mature fast enough, then read the remaining 33%.
