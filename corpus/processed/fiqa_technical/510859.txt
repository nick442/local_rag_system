Yeh I agree with amazon I would own only 2 shares. But what do u think about Nvidia? 196$. plus gpus are needed for self driving cars, cryptocurrency mining, ai, and vr. So stock I think would go up. And it's not as expensive as google and and microsoft. Do you think that price is good? Or to high for my available money.
