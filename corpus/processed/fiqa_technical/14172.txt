dont dare throw facts into their preconceived notions that unions are always evil and at fault for everything on the planet. I wonder how mister police offices pay compares to the top 1% when you look at disparity between ceo and cop pay today, versus 1950.. I'm betting(but am not claiming like right wingers do), I am betting that if you look at it percentagewise in the form of disparity, it is this cop who is earning closer to the correct pay, it just seems way high as we have gotten used to lower pay, less benefits and two people working in every family.
