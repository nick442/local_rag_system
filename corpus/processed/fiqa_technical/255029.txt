Yes. I passed the CFA Level 1 with three months of studying with only a BS in Economics and a career as a Financial Advisor. I took a local review course with my local CFA chapter in San Francisco, then sprang for some test question banks and just plowed through them. Anytime I missed a question, I reread the section on that question, wrote out an index card to drill the concept, drilled the concepts for awhile, and then took the test questions again. Good luck.
