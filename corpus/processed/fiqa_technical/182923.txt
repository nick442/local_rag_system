"First off you are either lying or are seriously disillusioned about the recruiting process because it is very common knowledge that trading puts significantly less emphasis on GPA that IBanking. . Secondly, why are you making the assumption that there was nothing exemplary on their resume? Having a low GPA doesn't automatically imply that the person's resume is trash. And again, if ""no one"" got past the initial round of interviews because of a 3.2 GPA I know quite a few firms who would be out some very good traders."
