"I work in the casino industry. We overbook tickets to concerts/events every single time, and 99% of the time we get enough cancels to not have to worry about it. But that 1% of the time where we have more players than tickets, we bend over backwards to make sure everyone gets a ticket. I've purchased tickets from ""ticket brokers""(scalpers) for like 5x the face value to make sure no one is unhappy. Of course I don't expect a car rental place to go buy a car so I have one to rent, but at least if they overbooked (which I understand), they better freaking find an alternative even if its a competitor."
