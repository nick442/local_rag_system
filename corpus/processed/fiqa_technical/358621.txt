"I'm not concerned with ""teaching"" Puerto Rico anything. It is in Puerto Rico's interest to repay their debt for the simple fact that they won't be able to operate without access to credit. Who is gonna lend to Puerto Rico in the future if these bonds go to zero. If everyone is paid back at a reasonable figure, Puerto Rico will be able to borrow again one day and not at a predatory rate.This is what I believe is Klarman's thesis for investing in Puerto Rico's debt. I have no sympathy for the lenders who relaxed their standards, nor for the investors that overlooked the risks for the extra yield. My point is Klarman did nothing to create this situation, he just saw value in the bonds when no one else did. The article is trying to paint him as a villain for simply owning the bonds after the fact."
