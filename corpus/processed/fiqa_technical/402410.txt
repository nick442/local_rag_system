PS: I have made no money. I am an Apple fan Boy - 12 year certed tech and former genius. I am running ios11pb2 on my 7plus. Just as Horace Deidu showed us where the industry was discounting Apple back with the rise of the iPhone & ipad, Ben Thompson at stratechery has been writing article after article about Amazonâ€™s strategy. And everything he has been writing for a couple years now about amazon is coming true - and it is a good lens to view the Whole Food purchase. However the stock turns out has no bearing on what the company is doing nor is a remotely reasonable way to compare companies. Being an Apple fan since the stock was 13/share has taught me that.
