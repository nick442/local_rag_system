"The ethnocentrism that drips off the piece can easily be defined as jingoism. Is the ""all-American business model defined by offering products that people love at good prices, friendly staff.. clean and bright stores?"" These are obviously things the author places highly as positive ideals. Without historical context, comparative information or any real examination it's clear that the positive correlation relies upon an excessive bias in judging one's own country as superior to others. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingoism I apologize for leaning upon the colloquial meaning. If you were to visit the front page of the OP site you would see it's an easy mistake to make."
