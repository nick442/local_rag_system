"It's really not your fault for not negotiating a better salaray. It's your fault for *having a problem* and not taking care of it. You felt undervalued and unappreciated, and because of that you left your job. Do you think your employers *would have liked to know that?* How do you think that conversation would have gone? ""Well boss, I've been working for you for a while now, and I've stuck it out while you looked for more people, and frankly I feel insulted at the difference between what you're paying them and what you're paying me. It's really getting to me, and I'm considering looking for a different position."" I can tell you how that would have gone. There are *only* three ways: The first is that the new guy is being paid for a skill or talent you don't know about that actually does make him more valuable than you. (You can respond then: how do I get those skills so I can get that kind of pay, too?) The second is that the person was hired at whatever the asking rate was because they were desperate for people, and they certainly don't want to loose you, so they'll work with you to bring your compensation in line with the going rate. The third is that they have been having problems with you, you seem poorly motivated, your work is suffering and you don't get along with anyone, so they're not interested paying any more for your services and you're welcome to look for a better deal. Come on man, the WORST outcome leaves you no worse off than what you did to yourself! The best outcome could have been worth 15K/yr! And it would have given your employer the chance to do right by you. Even if you ultimately decided to take a different position, you would have known where you stood, and almost certainly you would have left with a better taste in your mouth. Your problem is that you failed to let anyone know about your problem. Or worse, you bitched and moaned to everyone except the people who could have done something to help."
