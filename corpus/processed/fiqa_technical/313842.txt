Oh, yeah, the government's response to heroin users is *definitely* to get them treatment. Anyway, that's not the point: The point is that many things people enjoy in the short term, harm them in the long term. The thing about stock exchanges is, they are not people, and there's no inherent reason that any of them should exist. If they get addicted to something that harms them, the simplest and cheapest solution is to let them kill themselves, so that a new market that operates more responsibly can take it's place. There's no point in government intervention here because we're not saving a life, we're supporting a terrible investment. It's a completely different thing. *Your* mindset is the same mindset that leads to bailouts and subsidies that distort and cripple the markets by forcing otherwise-dead companies and methods to continue to exist by fiat, instead of letting that which is dead, die away, so that newer participants have the chance to evolve and improve the market.
