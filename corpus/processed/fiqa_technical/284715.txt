They would definitely buy at premium but how much higher would depend on how they value the company - there are many ways how a PE firm would do this and it’s not easy to guess without knowing more financial information. I’m a bit curious when you say they would want to buy ALL shares. Typically, PE firm wouldn’t buy out all since they would still require the owner / proprietor to continue developing the products. Unless, the products are matured and it’s a 100% makeover transformation - while this is possible, it’s quite rare, at least from my experience. If your shares are significant enough and you want to keep it, you may do so but it’ll require massive efforts when you’d want to liquidate later - since it’ll be in a private market, it’ll hard to value for other buyers and the known buyers might squeeze you if you’re desperate to sell. Disclaimer - some years of experience in PE. Regulations might differ in your geographical location.
