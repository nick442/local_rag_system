> CNC units without touch screens and fancy alignment cameras cost 2k. If they don't sell enough units in time, maybe they'll have to close shop? They do, but they usually have a very small operating envelope and limited ability to cut through thicker materials. If you want something which can cut a full sheet of plywood, you need to spend $10K+, and it requires proper installation in a permanent location. I think the beauty of this product is that it fits between those two extremes. It doesn't provide fully automated cutting, but it does allow you to cut large sheets of plywood that only a machine costing 10x can do. I think the problem is that the product is very niche. Most wood workshops who are successful and making lots of furniture will invest in a large format CNC router, and they'll probably keep it running as many hours as possible to get back the investment. Maybe they'd buy one as a secondary CNC cutter? Instead of setting up the large machine for a small job, they can grab the handheld CNC, and do the cut quickly. It's like a backup tool. So where does it sit on the novelty vs practicality spectrum? I think this is very much aimed at the cashed up hobbyist and smaller boutique workshop, maker spaces, schools, etc. I can afford it, but I'd find it hard to justify because I don't think I'd get enough use out of it.
