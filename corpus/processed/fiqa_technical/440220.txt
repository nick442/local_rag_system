Uhm, this is my disclaimer that this is not financial advice. But. I would imagine a decent amount of high growth tech will go into the toilet. Also cyclicals that are heavily reliant on the low cost of short term capital. But really these are just some intuitive guesses. It would really depend on what the mechanism and impact of a future recession would be. Curious though, why do you personally think a recession is looming? I know there's been a lot of talk but per the VIX, investors' worries don't appear to be affecting their behavior too much (at least in equities). I think the big risk is the Fed not being able to control the yield curve, i.e if short term rates increase but the Fed can't or won't shrink the balance sheet enough to impact long term rates. Just an idea.
