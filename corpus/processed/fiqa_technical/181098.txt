Food to your door is a problem nobody is asking to solve. Food delivery has limited success for luxury or novelty food items (e.g., fruit baskets, steaks, coffee, snack food, etc.), but for general eating/family eating, it's not an everyday food shopping need. I can already buy rice, cereal, pasta, etc. on Amazon and their prices are usually higher than what I can buy locally. And that comparison is name brand products. The price difference is laughable when it comes to store brands. Remember when Amazon Diaper products were supposed to put Pampers and Huggies out of business. Oh yeah. Look where that got them..
