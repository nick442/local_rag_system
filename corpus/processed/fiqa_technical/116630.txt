"I took computer science in college so to be fair I can't call myself an engineer.. I figured it wouldn't matter, but apparently engineer is a protected term. Which begs the question why 6 out of 7 computer science bachelor degrees in the university here don't officially make you an engineer. What are those web, application, software, systems, math orientated, game, ""general"", and art degrees are good for..? Or does no one know this and everyone is applying to engineer positions and being titled engineer without being one..? But you are correct. They do start at 60k. Funny thing though, I traded starting salary information with 6 different co-graduates. I actually got paid the most. 32-37k starting salary for associate in computer science."
