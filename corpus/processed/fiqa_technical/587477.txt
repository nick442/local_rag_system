Good, businesses that rely on slaves shouldn't exist. This isn't economic theory, this is real peoples lives. If you're a company that pays so little your employees need food stamps and rent assistance then fuck your business! Why do I pay taxes that supplement your companies profit margin? Why is this fairly direct corporate welfare not the type of welfare you right wingers ever bitch about? You love the masters crumbs right? Or it's just not you, so fuck poor people right? They should just die in the street and make way huh? [Flagstaff?](http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/fact-check/2017/03/29/fact-check-flagstaff-minimum-wage-hike-proposition-414/98641896/)
