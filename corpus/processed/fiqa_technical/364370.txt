>And how did this cause the MBS to get wiped out, was it a written clause or did they just collapse from the value dropping so hard? It was written into the debt instruments. MBS and CDOs are broken down into tranches with descending priority of claims to the collateral pool. When it comes time for payment, the top tranche gets paid out 100% before the one below it is entitled to a single cent, and so on and so forth. Here's an example of how one might be organized: Foo | Bar | text ---|---|---- Tranche | Size | Credit Rating Class A | 750MM | AAA Class B | 100MM | AA Class C | 60MM | A Class D | 50MM | BBB Class E | 40MM | Not Rated In this example, lets say that 5% of the loans defaulted, meaning that of the $1B, only $950MM was available to get paid out (assuming no over-collateralization, which most had, but that's besides the point here). The Class A would get the full 750 they're due, the Class B would get the full 100, and the Class C would get the full 60. At this point there is only 40MM left, so the Class D would get 40 of the 50 due (a 20% write-down), and Class E would get nothing, getting completely wiped out. >I dont know what subordination level means Subordination level basically just means how much debt it below it on the capital structure--how much needs to get completely wiped out before any particular tranche starts sharing in the losses. > Did defaults reaching 8% meaning that 8% of loan takers defaulted? Yeah more or less. Technically I think it's that 8% of the value of the mortgages defaulted, but I believe they were set up to be relatively the same size within each instrument, so there's not really much distinction between 8% of the loan takers and 8% of the aggregate value.
