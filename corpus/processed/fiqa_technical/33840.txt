">[..] but after actually typing my name ""Amy Hoy"" you still refer to me as a ""he""? Amy is a girl's name and my picture is obviously of a woman. I dropped an ""s"", yo. Chill the fuck out. You'll notice throughout I pretty consistently referred to you as ""she"" or by name if you really put any attention into what I wrote. Remember my comment about melodrama? This is a great example. You assumed I'm an idiot, rather than that ""he"" once or twice is a typo when there's a helluva lot more ""she""s in there. Also, why are you rebutting someone who's agreeing with you? It feels pretty douche-y, and looks like you didn't bother to read what they wrote. >The culture I'm complaining about is everywhere, not just in b-school. It's pretty clear in my post that I was bringing a personal example, not making a normative statement. It's also pretty clear that I in no way buy into Startup Culture, and was criticizing a larger cultural problem than just what I experienced in my schooling. I did you the courtesy of reading what you wrote before critiquing it, please do me the same."
