Jesus you're retarded. Should he take the time out of his day to condemn every group that might like him individually? He condemned the violence on both sides and political violence in general. What more do you fucking want? Do you want him to flog himself publicly and apologize for being white? The absurdity of the left's expectations for him is palpable and the only thing holding up most of their condemnations is pedantry. Literally nothing he does will satisfy you/ them so why bother? If anything he shouldn't have said anything about it just to piss you people off so you make a fool of yourselves. Should business owners and public figures issue public statements condemning any white supremacists that might be patrons or admirers of their work? It's preposterous to assume so, so why assume the same with the president?
