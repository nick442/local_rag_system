This. White collar crime isn't currently prosecuted to the same degree as blue collar crime. Probably because it's not as visible in everyday life (as opposed to say, a kidnapping). I'm glad to see this and I hope people are beginning to demand harsher punishments for these types of crimes. In a world that is becoming increasingly more structured around financial markets, white collar criminals should be prosecuted accordingly as their actions can have significant consequences in the lives of numerous people.
