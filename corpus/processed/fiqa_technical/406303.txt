London has done the world a service. Uber is nothing more than the biggest payday loan scam the world has ever seen. BUT, you borrow the money from your future self, and pay 25% of it to Uber. Average net profit for an Uber driver is less than 7 cents a mile. That means having to drive 14 miles to make a whole dollar. Anything above this rate ignores the cost of gas, and the maintenance costs of operating a vehicle. You're much better off selling shit to a pawn shop, if you are short of money this week.
