Yes and H1B is NOT CHEAPER for companies to employ. Companies end up paying the H1B salary, the H1B holder, the lawyers, and so on. H1B's have a skillset that the locals do not. If people do not like it then just get the skillset. This isn't that hard to understand..but the mainstream media just wont explain it. Great post btw.
