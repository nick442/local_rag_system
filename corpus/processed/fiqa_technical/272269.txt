"ooooo, you think your work means you should get a lead for it? wow, aren't you presumptuous. it's sad how you think there's some rule out there that says ""hard work => opportunity will come"" seriously, how can you be so deluded? civilization is built on the backs of hard working people where most never get any good opportunities. you think your hard work caused your opportunities? maybe you should learn that correlation doesn't imply causality. and yes, i think many people would say luck had something to do with you getting your lead. what the fuck makes you think that you deserve a lead just because you worked hard. millions of people work damn harder than and they never get anywhere. goddamn, your arrogance is just so mind boggling. saying that there's no such thing as luck is saying that chance is never a factor. your stupidity here is just too obvious to argue about."
