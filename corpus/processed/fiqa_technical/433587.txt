"You are legally able to contribute more than 4% to your 401(k) (unless you've hit the actual limit). There is no reason you need to pull out your ""extra"" contribution. So basically they just want their $27.50 back. So offer (via email or writing) to send them a check. You obviously don't work there any more, so if they insist it comes from your IRA or are not willing to accept a check, tell them to @%#&* off (OK, not really, that would be unprofessional, but that's the general idea). They overpaid you by $27.50, and you are legally bound to return the extra pay, but not to put up with their BS. Tell them you've offered to pay, and if they don't want to accept a check, they can sue you for it to try to get it in the form they prefer (which they won't do, and even if they did, at most the judge would just tell you to write a check - which you offered from the outset, so they'd probably owe your legal fees)."
