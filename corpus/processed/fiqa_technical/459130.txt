There's a company called IdealSpot (I haven't used them, just heard of them) that will do that kind of analysis for you and suggest locations. Also, Census data is free and a good resource for demographic data when it comes to neighborhoods. Also, if you have a local SBDC they may have those numbers handy and they also can really walk you through the loan part of the process as well.
