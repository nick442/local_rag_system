No I'm American, but vacation time is treated as earned income. That's why you get paid out on vacation days when you leave a job. If a company mandates you use vacation days then that's the same as them requiring you to spend your money on certain things. I'm assuming it's mandated in the contract that vacation days get docked for these trips, but it's totally shady.
