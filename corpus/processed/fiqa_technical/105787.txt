"It's not a scam. They just want you to be an Amazon customer for many years and you'll be advertising Amazon to anyone who sees your credit card. $50 is known as the cost of ""customer acquisition"" and it is a very good deal for someone who may become a Prime member and spend $1000s a year on Amazon."
