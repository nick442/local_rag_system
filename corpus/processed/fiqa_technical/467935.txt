This is kind of a silly article and it mostly misses the point. First, Google and others essentially have in-house investment banking departments that are vetting, valuing, negotiating, and sealing these deals. These M&A guys are mostly former bankers. So while they may not be using investment banks, they are certainly using bankers. Google has $60B in cash and does dozens and dozens of acquisitions each year. It's not surprising they find it appealing to move the banking function in-house. Second, certain tech companies like Google and Facebook and Zynga have unique corporate structures where the CEO / founders retain majority voting control of their companies. This means guys like Zuckerberg, Page, Brin, Pincus et al control over 50% of all voting shares and they cannot be ousted by the board of directors, nor can they be overruled on any matter via a proxy battle. This gives these founders far reaching control over M&A and thus you see deals like the $19B cash + stock WhatsApp acquisition (and Instagram); both of these deals were reportedly driven by Zuckerberg himself who not only initiated and vetted the deals, but determined the price. Most CEOs do not have this kind of latitude. Third, within Silicon Valley, the network is very small and tight and everybody knows each other. The CEOs, founders, VCs, etc..they all know each other and they know who to call when they are looking to acquire. It's not like Zuck needs a banker to tell him to check out Snapchat..
