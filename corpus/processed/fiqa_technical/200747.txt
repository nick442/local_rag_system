Yes, if somebody puts you in a multi trillion dollar deficit..yeah, it may take 60+ years to pay it off. Lets say your spouse racked up a few million in bills..that you are responsible to pay pack..how long do you think the fault will lie? Also, don't forget to add in lost opportunity costs of not being able to do anything else but pay back bills.
