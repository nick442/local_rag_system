This guy owns a hotel and timeshare company, it's not exactly a unique business. There are probably a thousand other people who could take it over and keep it running no problem, or another hotel and/or timeshare company that could just incorporate it into its own business. It's not at all comparable to something as unique as Steve Jobs and Apple.
