Well, when it comes down to it, it's not so much class, demographic, or belief system, as it is people I like. I'm certainly less likely to 'like' certain types of people, but I would rather be surrounded on a daily basis with people I'm comfortable with, and who I respect. In a business setting, it would also be nice if they were effective at their job.
