Must pay your bill at least 6 months consecutively for the benefit to take effect. Confirmed by customer service. The rep did tell me that she didn't know much about the new program when I asked her other questions (like is it in a form of a reimbursement or does WF pay the vendor directly). I am hoping the cellphone protection takes effect immediately. Can anyone confirm that 6 consecutive payments is a requirement?
