Color me skeptical. Your link is a survey of studies about power. The cookie study is cited in the survey, but the cookie study itself was not published. One of the authors of the survey also did the cookie study. So it kinda looks like the guy did a study that for some reason he was not able to publish, but snuck in a reference to it somewhere else anyway. Also odd is that despite the text of the survey and Lewis's speech, the chart on the second to last page of your link indicates that only high-power women ate more cookies, while high-power men actually ate slightly fewer. Maybe the chart is misprinted or I am misreading it, but maybe the text is wrong. I know nothing about this field, so it's quite likely that I'm missing something. The claims made seem reasonable. But I can't find anything verifying that there was a properly run study with the results that Lewis described.
