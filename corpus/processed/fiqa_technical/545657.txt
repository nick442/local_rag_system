I love Lynchpin by Seth Godin. Great book. Very entrepreneurial. He borrows a lot of concepts but still an outstanding read. It motivates me. I like to read it once a year. The last book i read was flash boys which caused an outrage after it was published but to me there was nothing in it that was a surprise to me at all. Wall st is greedy and looking to profit off of others with clever schemes? Stop the presses!
