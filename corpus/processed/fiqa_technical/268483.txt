We'll see. There are about 10 battery breakthroughs announced every month. None of them has broken out of the lab yet. Plus Elon makes a valid point: If you have a breakthrough tech, you'll probably try and sell it to the world's largest battery manufacturer: Panasonic/Tesla. Plus, they both have teams dedicated to mapping and pursuing all supposed breakthroughs and advances. While all this does not 100% guarantee that Toyota's boast is bullshit, it makes it likely.
