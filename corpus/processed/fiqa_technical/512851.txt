Just looking at the numbers, something appears off. Cost of equity of ~4% seems very low and should not be below cost of debt. Also a risk free rate of 1.66% seems VERY low. Sometimes it's worth taking a step back and seeing if the numbers even make sense. If you're serious about using your own analysis for investing, the assumptions are extremely important and incorrect ones can throw everything off.
