Determining the value of a service is an art, not a science. It depends on what others are charging, the quality and complexity and annoyance factor of the work, availability of people with the skill to do the work, etc. This topic can and does fill books, plural, and can't be answered fully here. As a customer, the answer is to get multiple quotes, understand how they differ, and pick the one you are most comfortable with. Last job I priced, I got three quotes, discarded the lowball who didn't know PT from cedar, discarded the one with the luxury price, and went with the guy in the middle who did adequate (not great) work for a tolerable fee. For a different kind of job I might have decided otherwise, or chucked all three and looked for more quotes from respected firms.
