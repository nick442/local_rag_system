"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://newrepublic.com/article/144180/single-payer-wonks) reduced by 66%. (I'm a bot) ***** > It&#039;s hard to deny that single-payer is an area where progressive politics has outstripped policy. > Smaller and more explicitly progressive think tanks, such as the Economic Policy Institute, Demos, and the Roosevelt Institute, are stacked with left-leaning scholars on subjects like the minimum wage, voting rights, and anti-trust policy, but are less in the business of churning out policy proposals for legislators, especially when it comes to health care. > While some groups, such as the Physicians for a National Health Program, an organization that pushes for single-payer, have been at the forefront of the issue, the bulk of the think tank world has been focused on defending the ACA. As Adam Gaffney, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and board member of PNHP, told the New Republic, &quot;When something seems very far away, the need for that kind of detailed policy work sometimes seems less.&quot; But now that single-payer is no longer an idea on the fringe, the actual mechanics have to be in place to maintain its credibility. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6s14zd/apparently_its_the_fault_of_leftleaning_think/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~184792 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **policy**^#1 **single-payer**^#2 **out**^#3 **detailed**^#4 **think**^#5"
