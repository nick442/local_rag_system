>The question is more like, do we want it? I agree that's the issue, and without doing more research, I think it would be a good thing. Currently it makes almost no sense to hire a woman over a man, other things equal, due to pregnancy risk. Reducing some of maternity leave and making some paternity leave mandatory would reduce the disparity between sexes. Obviously women can breast feed and are more crucial to baby rearing than men in most cases, so they should still have more leave time, but men can play a part sometime after pregnancy. Men taking leave currently doesn't make as much sense since they generally make more than women. However making leave mandatory can also help reduce wage disparity (if it exists, which is debated), nonetheless I don't see a way in which it can possible increase disparity. Increasing equality isn't done just for the sake of equality. It is actually beneficial for the economy. Women are probably underutilized in the work force, and eliminating biological differences, makes the other factors much more important for them (intelligence, competence, etc.). In addition, women may focus more on their careers if they know a pregnancy doesn't completely stall them, relative to men, and that they are less expected to be primary children caretakers. This creates a more competitive and productive workforce as a whole. However, making men take time off obviously reduces productivity a certain amount as they can't work, so you would have to weigh the pros and cons here carefully, which would be quite difficult. In addition, it would be quite lame to force a healthy, willing individual to stop working simply because his spouse has a child, even if his spouse wants to be the primary caregiver. That too can be harmful for mens careers and may possibly reduce the birthrate. Imagine a CEO or manager having to take forced paternity leave when his wife has a baby, that can be a career KILLER in upper management.
