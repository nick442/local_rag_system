First of all, thank you for directing me to some supporting material. I read the abstract and I'll dig in to the detail later. The 2012 Colliard & Foucault paper makes a good argument too. Papers like these *are* the kind of thing that convinces me and are very helpful. Second, I agree that humility is needed but I think I was *very* clear in stating that I don't have an authoritative view on the subject. I don't think there's anything wrong with questioning posts from experts if for no other reason than to get more information on the subject, which you've generously provided here and in your other post. Maybe you disagree.
