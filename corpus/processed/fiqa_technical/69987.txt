I'm not exactly sure who's confusing worker/workplace rights with union membership. Safety standards are written into law but there is little else about working conditions that is law in this country (a lot less than most people think, anyways). > I think my primary counterargument is why should a union be a requirement of a living wage and healthcare? It certainly shouldn't be. If the employer is good, then there is no need for a union. > If I work for a small business where unionizing would be MUCH more difficult should I not also have those things? I don't know if unionizing would be more difficult. In some ways it could be easier. If it's a small business problems can generally be resolved by talking to the owner. I think you're missing something though: Being in a union doesn't guarantee you anything. The law says that employers must sit down at a table and negotiate a contract with the union's members, but they don't have to agree to anything. Some unions like for freelance/contract/commission workers offer benefit packages to its members, but that's only because they don't have a consistent employer to bargain benefits with.
