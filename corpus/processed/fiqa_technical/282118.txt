"Oh, in that case - since you backed your wrong opinions based in no part upon facts with even more histrionic horseshit based in no part in reality, I'll go away now with my tail between my legs. I never said ACA was perfect. I said it was a lot closer at first. I haven't been a member of any political party in over 20 years because they're both corrupt as shit. This wasn't defense of Obama. He's no hero to me. But on this issue, the GOP is absolutely far worse. They've lied about it since the 60's when Reagan the actor was telling everyone how communist Medicare was. I spend a lot of time in these nations we're told whose ""socialized"" medicine is failing the people. Get zero of that on the ground in the U.K. Or Germany or any of the others. Loud or long posts don't make you right. Just makes you more wrong."
