I can't wait to see this crash and burn for two reasons: 1. Voters don't want to be taxed to oblivion which is why we vote no every time on an increase in taxes. 2. If the city loses, the case may create a legal stumbling block for civil asset forfeiture. If you want higher taxes, donate your own to the city.. Do with what you got, Seattle.
