"seems like a dumb idea to me. Will these people know what to do with $1000? Will they know best how to invest it or will it be squandered on booze, or just plain living expenses? It might be better spent giving it to them with a string such as ""buy a cow or chickens that can produce"" or seed for a patch of land. I expect some will fall in each of the three catagories. Question now is what will be the distribution?"
