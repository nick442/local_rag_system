Let's change up the factors in this equation. Bruce is a board member of a company providing seed for corn and other crops to farmers all over the nation. John is a candidate, and one of his platforms is to eliminate all agricultural subsidies. Bruce campaigns very vocally for John, and John wins the election. Should Bruce get a bad grade as a board member because of this? To be clear.. we are not talking about a removing him from the board at this point. Just a grade. I don't really see how you don't factor Bruce's support for John into this equation when making the grade.
