Shhh.. I have an idea. Hey let's you and me - the only owners of the public gold mines we don't mine fully to keep prices high - appear to make more gold available by making a swap agreement tied with pricing deals designed to have the affect of keeping prices high. Then maybe the government won't demand the public gold mines back that they only sold to us with the caveat we actually mine them fully.
