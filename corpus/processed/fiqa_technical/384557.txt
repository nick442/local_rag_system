Hospitals (most, I believe) are not allowed to turn away a person with a condition that would qualify as a life threatening emergency. The people without insurance cannot be left for dead, and yet the hospitals have to find a way to pay for their care. I believe there is some ways to get compensation from Medicaid, but this won't fully cover the cost, and hospitals are forced to raise prices on those with insurance. These increased costs are reflected in the prices of health insurance. A single payer system would address that shortfall of our current system, and a another huge cost in our system, the rise in tests, treatments and expensive care for our elderly. Right now huge amounts of money are being spent to extend the lives of the elderly patients by incremental amounts.
