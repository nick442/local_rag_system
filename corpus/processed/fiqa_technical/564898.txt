Your hypothetical money market account parallel basically nails it. You understand exactly how the math works. IRR computes a rate at which your money market account would have to pay interest in order to match whatever investment you are comparing to. That said, there are two major complicating factors to consider: Your hypothetical account would have to not only pay interest, but also lend money, at exactly the IRR rate. In reality of course, it never happens this way. You may be able to lend (invest) at x, but to borrow you're going to have to pay y. IRR simplifies away that issue in order to give us a single number. That number can be very handy for comparison to other competing hypothetical investments, but it does not capture that fundamental issue of lending rate vs. borrowing rate. An IRR calculation assumes implicitly that all cash flows, outgoing and incoming, are known and fixed; that is, risk-free. It makes no allowance whatever for risk, and all investments have some level of risk. Two investments that compute to the same IRR might have hugely different risk around their cashflows, and so not be a close decision at all. To compare those investments, you might go to a measure like RAROC-- risk-adjusted return on capital. But that's much harder, and more subjective, because it requires some numerical measurement of risk.
