lol information overload how about we share some of our frequent reads? i personally read Mike Shedlock's blog for global macro trends, albeit his content is leaning a bit to perma-bear and mercenary traders for trading related contents. I absolutely love their articles on trading systems,mentality etc etc. It played a critical role in building my very own profitable trading system, and forging the trader mindset i have today. I would not have gone far without these guys.
