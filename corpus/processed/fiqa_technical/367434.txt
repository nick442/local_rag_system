"People can pretend that those are the only types that work those jobs, but that is most often not the case. Most of the jobs in this economy are service jobs. Like, 70% are. So, are we to then assume that 70% of people had better just be teenagers who need beer money? (Obviously, this is an oversimplification, but I think the point is clear enough.) It is not as if people pop out a kid and subway suddenly says ""thanks for your service! Please report to a decent job with reasonable pay to start work Monday!"" Those jobs just aren't there. Furthermore, it isn't like Subway or McDonalds or walmart can't afford it, or like their prices would go up significantly to shoulder it. If walmart were to pay a living wage, it would cost their customers an extra cent or two per item. I imagine it would impact each business differently, but paying employees decent wages often proves to be a more cost effective strategy because turnover and customer satisfaction go up- ask shake shack or boloco or in-n-out. Its also better for the economy overall."
