>But that's basically what the military is. One big jobs program The military is one of those peculiar government expenses where, under ideal circumstances (peace), is a waste of societal resources, but in the worse case scenario (being attacked by a foreign power), is an absolute necessity. The US military in particular, is well known for having more spent on it than all of our closest economic competitors combined, albeit with reports that it might not be spent very efficiently. It could be reduced quite a lot without endangering US territorial safety at all, although I'm sure a few well-connected arms manufacturers would complain. Even aside from that, however, I was thinking mainly about the sheer amount of money involved in Quantitative Easing (QE). The big banks received at least hundreds of billions, if not trillions, multiple times. But without increasing economic demand, there is no reason for existing businesses to look for loans, so all that money didn't have anywhere to go except for the increasingly complex financial games that the banks play with each other. Imagine if all that money had simply been used to hire people to work. That's economic stimulus right at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. Those people are much more likely to spend on real things that will create an economic demand.
