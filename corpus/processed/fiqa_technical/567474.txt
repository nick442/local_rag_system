I agree with you. B&M is not going anywhere. People like to see what they are buying. Thats why i never buy shirts online because they might be a bad quality. But to add to the Best Buy roast. When i went to buy my 3ds it took 20 minutes to get help i was planning on leaving. When amazon announced the WF deal many, if not all, retailer's hearts skipped a beat. When i got the bloomberg notification i had to read it 2-3 times to make sure i read it right.
