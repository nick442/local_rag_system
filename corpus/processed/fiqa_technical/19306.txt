"Even if your employer decides not to include the HSA contributions in Box 12, the IRS will still be informed how much went into your HSA when the form 5498-SA gets filed. So you don't need to worry about the IRS; they'll get the information they want. As for you, if you already know how much the ""employer contributions"" (both what the employer contributed and what you contributed through payroll deduction) were, and you know how much you contributed directly, then once you get your form 1099-SA you'll have all the information you need to complete your tax return."
