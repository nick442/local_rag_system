"If your fianc√©e took a title loan out on your truck you won't be able to trade it in for another vehicle until you pay the loan. The dealer will likely take your ""slightly newer"" truck back because you won't be able to produce the title for the trade until the other debt is settled. Title loans are a terrible idea. You should probably try to pay that loan off as quickly as possible regardless, because interest rates are terrible on these loans. I will update this answer if you add details about the circumstances of the current loan on your truck."
