"Yea, I saw that too. It doesn't change the fact that what I quoted is still the current idea of socialism. Edit: also, you realise we're probably the last two people that will ever read these comments, right? You don't have to keep downvoting me just because you disagree. I hope you work through whatever it is that's really weighing on you. Maybe go for a nice long walk through the mountains or something. I know I need to go again soon. Been cooped up for too long recently. For the record, I don't get my political views from 4chan or Fox News. It's kind of lame that you just jumped directly to that. It indicates that your mind has gone way down the ""us vs. them"" tribalism path. I know this kind of went on a tangent. I'm pretty tired. But really, I hope things work out."
