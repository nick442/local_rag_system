Several answers already addressed the issue that you wouldn't want to get into this situation in the first place, but looking forward the problem is that you want to spend 2000, whilst you don't have it (or at least not 3200). Besides finding a way to get more loans/credit than you already have, you can consider whether you could survive without spending the 2k in question.
