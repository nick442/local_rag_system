Okay. The goal should be to avoid taxing those at the lower bracket. So no taxes for those making 30,000 and under. A lower bracket for those making $31,000 to $80,000. Leave in deductions for taxes paid to states. These can be very high and many are taxed twice. Trump's plan removes many deductions used for double taxes. Leave in mortgage interest deduction. It benefits mostly small rental companies and home owner. Get rid of many business deductions. Lower corporate taxes, especially on new businesses. There is a start. You want to have a discussion regarding this.
