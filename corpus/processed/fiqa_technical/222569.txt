Those problems aren't new. AC has been a dump for decades. The problem now is that there are so many other options. A decade ago your only choices on the east coast were AC or a couple Indian casinos. That has all changed. Neighboring Pennsylvania now has 12 new casinos and [quickly blew passed NJ in casino revenue](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/04/27/top-gambling-states/8168681/). Why should the 6 million people around Philadelphia drive an hour to get to AC when they have a comparable option only minutes away?
