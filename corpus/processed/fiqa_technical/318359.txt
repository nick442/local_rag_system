You say that like they won't hide money if we tax them more. We had much higher tax rates from the New Deal to the 80's and that's when we saw the middle class grow. Tax rates go down, money leaves the system, middle class goes away. Automation is destroying more and more jobs and will continue to do so. I'm all for lowering the corporate tax rate to attempt to encourage wage increases. Somehow I doubt it will work. Until it does. Just gotta keep taxing the 0.1% since they have 80% of the wealth.
