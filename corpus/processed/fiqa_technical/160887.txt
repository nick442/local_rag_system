At some point in the past they switched to par-baking, which means the donuts are cooked in a factory, frozen, sent to stores, fried, and glazed. Anyone with taste buds can tell they aren't as good as fresh baked donuts. Tim Horton's switched too, but I've only heard secondhand accounts of the decline in quality. It's obvious when a company does this they don't even care how the food tastes, it's just a cynical attempt to save money with the hope that customers are too dumb to taste the difference.
