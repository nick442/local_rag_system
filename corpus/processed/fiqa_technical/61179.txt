You'd invest through NASDAQ OTC market--I use Vanguard and it allows me to invest through there; I'm sure other online brokers have it too. If you search the companies you'll see the listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ OTC. The prices will be different--just because it goes up in HK doesn't mean it goes up in NASDAQ. There are also a few listed in the US--SINA, Weibo Corp., JD.com. From there, start looking at the major Chinese tech companies to see what they're worth.
