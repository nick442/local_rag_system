"> As for point c if you believe that it is a requirement for companies to pay above welfare levels then campaign for that to become law. This is technically true, but if you believe it is even remotely possible with the current political climate we live in, then this is also incredibly naive. Wal-Mart spends millions and millions in lobbying efforts precisely to stop the kind of laws you're talking about from happening. To solve this at the political level, we'd first need to have a federal government that functioned in the first place. But as long as Republicans filibuster and block *everything and anything* the ""other side"" proposes, we ain't solving even simple matters, much less this one. What we need is for more people to understand what the problem is, the imbalance, the unfairness. This is at the heart of the Occupy movement. But this message is detrimental to the mass media outlets, so that balloon is deflated as soon as it gets too big."
