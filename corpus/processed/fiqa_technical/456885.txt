"I really wish someone would release a similar product to quickbooks, its so SLOW and clunky. Its my number 1 question from my small business IT clients.. ""is there anything out there besides quickbooks?"" I hear freshbooks is good, but everyone is so ingrained in the quickbooks way of doing things it would be a strugle to switch people to a different product."
