So a company can exploit cheap labour overseas, but their cash cannot help pension funds of people from abroad? Multinational Corporations have no national identity. Their profits shouldn't be regarded as being gotten in just one country. If Apple's offshore money gives a guy in Bangladesh a better pension, they can buy a nice Japanese scooter, which in turn allows a Japanese girl to buy an iPod. I'm an idealist, yes. I wish people would stop dividing this world up with fictitious borders and stop with the whole 'us vs them' thing.
