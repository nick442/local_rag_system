Once wealth accumulates in the hands of a few, they're less likely to spend it, as opposed to when there's smaller amounts of wealth in the hands of many. That's one of the primary arguments for more economic equality. You then also have the case of that wealth being used to generate more wealth without really adding anything of value. Employing hedge fund managers, bankers, lawyers, and accountants to manage large amounts of that wealth in order to use it to generate more wealth, sometimes in ways that doesn't benefit society at all, and sometimes even to its detriment (toxic assets, tax evasion, etc). Overall, this has the effect of weakening the economy, at the very least inhibiting its growth, and I don't possibly see how you could argue that a weaker economy benefits *anyone*, especially those in the best position to take advantage of the goods produced by a stronger economy (the wealthy). A stronger economy means more and better goods on the market, that the rich can then benefit from. I don't think the luxury goods market would go anywhere either, and may even allow it to grow because of the people who are just under the wealthiest would get richer with more equality (remember it's only the top 10% who benefit from the current massive inequality).
