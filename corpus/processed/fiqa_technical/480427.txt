Unless you're going to be a quant, you don't need more than basic statistics. With that said, I think it's very valuable to have a good grasp on at least an introductory statistics course. Just having a basic idea how probabilities interact and the notion of sensitivity, confidence intervals etc. are very valuable for understanding model output. The world would be a better place if more people had a rudimentary understanding of probability and statistics.
