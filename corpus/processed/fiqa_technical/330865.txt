"Kek! So no others companies are big enough to take advantage of that? I don't see any other companies mentioned anywhere. Hmmm. It's like they are focusing specifically on Amazon, and don't want you to know about other companies who use this. That's weird! Sounds like they are trying to sell you on Amazon hate! And you're buying it! You aren't even questioning the missing information! Now, I agree that Amazon is definitely getting an advantage here. It may even be unfair, but this article doesn't even provide enough information to determine if the advantage is unfair from a competition perspective, other than being something that bigger companies can take more advantage of. (Wait, isn't ""buy in bulk"" something bigger companies can take advantage of, that smaller companies can't? Oh no! Why aren't we fighting that?) Recognize the lack of information, and avoid the hypocrisy it can cause."
