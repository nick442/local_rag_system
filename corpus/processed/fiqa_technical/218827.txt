Preview of the research paper here: [Long-Term Persistence of Hormonal Adaptations to Weight Loss](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1105816) These findings are very interesting especially considering the hormonal indicators used and the metabolic production and pathway diversity between each. Basically looks (to me) like some kind of long term normalisation failure and considering the differences in the indicators involved would imply a large chunk of our knowledge regarding metabolic regulation in mammals is missing.
