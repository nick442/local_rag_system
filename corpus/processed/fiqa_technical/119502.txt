Agreed. I had a relatively fresh (five years old) Chap. 7 bankruptcy on my record when a potential employer ran a credit check prior to employment. When I signed the form OKing the check, I told them what they'd find and said I was happy to explain it. I wrote a letter, they put it on file for the insurer (I needed to be bonded for this job -- I was co-signing six-figure checks) and it was fine.
