"Although they probably don't help ISIS, it will be interesting to see how Paypal's moral agency holds up to the rigorous whataboutism of the internet - remember a few months ago when the bank USAA pulled advertising from one news channel, then after public outcry, pulled their advertising from multiple channels because it fit the same box of ""not advertising on controversial sources"" ? That said, paypal has always been kind of douchy in regards to servicing its customers properly- holding money, screwing over sellers, black listing users and more- a lot of people probably already have a truly negative opinion of paypal, perhaps this move is designed to earn them some goodwill? If so, I doubt we'll see even application of the original line of thought -- don't want to urk those who you're attempting to pander to."
