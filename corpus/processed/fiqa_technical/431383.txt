That question makes assumptions that don't hold in general As to why to deal with futures: Well, there's just one contract per maturity date, not a whole chain of contracts (options come at different strike prices). That in turn means that all the liquidity is in that one contract and not scattered across the chain. Then, moreover, it depends what underlying contracts you're talking about. Often, especially when dealing with commodities, there is no option chain on the spot product but only options on the futures contracts. In summary, the question is somewhat bogus. Options and futures evolved historically and independently, and were not meant to be substitutable by one another. So their rights and obligations are just a historical by-product and not their defining feature. I suggest you refine it to a specific asset class.
