Paywall. But this is an issue that comes up in many places, including California, where we were recently up to our necks in drought, including the pressure on Nestle. Somewhere, there is a government official that approved this arrangement, just as there was in California. I'm sure elsewhere, as well. And we shouldn't be taking Nestle to task, we should be naming those government officials, and investigating them for corruption, or firing them for incompetency. I can't read this particular article, but I've never seen this addressed in the press. Are there any names mentioned here? In California, likely in Michigan, too, the government does not acknowledge individuals right to resources. We instead use the water supply as fodder for political clout, and give it away 'for jobs' as a favor. Government shouldn't control the water supply. It should be owned by people. Individuals will protect what is theirs in a way government doesn't. Even corporate owners treat what is theirs better that the current model of government leases.
