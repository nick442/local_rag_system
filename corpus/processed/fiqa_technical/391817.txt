A couple of interesting things to note: 1) The estimated impact of 1% higher marginal wealth tax was a 0.035% reduction in economic growth. 2) The study, as far as I can tell, does not adjust for government expenditure. For example, if a government repealed the wealth tax but continued spending the same amount, that is economic stimulus. Its economic impact would not reflect the impact of an increase in the wealth tax and a subsequent increase in government spending.
