I'm referring to yachts in my link. Most of the yachts listed in my link are significantly more valuable than the yacht in the article. Also, just because a $70mm yacht is listed for $40mm, doesn't decrease its running costs by a similar amount. Also, the borrower listed in the article is no longer a billionaire, not by a long shot so my point still stands even at the number you mention.
