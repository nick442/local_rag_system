"I mean ""predestination"" in the context that some people ""have it"" to be entrepreneurs and some people don't. The requirements are for entrepreneurship are intangible - if we knew what they were then we'd be able to follow a checklist when starting a business, no business would ever fail and we'd all be multimillionaires. IMO some people have a ""natural aptitude"" for entrepreneurship - I don't know whether that's born or part of upbringing. But you can often see someone talking about their great idea or their plans for a fledging business and you think ""you don't have a chance, mate"" or ""that's just ridiculous - who'd pay for that?"" (or maybe just ""you've misjudged the market""). These people don't have that natural aptitude, as they prove when they fail. If you're a budding entrepreneur your parents, other members of your family and your friends are *not* qualified to assess your abilities - only other entrepreneurs are. Family and friends just have the wrong biases - if your family tell you that you'll never succeed then you can only prove them wrong by succeeding; if your friends tell you you have a great idea then fear that they may just be saying that to keep the peace and to avoid conflict. Chances are that neither of these two groups have entrepreneurship experience - the same applies to many people here on Reddit ascribing success to luck. If you approach an entrepreneur and tell them about your great idea then they'll be too polite to say ""you're an idiot"", so you have to ask them for their opinion, for mentoring (and then you'll probably have to read between the lines, because people are still too polite). What I'm not seeing is people with nous and who also work hard - I'm not seeing them failing. Not dramatically. The people I see failing there has always been a clue beforehand, I thought ""why the heck are you doing it that way, mate?"""
