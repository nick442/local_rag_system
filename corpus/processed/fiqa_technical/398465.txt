"Makes total sense. My main concern is what the worldwide speech monopolies (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, Reddit) do with their power. I'm not concerned with the likes of Krispy Kreme. I am concerned when there are no alternatives and no competition (monopoly). The speech companies decide what gets seen and who can speak and they're often of the same political bent because they have similar (global) aims..meaning they don't care about the first amendment as long as they make $$ and satisfy the demands of bullies. If some blue-haired twenty something (or some bot) decides they don't like one of my sentences, they can effectively exercise their power and cut me off from the entire world to some non-insignificant extent for life. Sure you could jump to some ""thriving"" platform (that doesn't exist) and talk to a handful of people, but that's quite the restriction considering you previously had access to millions of voices with Twitter. YouTube trending is a good exercise in how brainwashing works. It's the same people every time with their banal opinions. Colbert and Seth Myers and preteens. Colbert is actually famous, so I get why he's trending somewhat..but daily? And Seth Myers? Do people even watch his show or does someone at Google simply want us to see his humourless rants every single day? I'd bet on the latter."
