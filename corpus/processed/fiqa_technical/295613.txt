> To imply a grand conspiracy.. No conspiracy required. All you have to agree with is that having money makes it easier to make money and society will sort itself into classes that become further apart and harder to move between. > How about it is hard work and good parenting? Those are important but exist in both rich and poor areas and it is a simple fact that you would get further with hard work and good parenting in a rich area than in a poor one. I think a good way to describe it is inequality of affluent opportunity and experience.
