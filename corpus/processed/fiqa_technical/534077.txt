I also worked at a place like that, and it *was* very distracting. When an EVP comes to your desk and needs something done and you're lower level, that's A Priority, but if you have other priorities that are on deadline from your more immediate boss, then you're scrambling. it gets old. I was pretty good at it as a lower level employee, but it starts to wear you out and for some people creates resentment. As I moved up to manage others, I tried to shield them from that while also not inhibiting communication. It's a tough balance.
