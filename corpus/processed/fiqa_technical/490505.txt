>I tip for service though. This is the problem. Tipping isn't a _reward for quality_, it's the _base form of compensation a waiter receives_. When you tip poorly for bad service, it's akin to your boss informing you that you're not being paid for your work today because it was sub-par. Or most realistically in restaurants, it's akin to your boss informing that you're not being paid for your work today because Bob down the hall screwed up. Restaurants are setup so that waiters bear the cost of the restaurants mistakes -- unless the customer complains a bunch to get a comped meal (but even in that case, most consumers still punish the waiter through decreased tipping). I agree in increasing the base wage significantly, but I realize that this won't happen in most of the country. (A few blue states already pay waiters minimum wage, but outside of that, most of the country doesn't give a shit).
