Not really. It's going to be a while before a machine can actually prepare food. Cashier(inside, I'm assuming drive through requires a human to do) is only a very small part of what happens in fast food. It's where managers would put people who were lazy at making food and the younger, girls(who may or may not have been fine elsewhere). Most people are preparing food in some way and let me tell you how hard it is to have a machine replace those people. Rushes in fast food are insane and making all the options they have is quite complex for a machine. It's not easy at all and we are quite far away from it.
