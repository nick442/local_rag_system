I'm not really sure yet. I know I'm beginning my upper level finance courses (Corp. Finance & Investments this Autumn) so I am going to try and see what I like. Investments have always attracted me but I have to experience it before I can say what I would like. I'm really open to anything. I know excel quite well (thought of getting Microsoft certified to put on resume) and stats have always been fun for me. I took 2 intro to accounting courses but have forgotten most of the material. Is there any part of accounting you recommend is valuable (auditing, financial acct, reporting & financial statements, etc.; maybe any course suggestions bc I know Ohio State Uni has multiple courses on different acct topics)?
