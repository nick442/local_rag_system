In Keynes' day, money was gold. Convertible at a fixed exchange rate. His recommendation was that the government saved gold in good times, to ensure that it wouldn't run out of gold in the bad times. That particular advice has zero relevance to a government that only borrows its own free-floating currency, as governments do not and can not run out of their own free-floating currency.
