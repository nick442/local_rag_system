It would work if there was a facility in place that made penny payments possible, without getting eaten up in fees. If a news website cost £10/month, I could only justify subscribing to a very small number of sites. Let me read a small introduction, and charge £0.03 for the rest of it and I'd impulse buy it every day of the week. If one person can churn out content that gets 100,000 £0.03 views, that'd easily be a decent amount of money for a month's work.
