> I would need to get all the breaks my employer gets A large part of the discount an employer gets, is due to the number of policy holders they enroll. Most methods of duplicating that have other problems. So forcing everyone into an individual market will end up raising rates on everyone, by removing group discounts. Eventually to the point where no one gets any discount from insurance.
