I haven't really dug into this story. Did he release a public memo, or did he write an internal memo that someone else released? To me, that's a big difference. Anyone should be allowed to voice their concerns and get a fair hearing, and an organization that fires anyone who questions their policies is toxic. The way some stories are written, it sounds as though the VP of Diversity had his head because he dared to question the way she does her job. That's quite a bit different than airing your grievances publicly, though. Frankly, if one of my employees had a viral rant about my company, I'd probably show him the door. It's not about his opinions at that point, it's about the lack of discretion.
