"I hope that finally, for the first time, someone (Corzine) will go to jail for mishandling investments and financial transactions. He invested clients money in something that they did not allow and not allowed by law, and, on top of that, a large amount of money has ""disappeared"". No need for more financial regulation: the old ones, from the 60s and before cover this kind of crime. All the new regulations enacted after Saving & Loans, Enron, Worldcom, AIG/Subprime simply do not work. If someon wants to steal and cheat, they will do it despite the law. Sending them to Jail will have better results!"
