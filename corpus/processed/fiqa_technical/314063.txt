You seem to be deviating from your original point? Energy is built into consumer products, for the most part the transportation portion to market of it is negligible, the plastics cost is virtually nothing today, so I'm not sure the point you're driving at. Your first point seemed to be that reducing energy costs would be a direct benefit to the average civilian, which despite the fact that consumerism is somewhat rampant in the USA it's pretty clear that if people cannot afford to buy consumer items they pull back and focus only on the necessities. So I'm not sure what your point is? Or how you arrived to it? Or if you're just trying to support your original statement rather than accepting that maybe it was in error? You stated that cheaper energy will help to solve income inequality. You've given some reasons, but I don't think any of them really support your statement. Income inequality will not be solved by consumers being able to buy cheaper goods, you cannot infinitely reduce the price of goods until it matches the poorest's wages, that doesn't solve the problem but rather just pronounces it further. The goods are now cheaper for the super-rich, who are now considered wealthier.
