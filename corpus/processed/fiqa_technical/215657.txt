I want to upvote you for following up with links, then that last sentence. A) not everyone on reddit is from the USA. B) not everyone on reddit is boned up on Las Vegas history since 1989. C) not everyone on reddit was even alive to remember the way Vegas was before the mega resort, corporate gambling days. Many people on this thread right now may have actually been born four years AFTER Wynn started his project, yet are old enough now to be going to Vegas. TIL you think everyone on reddit is just like you.
