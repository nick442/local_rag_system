The problem is a mixture of private and public. Either go full public or full private, or the disparate mechanisms of each will clog the other up and it fails. Blaming it on bad faith or incompetence on the part of elected officials is a different problem. An incompetent elected government is a product of an incompetent electorate, so in effect you're blaming yourself for hiring morons. The solution is to elect competent people, and throwing up your hands at the problem is tantamount to saying the human race is damned and there's nothing to be done about it.
