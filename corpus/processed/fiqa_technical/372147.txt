You are being a scumbag steve. While you are in Korea and not Japan, little shits like you are what cause foreigners to get bad treatment by cellphone carriers, landlords, money loaning organizations, etc over here. That is what happens in Japan and I'm sure it's pretty much the same across the sea in Korea. You hurt not just the company but other people. Of course you can't judge all foreigners by what one shitty foreigner does, but this is what happens in homogeneous countries such as South Korea and Japan.
