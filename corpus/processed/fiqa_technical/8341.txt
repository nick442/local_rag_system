I just found this old post. I worked in this field 4 years ago. The information is old. I assume the players are mostly the same. AIR in Boston and EQE in Oakland do the computer modeling for cat bonds and reinsurance. Hedge funds will often hire guys who have worked with the software. Swiss Re is the investment bank for cat bonds. The hedge funds that do cat bonds exclusively are pretty boutiquey. The exception is DE Shaw. Reinsurance is a pretty good entry into cat bonds. just some thoughts. get back to me if you have more questions.
