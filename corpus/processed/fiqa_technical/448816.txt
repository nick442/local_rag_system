Hi there. I think China is recommended for premanufactured products given their GDP output. The specific products may exist in the US too. The key is networking. Starting online retail, you are essentially ecommerce and or sales. There may be people seeking sales reps for their products. You should have a specific business plan targetting the niche you plan to sell and cater to. Thomasnet has US manufacturers. You may have to get clever and work out deals selling manufactured goods but with work it can be done. I personally have seen way too many issues result of dealing with imports and know of many rookie mistakes in business where people have gone this route due to price.
