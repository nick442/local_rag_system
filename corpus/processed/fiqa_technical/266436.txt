The link you posted was also one sided. But you see, this is exactly the problem we've been talking about this whole time. Trumps plan flies in the face of entrentched special interests in the government on both sides of the aisle. These are divisive interests that exist solely within the government, absent the will of the people and against the greater good for our country. These interests and their stakeholders must be excised from power in order for us to MAGA.
