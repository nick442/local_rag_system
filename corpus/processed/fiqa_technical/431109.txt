Yes thats true but I think the point is you have to look at it in context - reduced spending will hurt the economy but you also can't just spend endlessly on credit cards and bank loans either. The point here is it seems like the whole system has hit a wall in terms of further increasing debt levels. I think that while their analysis is overly simplistic, there is a point here in that we do need to cut the debt down.
