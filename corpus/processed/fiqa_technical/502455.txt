> Did, say, running Parallels and then Excel on Windows allow for the Windows shortcuts and features? Yes, except that you don't have certain keys on your keyboard (home, end, page up, page down) and there aren't really excess keys on the minimalist Mac keyboard to remap to those, so your stuck using an awkward combination of Fn + Ctrl + Arrow Key, which I have never found as fluid, or an external keyboard.
