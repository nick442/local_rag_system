Of course. There are many reasons why we want Robots to do work currently done by humans: dangerous jobs, physically difficult jobs, undesirable jobs (e.g. cleaning), etc. But also jobs that people like to do, but robots will be cheaper: painting walls, some yard work, loading/unloading freight, etc. No matter how you look it, the SOLE purpose of robots is to replace humans and their jobs. > I could argue that the new jobs being created--likely as equipment operators--is a higher skill job (than sorting shelves) and will likely pay more. Do you think a robot cannot operate equipment? And if less jobs are available for humans, so more unemployed, do you think they will get paid more?
