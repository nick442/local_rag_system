"I consider myself a fairly successful person, and I think that I've made a lot of good decisions to help me get there. What strikes me is how often, in retrospect, I was making those good decisions based on incorrect or insufficient information. Further, I really had *no way* of knowing at the time that my reasoning was lacking. It would be attribution error to ignore these instances and pretend like I have overwhelmingly good judgment. I've seen other people act on the basis of similarly poor information - when it doesn't work out, the typical reaction is something like ""I feel no sympathy since you made a terrible decision. You should have known better."" Please see any thread on the current student debt crisis, and you will see examples of what I mean. We are all, even the geniuses among us (I do not count myself as one, but I do believe I know a few), fallible. Lewis isn't suggesting we should feel guilty about success, or feel like somehow we don't deserve prosperity. His point is rather that we will never have earned the right to be greedy, that we always have a duty to those less fortunate."
