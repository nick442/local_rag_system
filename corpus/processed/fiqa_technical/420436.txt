"I too received a ""job offer"" from this CENEO outfit but mine was a proof reading position.Supposedly,I was to edit the email they were sending to U.S. customers. They needed proof reading alright,I've never seen such atrocious grammar and syntax.Half the time I could not figure out what these polaks were trying to convey. Anyway,I was getting a whole page to ""proof read"" daily and then, they sent me an email stating that the ""position"" had been eliminated.I never got the money I was owed."
