LET US BET ON IT THEN. IF YOU DON'T BET, ADMIT YOU ARE WRONG OR A COWARD. The terms of the bet are this: All IT employees do not get OT (which you believe because you know the industry and have never met a person who is a counter-example). If this is true, you win, if I can provide a counter-example, I win. How much would you like to wager?
