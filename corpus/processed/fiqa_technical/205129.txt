Lol, sorry buddy. Must be so hard to read that you couldnt even bother to refute anything I said. The never Trump crowd loves to deflect by either defaming character or nitpicking the silliest reasons to argue about instead. You are just another anecdotal experience I have in my life that continues to confirm what I already believe.
