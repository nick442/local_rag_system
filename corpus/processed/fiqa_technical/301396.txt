For public carpark owners, Inugoâ€™s services can bring in more customers and lower operating costs while private carpark owners are provided with a platform to monetize their currently unproductive parking assets. Inugo can be installed on both gated and un-gated sites, and motorists can pay directly through the app, removing the hassle of paper tickets and parking machines.
