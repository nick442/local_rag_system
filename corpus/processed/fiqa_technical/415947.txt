"the whole notion that a central banker must be independent of the government force is fuking insane. No, this is precisely borne out as I posted above by dozens of economies over hundreds of years. [Here is but one study from many](people.ucsc.edu/~walshc/MyPapers/cbi_newpalgrave.pdf) demonstrating this quite clearly. Unless you have some peer reviewed evidence then let's note your opinion as such and move on. Letting politicians dictate monetary policy has been terrible where it has been tried for the reasons I gave above: letting a politician print money makes that politician get votes, but leads to massive inflation and unemployment. Your ignorance of actual evidence and cries to ""Nationalize the FED"" will most likely work out much worse than the current system, as demonstrated many times in research including the above."
