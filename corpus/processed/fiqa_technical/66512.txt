Actually, lab grown meat will be cheaper and more plentiful. To have a cow pregnant, birth, raising the calf, feeding it, cleaning it, butchering it, etc is MUCH MORE COSTLY than meat grown continuously in a clean lab with no disease, butchering, feeding, etc. Actually cows, sheep and goat are a HUUUUGGGGE factor in global warming.
