You don't need to click, I can tell you the answer in one word: **HYPE**. One universal truth about big corporations and their CEOs, they don't understand anything about computers or technology. It simply isn't their expertise. If they hear from the television that the most important thing in the world is blockchains, they're going to bite that hook. The most important thing is not blockchains. blockchains are almost completely unimportant. All a blockchain is, is a log file that never gets trimmed or deleted, and everyone gets a copy, and they verify the contents against each other's copies. It's not revolutionary, and you don't need it.
