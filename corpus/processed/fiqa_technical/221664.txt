"Short answer - matching your firms stock record or box to the records of a depository or fund family. Any differences are referred to as ""breaks"" and need to be resolved promptly otherwise action like covering or moving to suspsense are required. There are rules surrounding suspense, that may be valuable reading. Let me know if you have any specifics or want more detail. I made a few assumptions but that is the broadest view of a firms asset reconciliation (FINRA passed some recent rules that take this even deeper into ""firm"" accounts)."
