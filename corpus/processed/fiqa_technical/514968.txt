You can transfer 401(k) funds from a previous employer to an IRA, and invest it as you wish. That $600 should go to the current 401(k) or IRA. Edit - OP has edited his question. I agree with him that each situation is unique, therefore 100% of the details are needed up front to avoid the answers that would be right for everyone else. He offered a valid reason for rejecting the current advice. There is no solution except to simply withdraw the money. It went in pretax, so taxing on way out is not a penalty. The 10% is the real penalty, and it's $60 in this case.
