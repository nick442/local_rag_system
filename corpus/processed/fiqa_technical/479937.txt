I think your perspective is sadly lacking. I personally know dozens of professionals in their late 20s to early 40s - the majority of whom make well over $100k/year - who consume marijuana regularly. Yet somehow they remain productive members of society who own homes and raise kids just like the millions of Americans who have excellent careers and regularly consume alcohol.
