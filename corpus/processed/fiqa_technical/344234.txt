"Check to see if you can do this at this point. When I was refinancing the mortgage on my last house, I put a sizable ""extra"" chunk down like you're planning to do, but the amount of the loan had already gone through the processing (for lack of a more specific term). My extra money went toward principal, but my payment was still the same as if I hadn't put any extra down. If you find out that it's too far along in the process, not to worry: extra emergency fund isn't a bad thing to have."
