"It's not a fallacy, I'm pointing out you're complaining about housing prices but unwilling to find better ones. As I pointed out (and you ignored) those housing prices are regarding convenience. With a little bit of a drive, you could find ""afforable"" housing instead of renting and voila! nothing to complain about. If you want a better house, then get a better job. It's not rocket science. Someone on minimum wage isn't going to be able to afford a house in downtown DC or surrounding area."
