>It's biggly sad you don't understand human nature. This has nothing to do with human nature, it's about economics. If you are an employer, you do not hire and retain an employee that provides you value that is less than the wage you pay that employee. If you do, it *costs* you money to keep them on payroll. So if you force employers to pay a certain wage, all potential employees that are unskilled/uneducated/lacking experience that do not merit that wage have now been banned from the workforce because the base wage is higher than the work they provide. And the higher you set that base wage, the more people you ban from the work force.
