nope, wouldn't. it's probably true. it would be a stereotype. like saying black people like chicken. is it racism if 98% of my black employees eat chicken every day or talk about how much they love chicken? it's like saying Italian employees are lazy, if I hire 1,000 people and 50% are italian and they're generally always slower than the other 50% how is this racism? if I don't want to hire women between 20-28 because I'd very likely end up having to pay for 12+ month for an employee that isn't at work, is it sexism not to hire? women tend to gossip, that isn't sexism that is a fact. you know it, I know it, your girlfriend knows it, but because it's a public discussion point it is now sexist. I can just say out of my experience the probability that a women brings a bad vibe into the office caused by drama or gossip is incredible higher than a man. am I sexist now? I don't think so, I'd still hire women, I just focus more on specific character features than in the past. similar as googles HR would focus on problem solving skills. I say this out loud because it might be sexist in the public eye but everybody knows it's true in the majority of cases. I have female employees and I value them as much as my male employees. doesn't mean I can randomly hire people.
