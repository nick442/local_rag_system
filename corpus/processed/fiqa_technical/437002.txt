"I am guessing you are being downvoted by people who wish they had two devices. The reason being: When your personal phone is your work phone, you are always on call. Quite frankly, that sucks. Give me two separate phones any day. If people need to contact you during the work day, they call your work line. If people from work need to contact you after work, too bad, that shitty work smartphone ""ran out of power"" around 5pm ;-)"
