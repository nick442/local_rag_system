"A huge problem in the world are naturally born ""leaders"", or people who learned the tricks of being ""leaders"", but should NEVER EVER be leaders to anyone or any company. Bad leadership is rampant everywhere with horrendous and catastrophic results. Am I right? On the other hand fewer people of great wisdom, great intentions, great ideas, great plans are prevented from being leaders. They are the ones who should be leaders. Why is that? Because of centuries of fake ""leaders"" training people that charisma and good presentation skills are a must for a leader. A good example is Steve Jobs. Despite all the ""admiration"" people have for Steve Jobs, he had terrible ideas, was terrible with other people and even his own family, egoist with major failures (Lisa, Next, Newton, original Macintosh) and he caused Apple to fail twice and even lost his control over Apple. The bottom line: Steve Jobs took advantage of Steve Wozniak and the work of many other true innovating and capable people. I have no doubts in mind that if Steve Wozniak and the true people behind the iPhone were put in charge, they would have been better leaders than him."
