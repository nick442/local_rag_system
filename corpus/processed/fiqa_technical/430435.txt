This sounds like a wonderful concept going up (a lower level employee contacting, say, a VP), but it works terribly in reverse. If you were a lower-level worker, do you want to field questions from random managers, directors, VPs and the CEO on something? I worked at a company like that, and it was horrible. It made you stop everything you were doing to answer nonsense questions because the person was too lazy to find something out on their own or through their own normal channels. It intimidates lower-level employees and makes them feel like they have 100 bosses. But then again, Musk's companies are said to have very high-stress, cutthroat cultures, so this would make sense.
