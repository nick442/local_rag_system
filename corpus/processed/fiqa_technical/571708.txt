We were in downtown so we walked most of the time or drove a few times, never took the subway. Nor do I remember any whale tours near the Seattle Aquarium, [Google Maps doesn't list any either](https://goo.gl/maps/6Qi9NgA61au). You're right, I wasn't looking for orcas so I probably just don't remember seeing pictures of them. It was two years ago but I guess the orca references just weren't that memorable. Certainly less so than a visit to SeaWorld for the typical person I would guess.
