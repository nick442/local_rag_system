She almost couldn't work any harder (here's where you suggest she go to school) She's averaged 60 hour weeks. Dunno if dads even alive. She has a right to exercise her ability to reproduce. And you can't claim she's wreckless or decide what she can or even should do. She busts her ass to take care of her family. But because she don't have enough 0s in the bank account, some y'all think she should not have kids. So you want her to find a time machine or what? Not hearing a solution, just typical lazy half assed judgement. Maybe you guys could consider sex education and family planning important to the budget. Maybe not let gas bag Mike pence change sex ed to just 'dont'. If we're talking about this particular poor mother, this is where it could have been done better. But I am making an assumption those children weren't planned. Human rights include reproduction. From my point of view I wouldn't have had two kids either. But she sure as hell shouldn't be cast as a fool for wanting family and valuing it over money.
