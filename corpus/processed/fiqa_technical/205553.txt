"You refer to the rise of ""immigration crimes"" which is pretty much normal considering the masses that came to our country.. you know this is stuff like lying about your age or your reason for seeking refuge or getting a job before being approved. You really should focus on the violent and hard crimes (which rose significantly AGAINST minority's). It says 5 % crimes from Refugees.. which means?? ah you get it."
