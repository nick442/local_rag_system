Is there any restriction to transfer fund from NRO to NRO There are no restrictions on transferring funds from NRO to another NRO account. Is there any tax deduction for that? This would depend on the purpose of the transfer. There is no tax on account of transfer of money. There may be tax to the other NRO account holder.
