Amazon is already experimenting with a private label called Wickedly Prime. It's not that great. Expecting that to disappear if the WFM deal goes through. I'm still waiting for Prime Pantry/Fresh not to seriously suck. Having to pay an extra membership fee on top of my Prime membership for the luxury of being able to get food delivered (and a delivery fee on top of that, mind you) really burns my ass. Not to mention the fact that when I tried Pantry, delivery took two weeks. No thanks.
