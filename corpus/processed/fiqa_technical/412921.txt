"If you take the argument that the larger the purchase, the more important the CEO then you look at the two largest purchases consumers make.. a house and a car. The house we can eliminate because there aren't any CEOs or companies involved.. well, unless you want to look at the banks hosting the mortgages. When it comes to cars I can tell you from my experince that the company or CEO never entered into it. I decided on a make and model based on reliability and price and never once comsidered the company backing it. Turned out to have been a mistake because I bought a Chrysler and most of the local dealers went out of business shortly after I bought it. Car purchases are largely an emotional deal, not an intellectual or financial one. The best brands sell you on what you feel about the brand, not what you know about the brand. Heck, there have been reams and reams written about ""selling the experience"", which is what companies like BMW, Apple and REI all do incredibly well. I think you'd find that if you replaced ""water"" with ""automobile"" you'd get a similar result. Who was the CEO of Chrysler when I bought my car? No freaking clue. At all. I still don't know."
