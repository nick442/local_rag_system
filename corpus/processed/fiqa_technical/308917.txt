Take this from someone who didn't study maths after A-levels (got B - not genius level either) and sat CFA level 1 yesterday.. If you don't pick maths or minor in maths after Sixth-form/High-school, you will regret down the line. It really is a massive differentiator in any finance field you decide to progress onto later in life. If I could go back, I would put my name down for Stat, further maths and anything math-related I could learn even though I might not be able to secure gold-plated grades. The fundamentals of it are far more important than anything you learn in class (if you want to excel in finance, analytics, and even startups), and with strong social skills, you will be a rockstar.
