You would have paid $880.00 plus commission in this case, and made $85 before commissions. How much you would have made on expiration depends on the price that TSLA has on April 1, which hasn't come yet. If it expires worthless, you typically don't pay a commission but you will have lost the full $880. If it expires in the money and you want to exercise it, then you would pay a commission (often different than the commission to buy/sell the option itself) and you would have 100 shares of TSLA. You won't know how much you make or lose in this case until you ultimately sell the shares of TSLA.
