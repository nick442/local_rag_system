You are out of line. Whether I agree or not with the comments to which you responded, I find it hard to believe you are a bastion of kindness when responding with such hostility. Am I to believe you harbor more kindness than the user to whom you responded by calling them an idiot? Furthermore, while accusing them of something of which you have no clue personally? I find your response far more agitating than the comments to which you responded. And please refrain from calling me a racist as you so casually seem to do
