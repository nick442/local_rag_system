Cute little bookstores? I didn't know you had such contempt for them. I guess you've never been to one in your life other than to buy a sugary drink. Joke's on you, it's those drinks and the huge ass they've made in you what now has you strapped to your smelly sweaty chair clicking that filthy mouse with your clammy hands.
