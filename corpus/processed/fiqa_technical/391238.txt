yeah. you're right. actually, it was more like the middle class that ended up being hunted and the small number of elites' advanced brains controlled the workers psychically. now that i think of it, the dog collar metaphor works even better with that story. you just replace the psychic control with nanobots relaying an operators commands directly to the worker's brain.
