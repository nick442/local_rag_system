> I have a hard time swallowing this opinion from somebody who actually thinks startups can or should get into a contract with anybody stipulating continuing employment. Nobody does that. Are you serious? Lots of people do it. In fact, no serious professional freelancer that I know would even consider going into a back-end deal with a startup without some kind of contract in place. Look - going into business with a start-up is not something people do every day. In fact, if you choose it as a career path, you're going to have a pretty shitty time and eat a lot of ramen. There's lots of startups around at every time of the year. I could take on half a dozen spec projects tomorrow if I wanted to. But this isn't how it works. You should ONLY ever get involved with a low-paid startup if you know the people involved and you believe in the project. Because there's every chance you might end up with nothing. But one situation you CAN avoid with a little planning is the investors pulling as soon as the first few bucks roll in and leaving everyone high and dry. Getting a decent ass-covering contract in place is key to working with startups. > Yes, you have to check your wallet and your fingers too whenever you deal with VCs but if you don't think that's the case with almost every deal you make, you are delusional. Who even mentioned dealing with VCs? The OP and the discussion is about dealing with a start-up company. I've never seen VC investors take anything more than a cursory interest into who the founders are employing.
