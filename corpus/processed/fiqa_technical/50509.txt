"Well what you said about money is the reason people say ""things are only worth, what people are willing to pay for them"". There is plenty of economic reasons to for instance conserve coastlines and the environment because deforestation, and coral destruction have negative externalities associated with that have to paid out in the future by who ever suffers from those externalities. However there isn't a market for eco-bonds or a way to value that landmass effectively which is a real issue for ecological conservation. There are people trying to do what and there is an interesting article this week in The New Scientist about such nexus between ecology and economics but while there is clear value somewhere assigning it a price only works if people are willing to buy or invest in it. Its quite sad how many of the critics of modern banking don't really appreciate what they do and what finance does (or more commonly confusion arises about what finance even is, let alone what it does)."
