Unless you have a law degree and a specific contract you can point to, you're just blowing shit out your ass. I think it's a fair assumption that when those contracts in question were created, they walked the legal line and would hold up in the court room. You know, 'cause if i had a few million on the line, I'd probably have a lawyer look at it and maybe even draft it..
