A system comparing students to themselves a year ago is what I think would work best. Therefore you are graded based off the students you have, not the grade you are in. This would mean if I was in 2nd grade and read at a 1st grade level then went to 3rd grade and read at a 4th grade level, then the teacher would receive higher marks. This would of course be averaged out throughout the class with outliers left off (because some students always get A's, and some.. not so much). Its not a perfect system, but its better than saying that the only performance indicators are not touching children and keeping your job long enough to get tenure
