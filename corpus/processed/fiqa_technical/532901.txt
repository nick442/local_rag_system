ya but have you meet regular people? the average person just wants to punch the clock and get a pay check go home pay with the kids and retire someday. its a stretch to think they can even try to keep learning. plus how many over educated people can we as a society even take? look at all those over qualified Italians and French and Germans. i totally agree with what you are saying but we as a society do not even offer enough college courses to let people learn new skills.
