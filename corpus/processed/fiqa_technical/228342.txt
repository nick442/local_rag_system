Right- and that's exactly what Amazon wants. YOUTH. They'll take every last bit of youthful energy and enthusiasm that a recent grad has to offer, use it up, and burn them out. Rinse and repeat. They're a despair factory. Honestly, this is the formula that the average large tech company has mastered. I know they are good experience and it's hard not to recommend them to recent grads, but man the people I knew from there when I lived in Seattle were depressed and demoralized by the experience.
