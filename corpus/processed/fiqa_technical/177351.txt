I think you're jumping to the end. No one knows at this point. This situation needs investigated. They'll either find evidence, or they won't. The courts will proceed as appropriate. This is why the Russia investigation is a good thing. It will either clear everyone of wrongdoing (clearing the way for his agenda), or provide evidence for impeachment. Both are good results. My personal opinion is that there's likely something there (but that's just speculation as you rightly point out). I DO think the investigation needs to be impartial. No putting a thumb on the scale for partisan purposes. It's good that Robert Meuller has a great reputation AND is a lifelong Republican. We should get an honest result.
