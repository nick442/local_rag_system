> It has moved economic resources to where they're most productive, and thereby enabled the economy to grow faster. I don't agree with this. Economic resources aren't moved to where they are the most productive. They are moved to where they will generate the highest short term return. Money flowing into finance and banking doesn't increase productivity.
