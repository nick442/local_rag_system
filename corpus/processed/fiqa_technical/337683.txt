"This is why I don't care about ""sales"" and ""sale price."" My thought process goes ""Compared to everything else I've seen is this a good price?"" for example, a super high quality leather jacket could go for $3-400+ if the sale price on a similar leather jacket of similar quality is $50 I consider that a good price."
