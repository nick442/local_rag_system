"The title of the submission you commented on is ""Antibiotic-Free Meat Business Is Booming, Thanks To Chipotle"". If the first sentence of your comment is ""Simply put this has to stop."" From that, I can only reasonably infer that you think Chipotle needs to stop using antibiotic-free meat, which seems like a strange position."
