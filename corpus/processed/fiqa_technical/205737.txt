In China (Shanghai at least) Burger King is actually really good. Everything is made fresh, they use high grade meat, and keep the place spotless. Most western fast food places in China are a step above the US but Burger King is a few steps. Carl's Jr came here a few years back and they are incredible. They aren't as widespread as Mcdonalds and KFC but the quality is high.
