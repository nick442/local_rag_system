"I'd like to see the network return to at least the ""quality"" it was six-to-eight months ago and then I have to wait and see if they roll out LTE in my market. Essentially, my service is worse than it has ever been and it has kinda sat at that barely usable state for a few months. Luckily, I can get a wifi signal most places so I can survive until December when I'll get a better idea if they are going to ignore my market."
