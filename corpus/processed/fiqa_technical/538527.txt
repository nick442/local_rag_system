I had Amazon Prime for 3 years. And I just stopped it at its renewal at the end of the month. I don't own a Kindle or a Fire Phone or a Fire TV and I feel like all their services are getting geared to the people that do. Android support for instant video? Nope! Chromecast Support for instant video? Nope! They want you to buy their devices in order to take advantage of their features and I think that sucks. Nothing against kindles or Fire Products I'm sure they work great. I just don't have one or know anyone who does.. So why make me buy one in order to use something I'm paying for. That an also the increase from $80 to $100 finally did it for me. I'm not going to lie I'm gonna miss the free 2 day shipping but I guess I'll just have to have order over $35 to place orders from now on.
