blockchain.info has all the most recent stats. 264,360 bitcoins traded in the last 24 hours. About [16.5 Million](http://moderninvestor.io/how-many-bitcoins-have-been-mined/) exist right now. Here is how they make more bitcoins >12.5 [bitcoins per block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) (approximately every ten minutes) until mid 2020,[7] and then afterwards 6.25 bitcoins per block for 4 years until next halving. This halving continues until 2110â€“40, when 21 million bitcoins will have been issued. None of that is really making the price going up. There is not a shortage of bitcoins. There are just more people wanting to buy bitcoin right now then there are people who want to sale. So on the exchanges people keep offering to buy at a higher and higher price. Competing with each other causing the price to go up. It'll probably hit a peak and drop back down to 4k or so. That seems to be the trend with bitcoin. Climb real high, dip down to about halfway up that climb, level off, time goes by, peak again. Repeat.
