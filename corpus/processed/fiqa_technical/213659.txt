What people fail to realize about bitcoin is its cost to acquire a coin. I'm not exactly familiar on pricing nowadays but back when it was $100 a coin it took you ~$95+ in power/equipment to get that coin. Meaning bitcoin can not go below $95. Bitcoin is at $5800. And if its as it were before, it's costing ~$5700ish to obtain, miners are not going to sell their coin for $5600 that cost $5700 to get.
