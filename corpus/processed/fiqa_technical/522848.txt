There's more to owning a car than just the expense. Taxi or Uber isn't a good solution for the end of the night when your date is a little bit drunk and wants to park somewhere and jump in the back seat with you. If you're married and have kids, a car will help you with taking the kids to school or day-care. If you're single with no kids, a car can help you get married and have kids. People in China joke that BMW means Be My Wife.
