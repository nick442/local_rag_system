"http://blog.collegetuitioncompare.com/2015/05/sec-estimated-tuition-2015-2016.html You keep speaking annually. No one gives a fuck about annual costs. You have to earn the entire degree, so the total cost is what I am concerned with, and what I was speaking to. Also - grow up a little. Stop calling yourself a ""major""; maybe ""graduate"" would be more appropriate. The fact that you work in consulting speaks volumes. Everyone else in finance laughs at you. If finance professionals are leeches on industry, you are the parasites on the cocks of leeches. EDIT: Sorry, everyone in **investment** finance laughs at you. I am sure there are some of those aforementioned fund accountants who would love to suck some leech cock."
