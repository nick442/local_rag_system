You think having to pay to get on a road is preferential to the government collecting money and letting anyone use the road? So, I'd have to pay a toll every time I went to the grocery store, or pay for a monthly driving pass? What if a company bought out the company that owned the road to my house and doubled the toll? What it was no longer profitable to maintain the road to my small neighborhood? I'd have to move? That doesn't sound like a good idea *at all*.
