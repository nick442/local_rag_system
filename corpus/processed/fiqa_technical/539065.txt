"That makes complete logical sense, this isn't a shutdown of cryptocurrency however. If you look at Russia, they banned Bitcoin at one point. Now they have said it is not illegal, and are looking to regulate it. It's entirely possible that the law makers don't understand it yet but eventually will. When that time comes rules will come into play possibly/hopefully will benefit the majority. The biggest factor playing against crypto right now is lack of understanding to the majority. Many people don't understand there is no security with an ICO, you have no guarantee of profit. They hear about the gains bitcoin is making and they get excited. There was an ad going around that literally said ""Missed the Bitcoin ICO? Don't miss this one"" or something along those lines. It is feeding off the uninformed. China isn't trying to ban crypto(We're talking about a large group of people), they're preventing ICOs from continuing what they are doing. A lot of ICOs are complete scams/ponzi schemes that benefit a very small percentage. They didn't just ban bitcoin, they banned scamming people. It's better to create a fast ban and change a law later, then to continue to allow people to get screwed while we debate logistics. Banning ICOs in my opinion is a step in the right direction and in no way should be seen as the start of the end."
