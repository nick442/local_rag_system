"E*Trade bank charges $0 for incoming wire transfers ($25 for outgoing). But, its online only bank. Wells Fargo offers free incoming transfers for PMA package accounts. But you'll pay for it in a different way. Bottom line - you have to shop around. Even banks that charge fees - some charge more and some charge less. $20 is on a ""more"" side. Chase, for example, charges $15."
