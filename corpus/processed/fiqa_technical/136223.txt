Eh, to be completely fair to Marissa, she was Google's first Product Manager. The entire point of a PM is that they're the CEO of their product and determine the strategy of the product going forward. Yeah she made a bunch of idiotic moves, but on paper, she was a pretty decent fit and had tons of experience in the same market Yahoo was in, and at an executive level as well.
