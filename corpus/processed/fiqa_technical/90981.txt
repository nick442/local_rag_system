"Yes. This article describes opting-out: http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/overdraft-fees-what-banks-charge/ It is true, I think, that most banks will offer this as a ""courtesy"" by default, but I believe that they must offer an option to opt-out. I checked my bank's webpage, and they explicitly describe how to opt-out by calling a number or visiting a bank branch, but it required digging carefully to find that information. That being said, are you sure that you'd really want to opt-out? The bank can still charge a fee for non-sufficient funds (NSF) and whoever was expecting the payment may also charge you late fees and service fees. It's much better just to make sure that you don't overdraw through careful planning."
