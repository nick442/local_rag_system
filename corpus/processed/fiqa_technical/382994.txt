"I remember, there was time when the phrase ""I want you!"" was uttered, one automatically pictured in their mind, a Stern white bearded Uncle Sam pointing, demanding one to do his duty to nation and country, obviously a call our Draft dodger in Chief chose to ignore, until by some miracle he got elected to collapse America. This is surly karma at work. Today somebody anywhere in this world of 7 odd billion people only has to utter the phrase ""Fucking Moron"" A picture of Trump comes to mind. Well done shit head . .you #MADE AMERICA CRINGE AGAIN"
