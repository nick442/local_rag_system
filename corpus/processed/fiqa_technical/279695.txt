> I'd be happy to look at any entry-level SW engineering resumes for feedback. See, you're already doing this wrong. All your prime candidates already have their resumes out there. It's call github. The fact that you're looking for entry level programmers make this even easier as you can limit your code review to people with time limited commit histories. And, if you're a programmer and you're feeding people like this resumes, you're also doing it wrong. Oh, BTW, you're going to need to either have a good relocation plan or offer 100% remote work.
