You could argue that Nokia was overvalued at the time, but I think you're right. As incompetent as Elop was/is, you have to have many tiers of management making strategic mistakes to explain what happened to Nokia. Their first sin was failing to anticipate how a pocket-computer/smartphone would disrupt the mobile market. Their second sin was failing to respond to the clear evidence that this was happening in 07/08 with the first iPhones - think of how rubbish their Symbian OS continued to be until they adopted Windows Phone. Their third was their failure to accept a future as a mere OEM. Had they started producing flagship android phones, in say 2012, then I believe we wouldn't see Samsung as dominant in the western market as it is now.
