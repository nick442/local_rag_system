"> That's like a palm reader predicting that someone is going to die.Well no shit, I'm sure someone is, somewhere, at some point. So are you saying it's obvious to everyone muni's are on their death bed, and its not about ""will"" they die, but ""when?"" Or are you saying that a total return of 30% over 4 years is bad? Because if you're not saying either of those things then I'm not sure what you disagree with."
