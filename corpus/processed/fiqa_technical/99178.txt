Starvation is a highly disagreeable physical state people are well motivated to avoid. If one finds themselves in that state it is because something, perhaps circumstances, perhaps something else, prevents them from adding value to society. This is not a personal judgement of the individual, its reality. His circumstances add no value to the egg. The egg would provide the same nutrition to the starving man as it would the fed man, and sustain each of them for exactly the same amount of time. The starving mans desire for food does not make him more willing to pay. It makes him willing to pay for smaller quantities of cheaper, poorer quality eggs. The well fed man is able to afford greater quatities and better qualities of egg, thus he is more willing to pay.
