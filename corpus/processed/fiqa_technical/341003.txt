The best way to look at it is this: I would suspect most people would say no. Most people do not have the time, skill, or risk tolerance to be able to leverage capital as large as the value of their own home. Remember that a 15-year fixed has a slightly lower interest rate than a 30-year fixed (difference of 0.5â€“1%). If you won't have the discipline to invest every cent left in your pocket, then you are better off with the 15-year and the lower rate.
