There is no evidence that QE had a negative effect on hedge fund alpha. If you claim, that hedge funds are not able to deliver positive risk adjusted return in up markets - this is wrong assumption. It's been proven, that with the leverage they get, hedge funds can perform better in bullish markets. We recently investigated the performance of 180 Danish funds in the past two decades. We found no evidence that they could outperform their relative benchmarks. Not even that, but we also assumed zero costs for investor, where in reality costs can range from 2 to 5%. Danish funds not only fail in term of positive risk adjusted return, but they also struggle to cover their costs. TL:DR The lover the cost - the higher the return. Evidence says - Go passive!
