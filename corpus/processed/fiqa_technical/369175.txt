">Yes, I have. The public picks up generally, about 75% of the total cost of a major sports complex and in the past 20 years, U.S. cities have spent upwards of $20bn on major venues alone. Shades of *[panem et circenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)*. But it is hardly limited to sports stadiums, this kind of obfuscatory ""taxpayer on the ultimate hook"" financing (aka privatized profits, socialized losses) is being used for a whole host of enterprises (where the enterprise owners are politically-connected, and/or can ""corrupt"" officials with what is, in essence, bribery -- even if not technically straight-forward ""bribes"" that can be prosecuted as such)."
