> your monthly bill Herein lies the confusion that I've witnessed among many commenters, yourself included. This isn't about *your* data. It isn't about *your* outlet. It's about the competing use of fixed infrastructure to deliver data across the country. I use highways as an example because everybody gets those. This isn't about your driveway and its connection to the highway, or even about making sure that anybody can drive up your street and into your driveway. This is about who has the priority to occupy the fixed amount of highway bandwidth that exists. Right now, a company can flood that fixed infrastructure at relatively little marginal cost to themselves. It's akin to a company that sends out so many trucks that at peak times, it occupies 37% of the highway flow (which, by the way, is Netflix's peak bandwidth occupancy). Is that fair? Is it right? Netflix's service is obviously popular; it's normal business to assume that they can shoulder higher costs due to their higher demand. That you may have to pay more for Netflix service is as much a function of *Netflix's business model* as it is of the ISP. Netflix doesn't have to pass its costs on to you; if it chooses to it's on them - not Comcast.
