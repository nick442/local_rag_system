>The majority of what we pay our cable company is wasted. We get broadband Internet from our cable company, and we use that constantly. But we also get 500 channels that we almost never watch, along with a couple (HBO, Tennis Channel) that we pay extra for and do watch occasionally. This is fallacious thinking to assume that less channels would lower your cable bill. The cost of providing you with cable TV is in the fixed costs of running lines to your house and the ongoing cost of fulfilling the SLA, which is a function of how much bandwidth they need to provide you with, not the amount of channels that you watch. Whether 500 people each just pick one channel each to subscribe to, or each of the 500 people splits their time equally between all 500 channels, it costs the cable company the same amount and your bill will stay the same.
