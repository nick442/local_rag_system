The median Fortune 500 company made 10 billion in revenues last year. If the company does 5% better, thats 500 million dollars. If you think the CEO is responsible for only 1% of that, its 5 million dollars. EDIT: You wanted two good reasons. Take a look at what a bad CEO can do at a company -- say, HP -- versus a good one, say, GE or Apple. If you can justify an extremely high salary for the high end, then the next best performers can argue that as well. I think lots of people would be ok with the best CEOs earning the salaries in that top 10 list if the worst CEOs also weren't paid millions.
