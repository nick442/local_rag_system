I totally understand where you come from and what you mean. And yes I would be partnered in this business since I would be the sole (there's only gonna be one) investor. The guy can't keep up demand and he doesn't wanna export is what my friend - his sister - told me so he's looking to find an investor. And I know it isn't free money since technically I would be investing and resorting the benefits of said investment. However, it would be tax-free afaik but even if it weren't I'd still be partnered with him and his business
