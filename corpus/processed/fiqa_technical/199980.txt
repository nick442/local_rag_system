Thats not quite as bad. The execs would get charged individually for dumping the stocks. In Anderson's case, the company itself was facing criminal charges. The worst case for Anderson was a corporate death penalty, being unable to submit financial documents to the SEC. Worst case for Equifax is that they pay out a large settlement and some execs get fired. Its not going to kill the company though. It seems like a very different situation to me. But hey, I bought a few shares when it dropped to 92 bucks, so maybe I am biased.
