Holmes, then Senior Vice-President of the New York Federal Reserve, noted that the key Monetarist policy prescription of regulating the economy by “a regular injection of reserves” was based on “a naïve assumption” about the nature of the money creation process: The idea of a regular injection of reserves—in some approaches at least—also suffers from a naïve assumption that the banking system only expands loans after the System (or market factors) have put reserves in the banking system. **In the real world, banks extend credit, creating deposits in the process, and look for the reserves later**. (Alan R. Holmes, 1969, p. 73) Holmes would turn in his grave at Krugman’s naïve assertion, half a century later, that banks need deposits before they can lend. commercial banks can create money out of thin air: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc_fpGfyqGE&feature=player_detailpage#t=509s http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=UL327SJH0xcew&v=327SJH0xcew&feature=player_detailpage#t=597s
