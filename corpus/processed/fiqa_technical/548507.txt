"> Yes it does and I know it very very well. Are YOU Trump? Jesus Christ, you're seriously trying to argue with me over HOW FUCKING TAXES WORK? Care to explain what ""Prime the pump"" means next, since I'm sure you think you invented it? What kind of idiot goes into an economics subreddit and bullshits about how taxes work, as if everyone here doesn't know you're full of shit? It's clear that you're just a trolling fucking moron at this point. Jesus, man. You really should learn to just shut your fucking mouth if you don't know what you're talking about. You could not be coming off more stupid right now, man."
