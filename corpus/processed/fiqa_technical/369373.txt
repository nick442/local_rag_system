"Siem Reap is easily one of my favorite cities. Most people visiting are coming from either Thailand or Vietnam, where they need to be skeptical of which Tuk Tuk they take. Nobody wants to stop at jewelry shops or a tailor, and many try avoid Tuk Tuks completely if given the option. My advice is to advertise ""no stops"" and start conversation other than saying ""tuk tuk where you go?"". While I didn't see too much of this in Cambodia, you should keep in mind the perception people have of Tuk Tuks coming into Cambodia. People will appreciate the honesty. Good luck!"
