The sooner we get away from oil the better. Drilling and fracking is destroying countless ecosystems not to mention people's lives. When you take into account the disastrous effects it's had on the climate, its pretty much a ticking time bomb for life as we know it.. We as a society need to start voting with our money and moving toward cleaner more sustainable energy and encourage others to abandon the filthy dinosaur that is the oil industry. I have no sympathy for these corrupt oil companies.
