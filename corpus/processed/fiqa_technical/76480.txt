Well, whats the source of income from? Social security? Dividends? At 40k that's the good thing about a progressive tax, you wouldn't be taxed heavily. Even 40k of capital gains, which lets be honest is mostly high income individuals, is barely taxed at a higher level than that 40,000k from a fixed income source. Again, that's the gain (aka profit) one is receiving from selling shares of a company.
