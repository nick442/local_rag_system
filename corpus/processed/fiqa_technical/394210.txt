"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://reason.com/archives/2017/07/11/the-myth-of-technological-unem) reduced by 90%. (I'm a bot) ***** > Isn&#039;t technological unemployment a real and serious problem? Non-economists of a quantitative bent fret about what we&#039;re going to do when all the jobs go away-when, say, autonomous vehicles replace America&#039;s 3.5 million truck drivers. > The gross figure of 1 percent of jobs lost per month is the relevant one for worries about technological unemployment. > One in which all jobs are protected, bureaucrats decide who gets subsidies and who doesn&#039;t, and the economy slides, as France has, into stagnation and high levels of youth unemployment? Or one in which labor laws are flexible, individual workers decide their own futures, and the economy lifts up the poorest among us? ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6mupwx/the_myth_of_technological_unemployment/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~165476 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **job**^#1 **worked**^#2 **know**^#3 **percent**^#4 **unemployment**^#5"
