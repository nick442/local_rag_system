"So, let's get this straight. You didn't bother to read any of those infant-digestible sources so you didn't see that East Asians and Indians test higher than most white ethnicities, and that sub-components of IQ variants vary across ethnicities too. You're also arguing that a single sigma below the mean IQ makes someone ""functionally retarded,"" which yet again showcases your never-ending depths of willful ignorance in this and other psychology/biology/neurology-related subjects. You may be functionally retarded and illiterate to boot, but you don't need to project those insecurities onto whole groups of ethnicities. We noticed those traits of yours well before your word salad deflections arrived at this dramatic climax."
