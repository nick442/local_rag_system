You cannot become a CFA charterholder without job experience (I think it is 5 years in a finance-related job). But typically, for students or recent graduates, passing the Level 1 exam has a lot of value as it signals your interest in the field and shows that you have the work ethic to go through the 1000+ pages of material. The incremental value of Level 2 and Level 3 is not as much, but they still add value. I did a career change into finance and I planned to take the Level 1, but I found that I didn't have the time to apply for jobs and study at the same time. I ended up getting a job without taking the exam. I did end up taking the exam last weekend after I started working at my new job.
