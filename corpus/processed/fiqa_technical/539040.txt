I never said I agreed with you. Nor does your experience line up with almost a decade of my own academic and teaching experience. The higher education system is dysfunctional because it is trying to operate as a feeder institution for an industrial economy when we are clearly in a post-industrial economy that doesn't lend itself well to a 3 or 4 year bachelor program designed to turn people into technical specialists (accountants, engineers, lawyers, etc.). College is absolutely designed to mold people for jobs, why else would businesses provide so many grants and scholarships to business schools? They expect academic institutions to produce workers that are ready to function without any on-the-job training. Speaking from experience working in the consulting industry right now: I think there is a serious problem when liberal arts graduates in a business environment show more aptitude and willingness to learn and prove themselves than individuals who have specifically taken business-centric degrees, yet are constantly unable to think beyond the confines of what they were taught in school and refuse to open themselves up to different ways of thinking. You would not believe how many lawyers and MBAs are unable to express themselves in writing, to the point where clients become upset because they can't understand what they are being told. The basics of education are no longer systematically taught to students.
