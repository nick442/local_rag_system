"> Now Pacquiao is a guy who will be broke very soon, or already is. He fought a no-named boxer with like 17 fights under his belt this past June in Australia (and he lost) to little fan fare. I know nothing about Pacquiao's finances, but Jeff Horn is only ""no-named"" in the sense that for some reason, you chose not to use his name. He had 17 fights under his belt, but was undefeated through them; he's not just some guy that came into the fight fresh off the streets. Further, to suggest there was little fanfare to the fight is plain ridiculous. They fought in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 50k, and outside of each fighter's home country, it was broadcast basically worldwide for free or on cable to stellar ratings. He did lose, albeit through a controversial decision."
