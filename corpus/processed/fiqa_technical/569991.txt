I only wish I did business with WF so I could stop doing business with WF. He is only apologetic because they got caught. There is a history there, and I am sure he will be hiring the next lobbyist that will help him block or eliminate fair banking laws. But I don't trust any of these polished wall street/banking guys. I have no reason to.
