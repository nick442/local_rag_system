Good question! FWIW, I was given a price of about $600 for aftermarket cruise control on a Hyundai Elantra. One problem with trying to get some-but-not-all of the features is that you can't pick and choose -- you have to get the features as part of a package. Cruise was the only thing I really wanted (i.e. would have been willing to pay extra for) from the next-higher trimline, so I decided to drop it. The particular set of features you're looking for means you're going to have to buy some stuff you maybe don't want (alloy wheels or something like that).
