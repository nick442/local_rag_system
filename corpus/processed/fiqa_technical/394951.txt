Big problem in general, employers don't give a shit about you. It's almost like they're pissed at you they have to pay you what they do. Then when you've worked really hard and hoped you proved yourself you get a 15 cent raise. Gee, this whole new 5-10 extra dollars a check? Whatever will I do with that. If you have a problem with the job or the pay there's the door. Hardworking people get cut out because in a free market it's all who you know. You could work a job a year and be up for a promotion, but the boss has this buddy who's looking for a job. Less qualified than you but he takes your promotion and starts the job making more than you all because of who he knows. So basically stop working hard and just try and make friends. It's more worth your effort. Which is why Millenials nowadays are so entitled. They're looking for the first connection to give them a handout so they can be on top. Because they all think it's just a matter of who you know. So maybe stop being that asshole who makes hiring discussions based purely on friendship. It technically has no place in business.
