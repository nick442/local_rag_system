"Its funny how we call them teens, teenagers etc. I fucking hated being called that when I was one. Go to Barnes and noble and there is a ""teen fiction"" section. Must be for 12 years olds or something, so they feel older. The only appropriate time to call a person a teen is in porn, and those bitches are all 22."
