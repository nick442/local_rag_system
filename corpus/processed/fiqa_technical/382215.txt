Buffett says the rich aren't taxed enough after he's already made and paid taxes on his income. The real problem is he can put his fortune in a Trust and avoid the inheritance tax. This puts his $75 billion in a non-taxable trust fund, and instead of $40 billion going to the government to pay for job training for the poor, a program he said he supports, it goes into a non-taxable trust. His kids get to sit on the trust board and draw multi-million dollar salaries for dolling out millions to Asian countries. He's a hypocrite and isn't really interested in helping the country that made him rich.
