"> They would work in any way those who choose to participate will it too work. Again, that is no answer. Saying, ""it will work how everyone decides"" is just sidestepping the issue that your proposal will probably implode due to human nature. Let me make my question more specific. I was asking about military spending with five service providers. If these providers will work as the participants choose then I think it is pretty clear the left and far-left service providers would quickly opt-out of military spending. The libertarian provider would probably quickly follow suit. That would leave you with a country where the right and far-right providers pay for 100% of the national defense. At that point I would expect the right and far-right providers to protest since the other three providers benefit from a military that they don't pay for. Eventually they would cut their defense spending in protest until the left ""pays their fair share"". The left doesn't like the military and would refuse. The US would end up with a weak, underfunded military. Is that how you want your system to work?"
