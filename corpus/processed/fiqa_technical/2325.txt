"Economic hardship is just as misleading as ""economic slavery"". If you are working two jobs and can't afford rent.. How can you better yourself? Sure, if you are exceptionally intelligent and/or charismatic and/or exceptionally great in some other way, you could find a way out of the hole. But if you are working two full-time jobs and are trying your best - that should be enough. I personally am against a $15 minimum wage - even on a local level, much less a state or federal level, but I very much support legislation that ensures someone who works 85 (or 60) hours a week (that's 12 hours a day for 85 hours per week) can get by. By ""getting by"" I mean can rent modest housing, can afford nutritious food, can afford decent health insurance, can buy clothes (maybe second-hand), can put a bit into savings, etc. Minimum wage jobs are done by young people just entering the job market and older people with few skills. Better to have legislation that takes that into account. High school and college kids won't be working 60-85+ hours a week. Save the subsidies for the people that really need them."
