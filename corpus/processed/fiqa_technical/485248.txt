Wells Fargo offers to rollover existing HSA accounts without mentioning the need to be changing plans, jobs, or providers so I don't think you need a life event to make the switch but you can check with your new provider to make sure prior to opening the account. Like most things HSA-related the rules for rollovers are probably similar to the rules for an IRA but once again your best bet is to check with your new provider. HSA Administrators allows you to invest in a large variety of Vanguard funds and were the best I found for investing when I was looking.
