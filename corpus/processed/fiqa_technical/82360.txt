I don't know if all these facts can be attributed to NAFTA but it is hard to escape the feeling that trade agreements hurt US workers. I have no doubt that a companies bottom line benefits from free trade and that consumers get access to cheaper goods- but the well being of the nation as a whole is not necessarily the same as the financial well being of corporations or lower prices for junk. Free trade agreements, without a doubt, have hurt average workers. Whenever economics is discussed it is important to keep in mind that the most economists are valuing these kinds of deals in ways that don't make sense to the average person. No one, for instance, can place a value on the person who lost their job- or how that impacts their family and community. I understand why- those kinds of social costs cannot be measured.
