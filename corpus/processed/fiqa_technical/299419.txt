Becuase it's not redistributing wealth. Redistributing wealth does not require rich people spending money, it requires taking that money and giving it to people with not as much money. That's a huge difference. The effects of each are vastly different. There are different incentives and demands created with each practice, and, ultimately, different societies are created. Giving a man a dollar for a good/service does not have the same consequences of taking the mans dollar and giving it to someone else because you think one deserves it more, based purely on the disparity of wealth.
