So apparently there is a second chart beneath the one I looked at last night with different numbers. In the first one, the top school scored about a 550 and the US about 500 on subjects across the board. I just did a percent change based on that to get 10%. But there is another great statistic Iâ€™d love to look up, where when you control the US for the geographic location, many parts of our country actually deliver among the best in the world (something like number 4).
