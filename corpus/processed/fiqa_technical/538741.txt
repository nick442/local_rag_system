I am aware of that. I assume that the company's weigh the risk of moving losing team merchandise ( at a marked down price by virtue of selling to a company which distributes in third world ) vs the reward of semi-exclusive or perhaps timed exclusive distribution of the winning team's merchandise (which should be in high demand). Edit: I shouldnt specify those markets as third world because that may be a misnomer.
