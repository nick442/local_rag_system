Do you understand why private companies pay for their employees to travel in business or first class? It's because coach class sucks. Coach class gets you there, weary from the trip. It's like taking a bus in a lot of ways. Lots of inconveniences, crammed together with a bunch of people who, if they didn't come in stinking, will be smelly by the time you're at your destination. Are you on a tight timetable? Do you need to catch a red-eye to be somewhere else, and attend a meeting later that morning or afternoon, without time to freshen up? Your associates will be grateful you took a better seat. Is it worth it to the taxpayer to have their employees sharp and ready to work after the trip? I think so. It's not foolish for the public sector to invest in their employees, if we want capable public servants. The cheapest option merely shifts the costs onto the employee, who will return the favor by not being able to do their best work.
