"Your best option right now is to get a lawyer, file suit against your insurance for the full amount (total shown on the collections from the provider, without discounts) plus ""damages"". Include in the damages the cost of your lawyer, time spent resolving this, and any other expenses you have incurred thus far in dealing with this. Your lawyer will be able to give you guidance here. I think you'll find that the insurance company changes their tune once they are served papers."
