Neither does he.. Opinions like that are why people hate the insurance companies. There is absolutely no insurance company who sets out to cover negligence unless it's government mandated.. I'd love to hear examples. And I know there are crazy one off situations, where you can prove me wrong, but no company or industry could survive specifically to cover negligence, if there were, the premiums wouldn't make it logical.
