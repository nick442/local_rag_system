"Here is the way I would estimate your taxes. Remember that a bi-weekly paycheck means that you get 26 paychecks per year. If the $1000 federal refund is too much for you, you can decrease your withholding to bring your refund down. This can be done by increasing your exemptions claimed on your W-4. See ""How can I adjust tax withholding so that I don't get a large Tax Refund?"" for more details. However, keep in mind that your state withholding is perfect right now, and if you increase your exemptions, you will likely owe tax to the state, unless you increase your state withholding at the same time."
