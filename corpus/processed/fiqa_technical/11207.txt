"Fuck Sears and their dogshit customer service. They're putting themselves out of business. [Link to my yelp review](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sears-roebuck-and-co-chicago#hrid:hoxPQTINooxJfZCKC_mtuw) of my latest and LAST experience. Makes me rage too hard to retype it, but tl;dr, they couldn't follow instructions, fucked up the delivery, then wanted to charge me a delivery fee anyway, and had an average of 15-20 minutes hold time for each of three phone calls, and that still wasn't the end of it. Make sure to read all the other ""fine"" reviews on this company's list of fuck ups. Among others on my personal list, delivered the wrong model washer to my parents' house that wouldn't fit, and wanted to schedule a new delivery date (for weeks later), and took 7 weeks to fix a bad PCB on my TV. Go to hell Sears! Bye!"
