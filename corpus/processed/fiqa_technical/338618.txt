So the reason that money disappeared is that someone was charitable? In your example of making 12 non-printed Loddars, the farmer gained meat and the hunter gained shoes, but the shoemaker never got his apples - he just lost shoes. It seems that value never disappeared from the planet. It is just that some got more than some others. So is the reason that countries suffer financial problems the gap between the rich and the poor?
