Ticketfly is the processor for my local place, they book big acts and they are the defacto closest place to go enjoy music. However, a good example would be the time I was purchasing tickets and the tickets were $20 a piece. Two tickets and the service charge was $23 for both. I was paying more for the service charge than what I was paying for hours of entertainment by professional musicians. Now this could just be the douche bag venue pulling this and they are hiding behind the Ticketfly name, that I don't know, just that Ticketmaster does the same shit so why not them to?
