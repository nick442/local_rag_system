"This article is interesting, but deeply biased. The writer manages to write pages and pages on a feature about Charney that only tells Charney's story. He interviews (I think, unless he's always just quoting other sources) a few other folks, but only ones who think he's brilliant and was wronged. It was only in the last 25% (of a very long article) when the author even bothers to reference the criticisms and discussion of sexual harassment and culture of sexualizing women that was part of what started the blowback from customers, and though it says something like ""You can't talk about Charney's story without mentioning the sexuality,"" it seems like an afterthought. Basically, ""a lot of people said Charney was a creep, and some of them sued him, but he says the allegations are false so let's move on."" It wasn't just increasingly uncomfortable ads, it was also people saying they were coerced into those ads, people saying the workplace was almost toxic in it's sexual charge, Charney saying stuff like ""then they shouldn't work here,"" the fact that people working in the stores were rated on their attractiveness and size, that AA wouldn't make or sell clothes past a certain size because he didn't want large people wearing his clothes, the fact that the clothes cost $50 for a tee shirt then fell apart, etc. Charney certainly has his side of things, but I personally think it was irresponsible to write a feature this long without giving more than a paragraph or two of context into why it wasn't just a cruel board doing him wrong, but that even many of his employees and customers turned away from the brand."
