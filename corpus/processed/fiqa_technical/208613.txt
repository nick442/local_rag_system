When I work hard people say “You Should Do That Anyways”, not acknowledging the fact that 9/10 people slack. I think most people who work hard don’t get the credit they deserve. Usually people who are wealthy are born into it, lucky or know the right people and have the right ideas. Hard working people make it too but significantly less people make it from just “hard work”. It all depends on your work ethic and what you’re willing to do in order to achieve your goals and reach your next step. Nice post op.
