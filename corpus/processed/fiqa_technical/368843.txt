So you can earn $60-75 and your BF $55? You are in your 20's (based on your below comment about being 3 years into your career) with a combined income of 6 figures. That's fantastic. No kids, no accumulated cruft and you make a crap ton of money. An average house in the best school district where I live would run you about $300,000. You should be able to afford that, easily, before you are 30. Not sure why you seem to be down on your situation.
