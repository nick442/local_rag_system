Amazon announced this last month. Only at Kohls and Whole Foods. They are the ones who needed this service not Walmart. http://mashable.com/2017/09/20/amazon-returns-kohls/ Walmart returns are pretty easy. Bought some bike tires and rim that were too small, but I tried putting them on anyway. The tire ripped and tubes popped. They asked nothing just took it back I was so glad I didn't have to explain that.
