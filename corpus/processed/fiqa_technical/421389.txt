"People were highly suspicious of stuff like vaccines at first. But that's pretty much standard for the developed world now. If everybody does it, then it will be cheap (mass production). It will probably even be government provided like public education. We have some basic ""enchancements"" like contact lenses and glasses to fix our vision and dental work to fix our teeth. I'm sure many handicapped people would want enhanced arms or legs, whether it is an endoskeleton or engineered muscle or whatever, if it will allow them to walk and use their limbs. And if you think about the amount of pills ordinary people take these days (cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, sexual performance or birth control), we are already getting a lot of chemical enchancements. Life expectancy didn't go up about 20 years for no reason. All natural means having no teeth and dying in your 20s-30s."
