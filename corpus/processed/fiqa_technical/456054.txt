That's unlikely to be a good move. After the penalties, you would have roughly $40k-$45k to apply to your debt. But then what? You'd still have $100k of debt, with no change in your income situation. You would be sacrificing half of your retirement fund to reduce your debt by only a third. Two points from your question are notable. First, you say your current job makes you eligible for loan forgiveness. Second, you say you love what you do. Given that, it sounds like it's likely you'll remain in your current job long enough to have your loan forgiven. I would see this as a major reason to stick it out until that time. It won't be painful from a work perspective, since you like the work (in contrast to someone who grinds through a job they dislike just to have their loan forgiven), but only from a budget perspective. Also, since your income is less than $75k, you may be able to deduct the interest on a student loan payment on your taxes (see Publication 970), softening the blow somewhat. According to your numbers, your loan payment is a bit over 10% of your income. That is not pleasant, but it doesn't seem out of the question that you could make it work through judicious budgeting. It would depend on other aspects of your lifestyle and expenses (which you don't mention in the question, and which might go in a separate question if you start wondering how to do that budgeting).
