I will add: 1. We need a Business Analyst to evaluate this / we need more data / we need more research, etc.. 2. The color, system name, etc are not a good choice and it should be blue / AGURSX system. 3. We need this to meet the deadline of [some made up required date/goal despite the manager having no prior clue about this current proposal] 4. We need changes to meet our limited resources.. 5. I will work on selling it to top management, but I need a simplified description of this. I am in a rush.. but I can easily think of 100 more management tricks..
