"Actually, you started the crime before ""doing [the] mutually volunteer transactions"". You started by violating the terms of the contract which are clearly stated on the coupon: 1 offer per household and no reproduction. You used the same coupon over and over again. That may not be a criminal offense, but the company could still find you liable for it. It's what happens after you do the initial defrauding that'll get you in the biggest trouble."
