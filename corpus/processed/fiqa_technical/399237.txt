Yes and no. Assuming you have a strong password, it is still safe. The added benefit of a salt is to make even simple passwords impractical to crack. However, the fact that unsalted passwords were obtained, there's no harm in changing passwords. Then again, if these passwords were intercepted by something like a man in the middle attack.. changing it now would result in your new password being re-intercepted. Isn't security fun?
