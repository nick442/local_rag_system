What did I miss? Seems like this suit has zero merit, even if the logos are nearly identical, which they're not as far as I can tell? edit: Reminds me of [Lays knocking off the packaging for local Oregon produced Jaunitas](http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-31530-frito-lays-fake-local-tortilla-chips-take-aim-at-oregons-juanitas.html) chips. Nothing like trying to confuse your customers into buying your multinational brand instead of the local mom and pop joint. Seriously fuck Lays.
