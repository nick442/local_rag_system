I've heard all kinds of stories. The internship I ended up with they didn't have a lot for me to do. Others they basically put them to work full-time. Now that I'm working and handling things competently in a private setting, I don't think I'd be open to having an intern just because they are only going to be there briefly and will consume a lot of my time training them.
