"> If a firm is soliciting capital, it's highly suspect, Way too generalizing. It needs to be distinguished that ""if a mega fund"" is ""routinely soliciting"" capital it should be suspect. Funds like Elliott opening up for a 24 hour capital raising once every 5-10 years because Singer thinks an opportunity will present itself to deploy capital in the next year or two is not suspect. Likewise, PM's spinning off from megafunds and trying to raise their first billion AUM after their first seed is locked is not suspect."
