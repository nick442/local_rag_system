Start reading up on what you want to do. Then decide how you are going to get there. CFA/CPA could only help you, same goes for an MBA. How much programming experience do you have? You have a P.h.D in Chemistry. Not too familiar with the field of chemistry, but I'm guessing that it is reasonably quantitative in nature. This demonstrates that you can be taught and can synthesize complex information. A lot of firms look for people like you who can think outside of the proverbial financial box. One to check out is D.E. Shaw. They hire people with obscure backgrounds to work in finance. I bet that most of the people that work there never studied any sort of finance prior to becoming employed there. On another note, consulting may be an interesting may for you to go. You could work in a field (bio/pharma) that requires industry knowledge. You'd be quite valuable to a Deloitte, McKinsey, or something of the like. Best of luck!
