Right now, there are three major cable companies. They are very obviously operating on a gentleman's agreement not to contest each others' territories too much, and using that position to wildly inflate prices. Witness how much headroom the incumbent suddenly finds to cut prices and improve service when Google Fiber comes to town. Large shareholders have outsized influence on the composition of a Board and its agenda, because small shareholders don't organize. Giving 67% of SpinCo to Comcast shareholders means that the kingmakers for the Comcast board will be the kingmakers for the SpinCo board, except that they can't play too rough with the Charter kingmakers. And yes, they could sell their stock, but do you think they will? Right now, it's a three-party agreement between three independent companies. SpinCo will be owned directly by Charter, and by the same people who also own Comcast. It turns the three-party agreement into a two-party agreement, because both of the other two companies will have either the direct or indirect power to make sure that SpinCo doesn't contest territories too much, rather than having to rely on the third company freely agreeing to that arrangement.
