"Taxability depends on residential status when the $ were earned. If it was earned during his status as ""Non-Resident"" in India, then its tax free. If the money was earned when his tax status was resident in India, then its taxable as per the tax bracket. Edit: Taxability does not depend on whether to transfer the money into India, or keep it out of India or bring it as Cash or Electronically. It only depends on NRI status. Of course transferring the funds into NRE makes the paperwork simpler in case there is a scrutiny."
