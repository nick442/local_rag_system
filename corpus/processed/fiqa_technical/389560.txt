How do prices of an apartment/house correlate to prices becoming more manageable in manufactured goods? I could also say that housing is not a good proxy seeing as how prices in housing differ depending on where you live. I can also point out that more is going into buildings like double paned glass and better materials which would also raise prices on your home. Yet a computer is much better than today than 35 years ago, and the exact opposite thing happened. I can also say that there is less timber today than 35 years ago, making the price of wood go up. I can also get into boring things like Bid Rent Theory, but what's the fun in that? Nearly all manufactured goods have gone down in price. Thanks to more open robust trade.
