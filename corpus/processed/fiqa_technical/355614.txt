>Tax benefit of debt The interest on repayments for debt (eg bonds, loans) is tax deductible (as interest expense). The way you figure out the after tax cost of debt is repayment*(1-tax rate). >Marginal tax benefit Just as marginal benefit, this is asking for every ADDITIONAL (ie marginal) dollar of debt, what is my additional tax benefit (tax deduction). Pretty rough explanation, let me know if there is something in particular that doesn't make sense.
