"IANAL (or an accountant), but there is a useful notion of ""technical insolvency"" which you it sounds like you probably meet, and which is a distinct concept from actual insolvency. Couple of choice quotes from that link: If a company (or person) is technically insolvent that merely means that it has a negative net asset value; its liabilities are greater than its assets. The significance of technical insolvency depends on circumstances: it may be an indicator of serious problems that may lead to actual insolvency, or it may be perfectly acceptable. .. A technically insolvent company is free to keep trading as long as the directors reasonably believe that the company will be able to pay its debts, and, again, as long as an upaid creditor does not use the courts to force a liquidation. which is basically what @keshlam's comment on your question is saying."
