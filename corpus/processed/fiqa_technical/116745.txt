Most of that money goes into regulations of and subsidies for the healthcare market which is the reason for the insanely high market prices; they basically suffocated every last bit of competition. 'Welcome to society' isn't exactly a fitting expression.. taxation is justified as long as everyone pays equal rates in exchange for an equal withdrawal of benefits. Everyone profits equally from courts and police. Which is not the case for mandatory public health insurance: you force a minority at gunpoint to pay confiscatory tax rates (that's the only way you will be able to fund it) in order to finance a service they don't profit from at all. It's the exploitation of a minority and nothing else. Same goes for every form of forced redistribution of wealth.
