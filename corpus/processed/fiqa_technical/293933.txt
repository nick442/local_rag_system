Zuck the cuck is the bad guy. He takes basic human instinct and exploits it. People are addicted to that shit like it's heroin. I can't say I'm not the same with Reddit but there's not an update to Reddits privacy policy taking away privacy every 2 weeks. You can talk about something and 10 minutes lateran advertisement pops up in Facebook with the subject you were talking about. He's finding out what people like and dislike so that propaganda can be more effective. If you don't think the government hasn't got a hold of mark zuckerberg and Facebook you're retarded.
