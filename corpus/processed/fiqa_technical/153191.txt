Because interest is tax deductible. I don't know much about the Chevron deal, but I'm an EM debt analyst and typically the issue you have is that dividends are taxed but interest is not. So to move money from a subsidiary instead of putting in equity and getting dividends (tax inefficient), instead you give debt and get interest back. You get a little less flexibility on payment but you more than make up for that (on average) with tax efficiency. Don't think of it as a loan at all. Think of it as a pseudo-equity investment with required dividends. Revenue is not taxed, profit is. Interest comes out of profit, dividends however are issued after profit. This could all be wrong vis-a-vis Chevron. This is just how most of the companies I look at work.
