Wish I could upvote this more than once. I built my company on my integrity and customer service. I have had numerous referrals through a few key elements such as * Showing up to every job ON TIME. you have no idea how much people appreciate it when you say you will be there at 1PM and show up at 12:56PM. * Breaking down what I am doing for the customer so they get a feel for what they are paying for (if they show interest, that is) * Eye contact, body language, and any other way you can exude honesty makes a world of a difference. I happen to be somewhat charming which assists me here, but anyone can do it. I think these points have allow my business to grow faster than expected, and I am in a similar industry (electrical).
