"America just needs to get the cash out. I believe in the power of government to better everyone's lives. But I'm in NZ. Low corruption here with a strong safety net. Universal health care. I have a hospital appointment tomorrow. They are going to fix my chest deformity for free even though technically it's ""cosmetic"". I was earning $50 an hour mowing lawns for 6 years. I did a double degree in the late 90s for about $7k a year. My Asthma medicine costs $5.00. My brother had cancer - treated free (he's fine now). My Mum's heart attack - free (she's all good too). If you start from such a depressed place (believe me I get why Americans feel the way they do) I think you run the risk of ending up in a rather cynical place - government can't help me. You got republicans essentially running on a ticket of ""government doesn't work"" and ensuring it doesn't by their actions. I dunno mate. Keep your chin up. I feel like America is getting close to a real jolt to get it back on track. She's really out of step with other comparable countries. America is still great despite itself. But it'll get back on track. The boomers will die off and progress will become possible again."
