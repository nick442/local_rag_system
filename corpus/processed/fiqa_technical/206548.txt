> There are plenty of reasons to vote against the GOP (as there are many to vote against Obama), but this surly is not one of those reasons. I honestly don't see why not. People vote for/against presidents over dumber things. Laying off Americans is a good enough reason to dislike the guy, and ultimately not vote for him. That's how he made his fortune, there is a price to pay.
