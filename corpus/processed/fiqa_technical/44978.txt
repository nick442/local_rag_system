While I agree with your point that 'we are progressively turning into a low wage country,' the rest of the article is talking about how restaurant and hotel worker positions *aren't* being filled because (presumably, lol) those people who would normally work there are instead finding 'better' jobs. The article is not talking about how those service jobs are good in themselves, but how the availability of them is a good sign 'because of the implication.' But yes, of course we are 'turning into' a low wage country. That's how the system works.
