UK is still in Europe, leaving the union doesn't change that. I would change my original claim that they are doing fine, Italy is improving, but not at a good state yet. They are years away from that. However, you omitted all the great countries that I mentioned doing well. Conclusion? They are individual states, each with their own political systems and leaders.
