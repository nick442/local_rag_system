"We spent a few months on Gail's ""jar system"". It does a really good job of removing impulse buying. The other thing I've found works is to find a way to occupy your time with an inexpensive pastime. In my case programming, building something out of materials I already have in the garage, reading, and even cleaning, etc., are all low cost ways of passing the time without spending a lot of money. If you think about it, shopping is just a form of procrastination."
