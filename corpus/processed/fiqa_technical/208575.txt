If you're a fascist, or some sort of astroturfer then you have to hate anyone who helps the public stand up for themselves. It's hard to see how anybody but the most arch-capitalist billionaire would be against people coming together to enforce what's legally just. I just don't get how a normal human being (potentially effected by things like you listed) could be so anti-lawyer. Doesn't add up.
