"We're talking about two different things. In the start-up world ""exit"" means liquidity event: either an acquisition or IPO. No one ever refers to an exit as being an ""abandon ship!"" moment. But I also somewhat disagree with your thoughts. The most important part about succeeding in business is being in business. Meaning, half the success is just surviving. I've been very close to failing with my company several times, yet it (and me!) are still here. I never give up."
