It lowers the cost of capital. Debt is generally a 'cheaper' form of financing, and in addition you have the benefit of interest being tax deductible. Assume you have no capital to expand an existing business. How do you fund it? You could sell/issue some stock to outside investors for cash (or inject your personal cash into the business if you have it), or you can borrow the money. General the borrowing is 'cheaper' as debt investors need a lower return than equity investors, because debt is less risky (has claims on the business assets before equity holders) than equity.
