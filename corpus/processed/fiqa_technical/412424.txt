">> (NK and Iran with nuclear weapons, both say publicly ""death to America""). > Iran's nuclear facilities are under 24/7 inspections by the US and IAEA. LOL!!! Reminder from history: Bill Clinton signed a contract with NK and even gave them nuclear reactors ""to prevent NK from having nuclear weapons!"". LOL!!! Do I have to explain you what happened few years later on? Then came Obama and did the exact same with Iran. Do you really believe that Iran will not have nuclear weapons? Really? Why did the USA and UN imposed more sanctions on Iran again and again, even recently? Do you believe Iran when it says daily ""death to the USA""? Back to NK: if they even dare to send a missile towards any other country, they will be wiped out from the map, with nuclear weapons you don't even know of."
