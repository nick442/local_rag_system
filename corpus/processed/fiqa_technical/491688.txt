Appreciate the good back and forth. I only did equity for a brief while before I moved to emerging market debt. I can go across capital structure but we don't spend much time on retail outside of China. I think EBITDA or an adjusted NI makes a lot more sense than FCF for Amazon, and nowadays, FCF is ALL that I use for valuation in EM debt world.
