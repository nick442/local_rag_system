"> I think people should prevent themselves from being homeless by developing skills to work. You are right, of course. Let me try to rephrase my question. If someone's problem is that they don't have the skills to work and you put pressure on them, is it not more likely that they will try to resolve the pressure quickly with the skills they have rather than endure the pressure while learning a new skill? For example, if someone is too unreliable to get a job and you tie his next meal to getting and keeping a job, isn't that person much more likely to start stealing food rather than learning to be reliable while being hungry? > Do you think it's moral to steal from someone who worked hard/smart and give it to someone who didn't and is now homeless? I object to the word ""steal"". The bottom line is that some of the hard/smart worker's money is going to go handling the homeless person whether it be feeding him or hiring police to handle the crimes he commits."
