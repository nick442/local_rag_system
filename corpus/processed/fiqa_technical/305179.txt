Since making loans isn't 'casino banking', I'm going to start a small, regional lending institution that just lends money to people to buy homes. I really want to open up home ownership to a larger group of people, maybe those who wouldn't qualify for traditional loans. I'm just not sure whether to call it Washington Federal or Countrywide Financial.
