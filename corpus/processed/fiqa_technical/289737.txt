When has Walmart fairly compensated someone? Edit: The question is do I think Walmart fairly pays their employees. The answer is no, because they don't have health care and they use up government subsidies. Well, do you know how much Walmart would need to raise each product for $12 Min wage. It would cost Walmart to raise there all products by 1.1%. that would be from 2015 min wage of $7.25. Which roughly around 65 in increase wage. So how much would $15 min wage cost in raise prices. It would cost Walmart around 1.3 to 1.4 in product pricing increase. But let's not forget they only have 30,000 of 1.4 million employees have health insurance. Guess where tax dollars are going if they don't have health insurance .. to Obamacare and Medicaid. What even crazier is the purposely make sure to schedule people under 32 or 34 hours week so they are part time so they don't have to provide health insurance. Then employees from Walmart are on welfare costing the taxes payers over $6 billion a year. On average each Walmart superstore that is open cost tax payer $900k to $1.5 million a year. We talk socialism is at the door step of this country but already lives here, it is thanks to Corporation like Walmart. Corporate welfare is okay but asking a company to pull their weight when they cost the tax payer so much damn money is too much to ask for.
