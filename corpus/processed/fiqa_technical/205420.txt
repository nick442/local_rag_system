Keep paying down the bills. Attack them by balance (lowest first) or by interest rate (highest first). Talk to a local chapter of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling to see if they have any ideas. Perhaps you are a candidate for bankruptcy or some other drastic measure if you have a steady living situation and steady employment. (I wouldn't know, but honestly if your score can't get much worse so there isn't much to lose) You are doing the best you can and because you care enough, you will do great and adjust going forward. As a dad myself, don't worry about paying for your kids school or showering them with entertainment. Of course they need some, but time with you and knowing you are always there and stable will mean much more than buying their books. The best gift you can give your kid is a future where they don't have to support you, which is sadly more common than we sometimes think.
