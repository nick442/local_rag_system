"I went through the Costco program for the so-called ""no-hassle"" bargain price when I bought my Prius. According to other Prius owners that I've met on forums and TrueCar's web site, I paid ""average."" Lots of people in my area managed to negotiate a better price by $1-2k. So much for getting a deal. I do not plan to use Costco to buy another vehicle again."
