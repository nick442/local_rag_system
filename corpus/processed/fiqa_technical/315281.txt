"> I think folks aren't reading this right. It's not ""you voted for Trump, which I disagree with."" It's absolutely ""you voted for Trump, which I disagree with."" In fact, it's the more extreme version of ""you voted for Trump, which I _so_ disagree with, I am going to call into question any decision you will make ever."" That's a clear fallacy. You have to judge Tiel on the standards which are relevant to what you are looking for him to do. Tiel is a recognized expert of starting and running businesses. He's _not_ a recognized expert of politics. Being good at running businesses doesn't create the ability to understand politics on a higher level, nor does poor political judgement make him also poor at running businesses."
