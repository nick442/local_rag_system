Typical republican tactics. Let's not focus on the issues and how you're going to fix them, let's just scare people into voting for us. The closer we get to November, the more positive I am Romney's going to lose, and lose badly. And people like this are a prime reason way. Most people aren't nearly as stupid as you think they are.
