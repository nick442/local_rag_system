Just like everyone should be a waiter for 6 months, I feel like everyone should be a manager too. Three women in their mid-20s will always explode into a cloud of drama. Oppositely, 3-4 middle aged men do the exact same fucking thing. People are just clicky and gossipy and shitheads. It definitely seems like girls in their mid twenties are the worst, while guys at 40ish are also the worst.
