Is that what you believe people's choices are in this system? Work for nothing or someone will kill you? The average person here has achieved a higher quality of life because of free market capitalism. Venezuela was starting to move in that direction, until they nationalized everything. Now people have to kill dogs in the street for food. Sounds great..
