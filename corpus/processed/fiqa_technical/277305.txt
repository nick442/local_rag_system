Hah, good luck getting those kind of terms. There's always another fresh-faced new grad with dollar signs in his eyes who doesn't know enough to ask about outstanding shares, dilution, or preferences. Very few startups are looking for penny-ante 'investor' employees who can only put <$100k. That's what co-founders are for. Actual employees are lucky if they can properly value their options, let alone control how much it ends up being worth in the end.
