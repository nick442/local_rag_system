I take some offense to your statement that I'm 'clearly jealous of the rich.' That honestly sounds like a really douchey statement someone out of touch with reality would make.. someone who is either naive, or has had everything handed to them for most of his/her life. I was stating facts, not making some attack on my buddies achievements. I live very comfortably. I just have something called empathy, and I can understand that things aren't as simple as you lay it out for everyone. Even the example you provide is idealistic. That kid had everything fall into order for him, not to mention his situation was ideal. I too had my own business when I was living at my parents and in middle school and high school. I also had my own employees, 8 in fact. In fact, I wrote my college application essay all about it. But you know what? Not everyone has the time, people might have families, mortgages, debt to pay off, and that 'extra time' you speak of after work, that could be spent working a 2nd job, taking care of kids, or hell, relaxing. I know in my present job if I didn't have the time to relax after work I would go insane. You need to understand that your 'solution' isn't an adequate solution for everyone. Even hard working people who pull way more demanding hours than yourself often times cannot afford to pursue the path you suggest. It's also not as simple as having an idea. Idea's are cheap. Execution takes patience, finesse, and lets be honest, a lot of luck.
