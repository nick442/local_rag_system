I was part of a class action against First Tennessee Bank for this same shady shit. Got my check in the mail last week for my portion. $21.12 At one point, they hit me five times for overdraft charges, ($175). No risk for them, charge the fuck out of you on the front end, pay back pennies on the back. It's a win/win for them. I joined a credit union (SkyOne) and love them, will never look back.
