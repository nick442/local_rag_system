> Why shouldn't everyone pay the exact same price for the same services? Because a rich person receives more benefit from government services. A rich person will drive on more roads, be in more hospitals, visit more parks, and use more of the rules and amenities the government provides. A rich person is more likely to call the cops while a poor person is more likely to have the cops called on them.
