Paying extra principal is not a complicated decision. You have a rate, say 5%. And you have an after tax rate, say, 3.75% (if you are in the 25% bracket and it's all deductible) Are you happy to get a 3.75% after tax return? If you have a retirement plan, and are not getting the full company match, that would be the first priority. If you have other debt, say a 10% credit card, that's the next priority. Is the sale soon? If so, I'd imagine you'd prefer to stay liquid, to have the next down payment ready without needing to rent in between.
