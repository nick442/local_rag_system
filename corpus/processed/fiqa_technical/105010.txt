I agree with Chad, seek out a personal counselor before making any huge decisions. I did want to add that if you still want to talk to people about this question try www.stuckinadoorway.org. There you will get other OCD suffers take on this and all sorts of questions. My only advice directly to your question is to make saving as regular and automated as possible. Contribute to any work based savings scheme or have a bank make a regular transfer into a savings account.
