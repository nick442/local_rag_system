And a large part of these kind of phenomenon that we see between the US and Europe just emerge from little initial differences which then carry out and compound themselves over time. For example, in the US, most people get their health insurance from the company they work for, because during WWII, the government obviously instituted a draft. But what is not as obvious, is that to keep wages low to keep the price of goods low, they insituted a wage freeze. The only way companies could compete and incentivize workers was through ancillary benefits. Health insurance being the most appealing.
