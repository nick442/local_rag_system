"I'd love to kmow why your thinking is at it is, given the now documented facts regardless of the failed propaganda, with examples of reasons why Afghanistan needed to be invaded. Saddam was bad, but is he, for example, as bad as Saudi murdering tens of thousands of Yemenis with Us and UK supplied arms? Creating a gigantic cholera epidemic, just as an aside.. Oh, and how did Saddam's WMDs work out for you? Was it lies or just ""crap intelligence""? The same intelligence agencies are ""protecting"" 5 eyes countries now?.... The only way I'll believe international justice exists ([minus Malaysia agreeing the invasion was illegal and Blair and Bush should be tried for war crimes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur_War_Crimes_Commission)), is when Blair and Bush are put before an international and independent tribunal, where the evidence of their crimes is allowed to come out.9"
