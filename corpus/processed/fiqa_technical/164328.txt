Ummm, yeah, if you'd like to explain to me how Google is performing poorly, that'd be great. I'd like to have that in a post by tomorrow. Total revenue has jumped 51% from last year. Just taking a quick look at their financial statements their revenue has increased 1.9 billion from quarter before, to 14.1 billion. Their cash and cash converts are up about 2.5 billion from the quarter before. Finally, their total equity for the company is up about 3.5 billion from the quarter before. Not bad. If you think this is a bad quarter, I'd love to see what their good quarters are. What's weighing them down is the buying of Motorola for 13.5 billion. But think about it, they have revenues of that in just *one* quarter. And even more have enough cash to buy Motorola in *cash* 3 times over and still have some left over.
