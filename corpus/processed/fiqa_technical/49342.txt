I would go android too if there was a nice phone (Xiaomi Mii Mix 2 in small would be neat) and if i could stand android. So, i'm now on a 2012 ipgone 5. Storage is a bit low now and the battery is pretty bad. Not sure what i should use next. Maybe a SE but i really want a display going to the edges.
