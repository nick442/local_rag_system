Section 8 housing, at least these days, is a scam meant to funnel poor and 'undesirables' into shitty areas and shitty housing away from the wealthy affluent areas that have decent jobs and services. Int he 70s people on assistance, which includes lots of minorities, were entering into middle-class or better white neighborhoods and making racists and classists angry. So then they decided people on section 8 were spending too much money on rent and instead moved them to cheaper section 8 housing blocks. Of course areas purposefully concentrated with people all on government assistance would never flourish economically, but it does make the surrounding land cheaper, thus you can build and cram even more section 8 people into that area and get paid by the government to do it. Unsurprisingly, you don't have a flourishing economy in an area mainly composed of poor people with the cheapest and shittiest housing they can legally make. No businesses want to move there so crime rates go up and desirability keeps going down.
