Do you really want to have a pissing contest about the horrible things said in /r/conservatives, /r/politics, etc? From what I can tell the horrible things to common sense ratio is terrible. Not a week goes by where politics doesn't call for killing people who disagree with them or for armed revolution. Going to the political subreddits is misrepresentative. I am talking about what I see leaking into the non-political subreddits. Which somehow garners me downvotes for even mentioning it in lighthearted terms.
