"Often ""resigned suddenly"" means a power struggle with the board in which a CEO was forced out. > In light of Pandit's resignation Chief Operating Officer John P. Havens also submitted his resignation This to me is further evidence that he was actually forced out in a power struggle. The COO had probably sided with Pandit and knew his days were numbered once Pandit was forced out. Otherwise, if it was a happy, orderly transition, there is no reason to think why another important officer would suddenly leave as well. Obviously this is pure speculation, but I would take ""resignation"" with a grain of salt."
