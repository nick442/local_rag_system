My take is there's room for a lot of models on the Internet, just as there is room for nonprofits, for-profit businesses and other types of organizations in the brick and mortar world. The Internet is a flexible medium that can be used a number of ways. The best part of it to me is that people vote by their actions --- if I hate ad-supported sites, I can ignore them. If I'm willing to pay for, say, news, I can do that, too.
