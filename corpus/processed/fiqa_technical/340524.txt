A lot of the greatest innovators in America started out with little or no capital. Thomas Edison once sold newspapers and fruit on a train. Jack Welch was the son of a train conductor who worked his way up the ranks of GE. Steve Jobs was put up for adoption as an infant and was at one point homeless. The idea that the 1% create all of the growth in the economy is a lie. Innovation and thus economic growth can come from any part of American society because it is part of our culture. The question is therefore not an economic one but a moral one. Do we, the citizens of the richest nation in the world, want to watch our fellow countrymen go hungry, homeless or die because they don't have living salaries or access to proper healthcare?
