"Pretty unlikely given that net neutrality has only been in place since 2015. Like I get that people dont like the way it was before and dont want to go back, but its not a change so much as a return to how it always was. Edit: And of course people here just downvote facts without even responding why they are wrong. I dont even oppose net neutrality, Im just saying that to claim that it will ""end the Internet as we know it"" is incredibly dumb, because we didn't even have net neutrality until 2015. This is how we have always known it."
