This is what I, as a Canadian, keep saying. What remains united about the USA? I see is divided ideas, diametrically opposed opinions, voting, spending habits, etc. The opposition to one side's ideas run so deep that families avoid talking about it with the other side, even though they're in the same family. There are certainly differences of opinion in Canada as well, but it seems we still talk enough about most things that we can find some common ground to use moving forward.
