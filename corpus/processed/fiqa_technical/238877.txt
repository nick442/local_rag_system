It isn't the first initiative (see link below) and maybe this one will stick around. Time will be a good test. Here is an article on it.. http://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/020515/how-robinhood-makes-money.asp They plan to make money off unused balances - so they hope to get the masses signed up using the 0$ fees. Also, no type of advanced trading, just limit and market orders. Think of it this way - even if someone puts in 100$ and buys a stock at 88$..that 12$ sits there. Multiply that by say..200,000 accounts and then do a basic 3% return on that. Also, they plan for margin accounts in the future. Time will tell.. sort of like I use Acorn right now (but it charges a fee to invest - a slightly higher than normal one). I signed up for fun and am just letting it ride.
