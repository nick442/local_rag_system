"I have a degree in econ, but that hardly makes me an expert. Here is what I understand well enough to feel comfortable stating: As you increase corporate taxes you decrease incentive for people to invest in corporations. Corporations are really a means of removing risk beyond initial investment to individuals who want to invest. If you were to set the corporate tax rate at 90% (as they do in the link) you would see more alternative investments locally and an incentive to invest where taxation isn't as high. Think of it this way, I could buy stock in apple but the corporate tax rate is 99%, then I would be better off buying a piece of property to rent, or a piece of stock in a country that has a normal corporate tax rate. An exorbitant corporate tax rate would encourage me to take on more personal risk and start my own sole proprietorship.. even if I would be less qualified to do so than those in the corporation. If you want an alternative school of economics to study [Austrian Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School) has a lot to offer. In my opinion the NYT article makes quality points and is economically sound. The ""naturalfinance.net"" article is trash."
