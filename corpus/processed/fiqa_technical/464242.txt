I'm saying that fees from Ticketmaster's competitors are usually only a few dollars less. How can you question the cost of a ticket when you don't know anything about the economics behind it? How much does it cost to advertise a show? How much was the artist's upfront guarantee? How much does the venue require to put on the show? Etc. You don't know any of these numbers for any of the acts you go to see.
