"I've found that once people ""fall in love"" with a home or the idea of a home, there's little chance they will chance course. I'd implore you to do some reading about individuals and families trapped in an underwater mortgage and having lost a job -- now they can't move for work, and they can't refinance or sell. In short, they are trapped and will be foreclosed upon (or, at best, will short-sell). If you want to play knife-catcher (e.g., trying to buy an asset while its value is falling) then at least don't go in blind or kid yourself about the risks. Of course, many folks believe the housing market has bottomed - if that's true then there's no harm in waiting 6 or 12 months and verifying that premise. At most, you'll lose a couple of points in equity. On the other hand, you may well discover that all is not well, and suddenly you can ""afford"" even ""more"" house. It is not hyperbole to say that the housing market in the USA has financially destroyed millions of people -- be careful out there especially as Europe comes unglued."
