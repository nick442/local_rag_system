If someone made their money honestly, who are you to say how they spend it? Their contribution to society was providing exceptional value..they owe no one anything but that. On the other hand, if they made their money like the tool who did the AMA last night, by manipulating government and using their guns to create a monopoly for themselves, fuck them..fuck them indeed.
