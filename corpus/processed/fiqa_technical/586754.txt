"It's always a good time to point out Google is the most arrogant evil Big Brother corporation which has ever existed, and naming their ""parent"" corporation ""Alphabet"" is further proof of that. What you probably didn't know is Google petitioned to eliminate ""Top Level Domains"" from the domain name system (TLDs are .com, .net, .us and so on) so that they could use their money and power to grab the domain name ""search"". Thankfully their efforts were stopped."
