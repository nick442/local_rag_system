> Shitty food is priced cheap Not really --- look at the snack aisle or the canned meat aisle. These things often exceed the price of USDA premium cuts of meat. Spam, for example, is about $9.99 lb. Priced higher than bacon, and ribeye steak. Brand name snack crackers are as expensive as chicken breasts.
