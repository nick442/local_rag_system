"#1 The Affordable Care Act is not a gift to anybody except the insurance and drug industries. It actually saves the federal government and employers money by giving employers a semi credible ""RFOTA"" to lay off or cut the hours for their ""overpaid older workers"" </sarc> For the government money is saved by shifting families and low paid workers out of expensive government programs like SCIP and Medicaid into hugely profitable individual private insurance plans of lower actuarial value. That effectively shifts the burden to the states and sick people. Why no discussion about the earth-changing implications of exponential growth in technology on employment? We need to fund education substantially better or we are soon going to be a nation of largely unemployed people."
