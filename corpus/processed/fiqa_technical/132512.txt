>Most other people would actually get a better deal than me in a private road system. How much of a better deal? Give me some estimates, any numbers at all. Because I can't imagine how a for-profit road can be any cheaper than a not-for-profit road. > I don't think the Federal government should do anything beyond protect your basic rights. Most roads aren't the federal government. In fact very little are. The interstate system makes up like 1% of the roads. Does this mean you're cool with states and counties taking over the road system? >I'd gladly pay more because I'm choosing to pay more than be forced to pay That sounds like an awful way to look at it. You're willing to pay for the privileged of someone else not getting something paid for? I know this is your opinion, but you have to understand why this couldn't possibly be appealing to very many people.
