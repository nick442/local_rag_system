Okay so I have just had a phone call with US Ambassy in CZ and they told me that ESTA is only for business trips without earning any money in US .. So that I will need a US entity (some company/person) to sign some kind of petition for my models before they travel to US and vouch for them .. Is that correct? Anybody knows how much that costs? Also they gave me this website: https://www.uscis.gov/ And said it has to be all arranged in US, that they can't do anything on their CZ part.
