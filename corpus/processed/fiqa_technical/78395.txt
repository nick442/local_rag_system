This is a typical scam. Yes, you just got listed with the terrorists as trying to launder money internationally. Terrorist organizations will try to find someone in the US who will accept deposits from overseas sources then send that money to one of their operatives. Cooperate with whichever police force comes knocking on your door. Pray that it isn't Homeland Security. They do not need warrants.
