"I've only really seen the social network so i'm no expert. Didn't he only get noticed because he made the other website, so in a roundabout way he only get ""lucky"" because he did something out of the normal. If he didn't do that other website he'd never have been noticed, so i guess we need to ask is it luck that he made that website, luck that he was noticed or was there an element to skill. If you want to call it luck then almost everything ever done comes down to luck, lucky my teacher had a good day when they mark exams, luck that i got a question i knew the answer to. What is luck in this sense?"
