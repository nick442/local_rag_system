Research local business grants for your area. I opened my own business after my first year of university and was able to attain a government grant for young business entrepreneurs and some other small grants. The government grant also provided free workshops with other entrepreneurs on properly running a business, how to develop a business plan, tax considerations, etc. Highly recommend a similar program even if you end up just doing an e-commerce website. I recommend making a brief business plan ahead of time though so you have something to show when you go for these grants.
