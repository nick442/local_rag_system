This is a really poorly written article, and since I wasn't familiar with cnsnews.com and their crack shot journalism I looked up some more bits. Here's a [fear piece](http://cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister/765894-hospital-jobs-hang-balance-obamacare-decision) about how if the supreme court fails to find Obamacare unconstitutional then EVERY catholic hospital in the country will have to close its doors. Which is clearly not going to happen and the worst kind of yellow journalism. Nothing to see here but some fear mongering, move along.
