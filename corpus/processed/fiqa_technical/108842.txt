Why the fuck would someone ever, in a million years, go to a place like BWW to watch a sporting event? I'm trying really hard and failing to come up with a reason for it. I know sports bars are a thing, and plenty apparently do okay, but BWW is setup such that you may or may not be able to see a screen and the sit down service means you can't really just park yourself there for a 3+ hour game. It seems like they have a sports bar theme, but you can't legit use it like a sports bar.
