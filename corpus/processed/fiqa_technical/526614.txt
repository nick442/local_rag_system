Society sets the values by which we judge actions. In the US, the choice has been to have business first class citizens, and humans second class. In the US you believe greed is good (and Christian for some bizarre reason) and you distrust your government. In Europe we expect our government to protect us from sociopathic corporations, which are seen as a useful, but problematic, tool. Humans come before businesses. etc. In the US you assign different values than we do in Europe. We optimize for a different goal function.
