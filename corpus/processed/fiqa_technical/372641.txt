My parents hooked up at a highschool party when they were 17. I was born because they most definitely were not careful. That being said, when my mother met my stepdad when I was 3, we lived with him in his mom's house. He had just started as a cop and we were very poor for a very long time. The reason we were so poor was because my dad was investing the majority of his money. Investing in stocks, his pension anything he could. He worked graveyards for years. He eventually got a new job and when he retires in a few years, his pension and a handful of really good investments is going to net him just over a million dollars. So this whole article is kinda bullshit to me.
