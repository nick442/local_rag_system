They *are* expensive. There is, though, a symbiotic relationship between PR firms, news-wires and lazy (understaffed, underfunded) reportage, where they can place stories about you. This can be hard to replicate without the appropriate connections/relationships. For me, it's always been expensive. Results are hit-and-miss depending on lots of things. It's one tool out of many. Choose wisely. (Which doesn't == never)
