On the other hand, I'd be contributing less than with a traditional plan since it is taxed before being invested. You got it backwards. The effective limit is higher for a Roth 401k than a Traditional 401k. The nominal limit is the same -- $17000. But an amount of money in a Roth plan is equivalent to a greater amount of money in a Traditional plan, because money in a Traditional plan is pre-tax that will need to be taxed when taken out, resulting in less post-tax money. Conversely, for a Roth plan, that is post-tax money, which came from a greater amount of pre-tax money; and it won't be taxed again. So it is more money, tax-neutral comparison wise. Of course, since you say that you won't hit the limit, this consideration doesn't matter anyway.
