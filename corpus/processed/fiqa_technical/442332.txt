Yeah, totally. The worst thing about being a programmer is the endless skills treadmill. (Especially if you're involved in anything Microsoftian) There's just constant API and framework churn, usually for very minor if not nonexistent benefits. But the job market harshly judges anyone who doesn't keep hopping onto the latest trend and building up critical 'years of experience' in the latest language or API. Microsoft is also a notoriously unpleasant place to work among the top-tier software companies, thanks to intense politics and their godawful stack ranking system that guarantees good employees will get bad reviews.
