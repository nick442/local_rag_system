Picking up PowerShell couldn't hurt. Lots of cool solutions involve Excel and PowerShell. If you learn R and SQL (both great skills), then Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Access should come pretty easy, I think. Reading a book or two on the Agile software development lifestyle (the best ones are sorry anyway) will help you get past interview questions that measure whether you can work with development teams. Edit: Regarding wasting your time: I haven't personally encountered any Java programming organization where knowing basic Java was of much use outside the programming group. PowerShell, Perl and PHP are all actually used by professionals who do more than just programming. I blame Maven for this trend (programmer humor). Java and CSharp are more likely to be useful if you are seeking a 100% programming role. Any programming language experience is better than no outrushing language experience, of course. :)
