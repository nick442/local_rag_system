There is a big difference between taking no action and providing guidance which is ignored by elected officials. Smart economic policy is not necessarily as palatable as bad policy. The candidate who advocates getting rid of inefficient tax breaks will lose to the one who offers tax cuts. Add to that lobbying money etc. and you get persistent economic inefficiency.
