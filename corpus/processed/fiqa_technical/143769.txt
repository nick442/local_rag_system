All of these big social media companies lie to the users, and folks give them a free pass. Google, FB, Twitter, and of course reddit. Hell.. some folks are 'fans'. The Google fan-base is more rabid than Apple crowd. None of these give a rats ass about any of us as individuals. It's about the bottom line. The buck stops there. If it's not money, it's not in the equation.
