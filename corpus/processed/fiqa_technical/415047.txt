"> Bernie: I could probably live with a percent increase also. Right now, it falls under capital gains, which is 15% for most people, and I think slides up to 20% at the highest brackets. I could live with a couple more percent points added onto it. I am a civilian now, and left the military with no retirement pension. As an owner of a company, I have to build my own retirement just like most civilians nowadays. I am counting on some portion of that retirement to be funded by stock/mutual fund/dividends interest growth. While I would alter my plans slightly if it went from 15% to 20%, I wouldn't have to change my plans. > You are right, there does need to be an enforcement agency, however, I do not believe it has to be government. You are right, it doesn't *have* to be government.. Call it whatever you want, but guess what those people who have to *deal* with that enforcement agency are going to call it.. *government*.. (or ""big brother"" or the ""cops"" or whatever). The point being, at the end of a day doesn't it equate to the same thing? How will this enforcement agency get paid? Are they going to sell tickets? Are they going to make a product or service *outside of enforcement*? Probably not, otherwise they are going to gain a reputation for having a conflict of interest and always have the suspicion of corruption hanging over them. So, then we are back to some form of ""tax"" on the market in order to pay for enforcement.. (And what do we call that ladies and gentlemen?.. A *government*!) > Kansas You dug down into the specifics, which I appreciate. Most people just go: he didn't reduce taxes and spending *enough* and *that* is why it failed. And that is why they are now raising taxes to pay for gaping deficits. Okay, so lets say you are correct about Kansas. Lets do some apples to apples comparisons. Most people say - okay, lets compare Texas and California - our two biggest GDP states. I am fine with that, even though their GDP comes from *very* different sources. CA is a technology state, while TX is an oil state. They both have a little bit of farming on top of that. CA has one of the highest and strictest tax policies of any state in the union. TX is known for being a *business friendly* state and a *tax rebel* (although they surely don't have a zero tax policy, not having an income tax is nice while they have one of the highest real estate taxes of any state). CA currently has a [GDP growth rate of 3%](http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/dec/19/jerry-brown/are-jobs-california-growing-hell-lot-faster-texas/), and has a job growth rate that exceeds the national average. TX is has fallen below the national average on both aspects, mostly because of the oversupply of oil on the global market. And of course TX was one of the top states while oil was up, but still was CA. The point being is that their *very* different tax policies did not make or break their positions. And many would argue that tax policy can help GDP when it builds stability and infrastructure (while states like KS seem to show the opposite to be true). Lets do another comparison, and see if we can get even more apples to apples. Lets find a couple of states the sit right next to each other, have very similar economies and demographics, but very different views on taxes and infrastructure. How about: WI and MN, KS and MI, NH, and ME, and OR and ID. Conservative with very lenient tax policy, an emphasis on freedom and reduced government: WI, KS, ME, and ID. Liberal states with emphasis on infrastructure, and social services: MN, NH, OR, MI. In all of the above examples, the liberal states exceeded the conservative states in job growth, and GDP growth. This doesn't mean the liberal state exceeded the national average - in the KS/MI and MN/WI examples, both states lagged the national average. However, in both examples the liberal state faired better. People could argue it is in-spite of the increased taxes, or they could try to find minute differences in the economies. Those states are pretty close, and yet the liberal states exceeded the conservative states. This can be seen on a global scale as well. It is almost as if people need a safety network, and stability before they are able to produce. It is hard to concentrate on innovation and invention while you are worried about being able to buy groceries, pay for that big surgery, or make sure your kids go to a good school. They have even seen this play out in commercial markets. [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is one of the most successful freeware programs in the world - despite the fact that it pays its ""employees"" absolutely nothing. When they interviewed the participants, they found that the one common thread was basic needs. As long as their basic needs were being met, the most important thing to them was that they were part of something bigger and were contributing to society. > My high school spent tens of thousands of dollars on Macbook Pros and iPads the same year they started having these ""big"" paper shortages. I agree - straight dollars do not equate to good education. After all, we pay more per student that most countries, yet [lag many western nations](https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei/edTool/data/highschool-08.html). I want you to notice something - every one of those nations at the top of the list has a strong *nationalized* school system. Not one of them has a privatized school system as the basis of their education program. Matter of fact, if you look at many of today's most prominent inventions - they have their foundation in government led R&D. Commercial does a great job expanding on government built foundations. Like Elon Musk has done with the space program. It is almost as if people want government, and want it to provide the foundation so that they feel safe building onto that foundation."
