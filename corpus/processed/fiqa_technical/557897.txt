Damn. I was just in AC last Oct for the three Phish shows. Place is a total dump, but Phish always tries it's best to help and bring in a ton of business. Phish, Dave Matthews, and Metallica have all had huge concerts there, but there doesn't seem to be much hope for the city. It's a shame because Boardwalk Hall is one of the best indoor venues I've seen a show in.
