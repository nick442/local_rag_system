"Yes and no. You can not claim the maid service cleaning your ""home"" but you can cleaning your ""office"" or your office's facilities. For example, If you have a mother-in-law suite in the back that you converted to an office, AND you have a maid service cleaning just that, THEN you should be able to claim the expense. Another example would be if you have a room in your house set aside as an office (careful here) AND your maid services charges $20 per room, you should be able to claim that $20. Another example; if you have a maid service that charges you $100 to clean your house, AND you have a dedicated office in that house, THEN you may be claim a portion of your expenses as a business expense. HOWEVER!! This can be very subject to your situation. For example, your much more likely to meet the criteria if you have clients in your office. Much less likely if your the only person using the office. Also you need to be aware that what the IRS allows you to call an office is not as clear cut as it seems. Your best bet is to ask a tax consultant."
