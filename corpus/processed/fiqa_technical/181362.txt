I think that Westerners often overestimate how much influence the West has over developing countries, like those in Africa, and that there are a million other factors that most of the Western public simply doesn't see. Yes, agricultural production has increased significantly because of Western (and Eastern) demand, which calls more children into laboring in those fields, because *that's just how it's always been done* in those cotton-producing countries. Of course, more business also means more income for those farmers, who you can bet your bottom dollar would ask consumers to buy MORE of their cotton, and not less. Higher incomes leads to many other positives for the local and national economy, families, individuals and, yes, those children. That's not to say that schooling wouldn't be preferable to child labor, but (1) that's not ultimately our decision, and (2) that makes a quite questionable assumption that decent, affordable, accessible schooling even exists there. So my assessment is that Western demand for cotton is a positive for the kids in Burkina Faso. What's more, I will guarantee you that even with all the failings and unpleasant parts of the world cotton commodity trade, Burkinabe cotton farmers would agree.
