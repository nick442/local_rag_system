Imagine how out of touch you have to be to say that no one is forced to work there. Not only do you have to ignore a little something called the unemployment rate (after all, you need money to eat and live in capitalist society), but it also requires ignoring what was Wal-Mart's business model for so long: moving into small towns, putting everyone out of business. I suppose maybe some workers could go get jobs in the local prison..
