"> There are way more than ""some successful ones from millions."" Nearly all my close friends are employed professionals (I'm talking about doctors, lawyers, university professors, software developers, business owners, government employees, working artists, you name it) who use marijuana. Same goes for my parents' friends. If anything, they smoke much more than my generation. Yet they all seem to have had decent careers and are now retiring happily. Yeah but they go to work high. The millennial smokers I see often smoke a few times a day. Come to LA where I live and TONS of them have the stupid fake ass marijuana cards. Medical use my ass, loser use is what it should be called. I wouldn't call daily smokers happy or successful. Someone that is happy or successful can unwind without the use of drugs whether its weed or alcohol. > More than half of Americans have used marijuana. If what you were saying were true, there would be a huge underclass of people wasting away in basements, doing nothing more with their lives than eating Pringles and playing video games. But that's just a derisive stereotype that does not represent most people who smoke pot. HAVE used is different than use daily, you do understand that, right? Most aren't successful at all actually. u/garlicdeath has some numbers for us and I'll quote him: ""NPR had a statistic that about 1 in 3 Millenials live at home with their parents, 1 in 3 live with a friend or relative and the rest have their own place or live with their SO"""
