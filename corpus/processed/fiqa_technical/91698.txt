Short answer: Structural decline in banking revenue and margins. Longer answer: A combination of regulation and technology has slowly eroded the profitability of banks, just look at historic ROEs. This has been exacerbated by low interest rates which has compressed banking margins via lower interest revenue, particularly affecting Swiss and German banks. Bottom line, investment banking is not as profitable as it was and is likely to become less profitable going forward.
