I want to be a bit contrarian here. It may be true that to rebuild credit it helps to have credit, but it's not the most important thing. If your description of your wife's history is correct, the most important thing is to fix her tendency to 'spend out of control', especially on get-rich-quick schemes. She may well be on the way to fixing that, but in those circumstances every source of credit is a temptation to spend. Why put that temptation in her way? Whatever tiny postive effect having a credit card has on her credit score will be wiped out if in six months time she suddenly maxes out that card and can't pay it off. I don't want to play credit counsellor, and you should get some professional advice, but her credit score will improve by itself if she takes on no new debt, pays off what she has, and cuts up any credit cards she owns.
