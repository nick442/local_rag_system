"Paraphrased from Economics of Money, Banking and Financial Markets: Money is (1) a medium of exchange, (2) a unit of account, (3) a store of value. To the first point: as Homer Simpson's brain explained to him ""Money can be exchanged for goods and services"". The second: money acts as a measure to keep track of the relative worth of an enormous amount of items. This makes it much simpler than tracking how many apples are worth how many deerhides, and so on and so forth as occurs in barter economies. The last point: money is a terrible store of value. Your money tends to inflate, meaning that its worth decreases over time. I think your explanation went into territory that it didn't need to. Your explanation of the creation of money for example seems to imply that the banking system is not involved in the process of money creation when actually the opposite is true."
