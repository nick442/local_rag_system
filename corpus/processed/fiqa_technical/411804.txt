Yea right! This is some communist propaganda if I have ever seen it! No rational person would ever want someone else to be making decisions as personal as health care for them. Get out of here with these ignorant socialist lies. No questions asked; people want health care decisions to be made between them (the patient) and the doctor, it is a fact. In all practical honesty, no one wants those types of decisions made by some pampered disconnected bureaucrat miles away. Anyone who argues otherwise is not being honest with themselves. The plain reality of health care in America is that it is a protected and dark market where no one actually gets to see the cost of services. All we need legislatures to do is make insurers and health service providers publish price sheets and cost lists to the general public and we all will get to watch costs for everyone across the socioeconomic landscape plummet to unprecedented lows. Fuck the Republicans for letting the insurance companies continue to write these disasters of legislation that they call a repeal bill. Equally, fuck the Democrats for letting the insurance companies give us the complete, failure by design, that is the ACA. Both of these shit-wings embedded with wilful bureaucratic incompetence need to just give us a fucking price listing for services and medications and get the fuck out of our way!
