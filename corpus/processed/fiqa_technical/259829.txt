They're trying to, but ratepayers and state governments are fighting back, especially in progressive states. The big issue is the degree to which you can bank your summer power surplus to offset your winter deficit. You'd think that since you're generating power for the grid in summer you'd get equal credit for that to use in winter when the sun shines less, but power companies do their best to prevent this, so state governments have to mandate it.
