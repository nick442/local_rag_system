I disagree. Sponsorship is the problem, or more specifically where it comes from. With commoditization of advertising, what happens is that any small player with a keyboard can become a news source, lowering the bar on what we consider news (though this goes for all content really). In turn this makes good content providers have far more competition and essentially lowers the bar for all sources, because most people will not pay a premium for great content. In the case of news, how does a news agency with researchers, fact checkers and overhead compete with a guy in his bedroom if clicks and eyeballs are the only source of comparison? The buying of content, or native advertising as its being called, is a direct byproduct of this slippery slope and the ultimate desire of each person or entity to be successful, which in some cases means offering ‘new products’. This is nothing new, but has just grown exponentially as the barriers to entry have all but been removed. At the end of the day this goes back to trust. If consumers put a premium on trusted content and channels because they want something like facts, vs. and echo chamber to reinforce a particular mindset, then it would be a different situation. Regrettably, free is what everyone one wants, but they forget one important thing - if your not paying for something, then your not the consumer, your probably the product. Obviously this in turn means it’s less important to get the reader real content vs. content that will keep them on site just a little longer than their competitors, for which they are rewarded. So going back to the millennials, good for them for apparently being among the first group to collectively realize that they need to question everything and rely on their own research. They are natives of the misinformation age.
