Yup, that's a standard FP&A role alright, coupled with some accounting functions. The good news is, a Senior Financial Analyst role is right around the corner at an organization that will be a lot more fun, with work that's more interesting. Just make sure your next hop is mostly removed from the daily reporting and close processes, and focuses more on modeling and strategy, that's the fun stuff, at least for me.
