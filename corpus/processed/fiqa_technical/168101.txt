If you can afford the payments on a 10-year mortgage for a property, that's an indication that it's very affordable. This assumes that there aren't a ton of hidden costs in this property (which could be why it's going so cheaply). Looking at more expensive houses just because you can afford them is exactly what the lenders want you to do, and it's dangerous. Resist the temptation. If you're happy, you're happy.
