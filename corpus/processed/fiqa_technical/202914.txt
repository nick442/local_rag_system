"> if they believed a doubling of wages would result in greater sales and profitability they would do it in an heartbeat. But it won't. Who said it would increase their profit? Just you, in this red herring. No one is saying that. Raising employees' wages and benefits would a) create happier employees, many of whom might just work harder and better and b) create *very* good PR for Wal-Mart corporate, making many feel better about shopping there and c) those employees wouldn't have to rely on public welfare, benefiting the rest of us greatly. This is really about the utter failure of trickle down: richest company in the world, and why doesn't that trickle down to the employees? Doing the right thing sometimes means delayed gratification, something ""job creators"" simply don't understand."
