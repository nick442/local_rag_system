According to glassdoor and my own recruiting salaries and benefits are quite different. For example, PWC has about 1200 consulting partners and the average compensation is $600k/year. Accenture Director/VPs are nowhere near that. Senior Manager positions at Accenture top out at 175, while the same position at KPMG pays 225-250. People don't choose Accenture over Deloitte/EY/PWC/etc. Most tellingly, the average bill rates at Accenture are quite lower than big4. Public firms cannot compete with private firms in compensation. A final example, Accenture bonuses above $20k are rare for Manager/Senior Managers. At big4 25-40k bonuses were commonplace these past few years, and these were bad years. Oh yeah, vacation at big4 is 6 weeks, Accenture is only 5. Etc. etc.
