"The reason is that GM consistently payed out for many many years. Their grandfathers and fathers worked at GM and got their pension, and they were told it would be the same for them. Very similar to the housing market in fact. When you have been told from birth that something ""just is"" and you see the results for yourself, it is easy to just accept that it will be that way forever. Obviously that is not the case, but I don't put all the blame on those people. I worked in michigan for a bit, and this idea, especially with the auto industry was basically part of the culture."
