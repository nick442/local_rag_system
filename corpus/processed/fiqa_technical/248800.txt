">However, unfortunately, teaching is provided by the government mostly, they pay terrible salaries for teachers and the government would like to cut costs. >So my guess is that there will be a push for less teachers, or ""on-line"" teacher conference-call, and other crap, but they will definitely teach for technology to replace teachers. I think the solution to education lies somewhere in between human interaction and automation. It's a complex problem which need a thorough analysis to figure out the way forward. Our education system is definitely broken and perhaps automation is could be the answer."
