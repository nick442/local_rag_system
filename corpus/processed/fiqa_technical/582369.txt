"Unaddressed pressure? Have you seen any scifi books movies or tv shows from the past 40+ years? It is a very common theme that has been beaten to death. The solution is pretty simple to me, I say ""evolve or don't"". Technological progress is always better than living in the Luddite fear factory. The *real* hard part is going to be deciding which mods are going to give you the best return on investment. I see that as the next step of natural selection. If anything, I think that this progress is going to be what finally unseats the old money families that clog innovation. I really believe that as someone gets more intelligent, they care less about dominating their fellow humans, and care more about growing their surroundings, and seeking beauty rather than destruction."
