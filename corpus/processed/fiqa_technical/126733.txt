Don't order anything deep fried and stop getting a soda - makes most fast food reasonable aside from over-the-top stuff like the Burger King Mac-N-Cheetos. Even a 7-11 hotdog makes a decent meal depending on your nutrition needs. Load it with jalapenos, onions, tomatoes and get an unsweetened drink. Lots of salt and the bun is full of carbs (toss it if you don't need the extra carbs in your diet), but it's my go-to on a hard 40 mile bike ride as I'm usually sweating a lot and need the quick energy.
