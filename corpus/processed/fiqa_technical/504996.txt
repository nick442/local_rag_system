Overvalued does not mean an opportunity to short. As long as a company's earnings are decent and there are limited other opportunities in the market, a stock would stay overvalued. its just that future returns on the stock might be limited. For shorting you need an expected trigger. Say you expect an overvalued company's earnings to decline or significantly miss expectations. This would be a candidate for shorting.
