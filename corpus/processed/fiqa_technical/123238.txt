Everyone complaining about fraud and jail time have no idea what they are talking about. Fraud in a financial sense is very difficult to prove. It is also very expensive to litigate. Furthermore, there is little evidence there was any actual fraud. Rather a number of things just went wrong. At the time, you had the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke and the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson both going on TV saying subprime wasn't an issue and even if it was it wouldn't affect the wider mortgage market. The regulators knew what was going on and did nothing at the time because none of the economic models anyone used showed we would go into recession.
