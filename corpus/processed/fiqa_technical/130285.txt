"Sure, and everything you've said here is absolutely true for a fully immunized portfolio. What the OP suggests is that it's simply impossible to effectively defease future obligations. He is pitching not so much finance as he is a political philosophy that can be summed up by ""defined benefit plans are impediments to competition."" In the OP's world, the business of life and casualty insurance would implode within a few years of inception. Actuarial science would be dismissed as mathematical witchcraft. We would see company after company laid low by overwhelming future obligations against which they have no defense. Rather, what we have are instances of *poor financial management.* As opposed to the fine examples set by insurers, endowments, foundations, etc. (all of which can remain successful ongoing concerns in perpetuity), what we have are businesses who decided that it would be better to cut corners and bet on risk, rather than to take the safer (but more expensive) route and effectively manage their assets in relation to their liabilities. He then goes on to suggest that, in laying off their problems, business are simply ""doing everybody a favor."" These business (and their highly educated financial managers) are taking their flaming piles of shit, handing it over to the guy whose expertise most likely involves the repetitive operation of a machine, and saying ""here you go, this is a good deal for you, enjoy managing your future!"""
