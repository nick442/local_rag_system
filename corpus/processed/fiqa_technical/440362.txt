I started a copy shop in 1996 and found my notebook from that period just the other day. I was OBSESSED with copyright issues and how Kinko's had closed 25% of their stores -- mostly in college towns where they do course packs. Turns out, if you're NOT a multi-million dollar national chain, the book publishers DON'T want anything to do with persecuting you. You're overthinking it IMHO. Talk to an insurance agent and a lawyer and you should be fine.
