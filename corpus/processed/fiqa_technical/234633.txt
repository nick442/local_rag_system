200 years ago, in 1817, in certain free countries, I would try to come with solutions and products that did not exist. For example, in 1817, I would invent the zipper for pants. If I was not such a genius and inventor, I would go to college and be one of the few with a B.A. or B.Sc degree. **Back then, a bachelor degree in any subject would guarantee you a great position in a great company with great income and stability.** (Today, such degrees are worthless - even a Masters degree is nothing much). I would then use my position to get good contacts and start my own business, preferably trading with goods coming from a foreign country.
