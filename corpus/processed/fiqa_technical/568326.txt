It would be interesting to bridge the gap between scientists and practitioners. That said, a daily cadence is way, way too lofty of a goal to start with. Even a weekly newsletter would be pushing it. Professors often have their own publications to deal with, whether it be their own social media, publishing in journals, reviewing/editing others' articles, teaching, etc. In other words, professors are very busy people, and there would be little to no incentive for them to spend their valuable time on an outlet that wouldn't benefit them in some way. That said, start small. Reach out to business professors and see what the interest is like, what they would want out of it (if anything), what medium they would prefer (e.g., blog post, a tweet, podcast), and so forth.
