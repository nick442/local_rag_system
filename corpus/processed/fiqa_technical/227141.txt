While I am sure there are some jobs at Walmart that don't require skills or an advanced degree, there aren't many that require a complete lack of intelligence and initiative. Maybe door greeters. Certainly, there aren't any jobs in the supply chain that would allow for complete lack of intelligence, etc. We are talking about people who operate large, expensive, dangerous power equipment in the warehouses, while also using computer and math skills to compute the amounts received in / packed to ship out, and entering all that into the system, etc. These are not no-brain jobs. At least not if you want to do them correctly and safely. Warehouse jobs aren't minimum wage positions because of the general level of intelligence required to do them well and safely.
