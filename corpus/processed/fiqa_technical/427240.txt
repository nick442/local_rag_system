Because the people who own the machines aren't going to just give their product away for free to the now unemployed. Similarly for those creating food, water, etc. Yes, in the long term all will be at equilibrium as prices come down so that supply can meet demand, but in the short term, there will be a hell of a lot of unemployed unable to afford to live. Why do people always assume technology or some change in the underpinnings of society will make unemployment a non-issue?
