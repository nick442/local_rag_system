"> My issue understanding this is I've been told that banks actually don't hold 10% of the cash and lend the other 90% but instead hold the full 100% in cash and lend 900%. Is this accurate? That's the money multiplier effect being poorly described. You take a loan out, but that loan eventually makes its way to other banks as cash deposits, which then are loaned out, and go to other banks, and loaned, etc., so that the economy is ""running"" on 10x cash, where 1x is in physical cash, and the other 9x is in this deposit-loan-deposit phenomenon. > The issue I see with it is that it becomes exponential growth that is uncapped. Not true. If there is $1B outstanding ""physical"" cash (the money supply) with a 10% reserve, then the maximum amount of ""money"" flowing through is $1B / 10% = $10B. This assumes EVERYTHING legally possible is loaned out or saved in the banking system. As such, it represents a cap. If you have an Excel spreadsheet handy, you can easily model this out in four columns. Label the first row as follows: Deposit, Reserve, Cash Reserve, Loan Amount A2 will be your money supply. For simplicity, put $100. B2, your reserve column, will be 10%. C2 should be =A2 * B2, which will be the cash reserve in the bank. D2 should be A2 - C2, which is the new loan amount extended. A3 should be = D2, as the loans extended from the last step become deposits in the next. B3 = B2. Now, drag the formulas down, say, 500 rows. If you then sum the ""deposits"" column, it'll total $1,000. The cash reserve will total $100, and the loan amount will be $900. Thus, there is a cap."
