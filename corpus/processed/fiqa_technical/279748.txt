I don't believe this. Really, if you have the drive and motivation in this country, you really can do anything you want. Sure, the mold says that you need a 4.0 gpa from Harvard and an MBA from Wharton.. but that doesn't mean that its for everyone. Employers value determination more than anything, so if you really want a job, you *will* find a way to get it; most of the time, the only thing holding us back is ourselves. Sounds corny as shit i know, but its true. If you bang on every door, network with every hiring manager, you will get a job. and if for some reason they turn you down, you can still start your own business. **tl;dr no.**
