> Which is why you'll essentially never find anybody running less than $10m, and usually more than that. 1) You have to get started somewhere. 2) If you're already trading your own account, why not spend 5k or so to start a hedge fund and earn additional money managing other people's money too? 3) It seems to me you are only looking at normal hedge funds and not considering the thousands of micro sized hedge funds which largely go un-reported on. Even those do indeed typically start with 500k-5 mil, but to suggest that I can't start one with 100-150k is simply nonsense. I did, and anyone else can too if they go through the proper paperwork (management LLC, fund LP, memorandum of offering written up, etc), and get the proper NASD licensing. BTW, now that I think about it more, I think mine was 150k, not 100k. Never-the-less, it was certainly one of the smallest ever.
