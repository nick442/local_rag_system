"Disagree, there's a reason why econ profs do not tell people to read ""Wealth of Nations"". It's long-winded, not easily digestible, is mostly commentary on the current political climate of his day, and a lot of progress has been made in the last 150 years; you can get a much better understanding of economic theory in about 10 pgs from any modern book, specifically the Varian textbook used by almost every university in the US. Your advice is akin to telling someone to go read Euclid's ""Elements"" if they want to understand geometry."
