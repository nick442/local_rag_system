Sensationalist title. It makes it sound like the CEO was given $260 million to leave his job which is not true. From the article: >Citigroup will have paid him about $261 million in the five years since he became CEO, including his compensation and about $165 million for buying his Old Lane Partners LP hedge fund in 2007 in a deal that led to his becoming CEO. He sold his hedge fund for $165 million and made the rest in compensation over 5 years. No evidence of anything given to him for leaving. Secondly, he was crowned the CEO of Citigroup in the midst of the 2007-08 market crash when Citi stock was already in free fall. It's misleading to suggest that he was somehow responsible for the bank losing 88% of its value.
