First I would be very careful using a short ETF. There could be some serious tracking error, especially if its levered. Second, when it comes to forex you are in the world of PIPS and high leverage. You would need to have significant capital to be able to hold out the swings as banks do their interventions. Plenty of people have been short waiting, and waiting, and waiting, unless you think you know something the market doesn't this seems like a pretty high risk strategy. I'd suggest buying options instead, but they will be expensive given the volatility.
