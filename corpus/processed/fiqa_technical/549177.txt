Gary, Indiana made a bid including buying ads in the Washington Post. They’d do anything for it. They’d demo half the city and give them the airport. Not that I blame them. It’s a city built for 200,000 steel workers and executives, occupied by 70,000 people with minimal skills and education. The one time Murder Capital of the US still carries a stigma. When you can buy houses for hundreds of dollars, the property tax rolls don’t look good.
