If you're being sued, unless it's small claims court, you need a lawyer. And if/after there's a judgement against you and you want to explore bankruptcy as an option, you'll still need an attorney. Depending on details, your assets may not be protected from the judgement. So any way you look at it, you need a lawyer.
