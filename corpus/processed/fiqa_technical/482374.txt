I'm simply pointing out the irony of this article. They pay 7.1 billion to the government, then the government gives 2.66 to its employees. So, isn't Walmart paying their employees indirectly? Doesn't the amount they pay to the government more than double the amount the government pays out? The point of the article is that employee benefits are being paid by the taxpayers, making walmart the great satan. This would be true if Walmart paid no taxes. this argument (taxpayers pay walmart employees benefits) outlined by the dailykos is invalid from the start. Mic drop.
