That Chevy Bolt will never improve from what it is when you drive it off the lot. It's never going to get self-driving capabilities or any software improvements to improve the efficiency of the car. Tesla cars improve over time. They get additional features in the years that follow. A Chevy is what it is and that's all it'll ever be.
