Enough. Please God enough. The 1% is not some omniscient group meeting in some lair somewhere. They don't all wear monocles and hang around to scheme and deal in back rooms. Enough. They are just people making $800,000 or more. Surgeons, financiers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, etc. I understand this argument and its importance, and completely agree that something isn't right here, but Jesus Christ stop personifying the 1% as some sort of scheming group of evil masterminds bent on world destruction.
