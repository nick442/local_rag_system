>The problem is that there is not ENOUGH demand to employ a sufficient percentage of the workforce. The other problem is that we have a system in which large portions of the population fall into destitution or poverty if we don't maintain very-full (just a reminder, but the labor market has absorbed, in the past few decades, large demographics who once simply didn't work, most especially women and many elderly people) employment.
