MicroGrid’s single unit structure is superior to woven material in that it won’t unravel or have loose strands that become problematic during processing into a pre-preg material or when conducting a dry lay-up. The homogenous design also ensures uncompromised conductivity between strands when forming the material to a variety of shapes and contours and provides a smooth surface on the end product. MicroGrid’s biggest advantage is Dexmet’s ability to tightly control the manufacturing process to meet a specific weight, open area, and conductivity requirement.
