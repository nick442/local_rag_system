Ooh let me ramble a bit, for this is very true in my case. The very second I feel even slightly patronized, I shut down and create a negative judgment of the company. Especially when the marketing methods they use are as transparent as a dad with a vagina. Unrealistically attractive persons using product, ridiculous dialogue with YouTube comedian level humor, ANY product placement/celebrity endorsements, etc. It feels insulting and gives companies and advertisers a sort of malicious persona and therefor unworthy of my shmeckles. On the other hand some advertisements seem more subtle and respectful, being more informative rather than persuasive or cunning, and that's what I want to see more of. Hopefully it's not just me but I could be too cynical. It's hard not to be these days.
