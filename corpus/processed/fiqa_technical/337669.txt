"Couple of things to make sure you have going for you since you are not at a target school are as follows: 1. Make sure your GPA is amazing and if it isn't make sure you are in 3-4 professional organizations (not just join them, get involved). 2. Make sure you know technicals and how to talk about them, VERY IMPORTANT 3. Start applying to internships at all of the banks, Big 4 Accounting, PE, fund account firms in the city (there are many). You have to get an internship this year and next year, the more the better. get summer/fall/spring internships. 4. Network with any and every person you know in IB, working in M&A, working for IB shops, working for PE shops, other finance alumni. 5. Do more networking, find out if there are any networking events, conferences, meet and greets, charity events, NFP events (there are a lot, just need to find them). Don't bombard people with the ""I'm at DePaul in Finance and want to be in IB."" story line, perfect/hone/practice/perfect your elevator pitch. Remember, you don't need to tell why you need a job, you need to tell them why they need you to make money. 6. Find some industries that might interest you (and are valuable) and learn them. Learn the technicals to solar energy or some emerging markets. PS: I know you want to make a shit ton of money, but you'll fail in IB if that is all you want to do because the guys that get these roles love the job because of the chase and the deal. They fundamentally understand the markets they work in on another level, they make themselves valuable to the firm they work for. I think you should dive into what IB is first."
