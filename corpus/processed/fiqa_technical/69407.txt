> Why are people defending this? Because it obfuscates the root cause and potentially damages the impact of what lessons are to be learned from this breach. There is a constant tug of war between what security recommends and what an organization ultimately decides to deliver. Implementing security is a delicate balance between what can be done and what should be done while keeping in mind cost, site usability and ease of development. Users want quick responses and ease of use, developers want everything in a big sandbox and security wants to wall off everything. Security teams generally do not implement changes required to meet sound policy. They'll recommend, monitor and report on issues, but for all we know the security team did it's job and recommended data isolation when engineering the site and robust patch management for all application and OS components, while monitoring and reporting these potential threats to their operational counterparts. That means nothing if the rest of the organization doesn't commit to making security a priority. To condemn her for her degree without knowing how well she did her job is not just wrong, it's *imprecise*. Whether it be her incompetence or an organizational culture of ignoring security in favor of expedience and cost, I think it's worthwhile to hold off on judgement until we know the full story.
