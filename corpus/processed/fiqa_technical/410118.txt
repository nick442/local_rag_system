Hmm, actually you made me wonder if this is something they react to, even if they don't realize it - like how a certain attitude might increase your chances of getting a date. If you act like someone with a lot of hidden weaknesses (whether you have them or not), people might pick up on a fear of taking a chance on you. If you act like people would be lucky to have you, others might pick up on the same cues - note this does not mean you engage in a debate to convince them that they'd be lucky to have you (that's something undesirable people do) - truly desirable people would probably think such debate not worth their time..
