If Amazon paid cash for the transaction, and there was no value to be unlocked, then I think you'd expect amazon's market value to remain the same after the transaction (exchange of equal value). But there's book value inherent to the Whole Foods business, and the various assets within it, and there's strategic value that might only be realized through an acquisition by Amazon. If another company bought it (let's say Kroger), you could argue that the market cap boost to Kroger would have been less meaningful (or nonexistent) because Kroger wouldn't be as well positioned to create value from the Whole Foods business as Amazon is.
