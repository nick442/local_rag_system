the main problems right now -security (it's really bad) -integration (everyone wants their own closed ecosystem so they can collect data or charge for services, which is the opposite of what consumers want.) -protocol (there isn't a universl smart home protocol) -service (many products rely on the company maintaining a server for them to talk to, so you don't know if a product will even work in a few years, which is bad for smart appliances that people expect to use for 10-20 years. obviously whichever company can get their hardware into other companies products will win. they need to start thinking like intel back during the pc craze in the mid nineties (alexa inside)
