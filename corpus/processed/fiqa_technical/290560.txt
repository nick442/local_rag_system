This is a tech company where they are doing stuff for future, when elect cars become popular tesla will skyrocket and dominate the sector, think of how much cash they will make if they dominate the car market. Only logical way to criticize the situation of Tesla is to assume electronic cars wont make it and never be used otherwise comparing to companies who make extreme profits is stupid.
