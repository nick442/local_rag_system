The court by itself is not expensive, it is the implied need for an attorney which are *very* expensive. Your average court case costs $130 to file. However, your average attorneys charge anywhere from $750 to $200 an hour. Granted, the need for an attorney stems from the complexity of written law. I would agree with you that this is not ideal about current society, but the alternative - an society without written law - is much less ideal. To even find something like that, we would almost have to refer back to my previous example - Somalia.
