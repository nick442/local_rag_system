Who are the enforcers? That sounds like a government. So we have to wait until someone gets murdered at a house before we then ostracize that house from society? That's seems horribly inefficient. A bad company could just change their address and name over and over to avoid being ostracized. And how is a company's brand going to be hurt when it's private security company disputes every crime that company commits? Why should a company care about its brand so long as its making tons of money (think about Comcast, for example)?
