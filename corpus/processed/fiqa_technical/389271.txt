Full fridge uses less. Mostly due to a sort of 'flywheel effect' from the mass inside the fridge. frankly I think this is more of a science trivia question, If you are trying to save money on power, then there's a lot of other things you can do, and there's tons of websites out there with power conservation tips. just google it. A better question here would be what to do with the money you save ;-)
