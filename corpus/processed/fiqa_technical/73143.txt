"He's right, I've had several hiring managers who looked over my resume tell me to leave out my warehouse job. The pay is very good but because it's not white collar it's essentially useless for the positions I'm looking for (fintech). They've actually done sleight research on this finding callback rates for similar resumes- they look for keywords that indicate you're at a higher ""class."" Seeing blue collar work isn't very good and, while it will give you an edge over someone with NO job, in the long run it can look very bad on your resume."
