This article is very short on details. How much Bitcoin did he buy? If he spent $10k or more the bank is LEGALLY REQUIRED to ask why he is buying it, just as they would be if he was withdrawing the cash. What's more, the threshold can be far lower than 10K, especially if it appears you are doing multiple transactions for the express purpose of being below 10K. Since the article explicitly said he did multiple transactions, this is a likely possibility as well.
