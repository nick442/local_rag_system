He's going to change a lot of things in this world, I'll admit to that, but he doesn't have the integrity to change business. He doesn't have the love and passion that's needed to take a business from the idea stage through to realising its existence using monetary influence. I have my own business, and I'm torn between wondering if I would accept an investment from him. It would be money, yes, but it wouldn't be passion.
