There aren't only two factors at play here. There is more to success than hours worked and lucky circumstances. I don't claim to know the other factors, but I would like to give you an example. Currently, I'm listening to Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor. It is truly an inspiring piece. Bach was, and still is, a great success. His genius has been rivaled very few times over the past 250+ years. Still, there are many composers who put in just as much work as Bach, yet are not as good. Both Bach and such nameless composers put conscious effort into the placements of their notes, so luck is not a factor. Both Bach and nameless composers also put in a comparable number of hours, yet Bach is just better. Clearly there must be some other factor deciding who is successful and who is not.
