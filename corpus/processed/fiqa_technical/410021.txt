You are vastly overestimating the rate of e-commerce growth. Here are a couple things to keep in mind: Brick and mortar sales are still increasing, just not as fast as e-commerce sales. E-commerce is still only ~10% of all retail sales. We may have an oversupply of retail square footage, but there is still demand for a lot of the space, retail vacancies are at a all time low. https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf
