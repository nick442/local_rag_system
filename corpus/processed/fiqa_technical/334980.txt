Is my laptop that I use to work and create my income my possession, or my property? Under what circumstances is it a possession, and under what circumstances is it property? What circumstances do you find it just to remove my laptop from me, and use it for yourself? Do you support black bloc tactics like window breaking and stealing food from grocers?
