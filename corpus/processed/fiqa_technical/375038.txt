**Litany of woes ** Nokia has been the number 1 seller of mobile phones since 1998. In Q1 of 2012 they relinquished this lead to Samsung. Samsung now has a 21% global market share against Nokiaâ€™s 20%. Till 5 years ago Nokia was in the top 5 most valuable brands in the world but had slipped to 14th place last year, and this year it will be lucky to be in the top 50. Nokia is shedding jobs like a sinking ship jettisoning all excess weight. Microsoft seems to be going its own way with the Windows mobile platform with the announcement that windows 8 update wont be available for Lumia range in the market. The stock is now at a 16 year low.
