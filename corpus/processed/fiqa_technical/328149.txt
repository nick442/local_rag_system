First of all, the company will pay the money for the insurance, do not be afraid. They have to pay IF 1) the insurance premium was paid every month and 2) there was not a false declaration of health when the contract was signed 5 or 10 years ago. It normally takes between 1 month and 4 months to settle an insurance contract. Your case might take a little longer. Second, the insurance company admit that you are the beneficiary, so the money will eventually come to you. What they say is that you need someone in charge, a trustee or a curatorship to handle the money in your name. Why? Because you have a mental health team in charge of you. Be patient, and.. Third, start by talking to someone in charge in your mental health team or the people you see. What you need is someone acting as a trustee for you. You need to go and seek free legal aid. Depending on your country or state of residence. I cannot help you more than that. You will have the money, eventually in a few months, but you need to find a trustee, a guardian as soon as possible. Someone in your family could easily do it for you ?
