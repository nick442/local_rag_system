"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2017/06/27/whatever-happened-cng-powered-cars/) reduced by 86%. (I'm a bot) ***** > Much cleaner than today&#039;s already very clean-running cars - because of the clean-burning nature of CNG. They may even run cleaner, in the aggregate, than so-called &quot;Zero emissions&quot; electric cars - which may not emit emissions at their nonexistent tailpipes but the utility plants that burn oil and coal to produce the electricity that powers them most certainly do produce lots of emissions. > One must also take into account the emissions generated during the very labor intensive process of earth-rape necessary to manufacture electric cars and to obtain and process the raw materials used to make them and which are not needed to make CNG-powered cars. > Cars like the six-passenger/full-size Ford Crown Vic and Chevy Impala and - potentially - large SUVs and trucks, also with V8s. And at a reasonable price - less than the cost of a hybrid and far less than the cost of an electric car. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6kzhbv/its_interesting_to_speculate_about_why_solutions/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~158055 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **car**^#1 **vehicle**^#2 **CNG**^#3 **electric**^#4 **CNG-powered**^#5"
