"Banks do NOT lend money they don't have. I don't know where you get that idea. In your view what stops a bank from lending a quadrillion dollars? Banks do need to have savings in the bank - learn about reserve requirements, which I mentioned above. Banks (just like you and me) can have assets and debts, but they account for them and they net to (almost) zero, just like you and me. Fed does not pay government as I stated above. The Fed buys goods from the open market (Treasury Bonds, for example, which are IOUs the government has sold to investors who purchased them freely), and the Fed pays for this with ""new"" money while holding the bonds, which then pay out just like they were being held by you or me. Finally, M2 is about 10 times M1, for the reasons I gave. Your claim of M2 increasing regardless of M1 is not true. [See here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Components_of_US_Money_supply.svg) for example and note that M2 is about 10x of M1, with the variations being for the reasons I gave above."
