"> Even if I did simply want to stop being American and live in Somalia I still have to pay taxes. No, actually you don't. Step 1. Move to Somalia. Step 2. Revoke your American citizenship. Step 3. Pay your final tax receipt. Step 4. Try to live the best that you can in Somalia.. > If it was totally free to leave you'd have a point - that I'm opting in to being here after the fact by not leaving. But that's just not the case. There is a real cost to leaving and renouncing citizenship and thus there is an aspect of being under duress to this ""agreement"" you claim we make. This sounds a lot like the ""I didn't choose to be born"" argument. How old are you? None of us get to choose where we are born, and what system we are born into. However, there are costs associated with it that we inherit regardless. The choice that we have is to leave - and yes, there is a cost to that too. I am sure people who are born into third world nations would cry so many tears about how unfair the world is for you.."
