Reminds me of last winter when two girls knocked on our door to shovel snow. I asked how much. They said $20. I pay $50-75 since I have a huge driveway (circular on one side and a regular driveway on to another street. I asked if they were sure because that is a lot of driveway. They say yes. I say, you got a deal and I'll give you $30 and you only have to do one of the driveways. Look down 20 minutes later and they found out how hard it was and called their dad and he was stuck doing most of it. Very shitty job and they walked all over the snow on the other driveway making it even harder to shovel. Laughed a lot but had to pay a professional to clean up their mess.
