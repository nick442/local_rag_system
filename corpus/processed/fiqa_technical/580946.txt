"Whatever the percentage divisions are, I'm a big fan of keeping things in separate accounts. This works especially well for fixed bills. It is essentially a bank account version of the envelope method. If I take out everything from your paycheck I know is reserved (including reserving savings), for me it is a lot easier to not even miss the money when I'm going towards ""fun"" expenditures - which come from the checking account."
