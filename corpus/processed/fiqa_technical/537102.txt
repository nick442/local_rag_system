I believe WMT already uses most grocery items as loss leaders, so I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon follows a similar structure. Amazon already forgoes profits on many categories (especially new markets) in favour of capturing a large market share. So, expect a big price squeeze on existing brick & mortar joints.
