There are different types of businesses, Microsoft is a public corporation which means it is owed by shareholders, not bill gates himself. The money Bill Gates has is not all cash, it is valued by the stock he owns in different companies. Other businesses may be limited liability meaning the owner may not be liable for losses on the business, but the money earned by the business is kept for business use only.
