"amway brainwashes followers in to thinking that they are participating in the most sophisticated business in the world. Also they teach followers that people who either hate or question them is ""ignorant, narrow-minded haters who cannot adapt to advanced business"". My friend is also stuck in Amway and he keeps telling me about his friend and family being ""jerks"" for criticizing him. Also they are like a cult because they always have a Amway meeting discussing business plans and they try to label anyone who tries to leave as ""traitors"". Also the fact that many quit jobs and lose friends for MLM and they already spent bunch of time and money makes it impossible to turn back."
