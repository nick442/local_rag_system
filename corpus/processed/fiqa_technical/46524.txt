Well the Fucking Moron in the white house never had the courage to sign up, in fact he grew a pair of very convenient spurs to dodge his draft, instead a pair of man sized balls. If anything he should be ashamed of his cowardice and have more respect for the fallen and their families who had the courage to sign up to serve their nation. And be glad for them, because were it not for them you would soon feel the beard of a taliban tickle the back of your neck as he asked you if you were enjoying what you had signed up for.
