“.. Have you seen fucking L.A” and “.. Arkansas”. Sure, that’s how it is. I guess the analysis from OP’s link is a future where the world keeps developing. Taking the bus in Sicily when I first went there 25 years ago, was virtually impossible. It came when the driver felt like it, and it went to to/from a very limited amount of locations. Today it’s not a problem at all from early morning to early evening. I guess that in a few years, it will change even more. For the better.
