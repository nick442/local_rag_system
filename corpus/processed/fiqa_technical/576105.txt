Your house and 25 acres was $50K? How is that even possible? Growing up in the 90's the average house in my town was around $600k. Now median home prices in that area are around $1 million. This is a suburb of Boston, so it's not like I'm talking about a place in an actual city. Prices fluctuate in real estate so much depending on location. Growing up in Massachusetts and then doing my undergrad near NYC, my experience with average or entry-level home prices told me they were always over half a million. It didn't really hit me that prices varied significantly until I went to get my Masters from Syracuse, my friend's father decided to just buy a 5 bedroom house on the edge of campus rather than pay her rent. It was so cheap it made sense (a little under $100K, so he bought it with straight cash). But still, 25 acres and $50k sounds unreal today. Like the cost of building materials alone would be more than that, forgetting about the cost of land.
