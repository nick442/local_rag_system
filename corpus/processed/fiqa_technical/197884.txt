Considering that Tesla is a very new car company with a very new product, the sorts of problems reported should not have been unexpected for anyone. In case a problem *does* occur, the tier of service in hours or days stands a tier *above* almost every other car company (most of which are on the level of days to week**s**.) There is also no way to buy a car that is guaranteed not to have issues in the first few years. There's always a chance of a defect even if the chance is minimal and backed up by a long favorable track record. Even Toyotas have their share of issues, and while serious issues may be more rare, the level of inconvenience in case of an incident will inevitably be higher when a new Camry *does* have an issue (speaking from personal experience).
