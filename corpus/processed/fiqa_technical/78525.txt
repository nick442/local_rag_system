Siri suffers from it working too well, I think. Yes, speech to text and text to speech is a relatively solved problem. But. That's only half of what Siri is doing. When it translates your speech to text, it then transmits the text to servers that, in only seconds, parse the *meaning* of the text. That's a lot harder. I tell Siri to set trimmers or remind me of things at certain times, etc. the brilliance of Siri is it understands what I meant in addition to what I said.
