Nothing new, PayPal has never hesitated to express their opinions before. I would have already assumed this was the case. I wonder though, do they still do business with countries that execute people for certain sexual orientations? It'd seem *killall[insert race here]people.com* drives a little less business for them than say, *Saudia Arabia*â€”and makes for easy PR.
