Your question just doesn't make sense in terms of finance. The reason I recommended those questions is because it'll make yours more coherent. There's deep confusion in your question, put another way. I don't think you're thinking about money properly, specifically the ownership and it doesn't appear you've read much about trading. If you're interested in a financial career, you need to be very willing to learn independently. I think my questions are a good place to start. Honestly, you should buy a finance textbook and just go through it. It's insanely complex at the top levels so reinforcing the foundation stuff is extremely beneficial.
