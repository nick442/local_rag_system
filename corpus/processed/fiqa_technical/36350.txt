Agreed. This is such an open ended question with no real answer. I assume you're asking for recruitment into the finance industry, which honestly recruit from a wide variety of schools depending on the division within the firm and which firm location the firm is hiring for. Its more about the program in the school, than the school itself (business/finance/comp sci/electrical engineering/physics/math programs). Also bank alumni also play a large role in recruitment, and are sometimes whom you might speak with during an interviews and at career days. Most of the recent bank grads I know are from Rutgers, MIT, UPenn, Penn State, Princeton, Carnegie Mellon, Villanova, NYU, Stevens, etc..the trend here is North East schools close to NYC (where I work).
