> It's been years since my finance classes, but it seems to me the best course of action after selling the property and paying corporate taxes would be to reinvest the money at the corporate level to then pay out dividends rather than pay each of the 3 shareholders out and have us then pay personal tax on a large amount. Full disclaimer, no one here is, or is acting in capacity as, a tax accountant or lawyer. My understanding is as follows (assuming you're in the US): 1. The C-Corp owns the property. If you sell the property, the *corporation* will receive the proceeds of that sale. IF a capital gain is recognized, *the corporation* will pay the appropriate tax rate. That rate is, apparently, the same as normal income. 2. If you then issue a dividend with the proceeds of that sale, you are actually NOT reinvesting the proceeds, you're distributing them to shareholders. Shareholders will *then* need to pay tax on the dividends at their personal rates *as income.* If you reinvest the cash, it will stay in the business. It will not go directly to shareholders. The cash will need to be invested somewhere else within the company. You will get hit with taxes regardless at least once. If you distribute to shareholders, those proceeds will be taxed twice. Example: Both Cases: Sale Proceeds: $100 Less Corporate Tax of 35%: $35 After-Tax Proceeds: $65 _______________________________________________________________ IF DISTRIBUTED: Distributed to Shareholders: $65 Less Income Taxes at 25%: $16.25 After-Tax Distribution to Shareholders: $48.75 ____________________________________________________________ IF RETAINED: No distributions. Retained Earnings: +$65 Cash: +$65 Book Value of Equity: +$65 Shareholder Wealth Increase: $65
