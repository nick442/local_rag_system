2,000 hours or 2,500 hours at time-and-a-half Yikes! OK, so let's say you work a full 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year (2 weeks vacation.) That's 2000 hours right there. If you're pulling in 2000 hours of OT that means you're working 80 hours a week, 16 hour days. I make $27.88/hour on my current gig, OT would be 41.82 * 2000 hours would be $83,653 on top of the $58K I already make. $141K per year. In order to hit $221,000 their wage must be $43.51/hour with an annual income of 90,500.8 for 40 hours a week and then $130,530 for working the additional 40 hours a week.
