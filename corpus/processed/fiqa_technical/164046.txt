Google Peter schiff 2006 housing bubble youtube. You may not even like the guy, but he was right all along--way before it happened. (takes about 1 hour or something). Another of the many guys that saw the bubble way before anyone and profited from it is called Kyle Bass. I would seriously recommend everybody that sees this post to watch all his videos. I take this guys seriously. They have been warning about the crisis for a long time. The media, on the other hand, will advise you to buy Facebook or something.
