"If you speak English maybe put a sign up saying that you do. I would prefer an English speaking driver over a non English speaking driver simply because it would be easier to communicate. Maybe add some bright colors to make it more inviting? Have a sign that says ""Free Smiles/Laughs With Ride"". Start an Instagram page and become active on social media. Best of luck, if I am ever in Siem Reap I will find you for a ride."
