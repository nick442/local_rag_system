It's plywood with a laser cut living hinge. I'd be interested if it could be die cut en masse. I think it'd need some glue along key joins and something to keep the hinge shut during transit as a friction fit will probably fail somewhere. If you want to do this on a small volume, buy a cheap laser cutter which can do 4mm plywood could let you make boxes on demand. You could make quite a few before you hit the break even point for plywood die cutting tooling and a minimum production run. Or find a factory which does laser cut ply in china (alibaba) and get them to make 100.
