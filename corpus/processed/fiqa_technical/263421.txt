"> Food is cheaper Which restaurants do you eat at? Most mom-and-pop shops by me charge 50% more for the same genre of food as Applebees. Applebee's/Chili's/Outback has a very well-defined market: sit-down food at cheaper prices. Problem is that this type of food is below millennials' experience (""ew, you actually eat that stuff?"") and thus Applebee's and the like are suffering in sales."
