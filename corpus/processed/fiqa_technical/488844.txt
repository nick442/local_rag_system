Are you suggesting when they break a law involving a small portion of their total business they pay fines involving all portions of their business? I'm suggesting when they break a law, they pay fines related to the crime comitted. So relating how much their fine was on a tiny portion of their business should not be compared to total quarterly profits, unless those profits were related to the crime. Similar punishment methods to most crimes individuals commit.
