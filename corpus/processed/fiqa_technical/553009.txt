First, almost no truck company will agree to this. They'll just laugh. Half of truck company's have owner operators, who will just pick up and move elsewhere. They can even start working for Amazon directly because (number two) Amazon is starting it own transportation, slowly but surely. This won't happen, and Walmart is stupid for trying.
