Oh my, you poor skilled worker being held down by the janitors, stock rooms workers, and retail workers of the world.. So, let me guess, you are saying we should probably pay people less than minimum wage because something something market value or something something that's all those lazy people are worth, right? How about this, if a business can't afford to pay someone properly enough to survive, they don't deserve the labor. That may mean that the CEOs, shareholders, white collar, and skilled workers might have to take less pay so the guy at the bottom that is also needed to operate the company can afford to live without needing help from the government.
