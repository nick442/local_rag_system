Call it whatever you like. There ate places you can go which have no government taxes.. mostly because they have no government and there is no social services. They are places like Somalia, and regions of Afghanistan. Sorry, but if yippy ate going to live under the umbrella of three modern world, that comes with an implied cost that we pay or pay the consequences. The fact that you are using their internet would seem to indicate that you do enjoy the services that are paid for with your taxes.
