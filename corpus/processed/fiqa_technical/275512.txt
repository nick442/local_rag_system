Neither I nor the greater study of Economics disputes the emotions of the individual in making their decisions. Short term, non-cooperative decision making is a classic, very common example of where people make decisions in the short run that do not benefit them in the long run based on their emotional reaction to the situation at hand. Thats why we compensate people for the value of their labor and not our moralistic interpretation of their needs. I also have disputed the generosity of individuals in making their decisions, which you have failed again and again and again to rebut. I have also disputed the use of false morality in state level judgements of what people should do.
