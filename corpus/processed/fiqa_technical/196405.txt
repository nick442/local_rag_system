"Salaries normally shouldn't fluctuate with inflation and deflation.. Inflation prevents consumers from spending (prices get too high), ultimately taking money out of circulation. This causes the market to go in to deflation (or at least deflate back to normal). That's when people begin to spend again, and start the cycle all over again. Now.. Imagine if salaries increased with inflation.. Inflation would never end. Everyone could keep affording the high prices. A Starbucks coffee would eventually cost $150, but the ""middle-class"" would all be millionaires. Your ""small-change"" would consist of a wad of useless bills, and the government would have to continually print out more money just to keep up. NOTE: This is not a direct answer to ""where goes delta?"", but would more be directed to the part ""Prices go up and salary doesn't""."
