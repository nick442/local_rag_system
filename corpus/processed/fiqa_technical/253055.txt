I see way more Chipotles in places like California than I do in Middle America, where humans also have taste buds. Where I live, most Chipotle patrons are obese Latinos or Armenians who, for some unknown reason, aren't spending half the money to eat a far superior burrito a half-mile away in any direction. I wonder if Mexican food in all of America will eventually be as bad as Thai food in Los Angeles or Mexican/Chinese food in South Dakota.
