"The biggest question is do you want to be a landlord? There are a lot of ups and down to managing property from bad tenants to having to fix a water heater or replace a fridge. If you aren't interested in being a landlord, it is definitely a bad idea. If you do want to be a landlord, then the question is how close do you want to be to your tenants? What if they are up late making noise, etc.? What if they watch TV all night and you hear it through the walls? What is your plan? You ask if people have trouble ""sharing"" a house. If you are the landlord and the other party the tenant, then you aren't ""Sharing"", you are leasing. It's a different relationship with different strains."
