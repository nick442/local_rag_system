Agreed that the CEO is lame and only in it for himself in the meantime. But regardless what Lampert does, he has lost billions on Sears already just over time and his recent actions will just recoup a small fraction of it. There is no way he's going to make back his investment. What I don't see how in this economy that most of those locations would be rentable to boutiques that pay more when all it's doing is throwing more retail space onto a market deluged with retail space. Some locations maybe, but many are old and away from the action in the meantime. For instance, many of the closed Kmarts, part of Sears, at least five near me are either still empty after 3-5 years or occupied by something that definitely doesn't pay the same rent, like indoor storage units or indoor paintball arenas and whatnot.
