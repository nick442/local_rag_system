"> The company song was a complete shock to me and I found it to be one of the creepiest things ever devised. Wow, that is creepy. I'm really shocked that any company would actually do this. It's like rubbing it in your face - ""We're going to further strip you of your dignity, and crush your soul, and there's nothing you can do about it!"" It's like being asked to attend HS pep-rallies well into adulthood. Yuck."
