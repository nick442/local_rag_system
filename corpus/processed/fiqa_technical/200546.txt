Dude it's not about being competitive. It has advantages in its own that no other car maker is currently doing. Sure, it's not the cheapest car on the market but it's • Fully electric. • Drives by itself (+$5000 autopilot which chevy doesn't even offer. STILL cheaper than chevy's upgrade which puts it at almost $42k). • Known for being the safest cars on the road. • And it's damn beautiful. So even though you're not getting your bottom of the barrel deal, you get what you pay for.
