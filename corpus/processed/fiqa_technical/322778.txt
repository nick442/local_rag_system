>What I was talking about is personal income tax Got it, thanks for clarifying. >That would mean Amazon would need to offer 5k more pay for an equal job vs an employer in another state. I think cost of living would also be a factor. So I don't know that a state with income tax would automatically not make the cut, as you asserted in your first comment, because the cost of living might be cheaper and even everything out. >This is just one factor a company this huge would consider when moving. Agreed, there are numerous factors that Amazon will have to consider so I see no reason why a state that has an income tax should not submit an application.
