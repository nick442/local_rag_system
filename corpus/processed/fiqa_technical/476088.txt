I have a Citi card that gives me checks all of the time. Most of the time it requires the 3%/minimum $10 or whatever, but occasionally when they're trying to sucker you into borrowing money from them they will let you take $1,500 w/ no fee for 6 months. Outside of that I've never seen it exist in modern credit cards.
