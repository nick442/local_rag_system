They probably lose a ton of money from people making innocent mistakes, too. A few weeks ago I was was at the self checkout register at Target and swiped a $20 roast. I swear I heard it ding in my head, even though it didn't actually scan, but luckily the employee was paying attention and asked me if I was going to pay for it. I felt like an asshole, but I'm glad she was there to say something so I know to pay more attention next time.
