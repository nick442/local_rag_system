You need a mixture of real estate, funds, and cash in the bank. Putting all your eggs in one basket is never wise. I would also stay away from land-banking period.. Like you had mentioned, scam after scam after scam.. Here in Tokyo, Royal Siam Trust (White Sands Beach?) is the token land-banking scam.. funny enough it was hosted by the OP..
