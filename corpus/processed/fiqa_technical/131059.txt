"Considering that I can't find anything on Chase's web site referencing a ""Money Market IRA"" I suspect that this is a type of account that they aren't actively supporting anymore, but aren't forcing you to cash it in. I would call Chase to find out for sure, however. That said, a money market is not a good investment if you are looking for any kind of growth. They are basically a savings account that pay (currently) a small amount of interest. You can get much better return from other low-risk investments. You can rebalance periodically if you want to keep a certain amount of ""cash"" available."
