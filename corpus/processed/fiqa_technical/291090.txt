Back when Best Buy first came to my area, when I was a wee sprat, I recall watching Best Buy commercials representing/discussing their no pressure sales atmosphere. Basically they were saying they would have sales staff on the floor, but nobody forcing you these pitches like you'll get at other stores. I really liked the idea. Of course it would occasionally lead to me having questions in Best Buy stores and no employees available or around to answer them. Good policy, bad practice.
