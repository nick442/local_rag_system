"The S&P 500 index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of McGraw Hill Financial. Changes to the index are made periodically, as needed. For Facebook, you'll find it mentioned in this December 11, 2013 press release (PDF). Quote: New York, NY, December 11 , 2013 – S&P Dow Jones Indices will make the following changes to the S&P 100, S&P 500, MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 indices after the close of trading on Friday, December 20: You can find out more about the S&P 500 index eligibility criteria from the S&P U.S. Indices methodology document (PDF). See pages 5 and 6: Market Capitalization - [..] Liquidity - [..] Domicile - [..] Public Float - [..] Sector Classification - [..] Financial Viability - Usually measured as four consecutive quarters of positive as reported earnings. [..] Treatment of IPOs - Initial public offerings should be seasoned for 6 to 12 months before being considered for addition to an index. Eligible Securities - [..] [..] Changes to the U.S. indices other than the TMIX are made as needed, with no annual or semi-annual reconstitution. [..] LabCorp may have a smaller market cap than Facebook, but Facebook didn't meet all of the eligibility criteria – for instance, see the above note about ""Treatment of IPOs"" – until recently. Note also that ""Initial public offerings should be seasoned for 6 to 12 months"" implies somebody at S&P makes a decision as to the exact when. As such, I would say, no, there is no ""simple rule or formula"", just the methodology above as applied by the decision-makers at S&P."
