Tesla is valued like a company that has self-driving car hardware already in every car they're selling right now, that they can switch on overnight once the software is ready. They're valued as a company that will create a driverless transportation service that those cars will be able to work under so that they can take over all of the Uber business, without having to pay for drivers. After that's up and running, Tesla can make as many cars as they can crank out and just set them loose on the transportation service, allowing every car they build to work around the clock to provide rides, giving the company a much more substantial long term profit on each car than simply selling the cars to individuals. That's the kind of company they're being valued like.
