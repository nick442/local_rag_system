In the current system it would be irresponsible to pay more than they have to but if corporations get to be amoral people they need tighter regulation because what's good for maximizing profits is rarely good for people. If you want to argue that businesses are more important than people then perhaps profits should receive favorable treatment to people but I highly doubt Lincoln was talking about Walmart when he was talking about a government by the people and for the people. There's plenty of businesses out there charging a fair markup for a quality product or service and paying a fair wage. It's not highly profitable but I think we've been watching the race to the bottom by publicly traded companies maximizing quarterly returns at the expense of literally anything and everything else. Something's gotta give. Also, your argument implies that you're ok subsidizing Walmart's profit margin with your tax money. Their employees are receiving government benefits because Walmart doesn't pay them well enough to afford it on their own. Figure $6B split 190M ways, we (US workers) all gave Walmart a little over $30 each.
