Still acting like a child and still not recognizing that OP getting an MBA wouldn't hurt him at all. Sorry I bruised your ego there pal, hopefully you'll recover and still be able to lead a full and productive life after this. Not sure if you noticed, but you've been getting downvoted basically because it's clear to everyone in this community that you're an asshole and incapable of discussion. Please continue going around beating everyone with your opinion club. It will help me sleep better at night knowing you're ruining your future by being an arrogant dick with no sense of decency or respect. I'm reporting you for this comment as well since you're still violating the terms of this sub. Hopefully you'll get banned so you don't ruin anyone else's request for help. Sorry OP, he's an asshole and can't help himself.
