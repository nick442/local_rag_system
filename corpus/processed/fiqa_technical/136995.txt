"As a general rule in many countries, pyramid schemes are illegal, so don't plan on getting rich anytime soon by being involved in one. Anything you earn through such a scheme is subject to forfeiture because it is ill-gotten gains. The entire basis of a pyramid scheme is that the focus is principally on recruiting new ""downlines"", not selling a product or service. I would strongly advise you to find a different way to riches. Multi-level marketing very rarely makes much money for anyone except the first people in the food chain, and the odds of finding such an early-stage opportunity are exceedingly small. For every successful MLM program there are probably 25 that never make it off the launch pad. Be honest in asking yourself -- if it was really that easy, why wouldn't everyone just get into MLM? It's more hype than substance. Do you know who buys most of the product? The newest people who ""drink the Koolaid"", because they're convinced they need to have plenty of inventory on hand for their potential customers. I can't tell you how many people I know who spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on buying product they never managed to sell. It's much tougher than people think, even with a good product."
