>You make up the lost ad money by my subscription. The problem with this is that they want far too much money for a subscription. The article is dead on that cable is grossly overpriced; I think most people who still get it do so because they need certain channels they can't get any other way - yet. So what will happen is that many of the current content providers will attempt to sustain their earnings by demanding subscription or PPV fees much higher than most people want to pay. For example: * Shaw Cable PPV HD movie: $6.99, good for 24 hours * Netflix HD movie: $7.99/month for as many movies as I can find that I like This is an order of magnitude different, and it's going to kill many 'traditional' businesses. I suspect the movie studios, cable companies, and other vested interests are going to try very hard to kill services like Netflix.
