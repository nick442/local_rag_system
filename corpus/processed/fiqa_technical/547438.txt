"You don't know what the term 'ad hominem' means. I am claiming you are ignorant based on your clear misrepresentation of factual evidence, which is an observation, not an ad hominem. You are just throwing out an insult not based on any actual evidence, which is an ad hominem. At least learn your pejorative terminology if you're going to try to adult. As for ""bad life decisions"", again, you are flaunting ignorance by ignoring the fact that poverty is massively chronic in America right now. Four in ten Americans have an income below the 1968 minimum wage. You can try to call them names and demean them all you want, but the higher paying jobs just aren't there for everyone, which is why we must seriously increase the minimum wage so that the necessities of life can be attained."
