The CFA will generally take 3-4 years to finish. They test level 2 and 3 once a year and level 1 twice. They recommend approx 300 hours of studying for each level, but you can get away with less. But for you, level 1 is going to be your undergrad in finance so it shouldn’t be anything outside of your normal course of study. You’ll be able to save time on studying if you take it while the material is still fresh
