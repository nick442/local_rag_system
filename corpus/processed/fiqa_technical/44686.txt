Great that you have WhatsApp - but make sure you can communicate with the tourists who have never heard of WhatsApp. Just like you are on Reddit now, you know to use what tourists are using. The same is true for messaging. Most western tourists are not going to have WhatsApp - tourists from Japan will have LINE and Americans, Europeans, and other Asians will have Facebook Messenger or iMessage (iPhone), Chinese tourists will use Baidu. Get an account on the service your customer uses - though using messenger requires a smartphone and iMessage requires an iPhone.
