"Israel has a federal union (called ""Histadrut"") since its founding. As an Israeli, I can assure you: a Federal Union will be as corrupt as local unions and as most politicians are. Power leads to corruption. What we need are laws, and not departments, committees and groups to work ""for the worker and American citizens""."
