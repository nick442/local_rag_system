I disagree with the theory that SUPPLY needs to increase.. stagnant sales can just as easily suggest either equilibrium between supply and demand, or a problem with purchasing power. I would want to know the home sale PRICES (today vs last month and vs last year).. and possibly salaries. if prices are the same, then we're more or less in equilibrium.. if sale prices are dropping, then we're in trouble.. but in either case I question whether adding supply will do anything except lower prices and push the market power towards the buyer.
