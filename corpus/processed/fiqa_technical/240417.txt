I work for a boutique recruitment firm as a Marketing manager and I love it. I used to work as a back-end developer but later transitioned into front-end which led me into Digital Marketing. I still get kicks when I read code. I am a programmer at heart and I love tech but I don't see myself ever pursuing it professionally. Programming is a chase down the rabbit hole.
