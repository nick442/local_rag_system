My suggestions would only save the country money and prevent at least 84,500 people - almost certainly much more from dying unnecessarily each year (due to mortality amenable to health care) if the US had healthcare that was available to everybody and affordable *like almost all other developed countries do.* They all literally think we are barbarians you know, largely because of people with opinions like your own.
