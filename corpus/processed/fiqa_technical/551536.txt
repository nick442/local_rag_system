So .. hotdogs shouldnt count either? What about cars? gasoline? Why shouldn't one off costs count? Virtually everything I buy is a one off cost. New and resold houses are being sold/bought every day. The case and shillers housing index takes attributes from common housing and amalgamates the costs. So theres your perpetual gauge if you need one. Its striking to me that perhaps the hugest cost in most people's lives, isn't considered when calculating inflation. No wonder the housing bubble got out of control.
