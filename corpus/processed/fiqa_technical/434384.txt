I understand the concepts behind the different weighting methods, but what I’m wondering is why a company CHOOSES a specific weighting method. For example, what exactly was being looked at when the decision was made to make the DJIA price-weighted instead of market cap-weighted? Why does a manager decide to use free-floating methodology over price-weighting? I just don’t understand why there’s no uniformity. Apologies as I may have not worded my question properly.
