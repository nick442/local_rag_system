"Except the notion of a social contract is *always* used and intended to be used as a notion of agreement. And if it isn't based upon agreement then you have no basis under which to claim an obligation. People don't owe anything to a collective that they do not wish to join, and the underlying problem is that there is no agreement. I'm not suggesting ""running a country"" at all. There need not be any such collective."
