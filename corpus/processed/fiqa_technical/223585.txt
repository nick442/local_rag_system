Anyone can do many jobs that require a degree. Can you cut leaves and put them in a test tube? Because that pays $20 an hour after 2 years in raises. Because I don't need 4 years of college to learn this 'skill'. You don't know that guy, maybe he's qualified for the 80 year old piping and no one else is. Security clearance at a highly guarded private school. Can have 2 janitors and not 3 because he's highly efficient. 100k in Manhattan is like 40k everywhere else. But yeah you're right, the fact her job requires a degree to put leaves in test tubes means she deserves benefits and a great pay and a guy who needs to know what chemicals can't mix with each other doesn't. Does he deserve 100k if the school requires 'any' 4 year degree?
