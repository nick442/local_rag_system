This will not bankrupt anyone. It is not like Gawker. Gawker went bankrupt due to some uniqueness i n Florida law where you had to put the money up befire being able to appeal. I can find no evidence of any such law in South Dakota. So, even if the jury fucks ABC ten ways to Sunday, it seems incredibly unlikely this survives appeal. And, as the article points out, different circumstances as well. The comparison is misplaced.
