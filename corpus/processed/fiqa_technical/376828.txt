> Less capital tax = less pressure on the wealthy/entrepreneurs (since you keep bigger portion of your net income, the interest to bring back business should increase) = capital inflow back to the US. IMO, this statement makes a whole lot of assumptions that are untrue. 1) The wealthy create jobs. I believe the opposite is true. I think if you want more companies/jobs you should offer universal healthcare so low to middle class folks can risk leaving an established company to start on their own. 2) More money to the rich means more investment in the economy. My experience shows the rich will use the money to grow their own wealth, not everyone's. I remember a recent Bloomberg article where businessmen said they would use repatriated money for buyouts, liminting competition and growing a company's hold on the market. 3) Take home money is used for investment. It isn't. Companies do the large investments, not individuals. Consider Amazon looking at growing their distribution channels or Apple with their iPhone evolution. If you make it more profitable for corporate profits to go to compensation, you leave less money for investment. 4) Companies struggle in the US due to overtaxation. This is a flat out myth. Cost of taxes for business in the US is one of the lowest for rich, educated countries and that is before the tax kickbacks (a la Foxconn) or loopholes. 5) And the bigges IMO -- the US has been fed the lie that the best thing for the citizens of the country is aligned with the best things for the country's companies. The opposite is the case.
