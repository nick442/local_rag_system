"Note that this particular cop has some kind of specialisation (""special-ops"") that would put him into a higher pay-grade, probably rising with experience in that field. Then he was promoted to sergeant and took on more responsibility. Again, he might well have had subsequent pay rises because of his years of experience as a sergeant. Personally, I want well-paid public servants, who will do a good job. I want a guy who has spent 20 years in such a blue-collar job to be able to earn as much as a computer programmer who only graduated a couple of years ago."
