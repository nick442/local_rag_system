"Most practices I've gone to use a triplicate paper form called a ""medical encounter form""with the specialty's most common procedure codes and laboratory codes preprinted. (And rarer ones hand added). The doctor fills this out and the office manager transcribes it. This also has a billing section where in my case the office manager initials ""cc"" for credit card. You probably refused or threw away your copy, but can ask to review their copy. Maybe there is a mis transcribed entry indicating payment at time of service."
