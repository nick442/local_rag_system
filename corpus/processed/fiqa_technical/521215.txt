I have a hard time believing 28% of the planet uses any one thing. You have to have electricity, money, Internet access, a culture that want it, etc. to even get to that point. China probably doesn't use Facebook. India I'd think barely. You're talking about large chunks of the world that don't have much exposure. Much of this is probably not real people. Heck, even the revenue they represent on the graph only highlights that the U.S. and Canada have the most profits and we represent, what, 5% of the world population? That's a far stretch. Even their Wikipedia page shows one statistic that they get 20billion visitors a month in 2015. That's 3 times the world's population. I just can't take any of it seriously unless they gave me access to their databases and let me figure out how to identify a unique user.
