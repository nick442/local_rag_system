"Yep. As an ""early"" employee, you tend to end up putting in a ton of extra work as well, and needing a lot more flex than most really established companies. You're also usually tempted by flexibility, or the (increasingly wrong) myth that if you work harder, you'll reap a bigger reward. What tends to happen is that you give up huge chunks of your private life, and all too often end up getting replaced by someone cheaper down the line."
