> practically a venture bet > Zuckerberg made a $20bn bet I gotta agree, I mean Zuckerberg is so well known as a preeminent venture capitalist with a great track record - how can I pass up the opportunity? Also as an institutional investor, its so incredibly difficult to find a venture fund for me to put my money into, I really do need someone like him to spend my money. I mean why bother to get in at the ground floor when I can buy the company after its been hyped up right? Buy high, sell low has always been my motto!
