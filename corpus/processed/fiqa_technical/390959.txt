I am so fucking sick of reading analyzes by idiots who don't understand what the problem is with the housing market. The problem is on the DEMAND side. If customers aren't buying new houses then building more houses doesn't fix it. When you build more then supply outpaces demand and the market is worse. This is what happened up through 07-08. How the fuck do we not remember this? How can we look at this data on new housing starts and think the housing market is back on track? If you want to point to a growth in sales, fine. Just reference something relevant.
