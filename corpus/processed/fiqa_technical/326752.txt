"For their current operations, they need people because of all the rules and regulations around the world. It's not ""random dude downloads the app and becomes a driver"" everywhere. In Sweden, you need to have a registered taxi fleet company and you need to be a licensed taxi driver in order to operate any taxi business. Then you can drive for whoever you want, including Uber. Those regulations need to be handled by staff. Then there's the marketing department in every country/city. As for the developers, I'm guessing many of them work on things of the future. I guess they're preparing for driverless cars?"
