">ignores over a decade of rigorous testing because it doesn't support your narrative. FAULTY TESTING. How fucking hard is it for you to get that point through your thick head? The testing is irrelevant because it's possible to get past it. It was not rigorous at all because again, it couldn't test for everything, the drug Armstrong used being one of them. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. Do you finally understand why saying ""He passed all the tests"" is useless? If he did have positive tests then that would be evidence of guilt, saying there is no positive test is not evidence of innocence, just absence of the evidence of guilt. It would be evidence of innocence if it was absolutely impossible for him to beat the test, but he can beat the test. Get that through your thick fucking head. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEAT THE TEST. It is just fucking mind blowingly retarded of you to continually push the fact that he passed the tests as fact he isn't doping when I have repeatedly told you that the was able to beat the test, and it has been outlined how he did it. So yes you are like a creationist in the sense that you ignore the evidence, said evidence being information on how it is possible for someone to beat the test, and yet you still say ""He passed the test"" Saying he passed the tests which couldn't check for the drug he was on and therefore he is innocent is like saying ""We used a shitty camera to check for microscopic gun shot residue on the murder suspect, the shitty camera couldn't detect any gunshot residue therefore he has no gunshot residue on him and therefore he isn't the murder suspect"" Fucking idiot. I really do think you're a troll at this point because the fact that he was able to beat the tests is the basic core of the argument against your claims of ""His tests are all clean!"" and you still don't seem to understand that."
