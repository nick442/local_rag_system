I think three things are happening right now: 1) The stock market is one of the only sensible places to get a return on your money. Bond rates are very low and real estate is a little trickier. 2) There are fewer publicly traded companies now than there have been in the past. It's easier to invest in public companies than private companies, so more money is going into fewer companies, inflating the prices. 3) Wealth inequality is higher now than it has been in decades. If you give poor people more money, they just spend it to lead more comfortable lives. They won't invest in the stock market. If you give a rich person more money, they just invest more of it, since they are already spending as much as they reasonably can. In this economy, for the past few decades, we've been giving the rich more and more money. So, with these 3 factors, more money is pouring into the fewer companies of the stock market, inflating their prices. (At least, this is the idea put forward by a Fidelity analyst I heard a talk from recently, and it makes sense to me).
