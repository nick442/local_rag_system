> I'm not so sure the current agency is all that interested in actually holding executives accountable for breaking the law. After all the talk about less of a focus on regulation and more emphasis on enforcement? I wouldn't be so sure. Especially when you have these three geniuses, a company whose PR people are saying 'they didn't know' while their investor relations people are emphatically telling shareholders that the board was notified of the breach immediately and took action. I mean, you don't often find that juicy a poster child to show America that, yes, you *were* serious about the SEC needing to focus less on the rule making and more on enforcing existing regulations.
