ermm yah but back then robots weren't replacing humies.. we can get our jobs completed with robots now, so where is the job creation? horse carriage extinction translated to automobile manufacturing jobs, how is that similar to what's happening now? there will for sure be high tech robot repair jobs.. but certainly not enough to replace burger boys who just got out of san quentin. while it's true completely new jobs will be created in the future, what is the likelihood that a robot will be able to tackle that new job? pretty good chance there's gonna be more and more robots for more diverse jobs! down with robots!
