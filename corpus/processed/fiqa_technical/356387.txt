* Bojack = awful * Mindhunter = good * Big mouth = ok * Beasts of no nation = can't comment * The Crown = massively over rated - seriously Lithgow as Churchill? Wow. * Kimmy = yep love it. * Stranger things = yep love it * Master of None = awful, huge waste of money * Peaky Blinders = awful * Bloodline = Great * Narcos = Great * Love = OK * Easy = terrible. You didn't mention Girl Boss (cancelled) Gypsy (cancelled) and all of the Adam Sandler garbage like Ridiculous 6.. So yeah I stand by my call, it's 50/50 if they make a good show at the moment.
