The answer today is the Fidelity Rewards Amex. This card pays the highest cash back (2%) on ALL purchases. The answer gets more complicated if you like miles, or you want to use one card for groceries and gas and another for restaurants, etc. But the Fidelity Amex gives you 2% on everything you purchase, automatically deposited into your Fidelity account as cash (no coupons to rip off, or checks to deposit).
