I think this is a /r/personalfinance question. What school are you going to where it would cost $20k a year in excess of your current income just to add 2 years to your associates? Why not go to a state school and try as best you can to get the associates credits transferred into the bachelors program? An accounting degree will make you an accountant, not necessarily a financial analyst or an economist. You won't be doing sales but you won't be making a whole lot more than you do now, I'm guessing.
