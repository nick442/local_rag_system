My advice is to know what you need in an employee and ask straight forward questions to get the information you need. The time spent doing so is unimportant; as long as you get the information. Time is valuable, for both you and your applicants. As another poster said, first impressions are important. It's also important to ensure you're getting a good fit. There have been times when I wasn't thoroughly impressed or decided upon hiring an applicant based on the first impression. It took some getting to know them to see the potential. There is no written guide to the perfect way to interview. Ask the questions you think will get you the information you need.
