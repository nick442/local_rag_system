>I want to start a company but it looks like the the market is way over crowded with useless products or could I still make it work if the product is actually useful? The market for a product or service does not depend on the number of existing products or services currently being sold. There are over a billion cars in the world today.

Just product value and usefulness The most useful product in the world will sell zero units if no one knows about it.
