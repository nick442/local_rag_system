> It was interesting to read the data regarding student loans, and the type of impact it has had to borrowers. The Fed did not necessarily signal the economy is in trouble, but a great deal of households don't have adequate savings to sustain against a moderate financial shock. One of the impacts of the student loans -- or one they didn't seem to mention -- is that there are *fewer* households being formed than there normally would be given the population demographics.. young people are not only staying in school longer (and piling up more student debt just from that, in addition to the higher tuition aspect), but when they get out fewer of them are establishing their own homes (with all that that entails in terms of spending) and/or they are spending a lot LESS on those things than past cohorts have (and of course higher rental & utility and other costs -- along with flat wages/salaries -- haven't helped that part of the equation either).
