"Been to many job interviews, here's my advice: 1) What the hell the company sells, who it sells to and who the competition is. THINK about the company. What do you think they do well, what do you think they need improvement on? It's a public company so a great way to start is look at yahoo finance. You can read headlines, ready the financial statements, etc. http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AFG 2) What do you bring to the company? Have 5 ways to talk about how you are a great, smart person by talking about examples. Anybody can say they are smart, dedicated, etc. People want to hear examples; ""Past performance = future performance"" 3) Ask questions, a million. Goes back to #1. Know the ins and outs of the company and ask a million. Someone who asks a boat load of good questions will show they are interested, did their homework and looking to learn. Don't worry if you think it will show you don't know things..people actually want someone they can teach; not someone who is smarter than they are. (Just to be clear, don't ask about the stock or its price) 4) I have an exclusive interview tip that I will not broadcast to everyone. But if you want it, PM me."
