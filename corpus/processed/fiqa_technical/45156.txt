"I went to a B&N the other day to buy the best selling non-fiction book of all time that was being promoted on the radio/TV/etc.. and of course they were out of it. When I asked the guy why they wouldn't have the most popular thing at their store (like milk at a grocery store or something). He said, ""Yeah, it's usually in high demand so we don't have it."" Great way to run a company!! Stock your shelves full of the unpopular stuff and never order enough of the HIGHEST SELLING BOOKS OF ALL TIME! Can't wait for the box stores to go down."
