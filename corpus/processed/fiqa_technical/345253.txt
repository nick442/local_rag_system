"Many terms a'blending here. ""Reserves"" in yankee are merely deposits at the Fed by lending institutions, from bankers to brokers. ""Treasuries"" are loans borrowed by the US gov't itself, not its monetary authority, the Federal Reserve. The Fed borrows with the cash (zero coupon perpetuities) or ""reserves"" (deposits) (zero coupon perpetuities). Yes, when the Fed owns Treasuries, it's like a subsidiary corporation borrowing to buy the parent corporation's bonds, lol. If a bank wants to hold Treasuries, it holds Treasuries. If it has to keep some assets in reserve, it holds cash or deposits at the Fed. If it needs to satisfy reserve requirements because of an unpredicted insufficiency, it ""borrows"" ""money"" ""overnight"" from other reserve holders. It's a sale, but it's marked as a loan."
