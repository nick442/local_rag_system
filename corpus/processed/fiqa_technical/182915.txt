"sometimes. Very often, there is two things at play: with the good ones, you exchange money for a service that cuts down on the time it takes to learn or improve certain skills. This can be done by specific trainings, this can be done by making a digestible summary of information etc. In that case, I don't think it's a waste of time or a waste of money. However, on facebook you see a lot of ""business trainers"" that don't bring added value; the one literally repeating what facebook has in their manuals but charge for it. the ones who are not bringing new insights on how you can improve and run your business, or how you can improve your management skills.. Because as your business grows, you will need to learn more of those and you'll have less time to learn them in. It's about weeding the bullshit out."
