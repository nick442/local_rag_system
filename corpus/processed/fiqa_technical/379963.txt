"This quote kind of shocked me: ""A well-run organization turns over 10% of their organizations, including senior leadership."" I'm not in management, but I have *never* heard anyone say before that employee churn is a good thing. And wanting fully 10 % of all employees to resign every year? That sounds completely insane to me. Is that really normal? Am I not getting something? My current employer works hard on trying to retain employees. When employees quit, we need to train the replacement, it's probably going to take 6 months until the new employees is reasonably productive. Employees are actively encouraged to find new positions within the company and we have actually rehired several employees that quit to do something else and then decided they want to come back. This all seems logical and normal to me. The mindset of wanting to push a significant portion of your workforce away each year is utterly alien to me. Would somebody elucidate me?"
