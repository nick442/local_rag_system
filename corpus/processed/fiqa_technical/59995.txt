I thought the crux of the argument was that they were supposed to offset the tax cuts with an expansion of the tax base through growth. If that story were true (and there's a fair bit of evidence that it's not) then why would they need to cut spending? The reason the CBO shouldn't score the expected growth from a tax cut is because we've seen very little evidence for significant growth from it--and not because we've never seen the long term impacts of a cut, but rather because they didn't result in growth.
