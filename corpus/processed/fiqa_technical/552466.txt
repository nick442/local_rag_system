That is because they don't pay enough. Sure you can get good money in a union from a large urban center, but that is only a fraction of the trade jobs and they never have problems finding workers for decent unions. What they want is someone with experience that will work for an apprentice pay but work at a master's pace. Then the larger unionized companies just use the 'shortage' to hire foreign workers at a fraction of the wage exasperating the problem.
