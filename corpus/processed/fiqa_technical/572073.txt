"To be fair, it *is* super expensive, but you also get payed more for things. I'd probably be making about 10-25% less an hour anywhere else in the US. Granted, I don't want to play myself like I'm super put upon, or even that representative. My family has money, so I have security there, and though I don't have a college degree (flipside: no debt), I'm very well educated. I also know how to cook and am incredibly handy, which probably saves me about $3-5,000 a year. But these are things one can learn if you have the inclination. Point is, people just have an incredibly inflated idea of what ""struggling"" is, and it pisses me off when they try to play a $60k a year income (and probably a $75k+ family income) as ""scraping by"" in New York. It's not. That's a good, solid income. If you can afford cable and an iphone, in the grand scheme of things, you're doing pretty damn well."
