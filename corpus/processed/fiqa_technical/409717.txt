I have to ask: At what point do people take into account their own financial responsibility when it comes to these fees? Don't get me wrong, I've been in that overdraft fee loop before and it was brutal so I took my business else where.. what I didn't realize at the time was that I did exactly what the bank wanted me to do. Either pay up for the bank forwarding money on my behalf, or gtfo. Banks aren't obligated to do shit with our pennies. By asking them to hold on to our cash, they provide a service including all the attached fine print. Trickery is obviously foul play, but so is constantly over-drawing an account. One or two overdraws should be red flag enough that you're not paying attention to your money. But this isn't the case for our culture. We get penalized then act like victims.
