I sold my small restaurant beginning of the year, the fees are not double. Visa mastercard are usually 1.85% plus some extra costs depending on bank. My Amex cost 2.2%. Yes higher, but let's say you do 500k a year, it would be 10-20% of that would have the higher cost not all 100% of the tractions. In the grand scheme of things, it's a drop in the bucket every month. I live in a very touristy area and if I did not accept it, odds are I would lose that 10-20% of sales by not accepting. Some people only carry that card when they are on the beach, boating, riding bikes etc. Only time I've seen double is from shitty banks or processors that gouge the pricing or make people sign 4 year contracts. Etc.
