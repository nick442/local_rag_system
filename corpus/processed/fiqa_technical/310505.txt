You have decided to get a break from work and enjoy a nice holiday by yourself or with your family. Unless it is a fitness retreat you're going to, there's a serious danger of sacrificing your exercise program, which can in turn scratch off any progress you have made. If you do not want to erase a month's' worth of exercise progress, itâ€™s best to stay on top of your game. It is not that hard to prevent any such difficulty by planning for work out during your holiday.
