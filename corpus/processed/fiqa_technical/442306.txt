I'm not talking about the CFA, I'm talking about the entire finance industry, ethics make it all possible. Ethics provides room for trust between entities inside and outside the industry. Think about it, if you are a small cap private company wanting to go public, you **trust** that the underwriter will pay equity holders fairly for their units of equity. If there is no trust in the price, then there will be no underwriting, and no IPO for a new stock to enter the public markets. If there is no trust between fund managers and financial reports, the. There is no trust in estimated prospects and everything will be shriveled into speculative dangerous zones of future uncertainty. There's always a difference between being genuinely wrong and being a liar. TL;DR industry wide standards of ethics builds a foundation for trust which everyone uses directly or indirectly in finance.
