This is rubbish. Universities will be empty long before the price ever gets that high. As prices rise, you sell less product - it's that simple. The US has decided that only a small percentage of its citizens should be able to afford to go to college, making it exclusive. But a smart country makes tertiary education cheap, and encourages people to attend. The fact that should disturb Americans more than any other, is that China has more Ph.D. students *than America has students*.
