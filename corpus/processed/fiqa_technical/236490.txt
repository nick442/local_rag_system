Don't confuse a home warranty with homeowner's insurance. Insurance will cover disasters. Warranty will cover lesser repairs that insurance doesn't cover. You can warranty your own home with a liquidity fund. Stash 1-3 months of salary in a savings account that you can tap out at any time. Water heater blows? Just call a plumber. Leaking roof? Call a roofer. No need to argue with a warranty company for reimbursement. Chances are, you will spend less on warrantable repairs than the cost of the warranty itself. If you're handy, it'll be even cheaper.
