yeah but that wasn't the implication of your statement. it seemed to imply that being 6 8 makes you a shoo in for the NBA. It absolutely does not. The best percentage chance you have to make the NBA according to height is by being over 7 foot, which gives you a 1 in 6 chance. As you go down in height, the stats become exponentially lower. If your argument is that being taller gives you a better chance of getting into the nba, well, no shit. but your statement seemed to imply that being 6 8 would necessitate your acceptance into the NBA. FYI, 6 7 is average height in the NBA if I remember my statistics correctly.
