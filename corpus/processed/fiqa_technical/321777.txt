I think it's also that I see less advertising than I used to. Originally you had a few TV channels, newspapers, billboards, etc. and the consumer was a sitting duck for any crap the marketeer wanted to push. Today, basically no adverts get through my ad blocks (including with youtube). I don't really watch freeview TV, and streaming etc. is free of adverts. I don't touch newspapers. So the only adverts I might see are the billboard type - which I stopped looking at when I was a kid. Hell, any kid today is more likely to have their head in a phone or DVD in the car than be looking out the window. I'd actually say that a company that didn't advertise would have more credibility than one that did. The smart CEO makes sure they appear 'authentic' first - appearing in news stories for what they do, not in adverts.
