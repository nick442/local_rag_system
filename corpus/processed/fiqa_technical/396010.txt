"I disagree with @Sam's answers: yes you will get that money back when your tax return is processed. This is not true. You will receive funds that are in excess of your liability (contrary to popular belief, the government does not take more than what you are liable for). ""is it possible to return the check and modify how it's calculated if I talk to payroll?"" No. When you sign your documents at the beginning of the year, that will dictate the amount of liability they take from each of your paychecks. ""Will this difference be given back in my next tax return"" Because your company is withdrawing 25% on your paycheck you may/or may not need to pay more depending on the rest of your salary. The IRS has set the system up as brackets. You pay your taxes based on the amount earned (voluntarily or involuntarily). So if you have income of $9,275 you would pay $923 in taxes at a marginal rate of 10% (and average rate of 10%). If you made $10,000, you would pay $923+$109=$1,032 with your marginal rate as 15% (while your average rate is 10.31%). All in all, this is dependent on your salary, filing, and other deductions to raise or lower your tax liability. Note: The $109 came from this: [(10,000-9,275)*.15]"
