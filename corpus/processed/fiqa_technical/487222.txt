I could see GM getting rid of all of their non-sports car and non truck model gas versions, but I highly doubt gm will ever kill their gas powered corvette or trucks. Currently no electric truck can match say a Dodge 4500 when it comes to towing 10,000 pounds for 12 hours a day. Those will be around for a long time.
