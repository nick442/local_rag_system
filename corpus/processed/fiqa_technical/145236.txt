"To be in the WH is not a constitutional right, its a privilege. Certain media platforms act like they are an all knowing press ""God"", unaware of their falling popularity. Two more red seats were picked up tonight. Going against Trump usually means you will lose. They normalize violence, spread Russian conspiracy theories, and gave Trump a 1% chance of winning election night. They are losers and I look forward to the media revolution."
