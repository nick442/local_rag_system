"I'm in my 40's, and fully paid off the mortgage early. My ex would have preferred that I'd given it to her as spending money instead. It can be said that since interest rates after year 2000 went down not up, I am a mug to have paid off early when perhaps I could have just bought more stuff like everyone else does. I looked at the 1970 to 1990 average interest rate; about 10%, and thought that it would be imprudent to have a big debt which would be crippling at 10 or 15% interest rates, so I paid it off while I could. A factor to consider is how you expect your own income to change over the next decade. If you work in shops, call centres, taxi driving, import warehousing, language translation, news writing, or anything which can be offshored or automated, then either the expectation of your salary diminishes towards the worldwide typical, or if it goes below Â£7.50 per hour typical then your employer goes bust. Or blags a subsidy. That is, I am a pessimist and would pay off early while possible. I don't know chinese for ""he's not here"" to say to the debt collector."
