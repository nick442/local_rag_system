A private company certainly has the right to make hiring decisions based on whatever criteria they want. The article strongly implied this company was incorporated, which makes it a public institution and that changes things. My understanding is that laws about discriminatory hiring go into effect once a company reaches a certain size (for example, over 15 employees). It can be strongly argued that once a company reaches a certain size it is more of a public institution than a private endeavor. I like very much that companies like Koch Industries cannot discriminate in hiring, even if they aren't a public company. To allow this would enable the systemic economic persecution of any disliked minority. Your blathering about half-witted leftist whiners is unnecessary and takes away from the valid point you were making.
