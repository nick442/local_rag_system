> I think the real question is why do businesses view taking care of their employees as a bad thing? Because if an employee doesn't generate 12 grand in profits for the company its hard to justify spending 12 grand each year on health care for that employee? (And, yes, I checked that number just now: for me to get health care for myself and my family costs $12,000 per year plus co-pays and deductibles)
