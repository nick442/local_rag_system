"Dimon's analysis and conclusions regarding his own lack of leadership and flawed oversight, leaves me frustrated and thinking.. ""No Shit Sherlock!"" For five years we keep hearing over-and-over from an endless procession of Wall Street Elite how nobody understood the smoke-and-mirror shenanigans and that none of them believed that they were involved in any wrongdoing. Each time that this lame conclusion of blaming ""unexpected consequences and complexity"" is offered, are we really meant to accept it? Does anyone accept it? Stating that ""I now know that deceitful business practices and blatant gambling had grave consequences"" is hardly a revelation. Seriously, Dimon had to be the archetype for the **[Captain Hindsight](http://vimeo.com/16315458)** character."
