"i am personally not terribly impressed with their articles, there is one that talks about how they had to do a rebuild of their ""matching engine"", which makes me wonder what was wrong with the previous matching engine.. maybe it was broke or whatever. one of their head people bailed out of the company a few years ago, and they said something that all of this hft stuff really started in 2008, if i read that correctly? maybe hft is a dead dog. then there was the article that attempts to ""debunk myths about the hft business"".. if they were profitable, they would not be talking about debunking myths, but instead they might instead be talking about their profits, lol. bernie madoff was once the chairman of the nasdaq, and i think this is one of the exchanges that sells these high speed connections to these hft firms, which means that the exchange will eventually figure a method to put their hands onto this hft money and they might cut out the original hft firms, as they are no longer needed. i smell a skunk, tradeworx is dead."
