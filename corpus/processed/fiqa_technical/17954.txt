"What you're looking at is something called ""Bridge-Financing"". Essentially, it allows you to borrow your down-payment from the bank, using your old home as collateral. The interest rate varies, but if you get the bridge from the same institution as your new mortgage, they will often be a bit flexible. You take possession of the new home, and begin mortgage payments on it normally. When the old home is sold, the bridge is paid off. Note that the deposit on signing for the new house will still have to be cash. All bets are off if you are talking about a NEW new home, as builders usually require advance payments during the build."
