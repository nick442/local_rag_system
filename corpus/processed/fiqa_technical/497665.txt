Why don't you get a better serving job? If you have all those years of experience why not bartend at a local or try for PF changs or Cheesecake Factory or something? I'm not trying to be snarky, I've got 13 years in the trenches myself. I just wouldn't work at a tgichilibees at my age or with my experience unless I was on some real hard times.
