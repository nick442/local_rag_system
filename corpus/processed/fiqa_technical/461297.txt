"really, so half of them (being born in 1993 or later) are over the age of 30? Are you mentally retarded or being treated for a brain tumor? no jackass, according to the census parameters (millennials = born 1993) render your post idiotic. ""The population of 18- to 34-year-olds is a cohort, which is a group of people that share a common demographic experience or characteristic (in this case, age). [..] There is no official start and end date for when millennials were born."" But the cognoscenti and research cells primary responsible for collating (collecting), sorting this data all operate on the following objective delimiters: ""[..]The birth year of the youngest ranges from ***---> 1993 <---*** ~~to 2010.~~"" And these are the consumers I was referring to, you know the other half you refer to in your flawed, but brief post."
