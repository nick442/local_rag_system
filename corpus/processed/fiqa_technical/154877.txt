"The idea that individuals control the housing prices through supply and demand is HILARIOUS! That's like saying prisoners control the quality of their food. Somehow blaming banks and real estate agents is going to hurt you and make you a victim? That's not fear mongering at all, clearly everything was so very plainly laid out for every buyer in the entire US that all they had to do was sign a single piece of paper that was written in plain English and of course they were never told anything like ""just a formality"" or ""just paperwork"" and ALL of them were smart enough to read through the work anyway and of course the bank associates were nice enough to reject a loan if they thought the people didn't understand the terms properly and..(etc. etc. etc.) TL;DR Good job shifting the blame, surely your well reasoned arguments with summarized backings will get people on your side!"
