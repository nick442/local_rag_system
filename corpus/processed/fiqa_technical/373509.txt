I'm confused why people are saying price and minecraft are the cause of this? Minecraft launched nearly 10 years ago and has been very popular for a number of years. Prices have also been high for a long time. This business had revenue growth of ~25% 2 years ago and still decent growth last year - so I don't think that those factors are the major causes. I do wonder, after being the dominant toy for a long period, if it's not the 'must have' toy for present. Also wonder if their recent releases have been as compelling as previous ones..
