I worked at an Applebees, and this is a good thing. I've never been to a place that treated its workers like this, and I've worked in maybe 10 resturants. We wouldnt clock in til we had our first table, and did our closing side work off the clock so that we could keep our hours down because they would not let you pick up shifts if you were going to get overtime. Because they did want to pay you 3 dollars an hour instead of 2.15 an hour. People were working 50 hour weeks but getting paid for 40 because Applebees couldnt pay hard working people an extra dollar an hour.
