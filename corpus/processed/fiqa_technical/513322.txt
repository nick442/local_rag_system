You're right, I do not fully understand different types of depression. I have suffered it, but I beat it with hard work. It's a daily struggle. I also understand that there are types you can't 'just beat'. I know a lot of people also use it as an excuse. I don't know what category the person I replied to, falls under. I felt the best I can do for him is to work with an assumption, and hope it changes him for the better. If I'm wrong, I'll just be another asshole on the internet. That part I'm fine with.. its worth trying to help someone.
