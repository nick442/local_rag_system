You will need to first try and get the seller to refund. (Get the name of the person you talked to and a date and time). Then you can contact the bank the card was issued through and dispute the charge. I would make sure that you retain any proof that you purchased one item and received something other than what you purchased. The seller does have recourse if they did fulfill their side of the transaction but if they are a legitimate merchant and actually sent you the wrong product most will not bother.
