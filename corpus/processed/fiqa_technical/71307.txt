Reducing supply doesn't cause demand. It may shift the equilibrium price, or supply can fall even faster than demand. Certain goods are pretty inelastic, such as food - people will still pay for it even if the price goes up because the alternative is starving to death. In that case you have a point that cost of production puts a price floor there. For completely elastic goods such as bitcoin which have no intrinsic use or demand beyond people that think it is a speculative investment, it's a totally different situation. Why is it that I find in any discussion about bitcoin the pro bitcoin side has not even a high school level understanding of basic economics?
