"Most of the work done as an analyst or associate depends on whether or not you are assigned to a deal at the time. If not, you're probably going to be working on pitch books, which is basically putting together a firm template-style powerpoint file ""pitching"" a company to a potential client. The pace is slower, but the work is boring. If you're on a deal, then the stress level is raised as you have to respond to client demands and timing immediately. You are typically doing some basic forms of analysis/modeling and then importing that into a powerpoint report. You are working on these reports endlessly, turning review comments from associates, VP's, and MD's. As you get higher up the chain you do more of the dealrunning (communicating to all the various parties to the deal, third party diligence, buy-side, etc.) and client-facing activities. You can find a lot of good info on the finance industry on wallstreetoasis.com. I'm personally in transaction services doing diligence work at a Big4, and I've always found WSO to be a good resource for at least basic info. You obviously need to weed out the people who are dumbasses/don't know anything (current students), but plenty of guys actually in the industry post regularly."
