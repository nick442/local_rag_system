There was a book written by Harry Dent in the early 90's that talked about the approaching demographic problem. The simple version of his theory is that people spend the most money between 45-49, after which people begin to become a drain on the economy as they utilize government benefits and begin draining retirement plans. Boomers are moving out of this range and there is no group substantially large enough to follow them, according to him, until the mid 2020s when the Echo Boomers come through. While he had some things way off and, u fortunately, seems to be overcompensating as of late and only hawking his newsletters, he had some great points in his first book. To me, you can't fudge those numbers and what he said makes a lot of sense. That seems to be very similar to this article.
