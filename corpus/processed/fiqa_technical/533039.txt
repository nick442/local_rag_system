I think the bank is effectively just cheating you out of some money, and you should complain - and learn from it. i do regular wire transfers between different currency countries, and fortunately, the bank's website lets me chose the currency I want to transfer in - but they ask at least five times if I'd not rather have them convert it because it might be sooo much cheaper than having it done by the bank on the other end. This is free money for the banks, and each side would love to get it.
