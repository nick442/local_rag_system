As many have said consult a bankruptcy attorney and think of it this way: Are you realistically going to be able to pay off said debt (less the student loans, you cant escape these in bk) in the next 7 years? If not, strongly consider bankruptcy. It'll fuck your credit for 7 years, but if you're going to be pinching your pennies to barely cover interest for >7 years anyway, who cares. Further, you don't need more credit anyway, so who cares if you cant get it. If you do plan on the bk route, be sure you're comfortable with your job prior to filing. It will obviously fuck your credit score and many employers check said score when hiring. Chances of switching jobs are diminished to some extent. EDIT: On a second note, 11k in debt is not that much money. Take a second job. Sell shit. Sell drugs. Sell a kidney. Do something. 11k is not hard to earn. But earn it now before exorbitant interest rates turn it to 22k, then 44k, etc.
