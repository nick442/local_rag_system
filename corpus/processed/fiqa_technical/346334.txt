"Its called propaganda. This ""user"" is a freaking bot that keeps posting anti-trump threads. Take a look, the ""user"" has over 7,000 karma and 0 comment karma. They don't even try.. It has posted over 500 different threads in the 2 months it has been active, without making a single comment. Take a look at what all the threads are about, I'm sure you will be shocked. its probably a bot for /u/postnationalism as he loves to spam with propaganda and fake news articles too. He is probably a bought account turned to a bot too! This sub has turned to garbage."
