The middle class in Europe is much poorer than statistics would reveal. Why? Because despite higher marginal income tax rates, taxation in Western Europe is highly regressive. Low and middle class Europeans have to pay a lot more for energy & consumer goods than Americans. Quite frankly, that's what matters to most people in life. Stuff. Big cars, big houses, a closet overflowing with clothes, the latest gadgets, etc. Even poor Americans have all that. Most Europeans don't.
