I really like wireless charging, not a deal breaker though. I find the larger screen more usable. I rarely use my phone for calling anymore, so the increased size if helpful. My phone spends most of its time held horizontally. I also really like the customization. I know this isn't for everyone. I am a tinkerer so I like android for the same reason I like PCs. There is just a lot more freedom. Apple products are great but I find them more like appliances they work and typically they work well. I like my nexus devices I have had for their bang for the buck value as well. I like buying an unlocked device for a great price. I occasionally travel for work and I like having an unlocked device. I also hate being locked into a contract, so the purchase price really helps compared to an iPhone. My biggest problem with android is the lack of accessories. I wish we had the amount that apple users do. It is all worth it though. I am open to having an iPhone. I am always looking over the fence but I feel their high cost of entry will keep me away unless something amazing happens with them.
