This is the thing - you will have to pretty much live it for the next ten plus years (far longer than you need for a PhD). You can become a heart surgeon in less. The question is if you don't make it all the way, would you still be happy? If you have an interest in financial mathematics, then I would add that it isn't all Citigroup. There are plenty of other places in financial institutions (both large and small) that can be more interesting and possibly less demanding than actuarial work for less work.
