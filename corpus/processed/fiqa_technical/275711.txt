">If Nike went bankrupt, should Lebron James NBA salary be taken from him? Well no, because Nike doesn't own the NBA (that I am aware of anyway),but LeBron might lose his endorsement income via Nike. The point I am trying to make is bankruptcy law (both corporate and personal) were put into place for individual protection. It affords us all a kind of ""do over"". To make it a regular business practice, and in some cases it's your ENTIRE business plan is (in my opinion) unethical and a manipulation of the laws."
