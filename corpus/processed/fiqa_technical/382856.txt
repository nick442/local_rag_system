Here's a real fact: NO President can make the stock market perform. Only the private sector can. One more: Obama has been the poorest job creator, probably ever, and had led the slowest recovery from recession in US history. Oh: And most people that run businesses and hire people cannot abide this administration and their regulation heavy/high tax approach to running things. Until Obama is gone there will be no great job growth.
