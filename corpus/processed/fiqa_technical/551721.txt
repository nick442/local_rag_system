"Uhh, you don't have to read the comments if you are sooo worried about people like me ruining reddit you dumbass. And yeah, I'm not so weak minded that I allow a exchange with a moron on the Internet to fill me with an anger that persists over a period of weeks. I had my fun shutting you down then you went and ruined it by spitting nonsense an concluding your poorly thought out statements with such zingers as, ""eye won teh web fight! Now I report you to mods for being jerk!"" So yeah, I'm not bent out of shape, mad, or upset. People I have never met don't have that power over me. However, I wish I could meet you to see if you are for real."
