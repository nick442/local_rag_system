I've asked myself that question many times but this problem seems like by far the most likely reason I didn't get an offer. The behavioral interview went smoother than any interview I've ever done before and I really clicked with the interviewer. The other case in this round was pretty easy. I wrote out all my calculations, verbalized my thought process at all times, and the numbers i got in the first case worked out perfectly, with the interviewer basically confirming I had gotten it right. In this case my interviewer's nonverbal cues were telling me I was doing it wrong throughout the entire second section, and like I said, he basically seemed to give up on letting me try to work it out with a good chunk of time still left in the allotted time. I'm also sure I was a serious candidate for the job as the company had spent a fairly large amount of money flying me out to their headquarters, putting me up in a hotel and paying for my meals. Competition was pretty fierce as far as their backgrounds vs mine but this case really seemed to have been the real cause of my undoing.
