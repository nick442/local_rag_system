"Companies often provide cafeteria, or catering services, to employees tax-free at subsidized rates. I'll use ""cafeteria"" as an illustration. The IRS says that in order to avoid lunch being taxed as income, the employees must pay the ""direct costs"" of the lunch, food and labor. In addition to those costs, cafeterias add two more items to come up with the total tab; ""overhead,"" (the cost of renting the space), and of course, profit. The company can waive the last two, and charge employees only materials and labor. That's why subsidized cafeteria food can cost as little as half of what it would cost elsewhere."
