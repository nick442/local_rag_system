"That's fortunately a lie that government public schools taught us. There's no factual basis to it. [Myth of the robber barons](http://mises.org/daily/2317) Rockefeller had nearly 90% of market share in oil while over a 20 year period Standard Oil lowered the price of oil from 58c/gal to just 8c. You see, in a market, you can only gain a ""monopoly"" by giving the customers the most value. Government is a monopoly who uses coercive theft (taxation) to finance its services and sees taxpayers as an unlimited ATM. Correct, the risk of *other governments* is what makes us think we need our own government. However, the huge losses of production from diverting resources to a military that spends more than the next **25 countries combined**, as ours does, prevent the development of competing security and paramilitary groups, such as Blackwater. Military and police, afterall, are just individuals being paid to protect someone's property. We have MUCH, MUCH less control over the govt than we do corporations. Notice you have 100% control over which company you buy from? You have 0% control over whether the govt takes money from you. Having a 1 in x,000,000 vote is basically 0.00000x% say in your own spending of the tax money. When you buy a product from a company, you have 100% say in your own spending. The contrast is day and night. You have complete control over a corporation. If AT&T gained the power to tax you to force you to buy their product, and only let you vote every few years on which one of 2 CEOs they have to spend the 30% of your money they take from you, you might start to see my point here."
