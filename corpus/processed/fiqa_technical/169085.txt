I do online grocery shopping directly with my local supermarket. Its great. I keep a basic list of recipes/supplies I use pretty dependably every week. I add them all at once. Then I quickly pick through them to fine-tune and bam, done. 15 minutes while drinking mai tais in my underwear. Schedule pickup for the next day on my way home from work.
