While Warren Buffett is an amazing investor, he does have the benefit of having his working career start around mid-WW2 and ride the baby boomer phenomena afterward. While there were bear blips in the past decades, there never really was much of a bear market outside the 70s energy crisis and inflation of the early 80s that nevertheless still could be leveraged for gains unlike the Great Depression. The question really is, will the next generation be so lucky? Idk, could be but I'm a doubter. He's right in his criticism (I wouldn't bet my retirment on Bitcoin) but the same critique could apply to the US dollar in parts (which admittedly has the fundamental strength as being accepted for US taxes, but as a consequence also severe drawback in being tied to the economic welfare and trust in the US Government). In the end, bitcoin and Warren Buffett are at fundamental odds. Bitcoins is for, among other niches, Currency and Market pessimists (around the world btw and not just US-centric) and Warren Buffet is a product of his time and generally an US-centered optimist.
