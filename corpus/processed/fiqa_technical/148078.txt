>Is it illegal to support the president of the United States? You act like people aren't allowed to have differing opinions from you. A whole heap of people who think we should let bygones be bygones and unite behind our Orange Overlord seem to be the same people who wouldn't be caught dead supporting the president during Obama's terms. Basically every GOP member of Congress and their entire voting base. So where was the call for unity and civility from 2008-2016.
