>some of it is actually decent investigative reporting lol. Businessweek could draw up a better article here than Vice. > Of course, you have a strong opinion adamantly against it, so I am guessing you really don't ever read that content. One I did read it. Two I am against it as most of what Vice does today is clickbait and journalism on the same level of Buzzfeed which is low. The Atlantic, Time, The New York Times, etc all do far better investigative journalism than Vice does. If you think this Vice article is good investigative journalism I don't know what to say.
