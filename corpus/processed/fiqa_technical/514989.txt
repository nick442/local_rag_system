Can you learn how to evaluate operations efficiency without working at McKinsey? Also, how many people does McKinsey employ? It seems like every consultant in the world is either working there, or used to work there. I don't think I've ever had a conversation without hearing about them. Do they just do all of the training for the consulting field?
