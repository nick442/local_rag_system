We had planned to be in Siem Reap in January 2017. In December 2016 my Mother-In-Law passed away from the effects of Dementia, which she had battled with for 11 Years. We were forced to abandon our Vietnam/Cambodia holiday. One day we'll get there. And when we do, I'll make sure we give you as much business as we can.
