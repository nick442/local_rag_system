Moderation is key to everything, and I even mention it at the first part of my bit there (yes, excellent, productive pot smokers exist), but based off of the trends in the states that have legalized it, we are heading in for quite an interesting experience in terms of marijuana abuse. It's just like an 18-21yr old kid at college, away from their parents and has the first unrestrained access to alcohol. They usually overdo it. And to second my original intent, it's up to the business/owner to determine if they want to discriminate or not against drug users. If you have a problem with that, seek employment elsewhere.
