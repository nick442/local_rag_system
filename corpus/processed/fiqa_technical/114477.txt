Isn't this really the same as the adoption curve for any new personal technology, though? It starts off being the sole province of a handful of fairly-well-off nerds who don't mind wasting their time on something that may end up being a technological dead end, then becomes a high-end rich person's thing once it's proven useful or enjoyable, then as the market expands, it gets cheap enough to benefit everyone. Think of it from the point of view of the people or companies producing the enhancements. Production will get cheaper over time (possibly going close to zero if the enhancements are stuff like retroviruses) and there's usually way more money to be made in high-volume sales than in boutique products if the costs of production are low. I think the history of technology over the past century says it's pretty likely these kinds of enhancements will go down in price enough to be affordable by millions before the kinds of social problems you're talking about have time to emerge. Rich people and enhancement hackers will always be at the far end of the curve, but they won't be alone on the curve, and anyway, _someone_ has to be trying out the new stuff before it's ready for mass consumption.
