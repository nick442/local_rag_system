I get where you're coming from, but wouldn't it make your life easier to post the salary range you're looking for so that you don't have to waste your time interviewing those who believe they're worth more? Having a stack of resumes means nothing if 60-70% of that stack would never consider working for the salary you have in mind for the job you're looking for.
