With enough money in the emergency fund to get rid of the car and still have a cushion, I would definitely get rid of it, as the car is not needed. Your car is only going down in value, which makes the current setup even less desirable. In essence, you are paying over $300 a month for something that, every month, is worth less and less. Since you are paying over $300 a month and it will take about $3000 from your emergency fund to get rid of the car, if you start putting that $300+ back in the emergency fund, in a mere 10 months you will have replenished the emergency fund.
