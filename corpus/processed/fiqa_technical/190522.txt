I didn't realize that was twitter. You're right that it doesn't sound like there is one, but it also doesn't sound like there isn't one. If business guy was generally more reasonable I'd assume there would be as generally you'd get one first. But just because he's unreasonable now doesn't totally exclude the possibility. On the facts as we have em you're right but seems there very reasonably could be more based on his comment and general situation.
