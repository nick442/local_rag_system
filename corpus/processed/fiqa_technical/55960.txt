My first apartment was a large 750 sq foot studio apartment. I am sure you could find a smaller studio apartment. There is no reason a minimum wage employee should expect to live in an average apartment when they make below average wages, they should expect to live in the least expensive housing type or with their parents. Originally, minimum wage was for a kids first job, not for an adult working fast food. At some point kids stopped working in high school. I had jobs in high school. In the last 10 years something changed.
