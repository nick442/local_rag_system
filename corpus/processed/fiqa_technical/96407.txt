Their shifting strategies from simply a medium to provide content that others have made to a content producer. That takes money. As long as the investments pay off and they pay their debts on time its should be fine. Ultimately I think they have no choice as content is increasingly streamed from the internet. What need to content producers like HBO need from content providers like Comcast and Netflix. People can buy HBO directly and watch it as long as they have an internet connection. Netflix doesn't provide internet or communications infrastructure like comcast and verizon and they weren't a content producer so they were going to be obsolete soon. Producing and owning content that others want to purchase and using that content as a way to make the netflix platform more valuable to other content producers seems like a good strategy to me. I actually don't think they have a choice. They still may not make it and my bust, but using debt to pay for the strategy they have decided on is not going to be the reason they fold. Its just a means to an end and its one of the only means they have available right now.
