I recently decided to splash out on a music system for the house which included a turntable - I used to have a proper DJ setup but that's long been sold off and most of the records are of a genre I don't listen to now, but I wanted to enjoy the records I *do* listen to and also buy some more. One thing that struck me when listening through albums is how much more closely I listen to each track. When it's not part of an endless Spotify playlist, when you physically have to get up and flip the disc over every 3 tracks or so, you pay so much more attention to it and it becomes a much more pleasurable experience, rather than just 'background'. It's more labour-intensive but that's a good thing. Good music deserves your attention. Edit: Also, for all the replies to this that sneer and make out it's just a fad.. buying a vinyl offers so much more in terms of a physical product than CDs or downloads. I have a copy of Kanye's 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' and the actual design of the triple gatefold and all the included artwork is amazing. Yes it's more convenient to just get Apple Music or whatever but that's not what we're talking about. It's the reason people go a decent steakhouse rather than McDonalds.
