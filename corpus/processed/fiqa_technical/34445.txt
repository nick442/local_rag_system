They have to follow the same rules as taxis because they *are* taxis. Sure, change the taxi laws. I know several cab companies that would love to fluctuate their fares based on time of day. Oh, it's 2am and you want a ride home? Sure, that'll be $10/mi, payment up front. The big complaint here isn't the competition, that's fine. It's the fact that they aren't following the same regulations, i.e. breaking the law, where the cab companies still have to obey the law. It's not a level playing field. The cab companies in my area have told the city if they don't kick Uber and Lyft out they're going to stop paying their licensing fees, and that's about $2m ever year.
