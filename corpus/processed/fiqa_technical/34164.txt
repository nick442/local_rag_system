"Prop 13's benefit to ""the rich"" is incidental and, frankly, minimal. Check out these maps that I grabbed from a title records. I searched for data on single family homes that were purchased (ergo assessed value is based on) between 1900 and 1980. Arbitrary, but it'll do for our purposes. I'd speculate that if I were to have picked 1970 or earlier the number of homes that are assessed at far below market value is negligible relative to the tax base as a whole. Here's Coronado Island: http://imgur.com/572yTZI The peninsula in Newport Beach: http://imgur.com/dFMcrZ1 The San Francisco Bay Area: http://imgur.com/a/NMZz0 And a zoomed in area of the Bay: http://imgur.com/a/NMZz0 If a parcel is outlined in green, it's assessed based on a purchase date prior to 1980. Outlined in white means after 1980. In my eyes, the big takeaway is that the number of homes which were purchased prior to 1980 is minimal. Even in the Bay Area, where the zoomed out view suggests that there's a lot of those homes, when you zoom in and realize how densely populated the area is, not very many homes are assessed on outdated values. (For example, on the Coronado map, the number of homes purchased pre-1980 was 47. Pre-1990 was 179. The search shows a total of 2,859 single family residences in the map area.) You can argue that it's a dumb tax policy, but as social policy, I don't have an issue with it and I'd still contend it's largely negligible. It's a battle that doesn't matter. A skirmish when compared to 1031 Exchanges, basis step ups, the massive decline in personal income taxes for the upper brackets, etc. Our tax policy as a whole is skewed and becoming more regressive (or, to the GOP, fair) all the time. Not entirely unrelated, but I did some research and played with some numbers about income taxes because it's something that interests me. Using this link: https://taxfoundation.org/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2013-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets/ you can see that $10,000 income in 1950 (which is about $100,000 in 2016 dollars) was taxed (I'm using married filing separately throughout): 20% on the first $2,000 22% from $2,000 to $4,000 26% from $4,000 to $6,000 30% from $6,000 to $8,000 34% from $8,000 to $10,000 The highest marginal tax rate was 91%, which applied to all income over $200,000 (just over $2,000,000 in 2016 dollars). Median household income in 1950 was $3,216. So the median american paid a maximum marginal tax of $22%. If you do the math, our median household pays 20.8% of its income in taxes versus 26.4% for the $10,000 income household. Fast forward to 1970, where our $10,000 CPI adjusts to $15,975 and median household income is now $6,186: 14% on first $500 15% from $500 to $1,000 16% from $1,000 to $1,500 17% from $1,500 to $2,000 19% from $2,000 to $4,000 22% from $4,000 to $6,000 25% from $6,000 to $8,000 The highest marginal tax rate has dropped 23% to 70% from 91% and our median American is paying a maximum marginal tax rate of 25%. Skip forward to 2010, where our $10,000 CPI adjusts to $91,504 and median household income is now $49,445. 10% on the first $8,375 15% from $8,375 to $34,000 24% from $34,000 to $82,400 28% from $82,400 to $171,850 33% from $171,850 to $373,650 35% above that The highest marginal tax rate has dropped another 50% from 70% to 35% and a total of 62% from the 1950 rate. Of course, this is all skewed because the more income you make the better able you are to shelter income from taxes. A family making median income is unlikely to be able to take significant advantage of tax shelters."
