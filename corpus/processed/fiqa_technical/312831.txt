Incorrect. However, as the head of the organization, he bears the lion's share of responsibility for what the organization does or fails to do. At the very least he has displayed a criminal level of negligence and incompetence. I find it hard to believe that someone so incompetent would be selected to run a multi-billion dollar enterprise, which leads me to believe that there is some level of complicity between Corzine and those who were more directly in charge of this fraud.
