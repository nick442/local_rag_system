Just FYI, you're being downvoted because there's no such thing as a free lunch. We've all signed contracts and licensing agreements preventing us from doing exactly what you're asking. I sincerely doubt anyone will put their job or access at risk for you. Of what possible benefit is it to me to get you this data, knowing that there are risks to providing it? You've got two choices: pony up or go home.
