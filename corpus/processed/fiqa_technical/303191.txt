I can't see how. Portland raised their minimum wage by 50 cents a year ago ($9.25 to $9.50), which is probably not enough to drown any restaurants that aren't already in trouble. The plan for $15 minimum wage is a gradual increase over 5 years. The next increase will come July 1st, as far as I can tell. That will be the one to watch.
