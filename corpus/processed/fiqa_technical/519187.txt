I think I found a simpler way to analyze this question: The U.S. Bureau of Economics publishes data of what sectors of industry contribute what percentage to Kansas GDP, and as of 2015, agriculture was ranked 7th at only 5.5%. What's more, Brownback has previously exaggerated the extent to which agriculture contributes to the economy, saying before that it's over 40% of GDP. Definitely seems like a good starting point.
