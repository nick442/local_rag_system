"> First, you give this gray topic of Medicare Part-D where Trump promised to act upon, but has yet do anything. Am I right? If you think the topic is ""gray"" and the issue is Trump ""has yet do anything"" then you haven't put in the time to understand why I think this is an issue. > Global Warming? It's Trump fault? It appears you didn't put in the time to understand my issue with President Trump and global warming either. > Because the Paris Accords, like the TPP, and like NAFTA, and the Iran Deal, etc, etc, etc, are scams to hurt the USA and make the USA pay more. Nothing else. Oh wow, you have drunk deeply from the Republican cool-aid. For what it is worth, you are being lied to and manipulated. There is a lot more (or less in a few cases) to these deals than you have been told. FYI, when you think the only reason people would be championing a policy you disagree with is that those people are evil, you might want to dig a little deeper. > Since you are an expert with Global Warming.. All right. > Who has bigger air pollution, coal power plants, cutting trees, environmental disasters, etc? The USA or China? Currently? China, China, USA, USA Historically? USA, USA, USA, USA > ..is it true that deserts are now becoming green? No, [deserts are growing](http://www.dw.com/en/holding-back-the-growing-desert/a-18620447). A few spots where plants are now growing in the desert does not change the global trend. > Most trees in the world, which are in Russia and not the Amazon, are green longer? It is thought that the warmer temperatures will delay them losing their leaves in fall. [The warmer temperatures will also kill many of them](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-fate-of-trees-how-climate-change-may-alter-forests-worldwide-20150312). > Global warming happened before, many times in earth history before the industrial revolution? Yes, due to [Milankovitch cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) and the Earth releasing methane and CO2. > Also ice ages? Yes, again caused by [Milankovitch cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles). We don't expect another ice age for about 40,000 years. > Oceans did not rise? Oceans and continents have risen and fallen a lot in the history of the world. Usually these kinds of changes come with huge extinction events. > I am not worried about Global Warming. It has negative things, and positive things. That is too bad because it will will come with about a hundred negative things for every positive. > Do you have any idea what will happen in the world, 20-30 years from now, when we stop raising cows, pigs, goats and sheep? That would be great but that won't be enough to stop global warming. It is also may never come to pass so it is a bad idea to do nothing today expecting technology to fix our problem tomorrow. > You should be more worried about China and what this country and all its people do the earth. Maybe so, but then President Trump should be implementing a plan and taking steps to minimize the damage in the future. Instead he is ignoring the problem and rolling back what few preparations Obama made."
