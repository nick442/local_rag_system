Agreed. It will always be a fringe device. Have you ever used a Roku? The UI sucks, and you cant even get full use out of it unless you: 1. Have cable and hook up all of your channels to it; or 2. Install a custom firmware (illegal) that gives you all of the channels and content anyway. A lot of people cut cable and buy a Roku to find out that it sucks.
