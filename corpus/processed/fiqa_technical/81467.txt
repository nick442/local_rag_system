"It's really not an ""either-or"".. it's BOTH. They each have their place & use. * 2-sided business cards are best thought of as **""miniature advertising brochures""** (shirt pocket/wallet-sized) -- great for certain types of businesses -- and for being generic (and cheap) handouts at show booths, conventions, etc. (Plus you can issue a stack of them to ANY employee -- 2-sided cards should be ""company"" cards, *sans* any individuals names or contact info -- just the general company phone number, website, etc). *Other than being mere ""advertising"" one useful option is to make the back of the card have something VALUABLE on it (something that makes the person KEEP it) -- calendars, industry reference info (chart/table/common calculations, etc).* * 1-sided business cards are **personalized ""calling cards""** (logo, person's name, title & SPECIFIC contact info, phone + ext, email, etc -- in addition to base company info) -- you use them when meeting people SPECIFICALLY & PERSONALLY -- and you want the back to be blank for you (or them) to scratch notes, etc. (in fact even leaving some white space on the front is a good idea).
