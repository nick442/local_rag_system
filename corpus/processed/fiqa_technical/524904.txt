I know this is pulling at straws and something I am against but how is this different than when some Mississippi businesses decided they didn't want to sell to gay people? Again, I hate that my state did that and I am not for racism but it seems that Reddit was in arms against this yet I have seen many posts like this that is similar and your argument is basically what the business owners said as to why they didn't want to sell to gay people. In your opinion, what is the difference? The businesses were not publicly owned, should they have been afforded the same leniency as Reddit is showing now..because they were not. Again, completely against racism and what MS did, but why is it ok to hate on one type of business and not another?
