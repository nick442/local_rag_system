I agree we should be efficient with the food we produce, especially meats, but I don't like using food production efficiency overall as an encompassing statistic. It comes with all sorts of problems largely due to artificial fertilizer productions, extremely demanding GMO plants, and of course overall pesticides. Pushing for extreme yields out of fields using artificial fertilizer can result in disastrous circumstances down the road. Over utilization of a field gives better returns now but we can't do that indefinitely and depletes the top soil of many micronutrients and healthy bacteria. Over time yields will decrease and, if it ever gets taken that far, you end it with more dustbowl problems. Even if you stop before it gets that bad you then have to suffer years of less than average yield to build the topsoil back up to health just so you can get average yield again. And then there is the problem of how artificial fertilizer is made, which while currently necessary to produce enough food (currently 50% of the world's food is produced directly due due to use of artificial fertilizer), it utilizes fossil fuels both as reagents and to burn for power to fuel the process of turning fossil fuels into fertilizer. If we really want to be sustainable we should be utilizing more farm land to make up for reduced yields from avoiding as much artificial fertilizer as we can.
