I super appreciate too giving me so much time. I'm in England so, no GameStop here - we have game.net and they're like a monopoly at the moment. My marketing strategy will be VERY innovative and I'll be using American e-commerce style affiliate system to have organic growth. (America is always a step ahead from the world and what ever gets big there, gets big everywhere sooner or later)
