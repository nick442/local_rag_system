">1. Clean the toilets. Show that you're willing to do whatever it is you're asking your people to do. LOL. Too true. It also gives you a (pardon the pun) whole *shitload* of ""ground-level"" evidence regarding how your employees (and/or customers) feel about your operation (and also in many ways reveals how your company feels about/treats employees & clientele). People who *respect* and *appreciate* the place that they work for or patronize .. help keep the place clean. Businesses & employers that appreciate their customers & employees make certain that the environment & workplace (ALL of it, including the toilets & bathrooms) are nice, clean, well-equipped, properly maintained, etc. >My largest mistake early on was not being able to say ""you're incompetent at this job and you're fired."" Instead I gave a wishy washy ""we don't really need you anymore"" and they filed unemployment falsely. Actually, with the ""reason"" that you gave, those people were **perfectly entitled** to claim unemployment -- you didn't ""fire"" them for cause/incompetence.. the language you used clearly indicated that you **laid them off.**"
