Inequality feeds volatility. Too much money in too few hands. The money is hot. It is either hoarded or wagers are placed on rent seeking investments. Precious little is invested in plant or equipment. Wages are too low. We unlearned everything Keynes taught us from the Great Depression. That's why the down cycles are stronger and the up cycles are weaker. Low wages are why labor participation is falling. Yes, Virginia there is a Santa Claus, but he can't help us from our determined efforts to sabotage our own economy.
