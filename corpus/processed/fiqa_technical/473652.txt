Think of your stupid, most incompetent friend. Now think if you want them to support themselves, if you want to personally support them for the rest of their lives, or if you want them to die so they aren't a burden. That's really what it all boils down to. Even if we make the assumption that the person's bad results are due to their stupid decisions (not due to their stupid biology but their stupid choices), then the answer is what? They die, somebody else takes care of them, they take care of themselves. If taking care of yourself requires a really good brain, excellently made choices, and a superior work attitude, then a lot of people will fail. If taking care of yourself can be done with a poor brain, a variety of bad choices, and a simple willingness to work, then a lot of people will succeed.
