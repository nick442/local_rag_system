Since I have been banned at /r/aviation for desk-thumping the severe Trump criticism of Boeing (whose construction of Trump's overpriced Boeing Presidential aircraft was faulty and subject of a recall) I cannot post at censorship-happy, headchoppers'-haven r/aviation this notice that Russia has arrived in the AirBus/Boeing comfy zone. Probably China is next.
