> You know what scares the shit out of giant militaries? And again you avoid my question. Instead of giving a reason why your proposal won't devolve into anarchy you just claim my example of anarchy is a good thing. I'll bet in school when asked a math question about a guy buying a dozen cantaloupes at the store you just claimed that nobody needed that many cantaloupes and expected full credit. I'm now convinced you haven't seriously considered the effects of what you propose.
