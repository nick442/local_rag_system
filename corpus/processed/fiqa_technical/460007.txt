It's difficult when you read every few sentences and a new phrase pops out. I'm not procrastinating here, I feel getting an overview of it here while I can ask specific questions about terms I don't understand will help me more than just reading it on my own. At least that's what I've found. I'm not smart and I learn better this way.
