>I want to work in an environment where I can advocate for myself and, occasionally, negotiate for better compensation. Some people aren't good at these things, and frankly, that sucks for them. I'll eat their lunch if they let me. Isn't that kind of the point? If you can't advocate for yourself using negotiation tactics, you're left with the options of increasing the scope of your job or increasing your skills.
