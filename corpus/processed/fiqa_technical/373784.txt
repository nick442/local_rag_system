Mental conditions such as dyslexia , dispraxia and even forms of autism commonly occur amongst the old familes in the UK . If anything they give people who have them an edge because they have to work that much harder to deal with the problems . The UK , like a lot of Europe , has a strong emphasis on civility and social skills and , as such , anyone with mental conditions is not given a free ride . They are understood and supported but they are expected to get their act together .
