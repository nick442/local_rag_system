Can I bring a bankers cheque or DD from singapore bank . Yes you can. Remember if they are payable in Singapore, i.e. SGD denominated, they will take time to clear; typically around a month. Alternatively you can approach an Indian Bank in Singapore they can arrange for a Rupee draft payable in city of your choice. The Banks also have a facility of opening an NRE account in the city/Branch of your choice by opening account with wire transfer. I do not have time for NRE account Money can be transferred into your NRO account as well. You could also use remittance services that provide better exchange rates.
