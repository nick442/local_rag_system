You know what lowers wages? Social safety nets. *NOW*..before you read that as advocating for the removal of social safety nets, hear me out: A low-wage service company would, in the absence of any social safety net, be required to pay employees far more. Why? Because employees would be required to cover all of their needs with their wage. No food stamps, Medicaid, etc. What, then, would higher wages do? It would cut back on the need to spend on social safety nets. Higher wages provide employees with the ability to cover more of their own needs with their labor income. Unfortunately, this is a chicken-or-egg problem. I would never cut social safety netting before advocating for higher wages, because I wouldn't leave people out in the cold without needed assistance. So where do I stand? I advocate for higher wages *first*, so that we can gradually decrease taxpayer funded social safety nets for working Americans later.
