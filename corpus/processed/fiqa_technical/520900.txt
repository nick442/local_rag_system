Ok opinion but too bad it's not supported by data in the article. The opinion is backed by a survey of opinions, not actual inflation and employment figures. If prices are rising generally (and not just in individual commodities), why isn't that being reflected in inflation and employment numbers? Wouldn't we expect to see gross employment numbers trending downwards and inflation trending upwards since the beginning of the year?
