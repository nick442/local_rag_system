"Okay.. graduation rates along with the number of reported salaries (and virtually every statistic you can think of) are reported in the ones I'm looking it. Have a look for yourself: Just journalism: http://www.grady.uga.edu/annualsurveys/Graduate_Survey/Graduate_2010/Grad2010MergedB&Wv1.pdf School wide: http://www.unl.edu/careers/survey/salary.shtml There is NO MISREPRESENTATION of information here. The graduation and retention rates are also reported. Do you seriously think that prospective applicants look at these numbers and think ""Wow, everybody graduates and this is what all of them make!"". If they do, that means they are stupid, not that the university is trying to deceive them. I realize the statistics may be skewed, but why in this case would they be skewed negatively? Why would somebody not report their low salary or unemployment? Wouldn't they, like seemingly everybody posting in this particular article, feel indignant that the school let them down with their education and want to accurately portray their salary/unemployment. Let's go ahead and assume that the salaries are actually skewed lower. The school puts the numbers right there, you can see how many people responded. All I'm trying to say is that universities are not lying to anybody, at least mine wasn't. Also, it is possible to make your point without name calling, using ""LOL"" as if what I say is laughable, and accusing me of not understanding things."
