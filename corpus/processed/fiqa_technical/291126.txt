If you're willing to take on higher risk than a corporate investor (you have to be) and you are smart it's way easier to operate as an individual. Your position/strategy is SO much easier to execute just simply based on trade size, you have relatively no overhead. You won't impact the market at all which is where a heavy hitter might have an advantage, other than that you are in a better position in terms of return vs investment.
