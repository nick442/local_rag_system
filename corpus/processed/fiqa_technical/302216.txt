I wasn't disagreeing with you, but I can understand why you might have that knee-jerk reaction. I was pointing out that people have been banned from the main subs because they spoke out against left wing dogma. Which, for the record, isn't necessarily better or worse than right wing dogma, it's just the controlling force in our society right now.
