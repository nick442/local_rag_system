I don't necessarily think anyone strives to be a one-man shop. But he makes an excellent point about the mentality of the business owner. You get a type-A personality running the show and they want to do everything or micromanage because they feel they do it better. A business can only grow so big with that mentality--I've seen it first-hand too many times.
