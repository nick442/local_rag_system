"not trying to be insulting, but i would contend your response should be the one dissected in econ 101. why? because yours is the theory du jour among business interests and economic commentators in the media. the fact is that this brand of ""free market"" capitalism rests on a series of impractical assumptions. first is that investors are perfectly rationale allocators of capital. from this, that excess capital is invested - at all, let alone in a productive fashion. next, that taxation (presumably what is considered ""high"") has caused unproductive investing practices, when in fact the inverse is true - decreases in effective income tax rates (personal and corporate) combined with the reduction of passive taxes (like the estate tax) have resulted in the incentive for investors to sit on their capital and do nothing to return it to the system. finally, and perhaps most egregiously, that investing profits back into expansion and worker compensation is misallocation of resources. the entire article serves to demonstrate that this line of thinking is a self defeating concept. giving precedence to the relatively elite investor class ensures that capital is allocated according to their whims, and often times that simply means into their bank accounts. this starves the system. so i don't expect to change your mind, but i would like others to know that what you are saying is widely debunked, chicago school nonsense that gets a lot of air time from self serving interests across popular media. a few hours of unbiased research will make this evident. it is somewhat ironic that the theory has limited standing academically, as it works only in an academic/theoretical setting."
