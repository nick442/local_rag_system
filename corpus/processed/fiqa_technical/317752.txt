I have always thought that Netflix should go the Amazon route. Amazon has been opening up bookstores in Seattle, San Diego, Boston and other cities over the last couple of years? Recently, retailers (fashion and the like) have been keeping their brick and mortar stores as essentially giant billboards for their online store - a migration from physical to virtual. And with Amazon, we have officially crossed over to a time in which an entirely online retailer is establishing physical locations. I'm not saying that business has changed its mind about e-commerce or anything. Rather, it's proof that no vendor, not even Amazon, can do without an [omnichannel](http://www.visualnext.com/business/what-is-omni-channel-and-what-are-the-benefits/) approach to commerce and marketing. **TLDR: Forget passwords, Netflix should definately set up Blockbuster-like stores.**
