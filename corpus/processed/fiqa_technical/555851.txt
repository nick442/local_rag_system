">I fucking hate it when I see another rich kid acting like they came from slums Where did David Knopf claim he was from the slums? You got a source for that? >and worked their way up the ladder How do you know he didn't? Life is a bell curve. Some people climb the ladder much faster than others. Some people may climb because of nepotism. Some people genuinely are better than most other people. You think everyone should rise up at the same pace? Move to Japan. >delusional twats much like yourself believe that you can earn anything with just some ""hard work bruh."" Not just hard work, but also talent. If everyone works the same amount, those who are more talented will *generally* have more success. Of course, some is subject to chance, some people have a head start, etc., but in general, that's the way that the world has proven to work. >About every successful silicon valley startup such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Snapchat were founded by kids with very prominent parents. Yeah, Microsoft. K. So Bill Gates grew up with upper middle class parents. Know what? So did a fucking *huge* amount of people. Know how many are as rich as Bill Gates? Fucking none of them. He had a head start, absolutely, but that doesn't take away his success. He's done more with what he was given than any of his peers, and likely more than anyone regardless of beginning income level could do. Zuckerberg's dad was a dentist. Upper middle class, but if you're *really* being honest with yourself, you'd realize that there are almost 200k dentists in the US alone, and yet there aren't 200k multi billionaires. Hm. Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, was the son of a professor who immigrated from Russia. Steve Jobs was the adopted child of two blue collar workers. Of course, if we move out of just Silicon Valley, your narrative really, *really* falls apart, since Silicon Valley of course has a little bit of a lean towards the wealthy, as computers aren't cheap and getting started in that arena requires the use of a computer. [Take a look at billionaires in general](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2010-12-06/twenty-billionaires-who-started-with-nothing). Most billionaires [did not inherit their wealth](https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/self-made/#7d08bb1941cb). And, something like a [third](https://blog.adioma.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/from-poor-to-rich-billionare-infographic.jpg) of the richest billionaires came from 'poor' parents, in addition to simply not inheriting their wealth. >whats the fucking difference between someone who inherits their money and someone who practically has a trust fund? A trust fund is a sort of an inheritance. I'm not sure why you're bringing this up? >Again he is not self made. He's just an extension of his parents achievements.. Source? I saw that someone who shares the name Knopf is wealthy (posted in this thread), but are those actually his parents? Do you have proof of that? Or are you just guessing that since he's made it to an executive position and shares the name of someone wealthy, that those are his parents? Further, *if* those are his parents, how does wealth from publishing transferring into a job at a consumer staples company work? Why is your first assumption when you see someone successful that they had it handed to them? Why do you need to selectively choose a small subset of people (Silicon Valley startups) out of an already limited group (billionaires) to be able to even attempt to make your point?"
