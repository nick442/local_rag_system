No. There are no short cuts to pretend you know something even though you never used it. It's like saying you are truck driver by reading a book on how to drive trucks. Find an entry level job in accounting/finance, and hopefully it will be using SAP. Even better: take training about how to use SAP for finance, in a school that uses SAP for hands-on training. I doubt it's easy to find such training.
