ATM to ATM transfer is not possible. Do you mean to say account to account transfer using an ATM machine? Online transfer between account or between an account and credit card is possible. Almost every Bank offers Online transfers using Internet Banking. The person wishing to initiate a Debit must subscribe to Internet Banking. Once you login to Internet Banking, you would need to add beneficiary Account [account where you need to transfer funds]. Adding of Beneficiary at times takes a Day for the Beneficiary to be activated. Once the Beneficiary is activated, you can transfer funds. The funds are credited to Beneficiary account within 2 hrs. If the both the accounts are in same bank, then some Bank's ATM's [HDFC / Citi etc] allow you to transfer funds between account using the Bank's ATM.
