So thinking on this a little more, I guess it's not completely cut and dried. For example, if the sales position was commission only, a bonus might be a way to ensure the sales team earn a base minimum income. This would allow them to have some level of comfort that they would be able to meet financial obligations like mortgages, kids school etc.
