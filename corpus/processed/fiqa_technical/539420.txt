Did you read [Hachette Book's response to Amazon?](http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2014/hachette-ceos-response-to-amazon-advocate-emails-why-we-price-books-the-way-we-do/). Hachette books is **not** arguing that their ebooks should be the same price as the print versions. That's an outright fabrication on Amazon's part. [Amazon is responsible for 65% of new online book sales, and 41% of *all* new book sales](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bea/article/62520-bea-2014-can-anyone-compete-with-amazon.html#path/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bea/article/62520-bea-2014-can-anyone-compete-with-amazon.html) (that's both print books *and* ebooks). I never said Amazon had a *monopoly*, but by refusing to sell any of Hachette's books, they are literally depriving that company of roughly ~~half~~ 2/5 of it's new book revenue.
