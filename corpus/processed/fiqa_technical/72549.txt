"It's a risk free investment only if you have 100% warranty that you will be able to sell these stocks for a better price than what you've paid. And that's virtually impossible. I don't think there is any ""risk free investment"" when stocks are involved. You can try to minimize the risks and consider them low, but IMO it's dangerous."
