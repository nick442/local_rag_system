I would like to open a bra shop, since where I live we have Victoria's Secret and nothing else. I have a name and logo thought out, and always keep an eye out for reasonable locations. I've talked myself out of moving forward with it, because it seems any time there's talk of a store fancier than a Walmart/Dollar store coming to town, everyone gets on about it being a working class/blue collar town, and how no one can afford x/y/z. Good bras aren't cheap. I'd also need to hire staff, because I'm not keen on being that close to people. I've daydreamed about bars and restaurants, with questionable, kitschy themes.
