Plenty of people were upset when cars replaced horses, electrical trams and trains as the primary source of transportation. We are still trying to constrain urban planning sprawl from the advent of car culture which currently is unsustainable. Asphalt prices will be 3-4x higher in 20 years, million of miles of road are vulnerable. If we had listened to many of the naysayers back then we would have foresaw some of future costs in makng a suburban culture for 100's of millions of people is impossible long term without severe economic and environmental repercussions. Even electric cars require power to be generated somewhere and the length of a commute is only increasing in most metro areas. Installing light rail as a band aid solution is going to run into imminent domain issues, costs and unknown amount of construction time.
