He talked about JPM's investment in blockchain tech, not about bitcoin's blockchain network. So you are right in the sense that these cryptos have their own blockchains, and he is correct that JPM and many large corp are looking at blockchain technology. Bitcoin as a currency is a make believe store of value, full of fraud, and right now a lot of FOMO investors chasing it. But I wouldn't call it a bubble because it has not popped yet. Bubble is usually backward looking.
