Because companies (big or small) only pay taxes on *profits* rather than *revenues*. It can't be any other way, really, because of the $5 you pay for the big mac, most of that goes to pay suppliers and employees and only perhaps $0.50 would be profit. But that fact also opens up all sorts of loopholes. For example, a US company can license a patent from a Cayman Islands company, and make yearly payments. Thus, the US company no longer has any profits, and all of that money winds up in the Caymans. That's a trivial example, but there's an entire industry dedicated to doing this shit. I'd be impressed if you could craft any law that banned this without also banning legitimate international commerce.
