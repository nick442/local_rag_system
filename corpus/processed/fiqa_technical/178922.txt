Y'all have your language switched around here. An unqualified audit opinion is the best, meaning the auditor believes the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Illuminate is correct though, that firms can be reluctant to issue qualified or worse opinions. Issuing such an opinion can lead to bad client relations and, worst of all, a lost client. However, if it comes down to the line, a firm will more likely drop a client instead of issuing a qualified or worse opinion, as those open up the doors to litigation.
