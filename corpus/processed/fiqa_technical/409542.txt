This why economists hate people like OP: They only read headlines and abstracts. >Given the importance of low wealth at retirement in explaining low wealth late in life, this paper begins by exploring the factors that are associated with low saving before retirement. We pay particular attention to the links between education, health status, and wealth at age 65 and at the end of life. We examine the distribution of lifetime earnings, a key determinant of savings capacity, and calculate a “saving ratio,” the ratio of wealth at retirement to lifetime earnings. This ratio depends on a household’s saving 2 rate over the life course, as well as on the rate of return earned on this saving. We also present new evidence on how health and family status shocks affect the trajectory of wealth after retirement, and in particular how they affect the likelihood of reporting very low wealth at the end of life.
