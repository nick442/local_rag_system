I use Amazon all the time but they are hardly a monopoly. I buy from other sites as much or more than I do Amazon. It's big and has great customer service but not always the best prices. They are far from being a monopoly and the chances of that happening are super simple. They'd have to run every single online store out of business and that's impossible.
