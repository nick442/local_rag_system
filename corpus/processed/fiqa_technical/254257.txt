You could get a Multi-Currency Cash Passport which has no transaction fees for deposits or withdrawals. (You can pick one up at Australia Post.) This allows you to load it with money now in US dollars. The exchange rate is locked in at the time you load it to the card. When you're in the USA, just use that card or get the cash out from an ATM so you can deposit it into a US bank. To see the exchange rate they charge, you can scroll to the very bottom of their Fees and Limits page at there's a nice little table you can compare with. Otherwise, they've got a calculator tool.
