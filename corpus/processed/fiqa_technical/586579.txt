> First of all, any boat or yacht is a terrible investment. The depreciation is horrendous. Can you explain why the depreciation is this way? I don't know much about yachts or boats, so I honestly don't know. Why would a boat depreciate faster/more uncontrollably than any other large asset? Is it because technology is improving too quickly? Because wear and tear on boats is particularly great, even after minimal use? Or because of the relative impossibility of keeping the boat maintained at a comparative speed to its depreciation? Funnily enough, my dad has a boat and the cost of mooring and maintenance is far greater than they joy he gets out of it. That said, I was unaware of the quick depreciation thing.
