I wasn't talking about cs I was talking about finance. Don't apply your own lens to my comment and then tell me that you think its wrong. And besides that I'm calling bullshit on the prereqs. Every major has pre reqs you just have to plan your schedule. Obviously it varies from school to school and if you go somewhere where there is an important pre req that's only taught once every year or two, yeah you have to plan for that shit or you get fucked. But I refuse to believe that any class has a chain of four pre reqs in front of it, such that you could not complete the chain in two years, or four semesters. And that's not even counting summer semesters, a great time to make sure you're pre reqs are covered if need be.
