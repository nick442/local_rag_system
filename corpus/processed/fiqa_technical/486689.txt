Stimulus diverts money artificially without actual demand for the sector where it goes, delaying the natural recession that comes when demand tapers off. People spend money when they are better off buying an item. Economics is organic, people trade to improve their lives. Artificially lowering the cost of some services and items (or lowering interest rates) by increasing the deficit only delays the natural decline of demand for whatever services receive stimulus. It was exactly this that caused the Great Depression, when the money supply was expanded (stimulus) by 2/3, then contracted. The 20s boom was created BY the government, artificially creating the appearance of demand, incentivizing overproduction.. then when the real demand doesn't materialize, a depression follows.
