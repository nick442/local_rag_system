Facebook is non dividend paying. It's up over 300%. Berkshire is non dividend paying. The only thing it's stopping is that stock from gaining 10% more because more stock isn't being bought with those sweet sweet payments. And that stock price doesn't create jobs, and neither did lowering taxes on stocks. You know what creates jobs? That money being taxed and put back into the economy.
