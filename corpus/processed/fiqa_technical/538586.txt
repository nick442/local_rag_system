Exactly! I've been asked to buy a homeless man a burger at the Johnny Rockets by the House of Blues. I mean, we went just TWO BLOCKS away from the boardwalk once to hit a liquor store (because the boardwalk store had a 26 dollar 6-pack of Dos Equis), and I was scared for my life (granted we were walking at 11pm-ish). It's the ghetto.
