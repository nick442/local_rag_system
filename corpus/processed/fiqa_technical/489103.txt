"Ask your trading site for their definition of ""ETF"". The term itself is overloaded/ambiguous. Consider: If ""ETF"" is interpreted liberally, then any fund that trades on a [stock] exchange is an exchange-traded fund. i.e. the most literal meaning implied by the acronym itself. Whereas, if ""ETF"" is interpreted more narrowly and in the sense that most market participants might use it, then ""ETF"" refers to those exchange-traded funds that specifically have a mechanism in place to ensure the fund's current price remains close to its net asset value. This is not the case with closed-end funds (CEFs), which often trade at either a premium or a discount to their underlying net asset value."
