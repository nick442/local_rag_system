"This is a poor argument. If I could make $500 an hour but could only work 1 hour per week, I'd be broke and still ""more successful"" given your example. Salary divided by hours worked (or even effort for that matter) ignores economies of scale. Just because you're efficient on a per unit basis doesn't mean you have the same potential as someone else that can ""sell"" more units than you."
