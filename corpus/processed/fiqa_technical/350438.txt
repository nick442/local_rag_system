That's an interesting assessment. I had a good read. I suppose it would be weird if we had more government. We only have 4.5 million people. I suspect effective government is a fairly low bar as we have plenty of improvement to make in a range of metrics. We are damaging the environment because of a lack of regulation on farmers activities. Many rivers in the South Island are not safe to swim in now. We have very high and growing income inequality. We are behind the times on drug reform and our incarceration rates and recidivism rates are an embarrassment. But importantly our system of governance (MMP) is more representative. We restrict campaign spending to small amounts of public money (you see a few billboards and ads on TV) which is proportional to the support that party has. We allow no outside funding although there has been some instances where private businesses have attempted to influence elections and the various parties are semi-frequently caught (and fined) for trying to skirt these restrictions. I think that's the main reason we manage to get things pretty right in a haphazard trend towards good policy over time.
