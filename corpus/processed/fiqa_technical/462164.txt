"The economics in this are pretty, let's just say weird/off. US looks richer because of borrowing money therefore it's currency appreciates in relation to other countries? I don't see the logic in this one. The outsourcing jobs overseas phenomenon is a long term one. Firms don't do it cyclically with recessions. Recessions might force the hand of some firms to outsource but I don't see businesses suddenly bringing those jobs back en mass when a boom occurs. It also ignores the fact that when firms outsource, they can provide goods at a cheaper rate domestically thereby bringing down some costs. The decrease in costs might even make it cheaper for businesses to operate thereby allowing enough savings to hire more people. Who knows, the whole effect is somewhat ambiguous. To simply select the worst possible scenario and explain only that is pretty obvious bias. "".. When Uncle Sam can no longer pay it's bills"" The video says it like it's a certainty. Somehow he knows for a fact that the US will default soon yet the Investment Banks with teams of analysts don't."
