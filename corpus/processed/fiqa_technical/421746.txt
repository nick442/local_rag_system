"I think anyone will agree that the ""optimal"" rate of taxation is the goal but what is optimal? It depends on your scoring metrics, the optimal solution to one problem might not be the optimal solution for another. You bring up the Feds but that confounds the issue because now we have to talk about monetary policy, taxation is fiscal policy In general lowering taxes increases capital investment regardless of the investment rate, the firm has more money they are going to spend it somewhere"
