They are contractually agreeing to terms that govern how penalties apply to a deposit that involves how wedding party guests review the hotel on Yelp. Its certainly possible to challenge this in court, but it isn't a first amendment challenge. Maybe something more like just disputing the charges and asking the hotel to prove the review was left by a particular wedding party member.
