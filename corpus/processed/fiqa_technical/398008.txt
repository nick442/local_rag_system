My point is that success has nothing to do with luck. There may be some degree of random chance, but a successful person is one who has learned to minimize any aspect of random chance in their lives. If you go to a dive bar and get into a fight and get stabbed in the neck you aren't unlucky, you just weren't smart enough to avoid that dangerous situation in the first place. There were a hundred chances for you to make a responsible decisions to avoid that *unlucky* incident. You go out on Friday night, to go to a bar, to go to a *dive* bar, to get drunk, to not say excuse me when you bumped into that gang banger, to raise your voice instead of backing down, and by your logic him sticking a knife in your neck is nothing but bad luck.
