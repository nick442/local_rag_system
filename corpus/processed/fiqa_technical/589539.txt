"As others have noted, in the U.S. a checking account gives you the ability to write a check, while a savings account does not. I think you know what a check is even if you don't use them, right? Let me know if you need an explanation. Personally, I rarely write paper checks any more. I have an account for a small side business, and I haven't bothered to get new checks printed since I moved 6 years ago even though the checks still have my old address, because I've only written I think 3 paper checks on that account in that time. From the bank's point of view, there are all sorts of government regulations that are different for the two types of accounts. But that is probably of little concern to you unless you own a bank. If the software you have bought allows you to do the things you need to do regardless of whether you call the account ""savings"" or ""checking"", then .. who cares? I doubt that the banking software police will come to your house and beat you into unconsciousness and arrest you because you labeled an account ""checking"" that you were supposed to label ""savings"". If one account type does what you need to do and the other doesn't, then use the one that works."
