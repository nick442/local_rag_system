Another thing that's often overlooked is the hiring of felons. I'm not going to say I support it. But now adays companies can pay $1 and get a nationwide background check that often includes even things that were expunged off records. In the past as a felon you just had to go to a different state and you could get a job anywhere. Most didn't do background checks anyway.
