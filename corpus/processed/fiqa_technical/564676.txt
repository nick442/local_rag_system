"> So you don't think two ""lost"" decades going on three I do think that's a problem for them. It's been a horrendous waste of potential. However I believe it to be policy mistakes - eg, why raise taxes if your problem is not enough spending? That's what the Japanese-government-owing-too-much-yen crowd will tell you to do, but the [consequences](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/08/13/japans-gdp-falls-by-6-8-in-the-second-quarter-on-sales-tax-rise/) of doing so should have been obvious to anyone. If Japan had simply understood that they're not revenue constrained in terms of yen, they could have run sufficient deficits to keep growth high. Instead they chose not to, forever trying to cut their deficits to something more ""sustainable"". Cue 2-3 lost decades. >a debt of over 200% The market doesn't believe it to be a problem, and anyone that's ever bet against the Japanese government has lost their money.
