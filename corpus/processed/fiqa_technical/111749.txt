They most likely went to the debt markets for the money. I'm only saying this because it's still cheap to borrow money and Bezos has a history of borrowing money for acquisitions, especially in the early 2000s (most of which Bezos later regretted). Amazon obviously has huge cash pile but why would you ever use your own money when you can use someone else's?
