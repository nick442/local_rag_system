I assume you are referring to the emoluments clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution) That clause has never been applied to any president. Even Washington and Jefferson enriched themselves off their personal businesses. They even traded and received payments from foreign nations. You can run a business as long as you charge a fair rate. You cannot however accept gifts or titles.
