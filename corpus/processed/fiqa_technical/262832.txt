You really need to calm down. Theres no need to get angry over some useless post on the internet. Are you saying that if the government took away apple products, the people would overthrow the government or riot or something along that line ? Because if thats true, thats quite pathetic. The government could also just ban apple from selling its products while still manufacturing them in the country or just block the app store. The government knows what power it has and apple has to keep in line to be able to keep doing business there. For someone living in china, you really dont seem to see that. And hundreds of factories ? dozens maybe, not hundreds. Also your english is very good. Kudos.
