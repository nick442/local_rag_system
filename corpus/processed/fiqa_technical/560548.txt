Looks like some sources are [confirming the acquisition for $970 million.](http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/25/amazon-could-steal-twitch-acquisition-from-google/) This will be interesting to follow, it looks lower than what had been rumored. Amazon shareholders will be happy, but those involved with Twitch may not be as excited. It almost makes you wonder what happened since the early reports make it look like Google was outbid. If Google really did offer $1B, you have to wonder what happened/changed.
