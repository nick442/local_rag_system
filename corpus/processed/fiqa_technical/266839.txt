I assume you're informed and not an idiot until you give me a reason to suspect otherwise. Espousing the same or similar nonsense as a group of predominantly uninformed and idiotic people counts as a reason. There's no redeeming silver lining in that perception. I figured I would mention the perception you're giving because it completely undermines the persuasiveness of any point you're trying to make, regardless of how valid your point might be, by affecting your ethos in a detrimental way.
