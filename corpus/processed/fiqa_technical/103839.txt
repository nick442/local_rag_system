I went to Atlantic City in 1990 or so, and other than learning that the Monopoly game properties were named after the streets there, it was a gross, run-down town with a bunch of substandard casinos. I've not been back, but in the mid 2000's I had a number of friends go and tell me it had really turned around. Is this recent downturn new, or are those friends just idiots?
