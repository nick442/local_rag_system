The sad thing is, most Americans are in deep financial shit due to the fact that it is expensive to be an american. Unlike your financially astute self, many are in debt. To those people, tanking a 35 dollar fee for overdrafting is much better than waiting the next day for your paycheck to come in and having your credit card bill go up by a thousand. So, when banks begin taking advantage of bad situations those people get pissed off. So really, most Americans are too far gone down the financial cliff to even worry about managing overdrafts, so although well intentioned, this advice won't really help most.
