"*Selfish capitalists..sigh Look. We both agree that large concentrations of wealth should be redistributed. I personally believe in a heavy Estate Tax, the rich are limited on what you can pass on to kids & spouses. I think that would solve a lot of problems honestly but that's just me. We both agree on taxes, I am more than happy to pay my 30% & understand the benefits of it. I would argue I, and many other high income earners, can do more good with compounding my money and giving all of it away upon my death and living off of the interest but I doubt I would be able to convince you of that. What we disagree on is the definition of hard work. If 1 man make 10 spoons an hour and works really hard and another figures out a way to work smarter and can make 100 and work less... Every economic theory agrees you should pay the man who made 100 spoons more even though the man who made 10 might have worked ""harder"". If my father choose to join the military and was very smart and able to lead well, you give him a stable career. If I was efficient at planning my college major, career, and investments, I get paid more, have less debt, and am able to save more and compound my savings into capital. *Results are more important than hard work, or to be frank, the effort you put into your work doesn't mean shit, it's all about productivity. That's why you hear the common ""participation trophy generation"" from older generations. So no it isn't luck, but I doubt I can change your mind. I used to think like you until one day I told myself, no more excuses, I am in charge of everything about my life. From that day I have been methodical and obsessive to make the smart choices in life that allow me to be happy. Just food for thought."
