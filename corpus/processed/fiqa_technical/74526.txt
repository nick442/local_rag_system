You create par levels for everything in the restaurant with set ordering times. For example at my pizza place we order everything except produce on Wednesday nights and Saturdays with deliveries coming Monday and Friday. Order produce so any vegetables and fruit we use on Tuesday Thursday and Sunday. Everything in the store has a shelf life and is labeled with the date it came into the store. Once you have expected product usage you just adjust to the projected sales volume so you don't run out or over order product. Also FIFO is and important part of managing food cost. Always make sure that the oldest product is used first. Let me know if you have any other questions.
