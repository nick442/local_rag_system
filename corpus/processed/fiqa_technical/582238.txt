"The type of ""office job"" and the level at which you're expected to perform (usually relative to the compensation) need to be considered. Just because you know Susie, the slacker data entry specialist I, can play on Facebook and Snap chat in between her poor attempts at being productive doesn't mean that all office jobs are like this. Susie probably isn't expected to get very much done and is most likely compensated as such, most likely less than a good manufacturing or laborer's job."
