You have no idea where interest rates will go. A year or two ago people thought 3% was absurdly low, why buy them? And then interest rates dropped even further, so the people who bought then got more interest AND the present value went up since then. If you'd done nothing you would have lost money. Now, rates are REALLY absurdly low. What do? Well, they could drop even more! It's possible. We could also have 20 years of flatline - see Japan. Sitting on your hands loses money. What else should you do? Put your money in risky equities? A lot of people these days are buying dividend paying stocks now. It's extremely foolhardy to treat stocks as fixed income because they are very far from it. Overextending yourself and taking on too equity risk, IMO, is FAR more risky than accepting low interest rates+interest rate risk. Finally: I don't exactly use bonds to make money, I use it as a safe haven while I wait for stocks to do something. Stocks go up, I sell some and buy bonds. Bonds go up I sell them and buy more stock. It's nice to get a little interest on the side but not critical. I could use cash (or 1month tbills) but I'm comfortable with the amount of risk-return that 5-10year bonds provide.
