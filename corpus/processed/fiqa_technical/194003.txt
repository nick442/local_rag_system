Sure. Even Milton Friedman called Hayek's economic work unreadable. Much of the Austrian economic foundation rests without as solid of a philosophical or mathematical foundation as most other schools of thought. I suppose the easiest way to understand this is to look at three foundational works. I recommend reading each of these anyways, but skimming, and paying attention to references, should give you a good idea of the varying levels of rigor introduced into each school of thought. [Leaf through Das Kapital](http://books.google.com/books?id=6TfTS9ITW7UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Karl+Marx%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NdrYT4yNCdLH6AHThdSoAw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=inauthor%3A%22Karl%20Marx%22&f=false) This is Marx's primary treatise. It is far older than the following two that I will present. Nevertheless, it, perhaps more than any other book, played a pivotal role in the 20th century. [Leaf through A General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money](http://books.google.com/books?id=xpw-96rynOcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22John+Maynard+Keynes%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LtrYT43YIamJ6QGuoL2cAw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=inauthor%3A%22John%20Maynard%20Keynes%22&f=false) This is the foundational work of the Keynesians. There is much more here than simply the advice to increase government spending to stabilize demand during economic downswings. And it has been probably the most widely accepted work by the greatest number of economists over the 20th century. [Leaf through the Theory of Money and Credit] (http://books.google.com/books?id=hHnIHlCm_CcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=von+mises&hl=en&sa=X&ei=59rYT4HbDKqG6QG2te2PAw&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=von%20mises&f=false) This is the Austrian Treatise from Ludwig Von Mises. It is the newest of the three. It is also likely the least rigorous. But please, judge for yourself. Von Mises did do some more rigorous work in other areas. But all schools of economics ultimately rest on their theory of capital. So, before you pick which church to belong to, it's worth reading their respective bibles.
