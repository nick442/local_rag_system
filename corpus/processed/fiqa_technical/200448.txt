> Mercedes and BMW both produce around 60,000 of their similarly priced level vehicles (S class and 7 series respectively) per year. Audi produces around 35,000 8 series vehicles. Ridiculously contrived analogies. Audi produces almost 1.5 *million* vehicles every year, and Mercedes a similar number; BMW produces nearly 2 million. Each of them *actually* make (& sell) more units in a single month than Tesla is claiming to be building the *capacity* to produce in a year. And that is *without* all of the subsidies and tax-credit advantages that Tesla is leveraging (much less the free press).
