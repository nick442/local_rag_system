"Now, how many seats was JetBlue actually able to sell at that price? They sold out every flight almost immediately after announcing this. Everyone is shitting on American for charging >1K for ticket prices. These are full fares that are normally sold less than 1% of the time. Optimally, airlines never seek 100% of their seats, they try to sell about 90-95% and save the rest of the seats for business travelers going somewhere last minute or for passengers that had an emergency on the other side of the country. Because there were so many flight cancellations, and virtually no seats available anywhere, the algorithms were trying to ""protect"" that availability for walk-up ticket purchases."
