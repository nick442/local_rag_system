I listen to the JRE frequently (also Schiff's podcast). Peter Schiff is a gold bug so he's going to have some biases there and against crypto. He does have some very interesting things to say and I like the guy (I'm very familiar with him), but at the end of the day, he's a salesman. BTW, I'm diversified into physical metals myself, hold as a hedge against the dollar. Crypto/cashless is where things are going, but I think that's still a ways off. It's way too volatile right now to be used as money, it's filled with speculators hoping to make some easy money. Governments will want to track every transaction so they can tax it. Plus, if you can't take your money out (i.e., cash), they can easily take rates negative, and negative rates are already a reality abroad.
