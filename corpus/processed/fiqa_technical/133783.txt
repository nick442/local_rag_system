Do you really believe that in 6 months in office, Trump did nothing about the economy or trade? Yes or no? Before you answer, here we go: * Donated his pay checks. * Repealed 14 Obama regulations via CRA saving $60 billion in costs to the economy yearly per American Action Forum * Directed Depâ€™t of Commerce to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing * Cut 1.6 billion costs from Air Force one and F-35 airplanes * Regulatory freeze on all federal governmental agencies via EO signed (1/30/17) * Making agencies cut 2 regulations for each new one. OMB reporting that as of June 2017 the real ratio is closer to 16 to 1 per Washington Examiner (07/19/17) * Sec Ross has slapped more than $2 billion in fines on China and Canada for illegal trade practices. * Food Stamp spending is down almost $1 billion per month and $12 billion per year per USAD * Killed TPP * **[And much much more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6w7zm4/real_trump_news_updated_082617/)**
