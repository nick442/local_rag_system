Have you bought computers since? Could you afford a computer back when you were building them? I remember my upper middle class friends owning computers back then, and I believe they paid around 1200 for them. Inflation adjusted, we should be paying just shy of 2k for a PC today, and yet you can buy a basic desktop for 500. You may have personally felt the sting from outsourcing, many people have. Many people also felt the sting when their typewriter companies could no longer compete with the computer companies. This isn't the 50's when you could work the same job 30 years. Today, many people have to go through several career changes in their lifetime.
