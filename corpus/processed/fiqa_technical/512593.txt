The irony is Walmart would probably get more of my business if they hadn't copied Amazon and gone the market place route. Their online site is a disorganized mess without any of the customer service or guarantees you get from Amazon. Their one strength would be if I could go on their site check the inventory and go pick it up at the local store. Instead unless it's an absolute emergency I just order from Amazon and wait the 2 days for delivery when I buy the same type of products I used to purchase at Walmart.
