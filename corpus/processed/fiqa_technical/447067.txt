This label does not cover [protoscientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoscience) or [fringe science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_science) theories with limited support in the [scientific community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_community). Also, it does not mean theories that were never widely accepted. Some theories that were only supported under specific political authorities, such as [Lysenkoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism), may also be described as obsolete or superseded. >==== >[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/k5AlkZB.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cellarius_ptolemaic_system_c2.jpg) - *The obsolete Geocentric model of the universe places the Earth at the centre.* --- ^Interesting: [^Imponderable ^fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imponderable_fluid) ^| [^List ^of ^topics ^characterized ^as ^pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience) ^| [^Falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) ^| [^Caloric ^theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjip1kq) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjip1kq)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
