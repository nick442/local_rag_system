> There's no entry path into these jobs. A lot of companies only seem to want to hire people who somehow earn these skills through osmosis and don't want to hire people on straight out of school. At least in my case, I have several positions open and would most assuredly hire someone straight out of trade school. I have already set aside the budget to have them trained on our software platforms anyway. It would be great to actually find someone with 3-5yrs experience, however these types are hard to come by, even in this job market. 4 year degrees are a dime a dozen, finding people who have learned a concrete skill such as CAD/CAM, machining, welding, etc are not. I can't just hire someone who has no training whatsoever either, nor can a hire someone who has a 4 year engineering degree, given that they are likely to up and leave when the opportunity arises, and after we have spent thousands of dollars and the time to have them trained. Baby boomers have dominated these blue collar manufacturing jobs for decades. They are now retiring in droves leaving prime opportunities open for those willing to take advantage of them.
