"> Or just remember how much you spent. The purpose of my comment was to say the online balance isn't a true balance, not that I had trouble balancing a book. Except that you rather obviously *don't* comprehend what the meaning of ""true balance"" is. The balance the bank shows on it's online system (or it's statements) is very much a ""true balance"" **of the transactions the BANK is aware of** (i.e. the ones that have been processed). That you think the bank should somehow be ""magically aware"" of the fact that you just signed a credit card transaction -- or that you wrote a check and mailed it off to someone -- demonstrate that you lack a fundamental comprehension of the system. And the ""just remember how much you spent"" as an excuse for not properly (independently) **recording (and mathematically subtracting)** what you have spent.. Is demonstrative of both ignorance AND laziness."
