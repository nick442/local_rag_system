Okay. As someone who is quick to be appalled, let see how actively you practice what you preach. For movies - give me the list of studios that are okay and not okay. Give me a list of movies from those studios that you would have otherwise paid movie to see that you will now abstain from seeing. For books - give me the list list of publishers that you are okay with and not okay with. Give me the list of books that you are abstaining from reading that you would have otherwise paid for. For videogames (this is the easy one) - same thing. For music, give me the list of labels that you are boycotting and the list of albums that are released under those labels that you will sacrifice your enjoyment of listening to. I would be appalled that you yourself would not even know from your selfless sacrificing, which artists/musicals/authors/actors/film makers/labels/publishers/studios you're denying revenue if you're so hung ho about telling people to follow your lead. I would be appalled but not surprised if you're talking out your ass though. TL;DR; you're appalled that I'm seeing new dark knight even if SOPA passed? I'm appalled that you're full of shit.
