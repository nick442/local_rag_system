"They used to pay over 90% during the glorious 30s (1940-1970). All of this is about the capture of politicians by the rich (both Democrats and Republicans) and the balance of power between labor and capital which has tilted on favor of capital. As Warren buffet cheekily said: ""there is a class war and we are winning it"". With the free movement if capital, it's super easy for the super rich to get their money out of a country. Now regarding the""fairness"" of taxes and their level, if you posit that taxes take away your hard earned work, then both 10% and 90% are unacceptable. It's like a thief arguing he only stole 10% of a bank, how is it more or less acceptable? Of course, I don't subscribe to this logic at all, I just want to point out that either any level of taxation is fair, regardless of the level, or unfair. There aren't any ""in betweens"". To finish, I would use market mechanisms to set taxation. Taxes on the super rich should be gradually increased until there is a noticeable effect on productive investment."
