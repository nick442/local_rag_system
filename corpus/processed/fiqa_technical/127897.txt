Automation is different than mechanization. Before we replaced physical labor with machines, soon we will replace mental labor with algorithms. I do believe it will ultimately create a better society for everyone, I just see it being a bumpy road getting there. Right now humanity already has enough money and resources to feed everyone on the planet and give them all health care and education. Every single person. The problem is all those resources are locked away by the 0.01% of people who own all the wealth and isn't circulated in the economy. With automation, the problem will get even worse unless we do something about it. Imagine mega corporations that literally run themselves, only benefiting the owners. It doesn't look pretty
