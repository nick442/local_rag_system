Yep, I thought this was how it was done in almost engineering disciplines. Extremely detailed spec sheets, but not blueprints. It's obvious why.. making blueprints for a manufacturing facility you don't know anything about is difficult, and I'm sure it results in a nightmare of trading plans and revisions back and forth between the engineers at home and at the contractor, as well as duplication of engineering talent (and cost-saving was the reason Boeing was subcontracting in the first place). NASA didn't provide blueprints when doing the original Apollo mission (arguably the best example of gigantic subcontractor jobs), they provided extremely detailed specs and watched progress like a hawk. The main problem sounds like the subcontractors were subpar and not properly managed.
