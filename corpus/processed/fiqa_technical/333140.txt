You can rehypo securities which are regulated by the SEC. No funding ladder with any counter party will Accept non-security assets (which loans btw aren't securities like bonds). We see the same in the broadly syndicated loan market. TRS loan facilities are just now developing into more mature vehicles to the point where banks are structuring collateral upgrades through writing fully funded participations to SPV's and borrowing treasuries from a counter party who has a lien against the SPV (oc'd of course) but that's a bespoke and uncommon solution. Most banks are still funding these TRS facilities with unsecured funds. The repo market is ultimately the robust and tradional means of securing funding against loan assets. Middle market and broadly syndicated repo are most common but ABS desks will often times reverse repo while loans or asset backed loans in addition to their normal warehousing businesses.
