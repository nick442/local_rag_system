"The main villain in Robin Hood is the Sheriff of Nottingham who is referred to as a ""tax collector"". It was most certainly a government that Robin Hood was stealing from. Robin Hood never stole money from private citizens. He didn't steal from rich shop owners, or farmers, etc. He stole exclusively from the local government, who kept raising taxes."
