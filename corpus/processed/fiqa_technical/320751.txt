You cannot just transfer or rollover from a traditional to a Roth IRA, because they are taxed differently. You'd have to do a distribution from your traditional (which will be taxed and possibly penalized, depending on your income and age), and a contribution to your Roth (which is limited based on annual contributions to all your IRAs). A conversion is not limited by dollar amount (unless you must take an RMD.. required distributions may not be converted). There is no income limit for 2010 and beyond (previously $100k MAGI), and there are no penalties. However, all you must pay tax on all untaxed dollars - this means the original contributions as well as the growth. It all depends on the size of your IRA, your investment options, and your expected tax bracket at retirement. Traditional IRA distributions are considered income for the year, while Roth distributions are not.
