You've convinced me with your capital letters. How could I have been so blind? The average person on unemployment is there for 39 weeks. Not permanent. So, you're basing your argument on false data. Further, a certain portion of these are there not because of stigma, but because the industry in which they worked doesn't need the labor. Another portion is only actually looking for work in order to continue qualifying for unemployment, and will retire after the benefits run out. You're talking about making a truly significant policy change with real negative effects on many, many real people in order to help a part of the population that doesn't necessarily exist in the manner you imagine it does. From what I can tell, you have done nothing to arrive at your conclusions beyond feeling an emotional reaction with no actual sense of the data. Or any actual knowledge of economics.
