">I also got more interviews in the 3 months since I started studying for the CFA and listing that on resume then in the 6 months before hand Sounds like you need to get your interview skills up to par then. Once you get the interview it's all on you to show them that you're quick on your feet and a somewhat enjoyable person to be around. I used to be awful in interviews but now I just waltz in there with a ""I dont need these guys, they need me"" mindset. I also cross my legs and lean back, etc. Anything to make me relax and not come off as a robot spouting financial statement jargon"
