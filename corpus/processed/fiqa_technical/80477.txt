How important sales people are in an organisation has been said but in some companies there is a bonus model among developers too. The problem is that it's harder to see a direct relationship between profit and lines of code than it is to see between profit and number of orders. I'm used to have bonuses to the developers based on 1. keeping deadline and 2. the customer response on the product. that way the developers tend to work faster and create more quality user experiences. By setting up quality guide lines that are easy to measure every company can have a bonus model for developers.
