Well, it's all very nice, but if you had really done the research you'd have found that ads ends up being the way to go, maybe with a paid option to get rid of them. Maybe it's not fair or right, but as things stand 'free' wins out from a monetisation standpoint. That goes double for a simple app that others can quickly rip off.
