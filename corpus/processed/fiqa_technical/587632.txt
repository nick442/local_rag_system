"My fiancee is a resident physician. I think the title of ""received"" is a bit misleading as directly receiving payments is a big no-no these days. The days of doctors being sent on Caribbean vacations and receiving cars, although I'm sure happens behind closed doors on occasion, is regulated and illegal in most cases. So what happens today more so is a pharma rep comes to the hospital and likes to target the residents (physicians, but still ""in training"" for a few years under a bit more guidance of the more senior attendings) who are burnt out and sometimes working 80+ hour work weeks. They offer free lunch, coffee, pizza, subs, etc. if you come listen to a presentation for an hour over lunch time. And even this has disclosure requirements. An exhausted overworked resident is the perfect audience though. Now most residents are there for the free food, intelligent enough to see past a sales rep with a business/sales degree's pitch, or simply sleeping through it. But in a room of lets say 30, all it takes is 1 to internalize their info, start recommending their drug, and the pharma's investment is very quickly worth the cost of some pizza and coffee. Now is this moral or good? I'd say no. We'd like our doctors to be impartial medical scientists. But drug companies will try any way to influence and increase sales and doctors are still humans susceptible to influences despite how intelligent and educated they legitimately are. All that to give some perspective to maybe disagree with a bit of a sensationalist headline, while adding perspective to what is actually occurring as far as where I'm sure most of that money is going."
