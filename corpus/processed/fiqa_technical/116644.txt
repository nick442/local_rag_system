Given that SpaceX is actually operating for revenue now, it would seem like they don't need to go public just for access to capital. Therefore, it would make sense for it to go public when it is more valuable to someone else than it is to Elon Musk but I don't see him having intentions to sell right now. However, if SpaceX became worth many billions of dollars or if there is a crisis at Tesla requiring Elon to inject capital there, those are the scenarios where I could see him IPOing SpaceX.
