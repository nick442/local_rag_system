>Actually, Education is where there's no need for humans: videos and recorded lectures, AI teaching at your own level and pace are much better than a class of 30.. Yes this is one advantange of automation yet I only see it as a complement to the education system. If there's one thing automation cannot provide it would be the same interactive environment provided by the classroom which allows students to learn from each other and _request a different explanation in real-time for clarification_. Videos and recorded lectures tend to be monotonous. One way communication is stifling and overwhelming which kills the learning environment. This is one of many reasons why online courses aren't taken seriously, at least in this part of the world. The presence of the facilitator imparts certain values in the student. The role of the facilitator is just as crucial as the knowledge they impart. I have never heard of AI Teaching maybe it will disrupt Education in the future but for now we are stuck with our vanilla Education system.
