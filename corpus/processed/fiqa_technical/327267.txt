You can also grow your produce, cook your own food, hell you can make your own electronics if you want to, and yet supermarkets, restaurants, and tech companies all seem to be doing fine. Just because weed has been decriminalized doesn't mean that people have the experience and knowledge to grow it or want to invest the time and effort to make it a successful venture. To my knowledge, you also have to be licensed to both grow and sell it, and holding small quantities is legal..if you're just some guy growing 1,000 plants in the woods and holding 500 pounds in your basement, you're going to get shut down and arrested. Have you not seen the great success of weed stores in places like Colorado? They offer far more than just weed in Ziplock baggies. If weed becomes legal nationally in the US, you will absolutely see large companies form for the exact reason that they form in every other industry: it's cheaper to consolidate operations and greater volume of sales means higher profit.
