I don't believe that $1 billion in profits claim for a second. Running trains at over 200 MPH is extremely expensive, so much so that only the Chinese have been willing to do it in regular service. Countries with more credible accounting practices invariably lose money on high speed rail, so there's pretty much no way the Chinese are raking in ten figures just on one route.
