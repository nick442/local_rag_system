"You are probably right I honestly don't know, my main issue with this article is the misleading nature. IMO it's as though the author has seen snippets of information and then formed his entire opinion on it. I'm not convinced he fully understands ""best execution"" or how exchanges work. Statements such as: ""IEX has delivered on its promise of better execution"" what is he basing this on? He makes statements but doesn't follow it up with facts."
