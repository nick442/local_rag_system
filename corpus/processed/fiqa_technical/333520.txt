You can't boycott cheap food. You have to legislate against it. People are voting with their dollars. and they are, by far, choosing McDonalds. In general boycotts don't work against national or global corporations. They can take the hit and respond with an advertising campaign and expand in other regions. You might get their attention, but in this economy a boycott against cheap food is never going to work.
