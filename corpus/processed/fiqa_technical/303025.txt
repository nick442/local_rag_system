Don't buy from them. Fry's Electronics matches all online prices. Just tell a Fry's employee that you saw the cheaper price at Best Buy or on Best Buy's website and they will match it. I don't know why or how this is happening, but Best Buy has some really good deals right now that I used to get discounts at Fry's last week.
