Its strange The U means You figure it out! What should be done is report all U levels when making an announcement! This gives an accurate total story of the state of employment without pandering to the left or right. We should not accept any comments/reports without asking for all levels. How can we form an opinion with tainted/censored/lying info. Is this no different than saying housing starts are up yet don't get told we have foreclosures and unsold homes still in the market?
