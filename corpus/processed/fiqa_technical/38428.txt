I've been thinking about this. Here's what I came up with. Please let me know what you think. 1. The whole world is on a FIAT money system. The central banks were all easing together in a coordinated way. So currencies remain relatively stable relative to each other.. Also, the price of goods isn't rising nearly as quickly as the money supply is being expanded because: 2. The growth of the internet/globalization are deflationary because skilled people in 'poor' countries have access to the global marketplace and are willing to produce far more per dollar than 'rich' country citizens. 3. The growth of inequality is deflationary. As wealth concentrates at the top, there are fewer and fewer customers who can afford the products/services that are being mass produced. So there's a mismatch between high supply and low demand. 4. A poor/slow economy (low spending, debt defaults and business/personal bankruptcy) is deflationary. We treat credit as money, and when debt is wiped out so is the credit that we were accounting for in the money supply. 5. The money created over the last 10 years or so hasn't had a chance to 'trickle-down yet'.. it's still tied up in financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) held by, mostly, institutional investors until the next big bubble bursts. So, there are many deflationary forces to balance out against the money creation.
