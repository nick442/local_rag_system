Yes on the August expenses, No on the April; the expenses must have happened after the HSA was opened. Also, note that you're limited to (in 2015) $3350 of deposits to the HSA in a single year, so you can only put $2350 more into the HSA. The IRS form for HSAs looks something like this: 1) How much money did you take from your HSA? 2) How much were your qualified medical expenses? 3) If (1) > (2), give us a bunch of money.
