My first reaction to this is that it'll strike generations differently. I (25 years old) would be excited to have this done for the convenience. My sister (30, married with a kid) said she would be scared of being tracked over the weekend or during off time, but would consider a bracelet form of the chip. My dad and grandmother both simply said hell no.
