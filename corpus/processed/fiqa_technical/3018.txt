It's definitely something to keep on top of. Who knows if he's right, in the long run. I'm 100% positive cryptocurrency in general is here to stay and will complement fiats, but the question is whether another coin than Bitcoin can deliver something truly more useful. What exact idea will beat it? if you can answer that, you'll be a billionaire yourself, but imagining that someone will have such an idea is not hard at all. It's harder to imagine that no one ever will. And when that happens, it will probably happen fast and it's going to sting. Many people will be once bitten twice shy after that, and the total crypto market cap may take some time to recover.
