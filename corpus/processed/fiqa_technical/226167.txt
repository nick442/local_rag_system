No protective order; no NDA; no disco clawback arrangement.. sounds like WF just handed over a bargaining chip the size of Kansas. Doesn't mean they can't (eventually) get it back through court processes (as an inadvertent disclosure of a trade secret.. maybe), but it's a fuck up more quickly and easily resolved by buying it back.
