http://www.citymayors.com/finance/bonds.html > There were approximately $3.7 trillion outstanding in municipal bonds by 2011 according to a quarterly U.S. Federal Reserve Flow of Funds release in December 2011. This amount included a $840 billion dollar amount missed from prior calculations of outstanding debt issued since 2004.(Kaske, Michelle. “Fed Agrees With Citi on $3.7 Trillion Estimate”. Bloomberg. December 8, 2011.) Still waiting on your magic numbers. What he did was cite a number that represents the entire muni bond market. A number that can be sourced from valid places. The muni bond market IS worth that much in total. At least from the sources we have thus far. You've yet to actually do much of anything but bitch that his numbers (and apparently the MSRB and Fed's numbers) are wrong while good ol crotchpoozie knows the real score.
