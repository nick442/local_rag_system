I've only got the equivalent of an associates (I think). It's a three year program at the Technologist level. It was not an easy program. We lost 1/3 of the remaining class each year it seemed. I think the money is due to the multidisciplinary nature of the work. Chemistry, electronics, mechanics, physics, programming, networking, all at a reasonable level on a daily basis. Plus there is an insane amount of responsibility right out of the gate and some people don't handle that well.
