Walmart is doing nothing illegal and every other business is playing against the same laws. Nobody is forced to work there and nobody is forced to shop there. That all said anyone who actually cares about this has a solution - update the laws and convince people to update their choices in where to work and where to shop. Think long and hard about how you would like other people treated, and how complex you would like that to be (hint: the US health system is ludicrously complex and inefficient). Realise that every law has other consequences and just because you want something to happen a particular way doesn't mean it will. For example increasing minimum wages doesn't magically increase average wages or provide new jobs for the unemployed. (There is a lot of [debate over the actual effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage#Debate_over_consequences) but it is never simple.)
