I wasn't being condescending, but I was pointing out there are professional association barriers to entry into higher level professions. So go fuck yourself, and that's condescending. But do yourself a favor and read the goddamn requirements in those states. 3 of the 5 REQUIRE AT LEAST ONE YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL. The other two require at least three years of study, under an experienced lawyer. What lawyer in their right mind is going to hire you, pay you, and train you rather than doing billable work? From Slate: Law office readers comprised only 60 of the 83,986 people who took state and multi-state bar exams last year, according to the New York Times. They are also less likely to pass those exams. Only 28 percent of the tiny minority of law office readers passed their bar exams last year, compared to 78 percent of students who attended American Bar Association-approved law schools, reports The Times. So, 17 people in the whole fucking country went that route in 2013. 17 out of the 65,526 people who passed the bar. So, ok, not impossible, but is .026% of new attorneys a viable path? Fuck no. Or maybe study up on medicine in your non-med school and sit for your USMLE, oh wait you can't. Or go sit for the CPA exam without a bachelor's degree without at least 12 hours of accounting, 150 hours of college credits (30 more than just a bachelors degree), AND at least a year of accounting experience. So thank you for the insult just for pointing out there ARE barriers to entry that cannot be overcome by OpenCourseWare style programs for many professions. Maybe you can take those 12 seconds and reconsider what life choices have brought you this moment where you are such a sad fucking jackass who cannot follow someone else's line of thought if it contradicts your own.
