Think about India's government, and then think about Spain's. Credit rating is a measure of risk of default. What government is more likely to default: A developed, relatively transparent European government with mature industries and an educated populous. Or a developing, relatively opaque SouthEast Asian government with a large amount of its populous uneducated, living in poverty. Ask yourself, would you rather make a loan to Spain or India? Which is more likely to pay you back? edit: Despite the fact that Spain needs a bailout, it already has a very mature, very advanced infrastructure/economy in place. With a little cash, the government can get that industrial machine working at efficiency again.
