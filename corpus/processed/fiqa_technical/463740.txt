I was gonna point out that female tech CEOs have been failing. While I am not so eager to link their performance to their gender, I wonder if it is a combination of male dominated tech industry working against them unconsciously and their own incompetence, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy? But you are right that male CEOs have also failed. Maybe it is perception bias at work? Or because there are fewer female tech CEOs around, so they stick out more? I think Amazon or ebay has a female CEO and they are doing pretty well right?
