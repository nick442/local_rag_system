"BBB is a paid service, certainly not sterling and like all businesses, results tend to follow the money. IMO, as a consumer info source, it's about as reliable as Yelp or other customer review sites. BBB is not dishonest, will respond to consumer feedback over time. Years ago, back when I owned small biz, found BBB useful for both good customer relations & promotion. The good sellers would pressure BBB to unlist bad actors, usually worked OK over time but not immediate. Just like Yelp, also had to deal with some *sshole customers who would use BBB complaints in an attempt to ""get back"" and/or avoid payment, etc. BBB listing is one of several consumer feedback sources to consider. Some dodgy sellers always manipulate feedback from BBB and every other sources/sites, but it's much harder to cover poor performance up these days, info is there if you dig a bit deeper."
