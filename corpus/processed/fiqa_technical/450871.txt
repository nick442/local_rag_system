Therapists and counselors will last far, far longer than artists. Procedurally generated music and virtual designs are already becoming nearly as good as human created ones, and we’re barely scratching the surface of neural networked creativty. The bottom line is humans are not special, and creativity is not some trait that *only* humans can have. If an AI can replace a doctor, a judge, a computer programmer, and a civil engineer, then it damn well can (and will) replace the artist making the IKEA prints you’re going to be buying on the art market. Meanwhile, I’m pretty sure we can be in the year 3000, and people are still going to want to share their problems with someone, and rant to a fellow human being who will listen to their shit and nod thoughtfully and offer advice.
