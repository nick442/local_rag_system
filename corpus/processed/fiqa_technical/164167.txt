Dude. If there was any farmer offering $30/hr there would be every rig hand in the country beating down his door right now. GTFO of here with this BS. Edit: Actually I know exactly what this guy is talking about. Seasonal harvesting work. So yeah. It's $30/hr for 3 months of work at best. They do have trouble finding people that can afford to get out there because who is doing to give up a decent pay job for only 3 months of work? And who makes minimum wage has the means to up and relocate?
