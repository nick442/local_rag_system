"If someone is guaranteeing X%, then clearly you can borrow money for less than X% (otherwise his claim wouldn't be remotely impressive). So why not do that if his 4% is guaranteed? :) Anyway, my answer would be that beating the market as a whole is a ""decent"" rate of return. I've always used the S&P 500 as a benchmark but you can use other indices or funds."
