What effort did you exactly put into this lawsuit? The lawyers spent years working and millions of their own money pursuing a massive case on behalf of the general public. Class actions are insanely complicated and fee like this ought to put large companies like Ticketmaster on alert to ensure their policies are legal and fair. Why does it bother you that people are paid for the work they do? Maybe you'd rather companies include small fees and charges in their transactions. By the time you realize you'd been screwed out of $5, $10, $50 it would be gone. You could go to court and probably get it back but that requires time and probably cost you more than it would be worth. That is exactly why these types of cases are adjudicated as class actions, the individual wrong is too small to pursue but grouped together make a big impact.
