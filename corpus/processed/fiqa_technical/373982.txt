I'm seriously considering liquidating my Roth as it's taken me years to build what I have. My rationalization: the market feels really expensive, and I feel a lot of risk with our current political climate. Is it normal to feel like you're sticking your neck out during times like this? I'm feeling pretty gun shy after 08-09 (stayed in market even though I got creamed). Or am I being a panicked little kid that needs to take a deep breath and ride the upcoming uncertainty (translation: stay in the market)?
