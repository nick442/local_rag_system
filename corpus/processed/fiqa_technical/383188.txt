I am using the PRIME MY BODY CBD and have been in Network Marketing for years. The company is not a pyramid scheme (those are illegal). The product's nano enhanced technology is awesome. I am seeing amazing results and you do not have to become an affiliate unless you want discounts. Many people will sign up as affiliates and not move into business but want the oil discounted. That is perfectly fine. You can also opt to order retail as strictly a customer. So those are options. But if she wants to go into a great home based business, I would seriously look at this as a viable option . CBD/Cannabis and Medical Marijuana is going to be a multi billion dollar industry and the stigma of the STONERS etc is being taken away and more people are understanding the natural health benefits of the plant..
