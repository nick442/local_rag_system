Even then, I've noticed a personal shift away from fast food as a whole, and more toward fast casual (is that what they're calling it?) places like Chipotle, Panera, that Noodle Company place, etc. Less in the $2-5 price range, and more $6-10. People want quality shit now, and we're clearly willing to spend a bit more. I truly don't know what these fast food places' next step should be. They try to emphasize superior quality but at the price points we see, it's all talk.
