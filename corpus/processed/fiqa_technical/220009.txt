This article makes a bunch of big and unsubstantiated claims such as: 1. An individual's desire for larger smartphone screen size is correlated with absence of other computing devices. 2. The number of computing devices an individual owns is correlated to the continent on which he lives. (E.g. North Americans own many computing devices while Asians own few). 3. While apple was originally focused on the North American market, it is now shifting focus to other continents. All of these claims are interesting, but dubious and unsubstantiated.
