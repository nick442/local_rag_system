Great. First foreign investors bought commercial real estate, and no one said a thing. Then, they bought up residential real estate en mass; and we didn't flinch until it was too late. And.......now they are buying farms?? Holy crap, the conspiracies are coming to fruition. America is really being ripped apart from within. Or, I could be wrong. Anyhow, this all has one group of losers; the American people.
