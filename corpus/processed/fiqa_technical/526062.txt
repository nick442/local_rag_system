"While I agree with you (I wouldn't buy Facebook above $15), hence my term ""suckers"" when referring to people who bought into Facebook's IPO - I still think there should be some kind of rule in place that an IPO has to reflect a companies actual value. The IPO price of $38 meant that Facebook's P/E ratio was 104x which is absurd for an IPO."
