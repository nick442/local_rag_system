Got job at top 10 bank out of college. First year as analyst I also got involved in college recruiting. There were many discussions on what schools to recruit from. Seemed to be a combo of best reputations, highest rankings, and schools some senior executives went too. Our bank had dedicated recruitment at about 10 to 15 schools. If you got into the analyst program outside of that it was through some connection. If memory serves me, these were the colleges we recruited from. Harvard Yale MIT Dartmouth Brown Cornell Princeton Columbia Duke Nyu Stanford Ucla Cal Think nyu the easiest school that gets dedicated recruiters due to it's size and location. My bank had more west coast and southern focus than other banks. I believe northwestern and u of Chicago get recruited from banks with large Chicago offices.
