You're right. Your statement is almost universally true. However, when applied to support of Trump, it is more the exception than the rule. By 'stupid', you could be saying that they were well informed, but voted for the wrong person because they miscalculated probabilities and implications of the future. Or 'stupid' could mean that the person was clouded in biases and incompetence; that they voted wrong because they just didn't understand. I would say Thiel is the first type and the average low-income Trump supporter is the second. By that I mean that Thiel's support for Trump is in a minority because the majority of Trump supporters seem to have an extremely simple basis for their opinions. They've been fooled by biases, cultural associations, actors, and the general complexity of the modern world. They don't understand the world. Their community, media, and religious leaders-along with the morals from their culture-often put their moral inclinations into conflict with their economic self-interest. Thiel, on the other hand, is well informed and complex of thought. He was not hoodwinked by anyone. Trump supporters seem stupid because they get so many facts wrong. From the opposite side, it seems like they are caught in storm of biases and psychological mindfucks. They don't seem capable of seeing information objectively.
