If I apply for a job at my hedge fund's PB, how likely is it that will come back to my firm through sales contacts and such? It's not a job within the PB business if it makes a difference. Do banks have policies against hiring from their PB clients? What about from S&T customers? This would be at the associate level if it matters.
