Idk what the problem is. My selection of outdoor sports equipment has never been bigger. I love these stores and I don't know how not too. I miss the small bait shop that was around the corner, but I loved that Bass pro catalog as a kid and now there is 4 bass pros within 4 hours of me, Walking in these stores is like heaven.
