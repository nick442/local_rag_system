"China is a gigantic investor in the USA. Whenever you hear the term ""trade deficit"" that the US has to China, there is an identical amount in ""investment surplus"" that the US gets from China. That investment is everywhere - in our stock market, in our government debt, in our real estate and in our Ohio Windshield plants. Every time you buy an iPhone, you're handing China hundreds of dollars which they then invest in America. We very literally gave them a Windshield plant in exchange for consumer goods. https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/05/16/that-china-trade-deficit-comes-back-to-the-us-110-billion-into-real-estate-alone/#76342d974653"
