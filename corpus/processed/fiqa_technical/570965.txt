"one of the good things about berlin is that you can find cheap apartments. with the money you pay for yours you wouldn´t get a lot of living space in other german urban areas (maybe ""east germany"") EDIT: just saying, that if you live by yourself with 8 eur/h, it´ll be a very basic style of living, considering rents are usually higher."
