I realize that for sure. I traded it speculatively in early 2013 during that meteoric rise. I'm just saying that it seems these currencies only exist because the big banks allow them to. Large scale adoption, I believe, will always be stymied by the big boys who can wipe out steady growth with a wave of their hand. Average folks just will never have the stomach to hold through that type of tumult.
