"Speaking as a returned Peace Corps volunteer from another major cotton-producing African country, I'd like to add that what is shunned as ""child labor"" in Western countries is totally acceptable, indeed the norm, in most African societies. You would be hard-pressed to find a clothing producer whose cotton supplies completely sidestep this phenomenon, mostly because doing so would increase costs to a totally unsustainable level, and no one in America or Europe is going to pay $100 for the lowest-end jeans or sweatshirt you find in Walmart."
