I feel like this is probably a good thing. But: I'm not sure it's going to lower the gender wage gap. For starters: Women tend to make more than men in their early 20's. So women's **prior** salaries are often actually higher than men's at a certain point in their lives. Later on, of course, men tend to make more. But you could make the argument that asking about prior salaries actually *helps* women in their *early to mid* careers. Secondly: The gender wage gap for same-skills/same-position is really, really narrow. So asking prior salaries would only seem to work in instances where the candidate was switching careers. Which is to say, it wouldn't help narrow the gender wage gap very often. Lastly: This helps men just as much as women (which is a good thing, btw) and so it's not really a gender-related law. All in all it seems like a good law though. HR departments are going to hate it though. And I bet they share data anyway and get around it without asking.
