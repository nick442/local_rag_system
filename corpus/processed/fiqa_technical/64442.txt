> Man am I sick of seeing Texas at the top of every economic and job ranking list. I'm in Texas, and if you're not a computer scientist in Austin or a petroleum engineer in Houston/Midland, good fucking luck finding a job that pays more than $10 an hour. Replace Texas with California and Austin with SF Bay Area and you have the same argument but different state.
