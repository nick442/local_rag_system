Yeah, no. Dunno who 'corporate' is to you but people have shopped based on price since when Ug the caveman made the first wheel and Ra the guy down the street was making jagged hexagon ones for cheaper because his labor costs are lower. No- they don't work as well, or last as long, but if it costs two fewer rocks to get a 6-sided wheel than a round one, Ra will be in business as long as Ug is, and Ug's product is good enough that he isn't going anywhere. Don't pretend we're in the midst of some product development and purchasing renaissance.
