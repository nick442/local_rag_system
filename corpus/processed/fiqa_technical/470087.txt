Except again you're wrong and retarded the comment I first made was in response to a ridiculous statement you mad to someone else who was referring to income tax because income tax is theft and I know this because I'm capable of critical thinking now even in my very first comment I mention income tax and nowhere in this entire conversation have I deviated from income taxes other than bringing up an alternative. I would like to ask you again, how hard is it going through life with 0 critical thinking and comprehension skills?
