"On a side note, the idea is shared with ""booting up a computer"", and comes from the phrase ""pulling oneself up by the bootstraps"". When a computer first starts, the hardware runs firmware from ROM, which then loads the boot loader, which then actually loads the OS kernel, which loads everything else. So the same principle applies to a ""bootstrapped"" business. You start with practically nothing, generate a small income from that, then leverage that income to produce products and services which generate more income, and so on and so forth."
