I always enjoy reading analyses like that, but something I've always wondered is whether they look at anything besides specifically the minimum wage. Having worked a warehouse job, I was paid 50 cents above minimum wage. Now, that amount isn't arbitrary. It is 50 cents above minimum wage, and if minimum wage went up, so would that wage. I reckon there's a whole lot of people making _near_ minimum wage, and it seems rather incomplete to talk about only 1.8 million americans when that number could balloon just by including wages within a dollar of the minimum. I'm not saying that is fact, I just wish the analysis wasn't so matter of fact, when it appears to me they've somehow overlooked a pretty import subset of people affected by the minimum wage.
