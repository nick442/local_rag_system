Yes youre right it's far more complex than the M-M textbook theory. My view is that there's even more advantages to debt than M-M would say. Further you've nailed exactly why these companies don't follow corporate norms. As disruptors they fear disruption despite their pretty much impenetrable moats. But their CFOs are slowly turning them. MSFT now has a normal corporate structure, apple is getting there, and Google hired Morgan Stanley's CFO. I disagree on your last point: what an entrepreneur CEO (who built a disruptive business from the ground up) wants for his balance sheet is usually not the right thing for shareholders. They do it because they can get away with it due to share class structure and their phenomenal operating performance. That's just my opinion.
