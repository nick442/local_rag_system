Yup. I know a lot of people who said they'd vote for Sanders, but then didn't vote Democrat when Clinton won the primary (whether than meant voting third party, voting Trump or not voting at all). It was not some last minute impulse by these people to do this as Clinton seems to be making it out to be, it was a long held belief.
