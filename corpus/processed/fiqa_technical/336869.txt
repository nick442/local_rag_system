"I wouldn't call adderall an outside substance. Anyone can take adderall who has ADHD right? Nobody is ""allowed"" to take whatever Armstrong took, or is that not right? I guess older men or people with cancer or HIV, but I never saw those people win races like the kinds Armstrong was able to win. Oh wait he actually did have cancer, maybe he can say it was part of his ""treatment""?"
