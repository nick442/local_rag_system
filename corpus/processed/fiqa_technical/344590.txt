You can go to Goodwill or a used book store in town and find a college level textbook Economics courses are usually broken down into General Econ, Micro Econ and Macro Econ.. after those you can into more focus aspects of economics like Economies of Scale and history. You can look up more about opportunity costs, supply and demand, guns and butter. that's what I remember from my General Econ courses. --- Also, this sub doesn't really have anything to do with Economics as far as academics goes. It's more about the current events of economic policy.
