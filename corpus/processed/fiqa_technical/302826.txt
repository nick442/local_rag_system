Depends on what measures were taken. *If* they followed standard best practices and were hacked, then would you still want them put out of business? Should airlines fold if one of their planes crashes? Now if they were negligent, that's another story. You can read my other comment down the thread but shutting down Equifax is only going to hurt innocent people who had no say in the matter. Personally I don't think that is going to do the most good after the fact.
