"> Honest question without entrapment. Do you really believe this ""anti science"" rhetoric? You must see that a good bit of that comes from a liberal media pushing an agenda. What has he actually done that is oppositional to science? Yes. I've seen it in action. While there are lots of stories in the liberal media, the sources I'm following are the Science oriented news: Science, Scientific American, Science News. Simply look at the war on climate scientists via the NASA budget for its work on atmospheric science and the EPA budget (down 26%) for climate science for obvious examples [edit: As well as the 16% cut in the NOAA budget]. And all of this for a misguided notion that one should try to protect coal .. which is dying on its own (Nat Gas is cheaper and solar will be cheaper soon; both industries produce more jobs that coal .. and ""remember kids: coal kills""). > NASA funding increased 800 million. NSF is up 100 million. Collectively agencies are up 14 million from 2015. Data here https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/fedfunds/2015/html/FFS2015_DST_003.html You have your information completely messed up. That said, the mainstream press also seems to be pretty incompetent at this too. The Fiscal Year for both NASA and the NSF starts Oct 1. The FY2017 budget was from Oct1, 2016 through Sept 30, 2017. Specifically the FY 2017 budget request for the NSF was submitted **Feb 9, 2016**. Any changes and funding of that budget under Trump's watch are minor. The budget request formed under Trump is the FY2018 budget .. and this budget (the NSF) request was submitted on May 23, 2017 down $841m (11%). [Here is the history of budget requests and actual expenditures for the NSF: https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/ ] Your NASA information was also bad. However, the approved FY2018 budget was only down 0.8% > The National Aeronautic Space Administration budget for FY 2018 is $19.1 billion. That's a 0.8 percent decrease from current funding levels. The situation for the NASA budget as a whole doesn't tell the whole story. The reason it stayed relatively level was the push for Mars. What one should note about the NASA budget are the severe cuts in regard to atmospheric research or anything related to climate change. > Ultimately you have to admit the rapid expansion of entitlements lobbied for by democrats will necessarily create budgetary pressure on non defense spending. No I don't. Why? First .. I simply note that you are trying to restrict attention to ""non-defense spending"" when it needs to be included in the calculation too. Second of all .. we should have the courage to call it what it is. It's *military spending* and we shouldn't fool ourselves by calling it ""defense."" So, in the context of large increases in military budgets/spending .. the relatively minor expansion in entitlements is irrelevant. Consider what the *single* Trump-ordered symbolic missile attack of Syria cost ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Shayrat_missile_strike I say ""symbolic"" because we actually notified them of the incoming strike in advance! ). Just the cost of the Tomahawk missiles was almost $100m. $100m for a single 1 hour symbolic gesture. That's 1/60th of the annual NSF budget. I'm not even going to mention the fact that each trip to Mar-a-lago costs $3m (if you include Secret Service). Here is a reminder of the relative sizes of the components of the budgets ( 2015 ): https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/ . And for all of the campaigning about getting out of foreign wars, Trump seems to be doing the reverse. If you look at the rise to power of the US in the 20th century, you'll realize that it was driven by science. It's science that made America great. If you really want to MAGA .. fund science."
