"They understand inflation perfectly. Their owners/member banks own the mortgages, auto loans, business loans, student loans, etc, and, of course all the collateral on unpaid debts. Inflation is I their best interests. They aren't in the money game, they are in the capitol game. The fed it's self is in the business of creating inflation and debt. While the fed, it's self won't capitolise on bad loans, they are happy to do whatever quantitative easing they can to bail out their member banks (who never needed bailing out, as it was their customers, not them, who lost out).. One of the men behind the founding of/ the principal of the federal reserve/privatized Nation banking, Mayer Amschel Rothschild said ""give me control of a country's money source, and I care not who makes it's rules"". The federal Reserve is doing a shitty job by way of we the people, because it was set up specifically to help a small number roof people to plunder our economy. They built it to create an entire nation of debt slaves.. What it needs is to be burned to the ground, and the authority to issue currency be places back into the hands of the legislators- as the Constitution specifies exactly to prevent private interests from doing what they're doing/have done.. The Constitution also doesn't allow for a federal income tax, which was levied the same year that the fed. Was instituted- 1913."
