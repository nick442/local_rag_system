There are a bunch of ERP options out there, as you can see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ERP_software_packages and many of them are free and/or open source. If I were doing an ERP implementation today I would think a lot about a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that I didn't have to scale or maintain. I don't know a lot about the players, but they are typically easy to try out online- folks like OpenERP or ERPNext. And oddly, it looks like Microsoft has a decent solution called Dynamics.
