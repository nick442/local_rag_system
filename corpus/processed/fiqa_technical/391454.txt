Not necessarily. You only need to raise prices to maintain current profit margins. Assuming you aren't living on a paper thin profit margin, you can give your employees a raise and suffer a lower profit margin. Now, that could have other negative consequences on your stock value and shareholders might be upset, but that is a different discussion.
