Wait just a second there.. > A sign advertised lots priced from the $300,000s to the $600,000s. Robinson told me that 27 of the Hideawaysâ€™ 58 sites have already been purchased, with the completed homes selling for as much as half a million dollars. So, I have to buy a lot for $600,000 - then spend hundreds of thousands more building a house on that lot - and then you're telling me that the very best I can possibly do, is to then sell it for $500,000?
