"It's also not really anything new. For a several decades, a huge percentage of the population has been essentially living paycheck-to-paycheck, and with essentially zero cash savings to cover emergencies. It's possible that it is slightly worse now in the sense that -- with the pervasive use of credit & debit cards, etc -- few people deal in cash or change very often .. and so they don't even have the old proverbial ""piggy banks"" (or jars/bottles filled with end-of-day pocket-change) that they can raid for $50 or $100. *Oh, and THAT really has nothing to do with ""bubbles"".* --- EDIT: Plus another thought.. just the other day there was an article crowing about how Millennials are ""saving for retirement"" in higher amounts and at earlier ages than prior generations -- if that is true, then a likely corollary would be that they are NOT engaged in plain old ""savings"" at the same rate -- i.e. what money they are ""stashing away"" is all heading to Wall Street, and is difficult to access in an emergency (and if they did access 401k savings, it would likely be as a ""loan"" -- rather than paying the early-withdrawal penalties & taxes)."
