I will respectfully disagree with you on the need for a social safety net and will cite the obvious example in Iceland. Of course, self-interest (political, monetary) will not allow it to happen. The entire thing is beyond ridiculous at this stage. Then again, I am but a simple trader and have no desire to be an analyst, so what do I know. I just take the trades.
