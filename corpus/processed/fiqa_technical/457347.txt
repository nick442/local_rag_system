"Agree wholeheartedly. And Jamie means ""Everyone's kicking our ass, particularly commie China, who was willing to sacrifice their people/environment and because our corporations have even outsourced R&D because it was cheaper there"", effectively assuring future innovation will occur elsewhere. (There is a study out about this very fact. Google it.). Dimon is really saying less reg, less wages, less protection of the environment/health or no growth but what is unsaid is that these countries are playing the long game against our greedy corporations playing for short term profit and in Jamie's case, Executive stock boosts, hence the proliferation of stock buybacks in recent years. Jamie's full of shit about caring about the US, he wants a race to the bottom here as well.Too bad it is too late. On the bright side, we have endless war to keep our General Dynamics/GE/Northrop/Bankster Middlemen going well until the apocalypse and maybe then some (Space wars are now afoot)."
