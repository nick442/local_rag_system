All that is an issue with non competitive market. My premise was that in capitalism, not in crony capitalism nor in heavily regulated so that it is non competitive or high in market barrier. Way to solve non competitive market due to crony capitalism or too heavily regulated market usually is not more regulation. That makes it worse. Role of regulation is to factor in extranality, promote transparency and such. Not inflate wages of people who don't deserve it
