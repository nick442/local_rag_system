All great questions, thank you. We are one of a several piano stores in south eastern MA, but many people will travel a fair distance to find the right piano. Our largest group of customers are middle to high income families. We've played our ad on the local abc family channel and on local pop radio stations. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSr-LRiP1s0 .. The corniness was intended and did create a lot of response. We offer a full value trade up policy for any past customers. Our record is a customer who purchased a piano from us 14 prior to trading up. Thanks for your help, I'll work on finding more ways to further identify and reach our target market.
