"have you by chance been to the middle east? (UAE, Qatar or Saudi specifically). or perhaps been exposed to any part of the US industrial revolution (im not sure of your nationality), hell, even the french revolution. a review of any of those, and thats just relatively recent examples, would show why you are wrong. saying it doesnt work is a broad statement without actually saying what the problem is, nor does it take any steps to underlying the root cause or possible solutions. when you say ""it doesnt work"". what specifically is not working."
