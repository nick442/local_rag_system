Much of this inequality would be reduced if we moved from income taxation to a wealth/asset tax. We could exempt a person's main residence and retirement savings (similar to the way we do now with the home mortgage deduction and capital gains exemption and with IRAs). This would also obviate the need for a separate capital gains tax.
