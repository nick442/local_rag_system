"I guess I'm that 20%. Sure, go ahead and bus you kids to my school district, for which my taxes pay a hell of a lot more than your taxes pay in your district (in my state, it's a percentage based on district that one pays). Butâ€¦ don't cry racism or privilege when your kid is expelled -- and that goes for anyone, not just people in my class. You know what's _really_ strange? I picked my neighborhood based on the superior public schools. Yet, I have neighbors and coworkers who pay for private school because public schools ""suck."""
