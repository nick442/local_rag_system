On the one hand, I see and mostly agree with your point. On the other hand, protecting the environment is exactly the sort of job that government should be spearheading. The entire world came together and agreed on something, then Trump pulled the US out because he felt slighted for reasons that are not based in reality. He's clearly not mentally stable enough to run a business (or he would have beaten inflation with his inheritance) let alone a global superpower.
