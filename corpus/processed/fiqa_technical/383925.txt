> From the IT managers perspective he has a budget of X dollars to allocate. When X dollars are spent that's it, he isn't allowed to spend any more. The IT manager should not view his budget this way. A budget is a projection of future expenses. If some expenses turn out to be different from the projection, then either (a) you need your budget to account for this by having some slack in it or (b) you have to revisit your budget and change the plan. Viewing a budget as a checking account is wrong. That's not how it actually works in the accounting department and by not understanding what accounting is doing, the IT manager is causing himself extra pain.
