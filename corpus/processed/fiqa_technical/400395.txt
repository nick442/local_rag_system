It's true, Detroit schools are a patchwork of expensive charter schools and failing public schools. But the surrounding metro area has nationally recognized public schools. Changing Detroit's public schools from bad back to quality is going to be very hard, and will take time. But investments are being made ($200 million in private donations just two weeks ago, to name one example) to improve education, particularly in employable computer science skills. But there is still a lot of work to be done, absolutely.
