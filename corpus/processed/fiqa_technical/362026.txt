Right it's less or a headache but they still pay more to use the staffing agency overall than they would doing it themselves, benefits or not. Staffing agencies wouldn't be able to make money if that weren't true. Generally if you are making about $10 an hour the factory is actually paying like $13 hour to the staffing agency. They mostly just do it so it's super easy to get rid of you with no hastle, if they don't like you. The staffing agencies just places you somewhere else.
