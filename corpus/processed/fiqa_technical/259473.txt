"How about keep your thieving hands off other people's money, and focus more on how you can trade freely with other individuals to get their compensation via saving them time, energy or money? If you analyze how most people ""get rich"", it's through providing a good or service that is so valuable that other people voluntarily part with their money because the good/service is of higher value to them.. i.e. BOTH SIDES WIN IN VOLUNTARY TRADE. I don't hate Steve Jobs because he had $Billions, because I recognize that 1. I want people who produce the most for us to have even more resources than average and 2. he didn't take a dime from me that I didn't have full control over giving him, unlike politicians who just win popularity contests to seize control of 40% of our money (total cost of taxation)."
