"I haven't been to Buffalo Wild Wings that many times, so I apologize if I'm missing something, but what is appealing about that place. Service was shit. Food was shit. Setting was shit. I'd be better off going to the ""food court"" at my local grocery store than to a Buffalo Wild Wings. There wasn't a single redeeming quality of the place."
