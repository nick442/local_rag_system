Lol I moved out without my parents help at 18 I've been working full time since I was 13. I've never in my adult life been dependent on anyone. I think one day when you grow up you'll realize that the government does nothing but make you dependent on them. The government doesn't do anything the private sector can't do it only does everything worse and less effectively. Maybe see a psychiatrist tho I've heard Stockholm syndrome never goes away on it's own.
