I think he means theme parks in general. There used to be a competitor in Palos Verdes: [Marineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marineland_of_the_Pacific), which closed in 1987, when I was 15. We went there all the time. Beautiful location and a lot of fun. My favorite part was a swim-through aquarium. Loads of fish and even some non-aggressive sharks were in there. You'd get a mask and a snorkel and could swim through. Wonderful experience and a shame it's gone.
