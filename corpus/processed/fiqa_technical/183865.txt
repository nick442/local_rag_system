Both of our local Kmart stores closed within the last year, but before that, they were sad states of broken, and had been that way I think before even Sears took them over. They finally re-did the bathrooms in the early 2000's I think, but so many ceiling tiles had stains on them from water. I used to work at one (before the buyout), loss prevention really had nothing to work with either.
