Most people use SMS or internet messaging similar to WhatsApp - but WhatsApp is not popular in the US. People use Apple, Google or Facebook services. Since SMS will not work for them in a foreign country, they can only use their internet messaging. Apple people use iMessage. Many other people use Facebook Messenger or Twitter Direct Messages (DMs). It is very important to have a Facebook account for people to link to you (when they write about their trip) - so Messenger should be easy to setup. Google, Facebook, and twitter can run on a cheaper android phone. But many tourists probably have Apple iPhones. iMessages can only be sent from Apple devices. If you have access to an older iPhone (iPhone 4S) - it should be able to still send iMessages. Email is used by everyone, but younger tourists may not like it, and it may be hard for you to check. Google can give you email and messenger for free.
