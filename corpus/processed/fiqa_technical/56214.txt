"1.- Every dell computer owner knows what is this diagnostic test for? maybe you can explain some stuff about it (you can Insert bullet points in the video, just one word, while you say it). 2.- What is your segment are you targeting with these videos? what do you know about the people that looks for tips, advices in youtube (age, gender, tech savvy?) if your audience is young I would suggest to make the videos more ""fresh"", different music, intro, maybe some jokes. On the other hand if your audience is old and not tech-savvy at all you will have to be more clear, maybe you start with instructions in bullet points and then you show how to do it in a computer (pressing the keyboard, showing the screen, etc.). That's my humble opinion"
