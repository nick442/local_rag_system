Well, that's the clever part of it. If you only dole out effective surpluses to those who have squandered a bunch of energy, then you've incentivized a certain lifestyle and robbed people who don't live that lifestyle to finance it. It's what we've been doing for 40 years (give or take) with consumer goods. They keep getting cheaper and higher quality, so if you're not budgeting a healthy portion of your annual income on consumer goods then you're missing out on the effective surplus. That incentivizes participation in the mass-production, consumer culture. Which in-turn keeps the wheels of the economy turning, and keeps all the little worker-bees in line. If you just handed people more money, they might get crazy ideas like starting their own businesses, organizing labor unions, running for political office, taking a day off work to go vote or attend council meetings, and generally being a nuisance to the people that run everything. You wouldn't want that, would you?
