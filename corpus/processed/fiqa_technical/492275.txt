His approval rating is within historical norms and he's on track to be among the worst presidents ever. People are just not connected to reality. I saw a lot of people saying that the pictures and videos of him looking at the eclipse were photoshopped. Nothing can or will change their minds. he will have Republican support until the entire world collapses and there are just a few months left in his term, just like Bush, who was obviously incompetent by August of his first term.
