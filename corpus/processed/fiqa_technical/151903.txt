"Even without the $2 fee, I'm jumping ship and switching to Virgin Mobile. Here's my breakdown: Verizon 400 minutes + 100 texts (IIRC), no data, $45 before fees Virgin 300 minutes + unlimited 3G data & text: $35 with purchase of $200+ smartphone. (and virgin uses Sprint for 3G) I'll be informing Verizon that their separate fee hike of $0.15 which, to my knowledge, is still in the works, is what's known legally as a ""material averse effect"" and allows me to opt out of the contract without paying a cancellation fee."
