Does anybody here have experience with company songs? I just can't relate to this article. I have no particular loyalty to my employer - but nor do I bear them ill will. They compensate me fairly for doing work that I mostly enjoy. I can't imagine being asked to sing a company song. When I work extra hours, I do it for the love my craft, not for the love of my company. Also, as a salaried employee, it is my job to complete certain tasks. I understand that this may occasionally entail night or weekend work. However, if this happens too frequently, it is my responsibility to escalate to my management so that my tasks can be prioritized. Consistent and unending night and weekend work is just a recipe for burning people out and reducing overall long-term productivity.
