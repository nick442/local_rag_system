"They're well known but not everyone prefers that style. To each their own though. My favorite it authentic Italian style out of a brick oven. So, what about ""Empire State Pizza"", ""NY Zaa"", ""Big Apple Pizza"", ""Big City Pizza"", ""Broadway Pizzeria""? We have a Johnny's New York Pizza around here somewhere (Atlanta), never been there in the 16 years I have lived here but have heard its good. Once the name becomes familiar through advertising, marketing and word if mouth, the name will quickly become known for your style pizza. Best of luck to you!"
