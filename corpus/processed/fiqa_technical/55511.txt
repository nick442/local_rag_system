I would go even further: You should want to pay as much as possible with your return without having to pay a penalty. This lets you keep your money as long as possible without costing you anything extra. You don't want to overdo it and pay fees, so leave yourself some buffer. Still, try to get yourself in the mindset that paying at tax-time is a good thing!
