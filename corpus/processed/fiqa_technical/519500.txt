This. You nailed it. TJs is pretty much the grocery store equivalent of the Lincoln Mint for hipsters. If every product is limited-time only special, then by buying it you can promulgate your self-image as the sneering exclusivist sophisticated consumer. TJ has done a lot of very detailed marketing research and strategy has gone into parting hipsters from their money and it's working. Good for them.
