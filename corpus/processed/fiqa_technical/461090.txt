Bad workers are non-union as well, there will always be lazy people. Unions are most needed for minimum wage workers, they traditionally fought for the workers in the worst conditions. Unions only make up about 7% of the work force today and are at a fairly weak position compared with the past. Their highest concentration was actually during one of the United States' large periods of economic growth back in the 1950s.
