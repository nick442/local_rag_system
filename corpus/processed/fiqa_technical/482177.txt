Pharma distribution is very different and much more regulated than what Amazon does now. I don't think they know what they are getting into. The standards and practices that apply to the manufacturing environment, the cleanliness, the record keeping, the temperature control, the strict procedures and the training and continuity of personnel required to maintain all that, the security and fire protection to maintain insanely high inventory values.. It ain't like shippin' t-shirts and TVs.
