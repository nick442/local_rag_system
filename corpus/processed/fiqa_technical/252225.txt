"We're screaming about it because we're barely hanging on by our fucking fingernails, and more taxes will suck all the cash out of our businesses and push us over the edge. I find it weird that the people who complain most about big box corporations are also the ones screaming for more government involvement in the marketplace, which acts as a regressive tax in the business ecology, and selects for the largest corporation. I for one think you can shove your ""sensible, smart decision"" through my *accounting program* and figure out how to make payroll, when I have to take out a *loan* to pay my taxes."
