Thousands of public servants ride 24+ hours in C130 cargo holds and get off and perform top notch combat and/or humanitarian work for days or weeks on end. I have no pity for the overpaid bureaucrat flying coach for 2 hours. They're unqualified for the job if a flight in coach stresses them out and causes them to under or not perform.
