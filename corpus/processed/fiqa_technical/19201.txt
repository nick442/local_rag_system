Cograts on eating better but Don't let that documentary scare you too much. All the studies they have done were prospectice cohort corolation based studies. Meaning they asked someone what that ate that day in a survey then 10 years later they look at their health. If they gained weight or got diabetes they then corolate that outcome with the food they ate 10 years ago. It's a terrible way to conduct experiments. This is why saturated fat was linked to heart disease for the past 30 years but now their realizing it's actually not a main cause at all and it's more due to the surgar and corn syrup in our diets. But sad part it the U.S.D.A makes money selling corn and sugar so they won't admit it even though the new research is clear. I'm an RD and exercise physiologist getting my PHD atm. Eating healthy is simple eat fruits and Vegis with the least amount of chemicals and eat grass fed meat and limit grain intake.
