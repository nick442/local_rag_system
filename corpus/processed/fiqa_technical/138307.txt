"This is kinda off track from what the the article is getting at, but it's related. I think now more than ever a company needs to focus on pleasing the customer. In this day and age one customer has the power to reach a million other people. Look at Reddit, we crash websites when just one person submits a link. Depending on what our intentions are this can be good or bad. I feel like the bigger companies have strayed away from this concept. With E3 in the news you can't help but see how the every day gamer views the ""bigger"" companies such as EA and Microsoft with disdain because they aren't focusing on the customers needs."
