"In it's current state, maybe not. The biggest issue with me is scheduling deliveries for perishable items. I don't plan ahead like ""Okay, tomorrow I'm going to Kroger between 5pm and 7pm to get groceries."" We live in an age where the trend is ""I want what I want, I want it here, and I want it now."" Depending on where you're at, grocery delivery doesn't always allow for that. But imagine they perfect it to where you can decide between having Chinese delivered within an hour OR having a bag of groceries delivered within an hour (at an affordable price where the distribution costs are not price-prohibitive). To me at least, that would be the ideal scenario. It's getting closer especially in urban areas, but hasn't really been perfected/made consistent yet by any one delivery service."
