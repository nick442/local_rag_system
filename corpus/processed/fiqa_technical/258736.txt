More to the point, why are executive incentives, bonuses, options, etc, not on the chopping block just as much as union contracts, when bankruptcy is declared? I'm far from pro-union, but this seems like basic fairness. At the very least the unions (and other disenfranchised creditors) should be able to get a lien on those incentives to partially compensate their losses. As a matter of public policy, there should never be a financial incentive to enter bankruptcy.
