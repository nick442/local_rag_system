"> I think you take some pretty big liberties assuming I think people deserve failure. To lurkers: /u/JohnTesh is responding to something I quickly deleted after posting my last message. Damn, he is fast. I don't think so. If you believe your success in life is earned then you must also conclude that most people's failure in life is also earned. > Or do you think they use the term lucky to mean there is no merit basis for the difference? I think people mean this more than your other but I think the word ""merit"" is too shallow. Of course success should go to someone who has merit. The ""luck"" assertion is that whether or not a person possesses merit is decided by factors out of that person's control. > I'm not saying everyone with money has it because of merit.. Of course not. There are exceptions to every rule. We are both talking in generalities."
