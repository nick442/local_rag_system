The only time I went there they rolled my burrito sideways so all the meat was on one end and the other goodies at the other end. I had to reassemble my burrito like a peasant and of course it was falling apart all over the place. It wasn't that tasty either. I remember I got the barbacoa and it was meh. We have several mexican taquerias in town so I just went back to those instead. Cheaper, better food.
