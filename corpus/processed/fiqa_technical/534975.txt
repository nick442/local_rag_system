"Home equity loan is a kind of a mortgage loan. So you're basically asking ""what's better: mortgage or mortgage?"". Home equity loan is usually taken as a second mortgage on the house, while you're still paying the initial one, but accumulated some equity in the property. In the scenario you're describing, there's no ""second mortgage"", there's only one mortgage. You can call it ""The wonderful glorious bestest ever mortgage"" or you can call it ""home equity mortgage"", and it would make no difference to the essence. Look at the numbers, and decide which terms are better, not which name sounds nicer to you."
