"As far as I understand, OP seems to be literally asking: ""why, regarding the various contracts on various exchanges (CBE, etc), is it that in some cases they are 'cash settled' and in some 'physically settled' -?"" The answer is only that ""the exchange in question happens to offer it that way."" Note that it's utterly commonplace for contracts to be settled out physically, and happens in the billions as a daily matter. Conversely zillions in ""cash settled"" contracts play out each day. Both are totally commonplace. Different businesses or entities or traders would use the two ""varieties"" for sundry reasons. The different exchanges offer the different varieties, ultimately I guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable. There's no ""galactic council"" or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering - ! Recall that ""a given futures contracts market"" is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company (just like Burger King sells different products). I believe in another aspect of the question, OP is asking basically: ""Why is there not, a futures contract, of the mini or micro variety for extremely small amounts, of currency futures, which, is 'physically' settled rather than cash settled .?"" If that's the question the answer is just ""whatever, nobody's done it yet"". (Or, it may well exist. But it seems extremely unlikely? ""physically"" settled currencies futures are for entities operating in the zillions.) Sorry if the question was misunderstood."
