I think it is because people have realized that the paper gold (and silver) is pretty much worthless, and that gold in hand (physical gold) is where it is at. I do not pretend to be a goldbug speculator. I just know that over selling paper, eventually has to bottom out, once people start to ask for delivery of their assets, and realize they are not going to get anything for their investments.
