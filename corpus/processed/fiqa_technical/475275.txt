Oops, sorry, I forgot, but yes, you did say that it was MIT. I've never heard about a school owning apartments, just dorms, and I'm in California and know nothing about MIT except it's a high-end school in Mass. somewhere, a place I've never been. Oh, I've also heard of Harvard. :) Here in California, I don't know if schools would get away with that. Certainly not at Berkeley.
