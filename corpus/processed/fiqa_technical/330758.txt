Nearly $1.0M sounds like a lot if you're installing furnaces or fixing cars, but how does the salary for the CEO of PBS compare to other broadcasters? [According to Wikipedia, the CEO of CBS made $69.9M in 2011.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Moonves) I think that a salary of 1.4% of a comparable peer would have made an interesting fact for this article, but nothing of the sort is provided. The author clearly has a bias - Romney spin-doctoring. Not worth the read.
