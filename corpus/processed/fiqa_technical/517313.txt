"Place your savings into safe interest-bearing accounts. Take out the loans. Keep constant track of your net worth. Having 100,000$ and 80,000$ in interest free debt is better than having 20,000$. You can always convert money + debt into less money and less debt, but you cannot always convert less money and less debt into more money and more debt. Now, there are risks; that is why you want an interest-bearing account to place your savings in to offset the debt. This minimizes the risk. It also reduces the return. It is arguable that you should be at your most financially risky at a young age. I'd argue that your future earnings are your by far largest asset at this point, and as a high school student going into college those future earnings have extremely high variability. Your financial situation is extremely unpredictable; being conservative about your high-leverage student-loan + education investments is probably justified. The fact you can manage arbitrage here means you should; and if you are careful, you can eliminate risk and get almost risk-free profit from the maneuver. If your money is in less than perfectly safe accounts, you are now doing leveraged investing and magnifying the risk and return of said investments. If your money must be spent on college or you'll be financially punished, then you may want to consider pulling it out before the last possible legal point just in case something goes wrong. Apparently 529 plans may not treat ""paying off student loans"" as a valid way to spend the money. You may need to talk to a lawyer or accountant about the legality of using these plans to pay off student loans, and the tax/penalties involved."
