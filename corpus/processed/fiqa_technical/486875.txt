Because like many brick and mortar stores BB decided to try and compete with Amazon on price when the entire time they had something that Amazon could not claim. A local neighborhood presence. Instead they focused on bottom line, cut training, and pissed off the community by abusing employees and being rude and useless to anyone walking in the door. CircuitCity and CompUsa suffered the same fate. Compete with what makes you unique. Competing using what makes someone else unique will drive you into the ground.
