"It's not a touch phone - but it has the trackpad instead of the trackball and it's got the QWERTY keyboard. The phone also runs on RIM's OS7 software. It is VERY light and sleek. The old blackberry phones look like bricks next to it. I'm pretty sure the battery makes up 3/4 of the weight in the phone. Along with the normal BB security - you can encrypt the memory card and device memory with a 250 character key randomly generated. You need to do both ""Device Password and Device Key"" to have the strongest encryption/security. The phone also has a firewall. You can set up VPN's with the phone if necessary too. The App world is getting better - but if you have a blackberry your probably not looking for apps. Basically, I'm pretty impressed with it and I have always loved Blackberry. I'll take it over the iphone or android any day! Sprint has the Blackberry Curve 9350's. The other models are 9360 and 9370. Not sure who else carries the new phones."
