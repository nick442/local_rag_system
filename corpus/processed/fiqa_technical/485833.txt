"While that may be true, it's a shame. Morality has to come before profit or the game is already lost. Profit without social progress is meaningless. The use of ""shareholder value"" as a justification for a lack of corporate ethics is disgusting. Our CEOs shouldn't have to be told that it's wrong to pray on their customers. It's fucked up. It's a huge glaring flaw in society. Have you listened to any of the interviews with Bernie Madoff or the Enron guys? They don't feel like they did anything wrong. No shame at all. Maybe it's because they're sociopaths, but maybe it's because we're all still irrational animals obsessed with having more than the next guy, even if we hurt everyone in the process /rant"
