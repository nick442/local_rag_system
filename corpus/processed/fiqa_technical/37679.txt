1% seems to be an equally shaming understatement: Approximately 39.6% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2010-2012 data). https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics Of course not all poor people get cancer, but when close to 40% of the total population does, I think it is safe to say allot more than 1 % of the poor do get cancer and many other things that cannot be planned for.
