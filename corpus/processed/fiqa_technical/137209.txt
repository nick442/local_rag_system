You've never heard of Halliburton? Granted that was Cheney. Cheney received received $398,548 in deferred compensation from Halliburton while Vice President. Don't remember him going to jail. And let's not forget the Bush's. They had numerous investments in oil companies. What's the best way to drive up oil prices? War in the Middle East of course. Vice President/President Gerald Ford also was criticized for his investments. This nothing new. Presidents are allowed to continue to operate their businesses. And I can't think of a single one that was ever punished for doing that. Honestly what I like about Trump compared with other Republicans is the fact he has no interest in war. He has absolutely nothing to gain from war. And every interest in peace. War would probably hurt his businesses. Look at the cease fire in Syria. Look at how he ended a CIA program arming Syrian rebels. That very different from what was happening under Obama and Clinton at the State Department.
