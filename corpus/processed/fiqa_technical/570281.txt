We don't want jobs just so we can do work. We want productive jobs so that we can consume the goods we produce. Everyone in Soviet Russia had jobs, but they were all poor. Just because you get an income does not mean that you are being productive. It is not circular, because unproductive jobs destroy wealth despite having an income. Sure, go ahead.
