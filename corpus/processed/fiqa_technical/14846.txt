Agreed, most artist would *love* to get paid for their hobby. but that doesn't entitle them to profit. here's how I think of it - when the car was mass produced, railroads probably saw a huge drop in profits. the marketplace changed, and where once it was possible to turn a huge profit, now it was only possible to turn a portion of that profit. What if, in attempts to regain their profits, railroads pushed for regulations of the road so that only certain sized vehicles could drive on it? (Loose analogy, i know) The point is that the marketplace changes and NO ONE is *entitled* to profits for their work. Entertainment supply has skyrocketed with the internet and therefore it's value has diminished. But even still, hollywood and record labels make huge profits, look at how overpaid actors are. the industry can't expect to keep raking in these insanely inflated profits. Other industries have to deal with similar problems, e.g. shoplifting. They chalk it up as a cost of doing business, and come up with creative ways to deter it. They could easily do this successfully with piracy (steam being the role model). All in all, yeah, i think a sharing economy is a very healthy alternative. And maybe in the future films and such will be funded through crowdfunding methods such as kickstarter. But in the meantime we cannot allow these industries to influence legislation and introduce dangerous laws that infringe on the freedom of our internet. they seem to think that they have the RIGHT to maintain their already huge profits, and we need to put them back in their place.
