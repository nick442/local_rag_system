That's a misrepresentation of my point. I said class warfare was a ruse, not that inequality wasn't real. They are not the same thing. Class warfare is the deliberate attempt to harm one social group to benefit another, involving theft of resources. Inequality is simply a description of the allocation of resources without any comment on how or why they are distributed in such a manner.
