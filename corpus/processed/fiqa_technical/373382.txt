"I knew before I clicked that this was going to refer to Saez. I don't mean to disparage his scholarship, but he's clearly a guy with an agenda. For example, the reason this number is so outrageous is because 2010 was a *terrific* year for the stock market, and a middling to bad year for employment and wage growth. Stocks tend to be a leading indicator, while job growth is a trailing one. In fact, Saez also tries to make hay by comparing the first two years of this ""recovery"" with the entirety of the (much longer) '90's and '00's booms. If you target your analysis at years when the market has recovered but jobs haven't, of course you'll see greater income gains for the investor class. But by that same token, Saez could have been putting out press releases for studies in 2008 showing how the rich were getting absolutely screwed by losing the lion's share of their income as the market tanked, while ordinary folks were perhaps losing only a little because the full force of job losses hadn't hit yet. But he didn't, AFAIK."
