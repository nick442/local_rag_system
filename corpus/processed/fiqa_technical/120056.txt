"Actually, this quote is bogus. It is from a book (Web of Debt by Ellen Brown). Even Brown herself now acknowledges this fact: Chapter 7, #20 at http://webofdebt.wordpress.com/questions-and-answers/response-to-gary-north/response-to-gary-north-2/ From Brown: ""A bogus quote from Garfield on the control over money. I was already alerted to that. Garfield is no longer mentioned in my book."""
