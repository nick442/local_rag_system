Your quote from the CBO is talking about a actual subsidy. As stated, there was a cash value difference between what the Treasury purchased troubled assets from banks at and what the market value of those securities were. This (the point mentioned in the article) is not an actual subsidy. As a counter argument to your first paragraph, look at Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.
