For any shop the biggest costs are not the product itself but associated costs. The quality, customer experience, decor, wages, rent, maintenance, tax. https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6brW7V2B470/UphyGQ9d3XI/AAAAAAAAMBw/JGJWd12XfHw/s1600/real_cost_coffee.png >* Perishable items are more costly than non-perishable. >* Some costs are incurred regardless of whether a product is sold. These are rent, wages, maintenance, perishables. Therefore selling more in a shorter space of time generates proportionately more profits. Coffee beans are effectively non-perishable with how long they last. Milk is not. A good worker can turn beans+milk into coffee in seconds. You may buy multiple coffees per day, and for your friends. The coffee beans themselves cost ~10p but the price charge could be £1 -£5 depending on the shop. Pizza is labour intensive. Takes more ingredients and longer in the oven (~20mins). You only really buy 1 pizza per person. It comes with a cost of ~£5-£18. Ingredients are generally perishable. Ice Cream usually cant be made by a shop so it has to be shipped in. It is very perishable, leave it out of the freezer for ~30mins and its melted. Its not a real replacement for food or drink, so its optional.
