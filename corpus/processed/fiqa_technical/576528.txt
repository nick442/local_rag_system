It's really a calculated risk. The most you gain is for the growth to be tax free, the downside (for the excess funds)is the growth is taxed plus the 10% penalty. I'd suggest a simple strategy. Deposit as much as you can, early on, until the balance approaches the current 4 yr college cost. Then, just add enough to match the current cost, i.e. If college costs grow more than the account, just make up that difference.
