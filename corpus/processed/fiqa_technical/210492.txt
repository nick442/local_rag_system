I think the government has no real monetary constraint at all. There's pretend constraints like an arbitrary debt ceiling, but not a real insurmountable constraint. There's not really a necessity to issue debt, the money could just be spent into the economy and no debt issuance conducted. Just run into negative equity. There's an inflation constraint in terms of how many real brains / hands / tractors are available, but it isnt 1:1 automatically. The talk of 'debt' is idealogical in my opinion. If Japan voids debt, it's not a problem. They seem to understand exactly how the financial system works and don't seem constrained politically to pulling the levers that deliver the best outcomes. They don't spend enough IMO, but at least they don't run around crowing about debt in a nonsensical way to score politically.
