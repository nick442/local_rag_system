"This happened to my review, I had reviewed a new business, and created a yelp account for that reason. I also reviewed maybe 10 other businesses in two days so I wasn't a one and done account. My account was flagged, and my first review was put as filtered. In retrospect, it makes sense. They want to keep reviews up from consistent yelp users who review alot of businesses. I think if yelp sees a new account, it flags the first business that person reviews, until its established that person is a regular yelp user. I would guess this happens alot on yelp. Someone says ""Review my business, but make sure you review a few others too, so you look like a real user"" The algorithms they have try to catch people like I was. People who create an account to review one company, and then do 10 reviews in a one week span, only to never log in. These aren't really good reviews in the grand scheme of things. For me, I kept using Yelp, and consistently reviewing more businesses. My review was unflagged a few weeks ago, now that I have 40 or so reviews and add a few each week."
