They better explode for their sake or this might be the beginning of the end for them. Especially since their website/domain hasn't been working correctly for them in the past days as well. I also heard this was happening with Vazvu too, right? Something with the fact that their domain may have leaked, so I'm wondering who's going to snatch it up.
