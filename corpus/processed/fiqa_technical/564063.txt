For an app that's distributed on the internet at large (which pretty much rules out mobile for a general audience, but setting that aside..) your only protection is either a) trust the company, or b) trust the community to have audited the source code. A new startup shouldn't be trusted enough for (a). For (b) it's not every individual user that needs to understand all the implications, but an app that becomes semi-popular would likely attract enough geeks who have audited the source code or tested the app in a sandbox to raise red flags if anything is awry. Hopefully anything truly nefarious would lead to an outcry the would scare away even a non-technical user (it's certainly debatable whether this is realistic but it's not far-fetched). To be even remotely popular with a general audience though, an app like this would need to be distributed through the walled-garden app stores from Apple/Google/Microsoft. In that case users are trusting the gatekeeper to exclude an app that was discovered to be doing something malicious. This provides some protection even if the source code is hidden.
