"The financing is built into the price. I do not have hard facts, but I strongly suspect that very few people buy brand-new smartphones at full price upfront. Most pay a monthly installment to the carrier or retailer equal to 1/24 of the full price, which in effect is ""0% financing for 2 years"". Samsung might be able to advertise a lower retail price and then offer financing at some rate of interest, but from a marketing standpoint, offering ""0%"" financing makes it feel like you're getting ""free money"", when in fact it's built into the overall price. Which sounds better, buying an $840 phone with 0% financing for two years or buying an $800 phone at 4.85% APR for two years (both have a $35 monthly payment)?"
