"I currently have the twenties in 6 rolls of 5 I don't know what ""roll"" means to you (perhaps it's another word for grouping). I think of it as money rolled into a circular shape. Do not do that. Place all the money flat and together. Possibly hand them the hundred and twenties separately if you want to emphasize that. An envelope with the amount on it is a good idea. Flat, not folded, not rolled, not separated by paperclips or rubber bands. A simple pile of money is best. Folding the money once to put in your pocket is fine but unfold it to hand it to the teller. The reason for flat money is that it will most easily go through the money counters. Rolling makes the money curved and increases the chance of a jam. And I apologize if that was just a turn of phrase. But I can easily envision some poor teller sighing with exasperation on being handed rolled money that then needs to be flattened to go through the machine. Particularly if the person handing it over grouped it that way in an attempt to be helpful."
