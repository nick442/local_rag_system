"There are many Bitcoin stores where items are bought and sold daily. Overstock.com is one of them. The value doesn't matter because Bitcoins are divisible down to 8 decimal points. I can send you a fraction of a penny easily, although currently the transaction fee to send it is likely to be several pennies. (One purpose of the fees are to discourage such pointlessly small transactions, referred to as ""dust"".)"
