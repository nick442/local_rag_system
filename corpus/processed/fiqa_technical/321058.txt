"HFTs, that serve no purpose other than to make themselves money, pay a premium to the enthusiastically complicit exchanges for the privilege of scalping those that do not. Their profits are not the result of any ""growth"" or ""service rendered"". Their profits are the result of a completely unnecessary tax on the system that amounts to theft out of the pockets of regular investors. Which part did I get wrong? I'm just a guy with a considerable portion of my retirement in an employer 401k, who's not thrilled about losing *any* compounding interest to these parasites. I'm not shilling for anybody. On the other hand, one has to wonder what has guys like you so upset about IEX."
