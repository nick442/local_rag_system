>giving students 1 trilion to pay off all student loans isn't inflationary, it would be deflationary No. If you have to print money out of thin air and letting it circulate in the economy then you are expanding the money supply (inflation). It would have to contract the money supply to be deflation. Even if the money is being spent on student loan payments it is still circulating in the economy, provided the recipients of the loans (banks or government depending) use it later. Debt was created out of thin air. Sure. But debt is not money so it has nothing to do with inflation or deflation. It can be paid back over long periods of time (in the case of student loans 35 years). The government could pay students back over the course of 50 years to reduce the debt burden for them, but it would hardly be getting the same amount back in tax revenue. The government gives someone $1,000 and they spend it all, you might generate a couple hundred dollars in taxes over the course of the year if that money keeps changing hands. This solution is not feasible. Those in Occupy need to come up with something more realistic.
