You want to regard loans as short-term, last-ditch, desperate effort for when you get caught in a bad spot and have a good, workable plan to get out of it. You don't ever want to start a business on borrowed money, unless you're an expert in the field of your business with a lot of experience in running businesses in that sector. The best thing to do is to get a job and save all your money to start a business that will make you enough money to start the business you really want. You may need to start a business to get the money to start a business to get the money to start a business to get the money to start the business you want. Whatever it takes, really. Just do it all yourself. Don't accept loans or favors. Also, the whole world (except Amazon) is moving from brick-and-mortar to the internet, and you're trying to move internet sales to brick-and-mortar. It's a little backward-looking. It could work, but there's probably some research you could do to test the feasibility of this idea. You need to be creative in designing effective, science-based ways to predict your success or failure. Don't worry about licensing issues with wholesalers. That's not something to be worried about, at this point.
