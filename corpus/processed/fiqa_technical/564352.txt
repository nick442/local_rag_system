"Frequent flyer here..generally, I've found airline staff to be pleasant and professional. There have been some exceptions, but they probably contend with more high stress situations (including asshole customers) than many professions. Now, as a 6'5"" guy, if they can stop making the seats/knee room smaller every year, I'd be a LOT happier."
