I'm aware that banks have foreclosed properties as assets on their balance sheets -- those that they haven't been able to sell yet. But, housing prices nationally are down 50% from their peak. How can you seriously make price-fixing allegations against the banks when prices are about half of what they were at the peak of the bubble, when - I think we can all agree on this point - real estate was pretty decentralized?
