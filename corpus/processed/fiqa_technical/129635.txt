"Utter nonsense. You wish to use force to make me comply with your version of social equity. I want to use NO force upon anyone. I merely want each person to dispose of their own property as they see fit until/unless they start to use fraud or force. You cannot achieve what you want without using government jackboots to enforce it. My vision is one of voluntary, non forceful, exchange of value. The truth is that the ideological left continues to peddle this drool because it needs pretend victims in order to have any hope of having a foothold on political power. This, in turn, means that the dregs of society are courted by the left - the substance abusers, the terminally lazy, the incompetent, the selfish, and the entitled are all the natural feeding ground for this ridiculous ideology. But, as I said, you and yours are losing this battle, however subtly. I have done a ton fo consulting for large companies over the past few years (remember, I am personally unwilling to hire anyone for my own company). Guess that what they're doing? They're outsourcing - first within the US to the right to work States to try and get away from the corrupt and greedy union thugs. And secondly, they're moving jobs overseas wherever it makes sense. For every American fool that majors in Womens'/Gay/Black Studies, Sociologogy, Psychology, or a host of other utterly useless majors, there are kids in China, India, Russia, and increasingly even Africa, that are studying useful arts like science, mathematics, and engineering. The future of the US is being burned to the ground by geniuses like Obama and the left, and all you people can say is ""I want more, more, more."" Good luck with that - within 40 years you will be the rest of the world's bitches."
