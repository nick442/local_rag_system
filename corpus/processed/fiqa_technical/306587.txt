"People worked a long time before ""business"" existed. But I believe what works best for the greatest number of people is regulated capitalism mixed with a limited socialism and a strong social safety net, aka, social democracy. But I believe that when a few people gain too much power, control too many of a country's resources, that they distort or destroy it. They make almost everyone's life worse just to make their own better. Historically I see that again and again. Past a certain point money ceases to be money and becomes power. People with great wealth have power over the American people, power they hold without being elected by the people, power that does not end with their term of office, power that cannot be stripped from them for bad behavior. No one should be allowed to have that much unelected power. We should use progressive income taxes and estate taxes to strip power, a.k.a., money from such individuals and families. This should be done to keep the superwealthy from using unelected power for greedy or evil purposes."
