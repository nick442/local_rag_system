As of 2015, there were 1,650 IHOP restaurants in 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as in Bahrain, Canada, Dubai (UAE), Guatemala, Kuwait, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, The Philippines and the U.S. Virgin Islands. So 25 is 1.5% of 1650. So they closed less than 2% of their stores. Applebees apparently has over 2000 restaurants. So 100-120 is 5-6% of their stores.
