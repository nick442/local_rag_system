First, on-line you mostly and vastly buy things that don't need to be tried first to see if they fit. Even in clothing, casual shirts, jeans, socks, underwear and shoes don't need to be tried first. As for shipping costs, not if you are Amazon prime, and if you pay for shipping, it's cheaper than driving your car to the store and possibly paying for parking. Not to mention that time = money. It's the old retailers fault too: very basic selection of only items that sell for high margin and always issues with inventory. **I lost count of how many times I went to a store and they did not have the shirt or pants I wanted in the size I wanted.**
