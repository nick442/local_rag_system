Generally it is a taxable transaction. Basic principle of taxation everywhere is that the mean of payment doesn't matter. If the income is taxable - it is taxable regardless of the unit of currency you used. It can be a strawberry, a bitcoin, a gold nugget, or a dollar, it doesn't change a thing about how it is taxed. If you look at the United States tax code definition of taxable income, for example, you will find no mention whatsoever of any currency. Similarly with other tax laws I'm familiar with. I'm sure there's no such limitation in Australia.
