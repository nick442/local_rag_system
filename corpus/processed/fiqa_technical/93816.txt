Sterilize the whales, enforce rules to prevent SeaWorld from ever acquiring another whale, triple the size of the living areas for the whales (or even quadruple), allow them to perform if they want to, and enforce rules that no human will touch these whales ever again unless for medical procedures (more to prevent more humans from being killed). I feel like that would work. SeaWorld gets good PR for increasing the living area, they can't acquire anymore whales, and the whole issue is a non-issue in 20+ years when all the whales are dead and then we can go back to SeaWorld again. Edit: I would also suggest the same thing for all of the current show animals. If they are to be kept, they can not be used in shows and must have a natural-esque habitat.
