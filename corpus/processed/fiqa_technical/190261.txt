The NY company's board of directors are your agents and fiduciaries. I'll call them your agents below. The acquiring company entered into some contract that your agents negotiated. Whatever the acquiring company owes you in terms of money, equity, or specific communication is based on what your agents dealt for in the sale contract. Best ask your agents what they got for you.
