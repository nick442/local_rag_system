> The alternative is to do nothing. No. Make green energy cost less via improvements to the product rather than tax schemes; energy storage with a greater density than petrochem, better designs for solar to reduce the per mgw cost, cover base load electricity generation with nuclear, etc. If you make conventional energy artificially expensive to nudge people towards renewables then you open the door to politicians gaining power by promising to reduce energy costs to the consumer via removing those taxes you're advocating for. If you make green energy cheaper than conventional, then people will switch on their own.
