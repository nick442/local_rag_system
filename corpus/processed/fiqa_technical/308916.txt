It keeps it at a level playing field. By your logic, Netflix should start laying down infrastructure for their own internet. I am paying for that content. I'm also paying for the road. My point it's not an even playing field. If Comcast wants my steaming business offer a better service than Netflix. Making Netflix unusable because I'm forced to use Comcast in a place with no other ISPs doesn't seem like the kind of competition that fosters growth and innovation but rather stifles it, which is something stated explicitly in the FCCs mission and strategy. You're right it is all business. Which is why we have a government and government regulations and don't live in some laissez faire economy. The FCC is the government and should be protecting the citizens not the corporations. Edit: Lastly, sure it starts about being just business. What's to stop Fox news from paying Comcast to throttle CNNs website to unusable levels? It sets a terrible precedent and could eventually impede the freedom of speech. That's another conversation!
