"Why do you think you are entitled to ""fairness""? In this world you get what you get. I am pretty sure your employer is not paying you for how you ""feel"" either. And by-the-way turning up on time and not leaving early is not exceptional behaviour; it is expected behaviour. Bottom line: do you add more value to your employer's business then the new hires? If so, ask for a raise, if not find a way to add more value and then ask for a raise or keep doing what you're doing and accept what you get."
