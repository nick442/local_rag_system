"What our friend ""otherwiseyep"" is describing in his first posts is *credit*, not money. Money and credit are two very different things. Economies function on capital, which is existing savings and supply of goods/services. They cannot function on promises alone (credit). So from the perspective of Austrian economists, his OP's were misleading."
