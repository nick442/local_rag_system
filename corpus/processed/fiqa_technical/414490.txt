This is the result of market competition as well. * Cheese Company A pays its employees $10/hour. (20k/year) * Cheese Company B pays its employees $20/hour. (40k/year) This increase in wages results in a 50cent increase/kg in production cost to company B. Since the grocery chain has a policy to set their sales-price to 100% of purchase price, (in order to break even on a sale-price), this 50cent increase/kg, results in $1/kg when it hits the consumer. Assume both cheeses are equal, most consumers will purchase the product at a lower price, leading to lost sales for company B. **Capitalism, is a race to the bottom.**
