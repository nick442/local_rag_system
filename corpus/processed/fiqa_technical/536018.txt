I agree about irresponsible pay at the top level, but disagree about a company hiring on workers just to be a good citizen of the country. We should be doing everything we can, as a country, to educate our citizens for these higher level jobs and promote entrepreneurship and growth of new industries to generate jobs. That is how we can get everyone employed. Just asking corporations to hire on dead weight for the hell of it on a macro level is harmful, not helpful, and could lead to more unemployment when the next recession hits as entire companies are taken down for being irresponsible.
