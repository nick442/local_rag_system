> Managers got paid bonuses if they sold more deserts/alcohol so waiters are forced to offer every customer wine samples and pitch them on other drinks. ..those bastards, giving us free booze. The bar I go to actually takes pride in their beer. Full wall of microbrews. They do not sell \*lite. Standard procedure is to sit down, ask the bartender about what's good, and to be given half a dozen samples of the new kegs they got this week. I mean, *seriously*, those assholes -- trying to get me to find and drink a beer that actually I like. What a bunch of jerks.
