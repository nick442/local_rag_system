Is there evidence of Russian money laundering through bitcoin or is this your assumption? As I understand it laundering through btc would require you to explain why your wallet has millions in it, doesn't seem useful Edit: unless you maybe distributed the bitcoin to fake users and had them spend it on your own digital services? Would people be able to track the coins through the ledger and see that you're indirectly circulating coins from your personal wallet to your business one? I don't know I'm in too deep now
