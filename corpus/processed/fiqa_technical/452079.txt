Rocky is right on the money, +1 from me. I will adjust the convince and money issue: You don't mention your country, but here in the US several companies make it very easy to rent. For example, with a reservation National will allow you to pick any car you want. Just walk up, jump in, and ride away. Avis and Hertz will have your car ready, just find your name, go to your spot and jump in and go. All the paperwork is done electronically in both cases. Enterprise will come and pick you up, at just about any location, bring you to the shop and allow you to do the paperwork there. I am not sure if that paperwork can be done electronically, but perhaps it can. They will do the same in reverse once the rental is over. The key here is budget. You will save a lot of money by renting when needed over your peers that own a car. However, you will need to plan to have the money each month. I'd plan on having 50*2*4.*75 = 300 in a four weekend month, and 375 in a five weekend month. Carry over any excess not spent to the subsequent months. You will be well ahead of the game and not feel restricted in spending the money to rent.
