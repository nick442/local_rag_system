The best thing about bond is the lack of tie in between each movie(except for casino royale and quantum of solace). Each movie can stand on its own and be special on its own. Each movie can have its own bond, own Bond girl, an own villian. But for Star Wars, how long can you milk a different sith lord, a new Jedi master and yadda yadda. The first 3 Star Wars were a cult classic that turned into success.the next 3 were just a way to monetize the franchise further, everything afterwards will be garbage.
