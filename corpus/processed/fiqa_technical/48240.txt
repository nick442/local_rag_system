This is an extremely simplified version and not necessarily accurate. C for example has $800b in cash and 10+% Tier 1 capital relative to other banks. Yes, they need to write down debt but the larger concern as opposed to bankruptcy by capital markets is equity dilution. Both C and BAC need to raise equity capital due and, due to new leverage restrictions, will dilute existing shareholders so much that they will have difficulty matching previous EPS. Also, a lot of analysts expect thy aren't marking down assets enough (reducing that large Tier 1 buffer pretty heavily). One of the primary reasons they issue smaller dividends relative to JPM is that dividends for systematically important institutions must be approved by the Fed now (Dodd-Frank). They can't issue a big dividend because the Fed says they aren't well capitalized enough. To say they are bankrupt though shows a misunderstanding of bank balance sheets and how the FRB discount window works, though.
