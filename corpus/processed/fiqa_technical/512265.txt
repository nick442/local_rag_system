> ever eat paper? Yeah, of course, plenty of times. Not (usually) intentionally, but sometimes a wrapper will get stuck, etc. Also, it's a good way to get rid of something if you don't have a lighter. More so when I was a kid and messing around with 'secret notes' and the like but. .yeah, I've eaten paper. Granted, I've probably eaten gold as well, and there are some benefits or health values of gold. . within the pseudoscientific / alt-health crowd. .not sure I buy into those but. .it has some value. But, nothing like paper. Obviously there are different materials used for making paper. .. lots of barks have a value from a health perspective, a relative nutritional value. Growing the tree, depending on the type, can provide fruit, building materials, etc. .with the pulp providing a paper value. So, multiple benefits can come from paper. ..and, that's just the post-harvest aspect. well, the case of fruit I guess not. but, there's the environmental benefits of trees and such as well; habitats for wild life, wind breaks, carbon sequestration. soil health, etc. Multiple benefits, and that's just from tree-based paper. If you expand it out to something like, say, hemp paper? well, there's the oil. .. which can be used for fuel production, various other uses, and, most especially, the health benefits and consumption from it. ..while the remaining fibers can be used for construction.. be it compressed bricks, hempcrete (which has excellent values in strength, durability, insulation, weight-to-strength *ratio*, etc. And, again, the health benefits of hemp oil.. ..argued to be the single 'thing' you can consume solely (+ water) and get 100% of the nutrients you need. ..in mixed ratios and obviously it isn't as great as other things in concentrations, but. .it's extremely nutritious. Also, the plant is really good for the soil, again, habitats, sequesters carbon, helps to pull toxins and such *out* of the soil for bioremediation. Is quick to grow, grows densely, is durable, has minimal inputs needed, hardy, .. all around a great crop. and, again, the health benefits of its oil are *combined* with its paper making capabilities. .. and, good strong paper too. has a great weight, feel, durable, can/will last a really long time if properly handled. .and has much wider variance *in* 'proper handling' than tree-based paper. Solid product. You should look into it, .. here, I'll give you some links to help you out. * [9 Health Benefits of Hemp Oil That You Should Know](http://www.zliving.com/wellness/natural-remedies/9-health-benefits-of-hemp-oil-that-you-should-know) * [10 Incredible Benefits of Hemp Oil](http://herb.co/2016/10/17/incredible-benefits-hemp-oil/) * [12 Ways Using Hemp Seed Oil Will Improve Your Health & Your Life](http://www.naturallivingideas.com/hemp-seed-oil/) A bit sensationalistic in the headlines.. and, well, as to be expected I suppose, but regardless, pretty great stuff! .and, again, that's just the oil. The post-oil-extraction pulp can still go on to be used for the more-applicable-to-conversation paper. But, since USD's seem to be the main focus.. ..though other countries are progressively (or more-progressively I suppose) utilizing even *more* durable plastic in their notes. .but, for USD, still paper. and, as such, the more durable cotton paper. Now, comparing cotton to hemp is really.. . [hemp wins nearly every time](https://www.davidwolfe.com/hemp-vs-cotton/) but.. cotton is cotton and, recent headline and social controversy of cotton flower decorations aside. cotton is cotton. Most everything that I'm wearing right now is made of cotton. It's a nice fabric. Durable, flexible, soft, etc. Good stuff. Not the easiest to work with but, clearly not something the world is in short supply of. but, that doesn't really address your point though exactly. Like hemp, you can get cotton oil (or cotton seed oil to be more specific) from the plant while also getting the fibers that you'd need for paper production. It's a bit of a 'mixed back' and definitely *not* as straight forward as hemp's purported health benefits (and I didn't even *get* into the CBD oil stuff that hemp can provide).. . * [15 Benefits of Cottonseed Oil](http://www.searchhomeremedy.com/15-best-benefits-of-cotton-seed-oil/) * [7 Amazing Benefits & Uses of Cottonseed Oil](https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/oils/cottonseed-oil.html) * [10 Best Benefits of Cotton Seed Oil](http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/best-benefits-of-cotton-seed-oil/#gref) but, from there, things start to turn a little south, and weren't necessarily all that 'great' to begin with.. * [Is Cottonseed Oil Okay?](https://www.drweil.com/diet-nutrition/nutrition/is-cottonseed-oil-okay/) * [3 Best and Worst Oils For Your Health](https://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/3-best-and-worst-oils-for-your-health) So, I suppose my point is.. if I even really have a singular one.. is that paper, regardless of source, has at least *some* sort of nutritional value. or could anyway. As well, the crops used to produce the paper have the capability of ranging from some medicinal qualities all the way up to a seemingly really beneficial quantity of nutrients and compounds. At worst, the crops provide a habitat for various organisms. The problem with gold and paper currency is that, in the end, they're both inherently valued by the civilization that deems them valuable. I mean, take the quantity of gold in reserves around the world. Cross that with the industrial uses of gold (of which there are many) and, in turn, cross that with the artistic value of it. It's price isn't based on its use.. it's based on similar principals *as* fiat (paper.. and, increasingly, plastic) currency: society's perception that it has value. Gold has many properties that are excellent for many applications.. superior to most (all?) in certain cases. ..but, that's not why it's valued at its current price. .again, it's valued at its current price because of perceived value. Even from an artistic perspective, the amount of gold used in the Palace of Versailles.. for the paint and such, was 'minuscule' given how much of the palace is covered in gold. It was something like just a few ounces because the layering is so thin. Point: if 'the look of gold' was all that people were going for they could easily just use another metal coated in a very thin layer of gold and. externally, the appearance would be the same effect and the weight could theoretically be even lighter (or heavier). But, people want *more* than 'just the look'. They feel that the gold itself has a value beyond just the 'look'. .and, for all intents & purposes, it *does*. but *only* because they and other people choose to perceive it as having such. I've traded gold (profitably) for over 20 years. I understand the arguments very well. .but, vs food? In the end, the gold is a means not an end.
