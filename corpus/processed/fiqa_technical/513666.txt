"It's a shame because there's a lot more to SeaWorld than just orca shows. Along with research, educations, and conservation of marine life, they're pretty much the only places where endangered marine animals that are injured or orphaned can be taken to be rehabilitated and released. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaWorld#Animal_rescue_and_rehabilitation_program SeaWorld really is a unique place that has instrumental in protecting marine life, and it's rescued far more animals than anyone could claim they've harmed. We're living in a time when use of animals for entertainment is becoming no longer palatable for much of our society, but Blackfish was as one sided as activist ""documentaries"" typically are. It was only one side of the whole story."
