> if the government had access to that capital that this guy is clearly withholding by not paying his fair share, *they would engage in more productive ventures*. I don't know if that's necessarily true. Government doesn't always spend money better than private entities, and private entities don't always spend money better than government. I'd much rather see this research going on than more money going to beef up our military, but I also think this guy should pay his fair share of taxes like everyone else.
