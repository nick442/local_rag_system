"Maybe people should stop looking too very easy, very unskilled labor positions to support them. There's no such thing as a ""livable wage"". That's a myth. If you don't have the skills to do anything more complex than be a cashier at McDonald's, it is not up to the company to pay you more. It is up to you to improve your skills. These jobs will be eliminated soon enough anyway."
