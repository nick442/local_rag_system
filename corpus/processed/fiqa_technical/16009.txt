I think people would probably buy it more if the brand didn't have so much negative buzz.. It's like, someone recently asked me why I bought a BB (hadn't I heard how much financial mess they were in?), and I had to explain that despite the company's poor stock performance, the keyboard still works just as great as ever, and I still really like the interface (personal preference). The company may appear to be sinking, but even worst case I think there's a few years left in them.
