"Idk I've worked at a tech startup and an ad agency that have these culture perks. There were certainly times here and there that you had to work late but really I wouldn't say it ever cut into work/life balance. I was paid well, made great relationships, didn't feel over worked and still enjoyed these ""perks"". Sounds like some people in this thread are jaded or just being taken advantage of."
