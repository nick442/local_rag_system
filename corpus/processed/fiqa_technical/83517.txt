"I'd say there's technical leadership - ""that guy really knows his s**t and we don't have time to learn the details ourselves, so we'll go with his recommendations"" - and there's psychological leadership - ""this is the direction we want to move in, and he's the guy who can convince everyone else to move in that direction"".

I don't have any particular recommendations though.
