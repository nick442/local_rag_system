That is including over time paid. This title is misleading at best. How many hour do they work? Cop's shift is 12 hours. Over time only happens after 12 hours so these guys are literally busting their balls for this money how can you just simply put the total out there and not tell people how many hours do they work to earn this much? I'd say a police making that money by working over time is much more deserving that money than a money manager who makes easily hundred times that much.
