Income inequality has been increasing quite a bit. This means the rich are getting richer, with everyone else getting poorer. The handful of rich peOple can't generate much economic activity. They, for example, only eat 3 meals a day, buy a few cars a piece, own a few homes apiece, etc. The massive numbers of people in the middle and lower cannot buy as much stuff as they used to. For example, they eat out less; hold off buying that new car; go to fewer concerts, don't go on vacation, etc. This lowers demand all around. Less demand equals less economic activity. Governmental austerity will only make matters worse, as this will lower demand even more, producing less economic activity. This has been and continues happening in Europe big-time. Germany is pretty the only country that ramped up government spending in the last few years, and bought their way out ofmtheir recession. Greece, on the other hand, has had nothing but austerity and is circling the drain. Tl;dr 1% lots of money can't spend enough--99% little money, just can't spend.
