Fast food doesn't have to be shitty. Five Guys is a great example of a good, fast, cheap burger. Same goes for local favorite [Whataburger](http://www.qsrmagazine.com/qsr-50/whataburger-way) Burger King and Wendy's see market share eroding and assume they have a marketing problem, which makes me want to ask the executive team-- have you tried the food lately? Nobody eats at BK because their food tastes like shit. Meanwhile, their [inexperienced CEO](http://investor.bk.com/burgerking/web/conteudo_en.asp?idioma=1&conta=44&tipo=43568) (35 year old PE guy (!)) is focused on [cost cutting] (http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-24/burger-kings-ceo-daniel-schwartz-is-33-years-old). What a joke. What BK needs is a complete menu overhaul-- higher quality beef, fresh ingredients, nothing frozen, yadda yadda. But short term, that sort of thing looks bad on the income statement. Which kind of makes me wonder why they bothered going private in the first place. Poster child for management gone wrong.
