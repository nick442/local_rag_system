> Taxes were much higher in the period immediately following the Second World War which is widely considered one of the most productive and stable periods of US economic history. Nations around the world got bombed to shit during WW2, and when the war's over the US still has all its factories intact and got busy exporting equipment around the globe making hand over fist. Even high taxes couldn't stop the might of the American Industrial Juggernaut. However the situation today is much different.
