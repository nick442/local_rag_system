">> Reminder from history: Bill Clinton signed a contract with NK and even gave them nuclear reactors ""to prevent NK from having nuclear weapons!"". > Yes, that was a brilliant move by Clinton! LOL!! And we ended with NK having nuclear weapons. Brilliant Bill (I voted for him twice) and brilliant you! > But then George Bush seized power in the rigged 2000 presidential election. LOL!! What's next? Trump rigged the elections with the help of Russia? By the way, I did not vote for Bush, twice. > North Korea's response was sane and logical. You should move to NK to see how sane and logical they are! >> Do you really believe that Iran will not have nuclear weapons? > Multiple Iranian religious leaders have stated that WMD are an insult to god. LOL!!! An you believe them? Is it also an insult to god to cut your hands off if you steal, or to send a woman to jail because she rode on a bicycle? Move to Iran, please, and check that for us. > Given that Iran has repeatedly called for a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East LOL!! Yes, it would be a great idea if Israel does not have nuclear weapons, because, no wars to attack Israel will happen and surely Iran saying ""Death to Israel"" is just a joke. Darling, the only reason the middle east is relatively peaceful is because Israel has nuclear weapons, and Egypt, Jordan and even Saudi-Arabia have peace and friendly relations with Israel because they know Israel is not the risk. Iran with nuclear weapons is a risk. And Israel will make sure Iran will regret any attempt to attack anyone. My god!!! You are so brain washed."
