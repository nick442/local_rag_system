It's good friend. You seemed like a nice person when I was glancing through your history, which isn't what I could gather from the other guy (or what a person could probably gather from mine). I'm just on edge for a midterm today, and spent far too much time sharpening the fangs in my reply last night. I have Turkish nephews because my sister married a Turkish exchange student some years ago. I remember staring at my screen one afternoon almost exactly a year ago, and worrying over them because I couldn't contact her during the first hours of the coup. Having to live in a country like that would be extremely unsettling for me. I wish you the best of luck.
