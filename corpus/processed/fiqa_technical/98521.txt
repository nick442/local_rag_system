The problem isn't capitalism per se, but rather a failure of regulation. (Yes, purely pedantically, that means the problem *is* capitalism, but I hate saying it that way because it comes across as suggesting that capitalism in and of itself is bad) For capitalism to work, you *must* have regulation. When regulation fails and allows (in this case) companies to become nations unto themselves and potentially abusive, then yes - that becomes problematic.
