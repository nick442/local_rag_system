Would I have to pay income tax other then TDS on interest earned on my saving bank account. No being NRI you are not taxed in India on income outside of India. I am sending money from EU to my OWN saving account. Please note this account is not NRI\NRO\FCNR As an NRI you CANNOT by law hold a regular Savings Account. Please convert this account to NRO ASAP. Does the channel I use to transfer money to India would make any difference? Its 3rd party transfer service. Whether you transfer the funds or not is irrelevant. As the income was during the period when your status is NRI, there is no Tax in India. sold some shares from my Indian demat account online and got some STCG. You would need to pay tax on this in India Edit: Self Assessment Tax can be paid till 30 July 2015 for the Financial Year 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015. Tax have to be paid in advance, so if your tax obligation is more than Rs 10,000/- there will be an interest at 1% per month and penalty at 1% per month payable
