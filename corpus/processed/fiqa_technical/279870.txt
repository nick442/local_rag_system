I believe that the form you will need to fill out for the company is the IRS' W-8ECI form. My US-based Fortune 50 company pays my rent in Germany, and had my landlord fill one out so that they would not need to do any withholding for the payments. From this IRS site on withholding income for payments to Foreign Individuals: Withholding exemption. In most cases, you do not need to withhold tax on income if you receive a Form W-8ECI on which a foreign payee represents that: The foreign payee is the beneficial owner of the income, The income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and The income is includible in the payee's gross income. Good luck!
