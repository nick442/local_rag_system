I'm from Westchester. Multiple chipotle in multiple cities in westchester ALWAYS had lines out the door. From MV to Ryebrook to White Plains. Lunch and from 430-630 still have people waiting out the door. I've seen NYC chipotles with lines out the door. I went their all the time as a teen. It's what you get when you're just fucking around in Manhattan and don't want street food or restaurants. What part of the city are you from because chipotles test kitchen (where the have queso) in the city is always packed as well.
