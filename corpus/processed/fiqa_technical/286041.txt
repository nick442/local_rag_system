Server at Local Applebee's here. I used to work for the company in the 90s when I was in college. Last worked for them in 97. Cut to December 2016 and as a Stay At Home Dad I need a job. Get rehired and have been Serving again since. I can confirm two things. One, people hated tipping 15% then and hate 20% that much more now. The amount of regulars we have that come in, eat and leave no tip is significant. Two, it's not the food, it's the people the company has hired to cook it. Here in NH we have the lowest unemployment in the US. My kitchen manager talks frequently about how they can't find anyone to hire. An Applebee's kitchen is absolutely waaaay more than a bank of microwaves and *needs* people who know how to broil steaks and grill burgers. Want customers apparently want is Top Sirloin food and service at McDonalds prices, and the only way the company can provide that is to pay employees nothing. And then the company and the customers get what they pay for. Crap people. Not sure how this cycle will get broken but it's a Death Spiral if they don't.
