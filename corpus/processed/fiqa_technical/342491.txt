"Neither. Why would you have to classify startups as value or growth? A startup is its own category. You can find startups at ""classic"" valuations (price/book.. Etc) that would make investors' eyes water.. But that happens because many startups are early stage and so revenue or book value or other classic valuations don't quite suit."
