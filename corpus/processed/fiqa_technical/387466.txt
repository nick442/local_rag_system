Internal billing might make sense in some businesses, not so much in other. Personally, I hate it with a passion. I used to work for a big newspaper that is part of a huge media company with several other papers. We shared a huge archive with newspaper clipping that go back for 140 years, with a huge staff of excellent archivists - so this was a big asset. Every time I started on a new story my first call was to them, usually they would provide me with an overview of about 20 relevant articles - that saved me lots of time and got me quick up to speed. Then the business consulting types came in and decided the archive needs to be a profit center in its own right, billing each research request individually to each paper. Two months after they changed that we were ordered by our editors in chief not to use the archive as much as we used - in fact most of them said that archive use was only permitted if all other ways or research had failed. Even the use of the electronic archive over our intranet was billed against us. So the professional database had been built up over many decades, it was ready and easy to use - but we had to stick with google. Half a year later they started downsizing the archive, because for some weird reason their workload had dropped by half. The fact that our rate for errors in article had gone up was *obviously absolutely* unrelated.
