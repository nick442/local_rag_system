"Millennials prefer Walmart? I've never heard that. I'm a millennial and everyone I know hates Walmart. Millennials prefer stores that focus on ""organic"" and ""fresh"" products. Stores also get bonus points for ""locally made"" in millennials' eyes. Walmart is competitive due to excellent prices and wide variety of selection. Not because people like going there."
