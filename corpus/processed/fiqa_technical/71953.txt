They are, just now where you might expect them. They can't bring it to major cities yet, but there are some companies bringing fiber to rural areas. They are doing this where the max dsl speeds are not fast enough to be considered broadband and there is no other alternative that qualifies. There is a government grant program which gives them money to bring fiber or any broadband but there's no reason to not run fiber if you're going to the trouble. If / When these companies can become profitable enough to move into territories without the grant you will see google fiber competitors. In my town they are basically circling the city with fiber to the home just by covering the grant areas and expect to bring it in the city where we have charter, which is actually pretty good except for the upload speeds, within two years. Charter has already been upping their offerings in the area and has even doubled the speed at no cost for people in areas that are being served by the new fiber or will be soon as there is some overlap. Fiber isn't that far off for most people, because from what I understand almost everyone lives with 2 miles of a fiber run if you have cell phone access as most all cell phone towers have fiber to them, and the way it works is odd in that no normal ISP owns the fiber, it's by other companies that have to sell access to whoever can pay for it. This is just what I've heard from some discussions with people about the fiber company here so I don't know everything, maybe someone else here has more information.
