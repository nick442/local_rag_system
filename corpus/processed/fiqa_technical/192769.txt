The problem with this is that it really only works in a small firm where everyone knows everyone else. Once it gets bigger and all the managers don't know all the workers it becomes a matter of who can BS the skill level of their favorites better in the yearly review. Then the resentment isn't about normally unknown salaries, it's about whether other employee's levels are legitimate. Don't get me wrong, opening up the conversation and trying to make it more objective is good, but this isn't some sort of common sense, one size fits all panacea.
