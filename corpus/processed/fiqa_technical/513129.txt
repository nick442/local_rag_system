"Isn't the guy that made the article website critisizing the book himself rich? Since he writes his own books and so forth? And the critique is wrong on some things, so you don't take the things that are right seriously? Are you serious? If so, then why take RDPD seriosuly? It might be right on some things, but it's wrong on more things so you shouldn't take it seriously. I just think people overestimate this whole ""opening the mind"" thing and they are so elated because they ""are not one of the sheep(le) anymore"" and are somehow better than others that they end up worshiping whatever gave them this delicious piece of mind candy."
