I'm not sure about the preventing, you may be right. But the USA basically prevents people from going to college of they are too poor, even if they have the grades. So which is more disgusting, grade-based admissions or wealth-based admissions? In Israel, you can go to college if you didn't have the top grades but you might need to pay more and go to a worse school. So I don't know where you're talking about. As for best universities, those were created while encouraging kids to go. How long will that last if the USA starts discouraging education? Not long. I think back to that scene in the movie Inception where the guy's older self tells him: I'm from the future. You should go to China.
