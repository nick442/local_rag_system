I can't believe people over 25% underwater even bother paying the mortgage anymore. By no stretch of the imagination is this a reasonable thing to do, fiscally speaking. To those of you who would make the moral argument that you made an agreement to pay.. 1. You also made an agreement for what the penalty is if you do not pay. Either way you're still adhering to the agreement. 2. It's a bank loan, not a suicide pact.
