The mortgage crisis really became a crisis because of these marginally qualified borrowers. They put their 3% down, maxed out their available debt, then the economy turned, so they lost their jobs. Worse yet, they couldn't sell out because their houses were worth less than what they owed on the mortgage. Until the banks started allowing short sales there was nothing to do but lose their savings, get forclosed, and watch their credit rating get destroyed.
