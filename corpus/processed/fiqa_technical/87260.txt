All other things being equal, you might be better off contributing to a IRA that is a brokerage account. You will have lots of flexibility in your investments and there would probably not be fees for the account itself. You might incur commissions for trading and/or owning mutual funds that are charged by the funds themselves. You won't be able to borrow from an IRA, as opposed to a 401K. IMHO, that is a good thing. Are you suggesting that you would withdraw early from a retirement account? You'd probably be better off not doing that. Assuming a large salary, you would be paying 43% to withdraw your money early. Would you accept a loan at 43% interest? You are probably better off not putting the money in in the first place to accomplish your goals, then withdrawing it early. Most people opt for a 401K for two reasons. The company match and ease of investment make a compelling argument. Keep in mind if a 401K is available to you, regardless if you particpate, you start phasing out your IRA deduction at 60K a year (single) or 96K (married). Given your huge salary comments I imagine an IRA would not be an option in your scenario. Given that, if you leave a job, you can roll your 401K balance into a trading account.
