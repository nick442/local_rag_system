The proposed LightSquared service uses a frequency band (wavelength) that is adjacent to the GPS frequency band. A receiver *selectivity* is its ability to pass the desired signal and reject all others. This task is difficult if the desired signal is *close* an unwanted signal, and particularly difficult if the unwanted signal is much stronger than the desired signal. The task to be sufficiently selective here does not appear to be impossible (one out of four were not disturbed), but GPS receiver designers in general, apparently didn't see the need to spend the additional resources to reject an unwanted adjacent that wasn't there. The frequency-band that LightSquared proposes to use was designated for satellite communication.
