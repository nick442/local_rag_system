This! 5) 3rd shifts. China will continue to produce your product after the run is done and direct sell it. Bring in the white guy. At the end of the day, he is to take the moulds with him. Arrange this ahead of time. Sometimes they'll sell all the pieces that failed QC with your product name on it. Then thousands of angry customers are contacting you and complaining about broken products, demanding refunds. Have the destruction of failed QC products babysat. This is why getting components made in china but assembly in North America is a lot smarter. Use different factories for different parts, redo QC steps here. An underwater scooter manufacturer had their product made in china. They knew they would be knocked off so they sabotaged their own product. They spec'd the scooter with seals that would intentionally fail, they deleted the catalytic battery caps and some key safety systems. An 'overhaul/QC' line was set up in North America where they tore down every scooter, did their own QC and replaced the seals, caps and other components. Surprise! 2 months later Chinese clone scooters hit our shores and during testing they all imploded and failed during the first dives.
