The foods not great. That said if it was, I'm definitely far more likely to visit a fast casual restaurant. I don't need a waiter to wait on me for simple stuff like getting drinks. I'd say bring up the food quality, switch to fast casual (less employee overhead then as well), and have takeout. I constantly order from a local restaurant nearby, since they have takeout I can order using a mobile app and have solid wings. We dine in occasionally, but it's only if the kids are having a good day.
