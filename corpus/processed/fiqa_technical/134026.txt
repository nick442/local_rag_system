Looking at the numbers quickly, if he makes this amount for the entire year, single, no kids, no investment income, standard deduction only, his taxable income will be about $110,000.* That puts him in the 28% tax bracket. His federal tax would be: $18,481.25 plus 28% of the amount over $90,750 Which comes out to about $23,800 in tax liability. His federal withholding is $26,047 for the year, so with absolutely no deductions whatsoever, he will be getting a tax refund of about $2200. I'm not very familiar with the California tax return, but it is entirely possible that he would get a decent sized refund from the state as well. This means that his tax refund could be about the size of an extra paycheck. He may want to consider increasing his allowances, which would make his paychecks bigger and his tax refund smaller. That having been said, taxes are high, no doubt about it. Remember that when you are in the voting booth. :) * Here is how I got the taxable income number for the year:
