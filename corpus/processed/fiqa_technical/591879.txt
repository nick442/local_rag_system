I would say it really depends on where you are applying. Almost all the candidates that we get directly from school are either CFA level I candidates or have passed it already. It has become ubiquitous enough to not be note worthy for us (can't speak for other places). However, if you don't have anything else going on atm then definitely take the exam. I would also say that you should pick/hone your programming skills revise your textbooks. I can't believe the number of MFE graduates who don't know what risk-neutral pricing means.
