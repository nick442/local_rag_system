So the MS analyst wasn't acting independently of MS's role as underwriter when he revised his earnings estimates? MS is a big place. I guess I just assumed that someone could be on one end saying something, with other parts of the company blissfully unaware. All without a conspiracy to commit fraud. Good to know. Perhaps you can point - for those of us ignorant in finance - to the rules or laws that were broken here.
