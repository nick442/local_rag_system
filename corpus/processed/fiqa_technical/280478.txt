In the theater, it's a person who can afford to buy expensive pop corn, cause he can buy the expensive movie ticket too.. Also sitting at one place will make him feel hungry and buy something to eat.. So maximum chances are that in the theater, that guy is your potential customer.. Otherwise if the popcorn seller is somewhere outside the theater, they may charge you less. That's because of a different target audience.. They would be targeting anyone who comes near the theater, who would not be willing to pay for expensive snacks or movie tickets.. So very few customers around will be actually potential customers.. To maximize their profits, they will keep the prices low and supply as much as they can.. I know this is going against the normal Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply graph, but if the prices are low there will be high demand, so if the PED is more than 1, the supplier should supply as much as they can, to maximize profits.. Its all based on the target audience.. That's what I think should be the case of expensive popcorn in movie theaters..
