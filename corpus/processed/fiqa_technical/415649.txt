While this question Can I get a rebate after using my HSA? mentions Health savings account the answer is still applicable. Go to the website for the plan administrator. They will either have a form to put the money back into the account, or they will have a contact number. In the past when I had an FSA I did this. In one case I remember the doctor told us the bill would be X, but when they submitted the claim to the insurance the final bill was less than X so the doctor's office sent us the extra back. I was able to return the money back to the FSA administrator following their procedure. Your situation is not unusual, accidental transactions happen all the time.
