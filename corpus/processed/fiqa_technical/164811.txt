I love how the spokespeople in the article basically try to pass it off as 'no big deal' or 'we reacted right away'. I don't believe any of that for an instant. I have been in several Kmart stores and they almost always have a leaking ceiling..and not a tiny leak either. They've even have a couple stores roofs completely collapse in heavy snowstorms over the past few years. It's amazing that some of the buildings are legally habitable.
