Let's say they paid you: $300K a year or $3M..would that change your tune? I've seen the upper end of Hollywood types be absolutely horrid to great people and they will gladly suck it up. Reason: 1) there is little choice--low percentage of success, 2) All or nothing environment and 3) there is a huge line of people who would kill to have this abusive job.
