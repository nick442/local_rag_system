There is no right way but changing your methodology to suit your situation is a problem. They were happy to use a 4 years period during the crazy times to lower the VAR and then switch to 1 year afterwards to do the same. It is picking and choosing your measures to suit the situation and that is statistical heresy. While there may not be a right way to measure VAR choosing the measure that is suits your situation is bad methodology. And of course there is such a thing as bad statistical methodology, you see it everyday. I also pointed out above that it vairies from bank to bank what confidence interval you use.
