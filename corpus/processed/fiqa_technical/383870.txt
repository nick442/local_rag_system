Another factor to consider is that resale value of the laptop is quite bit more if it is still under warranty. This would apply to people who replace their laptop often. It is higher because the purchaser can be assured they are not getting a lemon. I determined this by comparing prices on ebay before selling my computer. Of course, if you keep your laptop longer than the warranty, this means nothing. But for me it meant I could sell my old laptop quickly and for a better price. Because I used my laptop for work and totally depended on it, even one day of downtime would cost me a lot, so it was worthwhile to keep a relatively new laptop under warranty. Also, for those using Apple Care, there is an undocumented perk: Apple covered an out of warranty repair on a time capsule under my apple care for my laptop even tho they were not purchased at the same time.
