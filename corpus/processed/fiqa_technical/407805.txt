UPS lost my x-mas present that I ordered for my girlfriend. if more websites allowed me to ship via fedex, I'd probably use that option. I had to come up with something else because now I can't get another of the object I'd ordered in stores, and damned if I'm having it shipped to get stolen or misdelivered a second time.
