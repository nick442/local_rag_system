"Good strategy for a start. I think Milo is nearly done right now being ""famous"" or ""productive"". He's for sure taken a backburner to the presidency so even if he came with something more outrageous most people are focused elsewhere. Also people have gotten tired of his BS so publishers aren't picking him up and schools aren't allowing him to speak. Yes it creates a scene but now the scene is more legal, not riots with big news coverage."
