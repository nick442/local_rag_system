If they really believed in their product, the juice, they should have just reorganized their structure to idk repackage it slightly. So then we can buy the squeezables in gas stations or something. Sounds pretty ready if people found out you could just squeeze em out. That's how you cut manufacture prices down and still reliever the MAIN product, the juice. You can build the best machine in the world but if the product your selling doesn't need the machine, well you've just made a mechanical baby. Beautiful, expensive, and sure as hell don't make you money.
