>So where is all the money? I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc. It's a closed loop, right? Almost right. The problem is that the wages paid to the laborers are not high enough to buy all the goods produced, so there is constant overproduction and at the same time there are people who would want to buy these goods, but can't afford them. Some people lose their jobs, which reduces demand for goods even further. It's a vicious circle and everbody loses in the long run.
