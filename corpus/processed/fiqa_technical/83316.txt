Always a good time to buy gold. Think less in terms of commodities, more in terms of true money that can not be inflated out of existence. Buy it as cheap as you can, hold it for as long as possible. The historical graphs never lie and it proves time and time again its a good store of value. I would never think of it in terms of a speculative bet though. If it does reward you, its because the global currency system is broken. I think its broken, it may reward you. But never expect it to reward you. In the short term (2-3 years), the gold price can be manipulated. In the long term (10 years) less so.
