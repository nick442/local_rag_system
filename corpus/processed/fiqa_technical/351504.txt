> You use Amazon if you use the internet. Amazon AWS controls 50% of the cloud provider market, which provides the back end and holds data for many websites, apps, and services. There's simply no avoiding feeding Amazon since they control the backend According to your own post, they control only half the backend, which means the other half is controlled by their competitors. In retail, Amazon controls ~4% of all retail sales in the US, and 40-50% of online sales, which does not look like a monopoly to me. Yes, they are currently standing out and many investors expect more growth in the future, but this will only be true if they can stay competitive in price/quality/service/etc.. In every area they do business they have well-funded competitors which could start snatching up customers if they slip. Even AWS, it's not that hard to move to Microsoft's, or some other company's cloud platform if Amazon's rates get too high. The same is true for Google and Facebook, there's no service they provide that doesn't have well-funded competitors. Just because they currently lead the market doesn't mean they're a monopoly.
