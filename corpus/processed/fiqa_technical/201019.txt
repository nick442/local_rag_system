"A subsidy is a benefit. While you're right most of the time it is a crude ""transfer of wealth by the US government"" the formal intent of a subsidy is to assist so as to confer an advantage or mitigate a disadvantage. If as you say ""discounting the risk premium"" actively by the US government so as to confer, in the words of Ueda and Di Mauro, a ""funding cost advantage [to] SIFIs [of] around 60bp in 2007 and 80bp in 2009"" is not a subsidy, then what is it?"
