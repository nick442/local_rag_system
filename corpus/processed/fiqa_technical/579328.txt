">They will want to step away for a few years. Then will quickly realize, or already knew, holding cash is just as bad of an investment. They will then turn to hedges against inflation, real assets, further devaluing the dollar. They will turn to commodities and energy the only things in the past decade besides entrepreneurial investments which have increased in value. This is where you differ from the Fed. Not saying either one of you is wrong, but the Fed wants inflation in order to force individuals and, more importantly, businesses to invest their capital in CapEx, equities or other ""risky"" assets in order to combat inflation. You bring up a good point that if they chose to invest solely in inflation hedges, it may compound the problem. What happens when supply and demand are forced back towards equilibrium though? Gold is a different animal, but for other metals with industrial uses, would demand through inflation hedging be able to fend off decreased industrial and actual demand for the physical material?"
