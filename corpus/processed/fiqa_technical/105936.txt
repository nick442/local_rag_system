A movie theater is just a money-making popcorn/candy/drinks stand that happens to be right next to a money-neutral room that people watch films in. A bowling alley isn't much different. Unless your ideas involve trivia night, karaoke, 80s music night, local brewery tap takeovers, guest chefs, or other things that drive bar/food traffic, it's going to be hard to increase profits enough to turn things around.
