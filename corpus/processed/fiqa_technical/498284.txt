"*Most* companies have gross margins, because it's not *just* tied to cost of ""goods,"" but cost of *revenue.* FedEx has costs of revenue and therefore a gross margin. In some cases, however, yes, some companies will not have a cost directly tied to revenue. These are services companies in which an employees salary is by no means tied to the revenue (i.e. a salary of $50k will still do $100k of work or $1M of work with no change). EDIT: Work has me looking at American Addiction Centers (AAC), which is an example of a company without cost of revenue/goods."
