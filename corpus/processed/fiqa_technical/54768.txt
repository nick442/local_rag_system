"It wasn't my statement, but I will take a stab at this. The human brain is a fantastic pattern recognizer. In fact, I would say that it is the very best that we are currently aware of. Having seen the trajectory of a thrown ball a few times, your brain can predict with startling accuracy where your hand needs to be in order to intercept it..or how to move to get out of its way, should it be a larger ball. Your brain isn't doing the math necessary to actually calculate the trajectory, just estimating based on past experience. The same thing happens with ever decision your brain makes. It estimates probability whenever it can in situations ranging from location prediction to what your significant other's reaction will be to you staying out late again. Note that these things can be actually calculated via trajectory calculation or bayesian statistics respectively, but your brain doesn't have time for such things, so it approximates them instead and is startlingly good at it in most cases. For a list of ways that your brain is less good at these things, see ""List of Cognitive Biases"" on Wikipedia."
