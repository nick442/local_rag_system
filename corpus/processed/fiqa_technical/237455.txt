I pointed this out to my wife (Russian), and she said not to forget that most of those imports are from old soviet satellites, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, ect.. Infact, your own article, just a little further down states: >The major food exporters to Russia last year were, in order of importance: Belarus ($2.7bn), Brazil ($2.4bn), Ukraine ($1.9bn), Germany ($1.8bn) and Turkey ($1.68bn), Reuters news agency reports. None of those countries with the exception of Germany are sanctioning Russia, and are thus not part of the embargo. Not sure how impacted Ukraine's production capacities have been with the conflict? My wife is convinced that the none EU partners Russia already imports form will keep up just fine. The other Russians I know, agree, and think this was a good move by the government. She thinks the whole point of this embargo is to impact Germany so they get the EU to stop blatantly doing whatever the US wants, since this will impact them probably the most of the EU members.
