"You make it look like the US is the leader in import taxes on vehicles. According to this [source](http://www.caranddriver.com/features/free-trade-cars-why-a-useurope-free-trade-agreement-is-a-good-idea-feature), ""The standard tariff for importing cars to the U.S. is 2.5 percent of their value. For pickup trucks and commercial vans, the tariff is a whopping 25 percent. Individual European countries donâ€™t charge import duties, but the European Union charges a flat rate of 10 percent on imported automobiles."" When Trump says the US has been screwed over in their trade deals, he's not (always) talking out of his ass."
