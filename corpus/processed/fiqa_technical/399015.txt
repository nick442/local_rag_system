"Alright bud. I'm sure you're a smart and nice person who just wants people to earn as much as they possibly can (at least I hope you are), so let's look at it logically. You are suggesting people that are unskilled / uneducated lack the ability to negotiate in their favor and a government law must be placed to help them. However, the effect of a higher minimum wage means you now force that very individual to compete with more people for that same position. This is because there's not a lot of competition for a job that pays say $8/hr because skilled people don't apply to them. The higher you set that minimum wage like the ""livable wage"" of $15/hr that I hear so much about, the more skilled people will apply to these positions because they now pay more. What makes you think an unskilled / uneducated individual will be able to find employment in this competitive environment? You are assuming that people earning minimum wage today will continue earning a minimum wage even if a higher minimum wage law is passed. Also remember that employment goes both ways. Just as a potential employee has the freedom to walk away from a wage he doesn't like, an employer is free to not hire an employee for a given wage. An employer does not hire personnel that provides value less than the wage paid because that employee now costs the employer to keep him retained. So when you enforce a minimum wage which states an employer must at a minimum pay a certain wage, you forcibly fire all the employees that do not merit that wage. You effectively take away the 1 bargaining chip unskilled and uneducated individuals can offer which is offering to work for lower wages."
