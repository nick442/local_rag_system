back when i was trying to save my house before i went completely bankrupt i tried to apply for farm work down in florida. they basically told me to piss off and something about the department of labor. i talked to a friend who had a similar experience. its not that we're too good (especially as the economy gets worse and as we get more desperate) but they dont even want us in it. suffice it to say, i lost my home and now live on the floor of my parents spare bedroom in california. nobody wanted to hire me. ex-boeing employee here and casualty of that corporate disaster.
