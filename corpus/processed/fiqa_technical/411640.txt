The Airsoft game is a tactical one played only with aggressive tactics, safety is always first. The balls used in the Airsoft guns are non-metallic and small in size, but still if neglected they may cause major damage to your body. This is so because the balls will hurt badly as they move with high kinetic energy. Hence to make the game safe and to enjoy in the fullest use cheap airsoft gear that is supplied during the game.
