Yeah, I heard about that! That's virtually the same thing (in a different form) as a new currency as it's backed solely by the state's ability to uphold its value, but yes, given that it's trading for pennies on the dollar it's no surprise the USD is the primary currency there. It will be very interesting to see the policies that Mugabe's successor (his ex-wife or #2) puts in place. Either way I bet they fail, but hope they don't and actually make the necessary reforms to help the country succeed.
