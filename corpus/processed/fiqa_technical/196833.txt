"As littleadv says, Form W7 is the right one. Under ""Reason for applying"" you could select (e): Spouse of U.S. citizen/resident alien. See additional details in the form instructions. This would be an option after you are married. Note that the top of the form states in bold italics that ""An IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) is for federal tax purposes only."" It may be worth editing the question to reference your assertion that an ITIN can be used for credit card applications."
