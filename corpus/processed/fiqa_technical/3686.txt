">Interest rate swaps are now over 80 percent of the massive derivatives market, and JPMorgan holds about $57.5 trillion of them. Without the protective JPMorgan swaps, interest rates on U.S. debt could follow those of Greece and climb to 30%. CEO Dimon could, then, indeed be “the guy in charge”: he could be controlling the lever propping up the whole U.S. financial system. This guy is a total idiot. To anyone wondering why, learn what is meant by ""notional value"" and you'll unedrstand why people that list numbers like this as if it has that much importance do not understand derivatives. In short, 57 trillion in *notional value* means vastly less in actual play, far too little to backstop the US government, where a trillion is an actual trillion."
