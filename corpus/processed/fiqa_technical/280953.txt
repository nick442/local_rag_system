Ya my dad worked on the audit team in the 70s that actually looked at the deal. He later used the connection to get an accountant job at McDonald's. He read Ray's and the brothers letters as was helping as the impartial 3rd party to vet the audit and numbers. The buyout fued was bullshit. The 1% was a contentious issue the brothers wanted and kept trying to include in the negotiations but eventually gave up on when Ray offered them a satisfactory deal in return.
