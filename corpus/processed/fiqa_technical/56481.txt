But how can you have continued growth? Nothing is perpetual at least not in real life - maybe in theory :) I'm guessing you're talking about growth in the money supply right? Well how can you keep growing your money supply indefinitely if doing so requires the creation of a larger amount of debt than the amount that already exists? Think of it in rounds. If each round of debt requires that new debt to the amount of 105% of the old debt is created, how long can you keep that running for? You've essentially got the principle of compound interest working against you. I'm obviously missing something really big because this seems ridiculous to me..
