Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that maintence CapEx is viewed as required cash spend in order to *maintain* the business at its current levels, whereas as expansionary CapEx is viewed as voluntary. If I were to value your Company I would want to know how well it cash flows as is given that whatever voluntary growth CapEx investments current management is making may not apply to my plan for the company if I were to purchase it. Secondly, often times expansionary CapEx is funded through credit facilities, and thus from a credit perspective it is helpful to break out maintenance capex and growth capex when determining certain credit metrics, such as a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
