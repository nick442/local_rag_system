I'm a believer in broad index funds for the vast majority of investors. However, I'm sure someone here is more qualified than me to speak to the correct allocation. I'm mostly pointing out low-hanging fruit: you should (almost) never invest in the company that pays your wages. You could just dump it in the S&P or some broad market index and be in a better position.
