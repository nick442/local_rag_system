"Collateralized & Secured are interchangeable terms. Note the following two quotes from wikipedia (links below): ""A secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or property) as collateral for the loan, which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who gives the loan."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secured_loan ""In lending agreements, collateral is a borrower's pledge of specific property to a lender, to secure repayment of a loan."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_%28finance%29 This website also uses the terms interchangeably: http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-collateral-loan.htm Loan & Line of Credit are not interchangeable terms. In a loan, you receive a one time disbursement & repay it over a fixed amortization schedule. (Think home mortgage) In a line of credit, you can pay back & re-borrow from your credit line as often as you need. (Think credit card or Home Equity Line of Credit)"
