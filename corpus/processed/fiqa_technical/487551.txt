I'm pretty sure that banking has provided a safety net for criminal (predator) types. To take risks and do business in a way that would not be possible otherwise. Now we have grossly innefficient business, in the SOLE interest of predators (claiming to be providers). My carrot may travel 1500 miles (or more) to get to me, when carrots are grown within a mile of me. It's commercial communism. FORCING products and servives on us involuntarily. WASTING resources in the interests of the few. DEATH to these miscreants is my opinion. If it were up to me, there would be no global anything.
