> Next time you call your bank (or credit card company), ask them some pointed questions: Do you have a financial or data sharing agreement with Equifax? If so, why? Next time you are deciding WHICH bank to use, preferably for a significant relationship (ie million dollar + loan, business relationship, etc), you ask them then. A bank teller has no power. If you are already a customer, they don't care. No one gets bonuses for customer retention, bonuses are for new business. That's when people will care about your questions.
