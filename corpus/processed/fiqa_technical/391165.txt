"I assume you mean ""how."" Sure.. Suppose I have the option of hiring 3 people, or buying a robot to do the work that they would do. (Some single function, in order to operate it 24 hours a day, 5 days a week, I'd have to hire 3 shifts to do it.) I choose the robot because I look at the cost (capital and operations) of the robot and it's lower than, say, 2 years of paying 3 people. The productivity of the factory went up, but not due to any improvement in the workforce. After the robot has done enough work to effectively pay for its capital costs, the additional work it's doing is profit. The case labor tries to make is that ""output per worker went up so workers should be paid more,"" except the attribution of that increase in output has nothing to do with the workers and everything to do with the company's ability to leverage capital."
