Nothing wrong with disagreeing. I think that health is fundamentally different from the other services you mentioned. People can be careless with health and massive bills are added that end up in the taxpayers expense. No incentive exists for arson other than the fringe occurrences. The US already pays the most per person for healthcare in the world. You can't fix this problem with money.
