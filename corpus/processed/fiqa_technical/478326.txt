I'd really like to have a discussion around this, if people have another opinion, like that the derivatives market is actually correct and that we don't need to change it, I'd really like to hear your arguments. I'm really curious about this, I'd really like to know what motivates someone (other than pure greed) to say that the actual state of the markets are OK.
