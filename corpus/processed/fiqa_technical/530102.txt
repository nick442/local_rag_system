Valuations are literally 100% driven by retail investors who 20 years ago were literally peasants and are not grounded in reality. I'm working at a small IB in China over the summer. The IPO I'm working on is a small cnc machining company. Some of its competitors are literally trading at 100x EBITDA, growing sales at literally 5%. Nobody who is in a management position has any inkling of how finance works(not to say they're not smart, just that they have no experience).
