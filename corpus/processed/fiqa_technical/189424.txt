Skewed in what way? Present a reason why somebody would falsely report information. If you're saying its skewed lower, then you're saying people with low salaries don't tell the university their truthful salary or don't report. Why would someone do that? Wouldn't they feel indignant that their education wasn't getting them enough money and would want to demonstrate that to the school?
