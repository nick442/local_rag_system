"Yeah I find the mixture to be quite varied, with their comments actually making quite clear how moronic some are (""we're data driven"" <-- duh) while some of them are just another way of communicating something eminently sensible. Things I've used that I don't feel bad at all for having used: 12. This is where the rubber meets the road = Don’t screw up (it's a slightly less patronizing way of saying ""don't screw up"", though I've used the straight form as well) 32. At the end of the day…. = OK, enough talking back and forth, we’re going to do what I want to do (again, I could say what the translation is, but why not go with the slightly more subtle version?) 61. It’s scalable = We can sell a lot of it in theory (I've seen a fuckton of things that are NOT scalable, so it's not an unreasonable thing to discuss) Business clichés quite often serve a real purpose in heading off conflict while communicating something quite painful in an inoffensive way. If they manage to head off conflict, obviously they start getting used a lot, which turns them in to clichés, which starts a new sort of conflict until a new way of doing it is developed. This sort of thing keeps management consultants in business."
