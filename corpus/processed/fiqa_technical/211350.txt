Like I said up above - ya got a spouse with cancer who has no health insurance if you leave your job - you don't leave your job. Also, our expenses in general here in L.A. are so insanely high. We have never been able to save substantial money. I think we're responsible for our own happiness, but we are also responsible for people we have to take care of, be they kids, spouses, etc.
