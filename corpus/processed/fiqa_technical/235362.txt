A *licensed* electrician is pretty much guaranteed to have the skills. A union electrician is almost guaranteed to fuck a project schedule up. >Unions also fought for and got us a 40 hour work week and overtime pay. Benefits and disability insurance. Snore. Clichés are getting tiresome. You pay for disability insurance. Benefits came about as a way to get around WWII pay freezes. Look it up. >currently politicians are rolling back those protections No, they're not. >the work to get those benefits will be that much harder With this self-contradiction, you have proven my point: Unions were once needed, but now it's just abusing for the benefits for union workers only. Perhaps you got confused by what is happening in Wisconsin. >Police are pepper spraying old grandmas and people sitting down not doing anything You are just full of tiresome clichés. If OWS wasn't violent and unruly, this wouldn't happen. Nobody got raped at a Tea Party event. No shitting on cop cars. No Teargas. OWS is responsible for those things that you cite. The right to peacefully assemble does not mean you can encircle and block the police from doing their lawful job, which is what happened at UC Davis. The old lady got trapped in a protest that got out of hand thanks to OWS idiots. Stop whining. Stop being violent. Get permits and do the right thing and you might be just as effective in electing change as the Tea Party has been. I doubt it though. OWS children are just plain ignorant. The 1st Amendment doesn't mean you can build tree forts in the park. That was the final nail in its coffin.
