My household is well into the top 10% of income in the U.S. and I have absolutely no problem paying my fair share of taxes. I grew up poor and have been homeless. My wife wasn't much better off growing up the daughter of a truck driver. Now, I am senior management at a tech firm and she is a research scientist with a PhD in neuroscience. If not for a little bit of luck we would be living very different lives. We need the United States to become a true meritocracy. There are too many people like myself and my wife - who had the talent to achieve really awesome lives for ourselves - that were never given the opportunity to go to college, let alone grad school. Don't get me wrong. I took every opportunity that showed a glimmer of hope while I worked my ass off (at one point, I was working one full time job and another job that was at least 30 hours a week while holding down 12 to 15 credits of classes every semester), but I want everyone to have just the opportunity to be the best person they can be. Obviously, opportunity does not equate to success, but opportunity should be enough. We are letting the next great business leaders, scientists, doctors, and engineers squander their potential in poverty and not only is this inexcusable on the micro level, it makes us weaker as a nation. I will *never* understand how my peers don't understand this.
