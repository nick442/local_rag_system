Where is the revenue? I can't see how Reddit can be profitable given how poor it is as an advertising platform, and how its core user base loves ad blockers. This seems like yet another valuation based on projected hypothetical earnings, using user activity as a metric. Yes, that *might* translate into earnings later. Or it might not. What am I missing? Ps having witnessed the rise and fall of Digg, after they said very similar things about re-skinning their site, I hope they don't mess this up. PPs I don't know about anyone else, but I hardly ever use Reddit desktop. Mobile app only for me.
