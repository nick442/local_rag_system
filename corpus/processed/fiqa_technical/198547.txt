The Chinese corporate sector doesn't really have a crazy amount of debt compared to developed countries. And households even less. What people are concerned about is how quickly it is rising, not the actual amount. And also the structure of the debt. (And how much of it isn't captured and reported.) But to answer your question, the two factors you mention are positively correlated, not negatively as you postulate. The more assets you have, the higher the odds you are able to repay and the more debt lenders are willing to give you. But debt tends to be measured relative to income not wealth and this is another reason Chinese household wealth may be overstated.
