"In the US, the ""first class forever"" postage stamps. The post office has never lowered the cost of a stamp, but has raise it several times recently. Given that the gov't has bailed out everyone else, I believe it is a safe bet that they would bail out the post office if it financially fell apart. And you can always use them to send a letter. They aren't very liquid, and it would probably be difficult to invest in them in large quantities. Although, when the post office does raise rates, you could sell yours off on ebay or something."
