> Arguably, the dollar today is essentially backed by oil i.e. as economists say the 'petrodollar'. This isn't really true. The exchange rate between USD and a barrel of oil floats with the market whereas it was fixed with gold. Also by the nature of the way oil is consumed it doesn't make sense to think of it this way - gold retains state when used whereas oil is burnt up never to be seen again.
