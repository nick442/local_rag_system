Long story short, we are currently in a set of asset and credit bubbles across many financial asset categories, driven by the tremendous amount of liquidity created by central banks with 0 interest rates and quantitative easing since 2008. The bitcoin bubble is pure financial speculation, a price increase in the thousands of percents is unsustainable. And the stock bubbles are enormous and exist across all major US indices, and indices abroad like the Nikkei 225.
