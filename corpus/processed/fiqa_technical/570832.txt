Okay, so you give the subsidy to the person buying the solar panel, who would then give that subsidy to the company selling the solar panel. Isn't that effectively exactly the same as giving the subsidy directly to the company selling the solar panel? Both would result in exactly the same cost for the consumer, and same profit for the company.
