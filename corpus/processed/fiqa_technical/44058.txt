__________ _________ ____________ Therefore, I get the outcome I want. The human brain must think: it can't stop. If you don't believe me, try meditating. The mental process of putting stuff in those blanks is called rationalization. This is a bored mind who wants something. If that mind is not particularly well disciplined, those things will get pretty unrealistic. That is what has happened to your friend. Landlords do not like drama. They do like money. Generally a landlord will be happy to take your money any reasonable way that they can achieve. It sounds like either your landlord lost the ability to do credit cards, or he got sick of paying the 3% overhead, or some other overhead costs that may be higher because he does not have the right credit card merchant service. For instance PayPal Here charges 2.70% flat, but a traditional swiper can cost up to $2000 a year in trumped up fees and charges. As soon as the landlord calls the rent a debt, he has to take cash. But in most places, rental is at-will, and the landlord can evict for any reason or no reason at all (except race, creed, color, national origin, family, running a daycare center and a few other protected reasons).. and there's not a whole lot you can do about it. Even for a lease he can trump up a reason. Your friend would be wise to have a meeting of the minds with the landlord about how he'd like to pay. Business is done by mutual consent, not non-consensual legal tricks. I agree, I wouldn't do ACH either. One problem with ACH (or credit) is the landlord can charge anything he pleases, and that's when they start sneaking in devious surcharges for things. Once he's pulled the money out, you're really at a disadvantage to argue, since he already has the money. And it's really difficult to do a chargeback on part of a payment, so you end up having to chargeback the entire rent check, and now he can evict you.
