"Who the fuck cares about exhausting? Sorry dude that is not the criteria. You examples are bulshit and non responsive to my points. But one more time to humor you. Nope your janitor who did not study to get a degree so he cannot get your ex's job. While your ex can get the janitor job if she wanted to. So nope one is going to get paid better. Brain surgery will put your gf at upper middle class/ lower upper class. Btw saying ""but to argue cleaning kids vomit and shit off the bathroom floor takes less skill and should be paid less ..Yeah no."" Is not a valid argument. It is your opinion and by this point in the conversation, it is no longer necessary to repeat yourself. In factâ€‹, you can repeat it till you are blue in the face and it will still remain your unsubstantiated opinion. Not only is the fact that cleaning puke requires less skill one of the reasons why janitors get paid less but to boot the fact that it requires less skill means that more people can do the job and basic supply-demand inevitable leads to lower price which in this case is lower salary. The fact is that there will always be a lower class, it being the part below the middle class. And it takes skills to pull oneself out (or luck to be born rich which I do agree is unfortunate). If you have no skills or chose to work a job that does not require skill, you will be in the lower class. So now, besides a basic English class, you seem to need a basic logic class. I'd suggest looking that stuff up online or if you need the more structured environment, your local community college."
