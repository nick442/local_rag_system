First off, let me just say that you are an intelligent individual, and regardless of how heated this conversation gets I really appreciate the opportunity to talk with you about this. I definitely don't disagree with you that Germany **got** it's debt by a different means and that the mechanisms that kept it in debt are different from the mechanisms that are effecting us today, but the discussion we're having does have everything to do with debt! We've been deficit spending for generations and we're trillions in the hole, and that's the psychological issue hanging over our heads. I'm not arguing with the accepted principles of Macroeconomics. In fact, what's just occurred to me is that we could put together another Bretton-Woods type conference (which would hopefully learn from the mistakes of the previous systems) so we can design a system that will keep inflation low while we dump money into the economy. From what I understand, inflation has always been lower while these (albiet flawed) previous systems were in place, and the issue in my mind with dumping money while the debt situation is such a concern, is that speculators could sh*t the bed and devalue our currency
