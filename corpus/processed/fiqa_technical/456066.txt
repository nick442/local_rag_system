It's not personal, but simply a shift in the demographics that can be measured. Identifying those changes within the market, who is doing what and why, then reporting it to the board, is part of her job. Quality of food, dining experience, etc, etc are all things that should be reviewed on a regular basis. This is also more of an industry wide issue, as the changing tastes and expectations are finding more than just this one company struggling, as the CEO rightly points out. The food has always been sub-par and vastly overpriced second tier fast food. The experience is usually as good as the food. This is the entire range of restaurants, TGI Fridays, Ruby Tuesday, Applebee's, etc, etc. They were popular and offered a reliable, if poor, meal wherever you went and quite popular. I've actively avoided them for years, unless in a position to refuse, or someone else was paying, which was usually both. But I was an outlier, and they understood there was little they could do to get me to come in. This is a demographic shift, not simply a blame game, and once identified, they then try to determine how to alter their model to match that shift.
