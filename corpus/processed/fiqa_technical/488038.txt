What about giving back as a form of advertizing? Like the Adopt a Highway program (which will put up a sign saying that your company has adopted that part of the highway) or donating some of your items to be sold as a fund raiser and have your tags on them. I feel like this is both a way to give back and a way to promote myself.. Is that wrong?
