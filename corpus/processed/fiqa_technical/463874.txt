Wrong, the whole point is to help people who need it. The only reason they need the help is because their employer refuses to pay them accordingly. The food stamp program was not created to help coincide with a business model, it was created to make sure people who couldn't afford to eat were able to eat. If Walmart can't make it on it's own then a company like Walmart doesn't deserve to exist. If we had some sort of law requiring businesses to pay higher wages than minimum wage when these businesses meet some sort of requirement then we wouldn't have this problem.
