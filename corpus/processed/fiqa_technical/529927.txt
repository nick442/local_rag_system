"Your SSA payments are not IRA contributions, but they're actually a tax that is earmarked to the Social Security Trust Fund. As such, no, you don't have any ""contributions"" that can be refunded: you paid a tax, and in exchange for having paid that tax you will possibly later have a benefit. However, some foreign nationals are able to convey that benefit into their national savings plan. The Social Security Administration has a FAQ page on this particular subject. Unfortunately for you, Pakistan does not have a bilateral agreement according to their list, so you may be out of luck."
