> That's utter stupid ignorant garbage. Why would anyone ever buy a failing business so that it loses money so they aren't taxed on the losses? Because they have a political agenda, and they have so much money (Bezos was briefly the richest man in the world) that they don't care. Did you get it now? And REMEMBER! If you have a political agenda, then truth, facts and Journalism is not what are using.
