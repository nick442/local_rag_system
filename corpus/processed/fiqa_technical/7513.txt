"Try it on a Kindle or eBook reader. I used to think this way about eBooks. Was too much of a purist. I'd had experience reading from iPads and computers. It's seriously a huge difference. The Kindle doesn't strain, it's light, can fit in (larger) pockets, and is incredibly handy. The battery life lets it stay on for days at a time as well. Battery isn't a huge issue unless you plan to be stranded on an island sometime soon. The library thing I suppose is an aesthetic thing. You could always just look through your book list on a Kindle as well. That way you save some room in your house? But I suppose some people just ""want"" a library to have - I can empathize."
