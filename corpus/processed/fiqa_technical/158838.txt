"Here is the thing if in 2020-2040 you can buy CD's that pay 4% then you would kick yourself for paying your mortgage early and costing you a no risk 1% revenue on your money. Think about this? You have a 4% mortgage that is costing you less than 3% after tax deduction"" in 2025 you are buying 10 year notes at 7% which is not out of the question. You will be making 4% on your money with virtually no risk. Personally I agree with JoeTaxpayer. I have gone a step further and done so with two houses and I netted myself over 20 grand in 30 months. So in short you have to ask yourself ""Can I make more than 3% on my money?"""
