I'm building a big addition onto my house. It's my third huge construction job. I use Amazon to buy tools, lighting, wire, radiant heat supplies, small appliances, smart home items, and specialty parts. HD and Lowes are good for cheap or heavy items. I also want to inspect my lumber, but even that is better delivered from a lumber yard when I need more than a few dozen boards or sheets of drywall. I have things delivered to my house almost daily from Amazon.
