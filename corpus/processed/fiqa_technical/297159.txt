I really like Rocky's answer, some more info: Keep in mind there is no limit on punitive damages. You could sue for the pants (160) + the filling fee (50) + a reasonable hourly rate to compensate your time (assume 200) + punitive damages of 4590 (assume 5000 limit on small claims court). When facing a suit of 5000, it could be much cheaper to settle for 160. Keep in mind you don't have to take it. Once you file you may only settle for the pants plus filling fee. Once you actually get to court, you may only settle for the pants + filling fee + some time compensation. If you have the claim ticket, you will win. The question becomes how much punitive damages could you also win? Filling fee, easy. The compensation for your time, very likely. Once the owner is served a summons, they will probably go to a lawyer. The lawyer will tell them to settle ASAP. Use that to your advantage. One thing you might be able to settle for is free dry cleaning. They might give you the $160, plus another $160 in free dry cleaning..if you are willing to use them again.
