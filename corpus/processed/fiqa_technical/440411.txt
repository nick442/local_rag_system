This article is hilariously wrong. They studied companies that are already structured in such a way that they pay far less than statuatory rates. The VAST majority of companies do not have sprawling international operations and cannot benefit from these types of structures, thus they are paying tax rates far closer to statuatory rates. The study is looking at the WRONG companies and drawing a false conclusion from them. Itâ€™s simple math. Reducing tax rates makes companies more profitable, providing more capital for expand and grow. Growth requires adding employees. Only a moron would argue that companies are better off and will grow faster when more of their profits are taken from them via taxation.
