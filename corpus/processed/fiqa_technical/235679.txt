"While I agree with this, I also think a tiny fraction of that mentality comes from the simple notion that: you can find a desk job that pays great, so why work a hard manual job that also pays great? Take the average worker, and tell them ""You can do manual labor for $xx,000/yr, or you can do a desk job for $xx,000/yr"". Most people will pick the desk job for obvious reasons. So it's not just the belief that certain jobs are below them (although that IS most of it), but the simple notion that we were sold over the last 30 years that desk workers in cubicle farms can make as much money as someone working a labor/manual job, so go for the desk job."
