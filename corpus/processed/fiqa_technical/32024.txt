It's not totally serious, but it's an interesting solution to the problem. You pay them in equity into a trust that then has some operational control. Meaning they are being compensated for their labor and have their sentience acknowledged. This would mean they merit more reasonable accommodations since they're employees, and produce distributions which can be used to buy more control or for environmental charity. I'd also find the inevitable editorials / comments that their QoL has surpassed the foreign labor going through Disney University amusing.
