> You're saying that the best plan for America to remain relevant in the global economy is to not encourage education? Yes, if that education is to spend 50k+ on yet another business management or arts degree. We need practical skills and degrees that back an education that allows someone to build, create and maintain. Having an educated populace that does nothing is worse than having them skip school because at least then society did not pay for the wasted education.
