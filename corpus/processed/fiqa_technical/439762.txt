"MS4 still undecided about specialty. And it sucks. I literally have no idea what I want to do. I have ruled out some big ones, but on my list (no joke) are peds subspecialty, ortho, ENT, derm, rads, IR, anesthesia. All f***ing over the place. Half of these I probably can't do because I didn't know I want to be an orthopod since I was 5, don't have 7 years of research with 10 pubs, and am not best friends with the chairman. I want to be a surgeon but I want to have a life. I want to make money but I want to be happy at work. I want to work hard but not sacrifice my family. There are some of us who know what they want to do (eureka moment), most of us figure it out as we go along, and a few of us aka me are paralyzed with fear and have no clue what the hell to do. /u/brobroygmi lied on the inter webs. He's a med student His ""business"" is obviously not what he's trying to make it sound like it is."
