You only insure assets, and you only insure them for the people that depend on them. You don't need to insure a liability. Therefore: Example: I have life insurance equal to a couple of years salary, in order to make sure my wife doesn't encounter any hardships if I die. I'm the primary income earner, and she will take of the kids. Once we have kids we'll get life insurance for her to cover what the costs would be to take care of the kids if she were to die.
