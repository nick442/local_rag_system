I am; I bought the house as a preforeclosure (short sell) at 120000; 100% financed with a USDA loan and lived there for about 5 years before my wife and I took a job in Birmingham. With a 30 yr fixed rate.. 119000 is about as low as I can go before I would have to come out of pocket at closing to get the lien released.. and the problem is there's nothing left in my pockets.
