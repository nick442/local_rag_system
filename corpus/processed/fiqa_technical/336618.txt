If I understand what you're asking, I think you're looking at the relationship wrong. Yes, when one currency has a higher interest rate relative to another, it's value should, theoretically, appreciate. For example, if the USD interest rate is 10% and the EUR is 5%, the USD should appreciate in value against the EUR. However, the parity relationship tells you the price at which an investor would be indifferent to the difference in interest rates. So using the formula for interest rate parity: (1+r(USD))/(1+r(EUR)) = F/S and plugging in the interest rates from above and a spot rate of $1.5/EUR: (1.1)/(1.05) = F/(1.5) The 1 year forward rate would have to be $1.5714/EUR in order for the investor to be INDIFFERENT between holding USD or EUR. All this assuming interest rate parity holds. I'm not big on Econ but this is how I understood it when studying for the CFA exam the past few months. So please, someone correct me if I'm wrong.
