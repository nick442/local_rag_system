> Show me proof that Microsoft's starting salaries are over $100k. The last figure I saw was $86k. That figure must be several years old - $86k base pay sounds about the range they were paying in 2006 or so. About a year ago Microsoft handed out massive across-the-board pay raises to everyone to bring their salaries in line with those offered by Apple and Google. But obviously like all companies they keep the exact figures hidden from public. About two years ago I knew some college graduates going to work for Microsoft, and they were already in the $90k range even before the sweeping pay raises which happened mid last year. And this is all of course all referring to base pay and doesn't count bonuses. Because of the way Microsoft's review process works, almost everyone receives a bonus at the end of the year. 90% of engineers at MS will receive as a bonus 10-20% of their annual salary in cash, and an additional 10-20% of their annual salary in stock. Now people don't usually count those when comparing base pay, but if you want to look at total compensation it's *easily* past six figures even if you assume a really low base pay like $86k.
