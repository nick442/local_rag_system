Let me pick on one of the quotes from the article: > As Shierholz emphasizes, “for a full recovery in the labor market to occur, two key things need to happen: Layoffs need to come down, and hiring needs to pick up.” How much further can layoffs go? [Looking at 40 years worth of data](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=HHo), initial jobless claims are near historic lows. If you adjust layoffs to the size of the work force, [they are at all-time lows](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=HHp).
