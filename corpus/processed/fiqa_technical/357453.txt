Number 3 isnâ€™t as easy as it seems. I interviewed at one place and the manager was affable and happy. He told me he loved his job and the company. After I was there for 4 months I reminded him of this conversation and asked what he liked about the company. He said he lied to me so I would take the position. I left a few weeks after that, but I should have listening to my internal feelings about the company. Be sure to look around at the staff and the environment, even the people you are not interviewing you. Do they look like they are serving time and hope to be released for good behavior? Watch their demeanor and body language they say a lot. Number 5 is very important. I have friends that took jobs that use out of date technology and now they are almost unemployable.
