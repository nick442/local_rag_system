>Companies have been hiring younger workers because of purely cost-based considerations. Nope all the economic evidence shows that young people without higher education pre-recession and pretty much all under 30s since the recession have been pushed out of the labour market in favour of older workers, already established workers taking pay cuts and part time work and in many lesser skilled areas immigrant labour. >The problem is that most of the children we've dealt with feel completely entitled to a baby boomer salary The entitled/not prepared for work etc arguments that people have started to make is bullshit and a ridiculous piece of nonsense spouted by business groups when asked why arent you hiring more. It was the same 10,20,30 years ago and i bet if you look back at any major recession businesses will spout the same nonsense. You also complain of them jumping ship, then provide a career ladder, training and a competitive salary. Businesses destroyed job security and career progression in so many areas to save money they never think it costs them money and productivity in the long term.
