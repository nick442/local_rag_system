I'm not saying new jobs aren't created every day with the increased pace of technology, I'm just saying it's not fair to claim that every job a robot replaces will be made up for 1:1 with a robot support job and that the only thing holding that back is education. Also, I'm not arguing against technological progress in general. The distinct difference with automation is that it replaces jobs. When we went from horses to cars, over time people migrated from one transportation support role to another. Carriage drivers (or their children) became taxi drivers with time. What I'm wondering is what happens when those roles are *replaced* not changed. When all taxis and trucks are driven by robots, what happens to those people? It's not like they become flying taxi or flying truck operators. Those jobs just don't exist any more. The impact of automation to date has been absorbed as we have transitioned to a services based economy rather than a production based economy, but I can't see what we would transition to if many of the services we receive and all of production are no longer provided by humans.
