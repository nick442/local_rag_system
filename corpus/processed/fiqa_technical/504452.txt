For an injection molding machine, you're looking at tens of thousands of USD. Also, specialist training is required to operate the machine and create molds. For an injection molding company to make a mold for you and use their machine, several thousand USD for tooling and then a couple of USD for each part. Also, keep in mind that you can't really create hollow parts with injection molding, like you do with a 3D printer. You would have to create two parts, which are then put together (the method depends on the material). For small-scale manufacturing, and this includes 100-200 parts a month, you're better off with 3D printing. Professional 3D printing services will charge you within an order of magnitude around USD 500 per kilogram, depending on the material, quality requirements, and volume.
