"First of all the deal specifically stated that giftcards were excluded. Due to a bug in the system (or more likely just negligent programming of the system) they forgot to actually stop people from buying giftcards. You weren't ""taking up on the offer"" because you weren't suppose to be able to buy giftcards. You are exploiting a bug in combination with cashiers who both did not notice the coupon excluded giftcards and didn't realize that giftcards should be excluded because of the abuse. Secondly, they also specifically limited the number of coupons you could print. Again, by photocopying them, you are circumnavigating the system and exploiting the fact that they should've put unique IDs on each coupon printed. Negligence on their part again, but clearly the offer they were trying to extend did not include the ability to redeem 100's of the coupon per person. Finally, from the article: >When you have to start disguising yourself, visiting multiple cashiers and you get rejected but still keep trying, an intelligent person would know that they are, at the very least, doing something wrong, even if their conscience hadnâ€™t already told them that earlier."
