Credit card companies charge merchants for accepting their cards. They'll take their cut and give you some of the fee back as a reward. So, in reality merchants have increased their prices to accommodate for the credit card processing fees. The credit card takes a bit of their fee and gives you back some of the money you wouldn't have spent if there were no fees for using a credit card.
