I know that the Port Authority employees don't work for the city, so that's a straw man. The reason you've been disingenuous is because you implied that the fact that New York City is overwhelmingly Democratic has any bearing over the control of the New York State Legislature, or the Governorship, when this is clearly not the case. The fact that the current executive director was appointed by Paterson is the first relevant argument you've made. Even so, the current state of the Port Authority was shaped by more than the past 5 years, and to imply otherwise is also disingenuous.
