"I was able to attend an open discussion on Illinois pensions a few years back. Dick Ingram, head of the Illinois Teacher's Retirement System spoke, as did a public employee union leader, Governor Quin's budget director and Christine Radogno who is a state lawmaker. It was eye opening on many levels. Some of the points that stick with me are: * The state has never, over 30 years, followed standard practice and used an actuary to determine how much to put into the pension funds each year. The legislators just pulled numbers out of the air each year. As a result the pensions have never been properly funded. The benefits are rich but, according to the people on this panel the main issue is this under funding. * Some years the state declared a pension holiday and put nothing into the pension funds at all. When this was brought up the largely union crowd started to turn on Radogno but she held up her hand, said she had voted against that and then commented that the unions all signed off on the pension holidays. As one the crowd's heads turned to the union rep on the board. He turned red and stared at the floor. * 2/3 of the teacher's pension hole is for people already retired. Changing benefits for current teachers will not help enough. I asked Mr Ingram how much additional tax he would need to plug the hole in the system he manages. He answered ""double"". I asked for how long. He said ""It doesn't work like that. I'd need double the current amount forever."" I came away much better informed but deeply saddened. Like 69% of the people polled, I want these teachers and public employee to get their money. I just don't see how it can happen."
