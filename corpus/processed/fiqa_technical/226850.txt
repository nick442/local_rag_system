> I'm saying that instead of some of these companies spending 70% of their earnings on stock buybacks they should reinvest that money into their employees and **pay out larger dividends to shareholders**. Wait..what? What do you think the difference between dividends and buybacks is? Buybacks and dividends are just different ways of distributing cash to shareholders. The main difference is that with a buyback, shareholders can choose whether to cash out or hold.
