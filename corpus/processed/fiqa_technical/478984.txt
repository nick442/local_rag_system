Friend, there is a difference between following the letter of the law vs the spirit of the law. Because something is legal doesn't make it the ethical choice. If I'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $100 bill without noticing, I can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally, but its hardly the moral thing to do. Taken to the extreme, if it was legal to buy and sell slaves, I still wouldn't do it even if it provided a monetary benefit. Or, if I drove by a person dying and bleeding on the street, it would be legal for me to drive home and do nothing (I think..not so sure as I write it). While I agree with you that tax laws are at fault, its reprehensible to me that corporations making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region choose tax avoidance as opposed to doing what is not only right, but better in the long run for all parties. Keep in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind. I fully respect your perspective and you're entitled to make choices based on whether they are legal or not, but I choose to live life differently. Best of luck.
