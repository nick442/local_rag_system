Explain to me how the fact I will go to jail with a gun pointed to my head if I don't pay taxes which then go to pay off your debt simply because I worked hard to get a good job and pay off my debt is not stealing? What the hell are you talking about - that is literally the definition of stealing - putting a gun to someone's head and taking their money. If I graduated with a lot of debt (which I did) but couldn't pay it off I would take personal responsibility like an honest person and work hard to find a good job or live cheap to pay it off (like I did). This will also incentivize less people to get unnecessary degrees that don't have jobs available because they don't increase productivity/standard of livings for other people. The reduction in demand also will force Colleges to cut costs and lower prices. A win win. Stop thinking stealing from me to pay off your debt is moral just because you hire the Government to do it for you.
