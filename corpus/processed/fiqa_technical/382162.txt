This factory is also for cars being sold into China. It makes sense for the factory that serves the China market to be close to where the cars are going. Especially since so many of the components of the car are made in China in the first place. (Toyota, VW, BMW, etc make cars in the US for a reason!) EDIT: My original comment said these cars were only for the Chinese market and that is wrong.
