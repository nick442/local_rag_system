> Why do people have such little financial control? That's what the second half of the article is about. It's all psychology. I don't think there's anything inherently dumb about putting something on layaway. It can even be a useful tool for teaching people to save money for things. Think of it as spending $5 to train your brain to accept delayed gratification. On the other hand, I know people who think that rent-to-own is a great way to get an awesome computer or TV for really cheap. Those people are idiots. Even if you tell them that they're paying 2-3x the regular price of the thing, it just doesn't register in their brain. They don't care. They want shit NOW.
