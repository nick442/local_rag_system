I maintain a strong bias against taking on any debt, of any sort, and I feel it serves me well. This is not to say I would never take on a debt, like a car loan, mortgage, or educational loan. It's just that there is a built in bias against it. The reason that bias is good is that, in my view, taking on (unforced) debt presents the following problems: Therefore, the standing no-debt bias. That said, if there is a very compelling reason to take on unforced debt, it could override the bias. The best example I know is that my mother bought a house with a mortgage when she had the cash, because CDs at that time were paying far more than the mortgage interest rate (this was back around the 80s when CDs hit an absurd 18%!). To not take on that debt would be refusing free money! But that's a rare case. Today, CDs and other guaranteed interest streams are at historical lows, so this factor is really not in play.
