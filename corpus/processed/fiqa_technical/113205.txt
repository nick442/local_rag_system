Pure fearmongering. The poison is in the dose. Finding trace amounts of anything is completely irrelevant and is never a cause for concern. Until they publish what the actual concentrations are - and which concentrations might be a problem, this is complete non-news. (The fact that they left out the concentration is rather telling.!)
