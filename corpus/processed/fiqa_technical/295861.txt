If you're able to pop this data into excel you can quickly calculate the solution. Every one of these problems boils down to 'Interest Rate', 'Term', 'Payment', 'Present Value', and 'Future Value' (FV will typically be zero). Excel has a formula to calculate any of these components based off of the other inputs. In this case, the given information is: Interest Rate: 7.56% Term: 36 Months Monthly PMT: $350 Present Value: ? You can use the =PV() formula and input the other known values. One caveat is that you'll need to adjust the interest rate to account for the monthly compounding. So, the formula would be =PV(.0063,36,-350). This gives a result of $11,242, which is the amount you'd be able to borrow. [All of these can also be solved on the TI-84+, but I don't have my old calculator on me to walk through the steps] To calculate the total interest paid, you would then find out how much you'll be paying over the life of the loan. If your monthly payment is $350 for 36 months, the total amount you'd pay is $12,600 ($350*36). Subtract the $11,242 calculated in step one, and you are left with $1,358 worth of interest. Hope that makes sense. Let me know if you want me to go over any of the steps in more detail. As a former finance student, I would highly recommend locking down the TVM functions, as they will pop up quite often throughout your schooling/career. Best of luck!
