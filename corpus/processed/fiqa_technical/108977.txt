I find myself doing well until I compare myself to someone else I think is doing well or better. I just bought a car on credit for the first time in 16 years. As a household we are making more than we ever have. With the exception of the car, we have no debt. If I don't listen to the news, I am happy. It's when I start listening to how dire things are, or when I start second-guessing my decisions, or when I wonder whether I will lose my job (for no other reason that anything is possible), that I begin to feel like the world is going to end. So, avoid Reddit and TV, stick to reading early 19th century novels, and we'll all be fine.
