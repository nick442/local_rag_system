Very true. I work in corporate finance and the hours are typically 9-6, but when we have our annual operating plan or some sort of deliverable we'll stay past 8. But here, because analysts get overtime (time and a half) we rarely work past 10 (anything past 12 hours in double time!) The work life balance is quite fantastic! However, the pay is not what it would be if you chose banking or consulting (it's comparable $60k but no bonuses).
