It IS affecting our bottom line though. The rich have been taking more of the pie by suppressing wages while also getting tax cuts for decades. There's no reason that the super wealthy should be paying less tax (as a percentage of income) than Americans in the bottom tax brackets. That's a large part of why American infrastructure is crumbling, the top earners (who couldn't earn that much outside the system) aren't paying their fair share. And don't even bother bringing up that top earners pay the most dollar amount of tax because that's exactly how it's supposed to work in a progressive system but paying the most in tax doesn't necessarily mean they're paying enough. The percent payed in tax is supposed to go UP the more you earn, not down.
