It all boils down to this: If you don't have a record of what you own before a fire happens, you can't get it after the fire happens. The more records you have, the better. Proof of sales price. Proof of authenticity. Condition. Quantity. If you have to prove value, you'll be glad you have the records. It makes sense also to see what kind of things are not covered. Is art covered? How about coins or jewelry? A stamp collection? Antiques? If replacing these kinds of things is important to you, then make sure you (a) have insurance for it, and (b) can demonstrate its value with your records (purchase receipt, appraisal, etc.)
