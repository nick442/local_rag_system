they have been incrementally making more and more stuff illegal in this area. when my family members started in the business almost anything was ok so long as you didn't hurt your own company, which you had a duty towards. as a board member, unfortunately, Gupta did have a duty towards the companies. so there's nothing borderline about what he did. a major figure in this story contacted a family member for tips once. that family member politely got off the phone. it's not hard, or blurry, for someone with real ethics.
