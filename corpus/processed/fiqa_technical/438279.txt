I think it's entirely possible with smart trades and a lotttttt of self-education. I made the majority of it on penny stocks so far, but have recently switched primarily to options plays and have had some very bad luck, but mostly good fortune. So, in that vein, in your hypothetical situation, I would pay myself to educate myself and then trade for the 1M and keep all the fees that would be paid to someone for everything that was done. Then I would take the remainder of the 10 years off and travel around the world :) RachelTrades, You are walking into a buzzsaw. You do not understand the risks you are taking, and your gambles will inevitably result in you losing nearly everything. Do yourself a favor and discuss your investing process with a professional. Describe your trades and how you evaluate your positions with this individual and try and hear them when they tell you how badly you are setting yourself up for ruin. I realize that you have no reason to listen to a random person on the internet, but I hope that you are able to take a moment of honest reflection and save yourself
