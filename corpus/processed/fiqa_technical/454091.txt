"You have run up against the ""build a better mousetrap"" problem. It's impossible to build a better mousetrap than the sprung neck breaker we all know. You might THINK your design is better. *but it isn't*. The market has decided that you can't beat the normal mouse trap. Yes, others are available, and maybe some are cheaper, and maybe some are better, *but the vast majority of sales will always be for the traditional item*. In marketing terms you are insane if you want to get into the mousetrap business, with a new design of mousetrap."
