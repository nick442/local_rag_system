You commenters in this post seem to disagree with what this guy is saying because he turned down a Trump post and took shots at him? Do you sincerely feel that all type of regulation hurts this country? What of the religious right taking a hold on education? Will that help America in the generations to come in competing against the world? Think for a sec before you type in more of the same as I've read here.
