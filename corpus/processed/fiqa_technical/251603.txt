"I've seen various blog posts (mostly from Penelope Trunk) refer to ""optimizers"" versus ""settlers."" The optimizers are the go-getters, the ones always on the move, trying to optimize their time, their life, their experience, etc. They tend to be younger, on average, live in bigger cities, and on the whole, tend to be less happy. The settlers are the ones who settle for what is, live in smaller cities, and tend to be happier, albeit ""less interesting"". Assuming that your idea of ""slowing down"" refers to moving away from that maximizer lifestyle, yes, I think you'll probably save money. Apparently it costs money to be unhappy! Going out for meals everyday, going out with friends every evening, shopping for the latest and greatest whatever, buying the newest gizmo, trading up your car every 3 years, traveling every other weekend to far-off places, making your life ""interesting"" - these all cost, and far more than their opposites. Take time to be happy with what you have - enjoy your comfortable and broken-in shoes, enjoy your paid-off car, enjoy some quiet alone time with a good (library) book, appreciate the delicate tastes of a homecooked meal over the in-your-face greasebomb of restaurant food, take a walk, shut off the latest Apple iDevice, and just be. You'll save money, find calm, and feel refreshed. *Apologies for waxing philosophical - though the connotations of ""slowing down"" sort of insist on it :)."
