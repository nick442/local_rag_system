"AFAIK they use entirely different LTE frequencies in Japan and the US, hence the issues with the ""new iPad"" being LTE in the States but not here. Additionally, there are still Japanese manufacturers who are big brands in the Japanese market, but more or less unheard of overseas. So there's likely to be relatively limited scope for economies of scale regarding handsets. Sure, with a limited number of handsets (e.g. the iPhone) you may be able to place a larger order, but when was the last time you heard of a network operator dictating terms to Apple? That's why only Softbank had the iPhone at launch, because they were the only one willing to cede to Apple's high pricing demands. And that's before you even get into language related issues. As far as LTE equipment goes, it depends on suppliers and whether the practicalities of ordering equipment for two very different territories, thousands of miles apart, with very different geography will bear a lot of fruit. As for people traveling between Japan and the States, its such a tiny proportion of customers, it would barely make a dent. And most corporate customers historically favor DoCoMo anyway and given Japanese business culture are unlikely to change any time soon. In a nutshell, the synergies may not be as strong as it first seems."
