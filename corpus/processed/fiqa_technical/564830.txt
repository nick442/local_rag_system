Is it what I want to eat when I want to eat good food? No, absolutely not. Do I occasionally eat it? Yes. It's a matter of price/time/convenience, which is basically the entire fast food industry. I absolutely believe pizza that isn't artisanal level can be automated and the product can still be damn good. The chief problem with frozen pizza isn't that it's made by a robot, it's that it is frozen.
