Seems the journalistic DDOS attack worked on you. When we're flooded with crap it makes it very hard to filter out the noise. The goal isn't to change our minds, but to have us grow to think it's all garbage. There's still great journalism out there, it's just more drowned out by a huge volume of idiocracy.
