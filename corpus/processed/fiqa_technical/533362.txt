"I would suggest having your money auto-deposited into a savings account. Then use cash weekly to pay for everything you purchase. Forget the ATM card, because you can burn through your whole paycheck and then run out. Set a certain budget (say $200 per week, just making up a number), and that's all you get. Withdraw $200 from the bank / ATM, and then walk away. No buying online (because it isn't restricted), no buying on a card. All expenses (beyond utilities) comes out of that cash. When you want to spend more, you need to wait until your next cash ""paycheck"". If you want to spend more (on whatever you end up splurging on), you will need to cut back in other areas (cheaper food, etc). As others have mentioned, freeze that ATM card, and don't use it at all."
