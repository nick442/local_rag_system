One more thing to consider is fleet upgrading. Let's say an individual person drives in the rain and finds out that set of circumstances causes the car to fishtail and crash. Now that one person knows that lesson. Nobody else benefits from that new knowledge. That one guy will be super careful next time it rains and he drives into a curve or whatever, but the next guy doesn't know better, so he may make the same mistake as the first driver. When the computer AI crashes the car, the company pours over the crash data. The software is tweaked to learn to avoid that kind of accident, and that updated software is pushed to the whole fleet. Now every car that gets that update is a little bit better of a driver. Over the months and years, it will get better and better.
