I used to think the physical books were great but I'm definitely over that. You end up with shelves of books you'll probably never open again. It just contributes to the clutter. Oddly I feel the opposite about text books from the parent commentor. I feel like text books are still handier and more functional in paper form. A digital copy would be useful for doing searches maybe but provided the book has a good index that should be covered.
