Be glad you don't live in the Pacific Northwest. We're still recovering from a refinery shut down that sent our gas prices to $4.30/gallon while the rest of the nation was at $3.50/gallon. Our gas prices are still higher than US average at $3.70/gallon. Some gas stations are still charging $3.90+ here.
