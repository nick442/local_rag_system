"I don't know why you're getting downvoted. I'm a ""lib"" and I find it sad that the media has whipped up everyone into a lather expecting arrests now- all based on NOTHING. It's sad there's no investigative spirit or skepticism left on the neoliberal side. (I'm not a neoliberal- the left has split into oblivion which is sad, but typical)."
