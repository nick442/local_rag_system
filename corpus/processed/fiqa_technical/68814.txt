It might some but I'd wager it pushes the short-term rental pricing down (like hotels) while pushing the long-term rental and housing market prices up. If landlords can make way more in short-term rentals they are going to do that and limit the supply of long-term. The tourism sector may have increased revenue but by what extent I don't know. I'd wager that exploding rent and housing prices will negate any benefits for most residents and may end up costing them much more. This is why I think you should only be able to do it on your primary residence. Unless you want to be regulated like a hotel because if you have short-term rentals that you don't reside in, that is effectively what you are. Not being regulated the same as a hotel at that point only gives you an unfair loophole advantage to other short-term rentals.
