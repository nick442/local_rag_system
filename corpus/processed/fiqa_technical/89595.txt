I have mixed feelings on the way Yelp filters reviews. They need to be fairly aggressive on the way they filter them as it's extremely easy to manipulate, however In the process many good reviews get canned. I wrote a beast of a review for my first review and it was promptly filtered . I was ticked. After one or two more it became unfiltered.
