"Ah the old ""I'm not racist, I have black friends"" defense. Cool. I have heard of guilt by association but it is not at all relevant. A higher percentage of of whites owned slaves than the percentage of Muslims who are radicalized. You're saying that you're guilty of that ""by association""? What a stupid thing to say."
