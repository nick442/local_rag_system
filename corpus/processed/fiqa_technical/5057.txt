Apologies, I agree with Iamchrisbrown209, girlfriend-beating fuckmunch that he may be. Walmart does not tolerate strikes because the majority of Walmart's employees simply don't have enough experience to strike- were I a dock loader, if half my stevedores striked tomorrow I'd simply fire them and hire a bunch of other guys who could lift heavy things in exchange for x amount of money tomorrow. Because in the global (and most local) labour markets at this time and in this global economy, I could. I simply could do that. It's sad, and, I agree, wrong. The reason that the minimum wage exists is because of protectorate and nationalist business practices, nothing more. It may be a *good* thing, and a *right* thing, and I agree that it is, but it isn't because of compassion. It's because at the time that the concept of minimum wage was negotiated and discussed, there wasn't really such a thing as outsourcing. Companies could not outsource their labour to other markets, because for a large time there was no other market to outsource to. The concept of shipping jobs to China, or India, or Brazil, or, in fact, anywhere else, simply didn't exist. The ultimate message is that people don't *deserve* anything; they get what they fight for in reasonable circumstances and what they successfully lobby their government on. Namely, that tends to be popular, fiscally sensible (although not so much in the United States, in some cases) and viable political policies. Nothing more. It's very sad. It's not right. But it is reality, unfortunately.
