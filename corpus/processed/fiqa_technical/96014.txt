No, I'm saying that many potential customers believe BBB to be important. You aren't going to preemptively change the minds of every potential future customer. So you can look better in their eyes with BBB accreditation, or you can possibly lose the customer before you even start. I'm not commenting on BBB at all, just their perception.
