Free market wages on top of living wage? UBI doesn't dictate that all forms of payment be stopped, just that the govt provides costs of living in the form of either a weekly check, or as your tax refund with a basic of CoL deducted on top of your work related purchases. The free market can expand all it wants on top of that, it's just that now everyone has a fallback when the free market contracts as it inevitably will because infinite growth only works if you have infinite resources to fuel infinite growth.
