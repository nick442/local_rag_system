"I remember when they started the policy of ""will not accept ANY lifetime warranty claims for rust"". A reasonable enough claim, because there's no such thing as 100% stainless. However, they started this stupid game where *any* tool with *any* amount of rust on it was automatically a ""rust claim"". For example, if a socket for a ratchet was stripped, worn, or chipped to the point of being unusable, and also had a small rust spot, they wouldn't replace it. Spend a dollar and piss off your customers to save a nickel.. go figure."
