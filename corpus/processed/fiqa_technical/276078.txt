"While I'm sure Reddit will declare Tesla awesome for doing this (because you know ""Tesla!!""), it's actually pretty fucked up that all they have to do is hit a button and everyone gets 30-40 miles more range from the same hardware. They used the same batteries cross many cars but artificially limited the range on some to grab another $9k on the sale. Yeah I know bunches of other corporations do it, but Reddit is usually pretty pissed about that type of business model and for good reason. We should pissed at Tesla here too. Wtf."
