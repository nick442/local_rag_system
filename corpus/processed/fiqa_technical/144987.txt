"to answer the question in the title of your post.. + convince your fellow Euro nations to accept austerity, + convince them to elect responsible governments, + demand transparency from your leaders, and.. + make sure this never ever happens again. Alternatively, build a time machine and go back in time to either.. + immigrate to another part of the world, + sabotage the corruption of the PIGS nations, + prevent the formation of a shared currency, or finally, + do something to ensure Germany didn't lose WWII, as letting them be in charge of everybody's money would appear to be a sound financial decision. That is how you negate the impact of the Euro collapsing. Now, on to the details of your question.. I believe your initial assessment is correct. If one accountable nation were responsible for the solvency of its currency, it could be trusted indefinitely. As is the case with the Euro, as no one country is directly responsible for it, the less responsible governments are in a race to exploit it as much as possible. Remember, ""Spain no es Zimbabwe!"" I think Euro zone nations will be lucky if all that comes of this is the fall of the Euro. Wars between nations have been fought over less significant developments than what Greece, Italy and Spain have done to the financial stability of their Euro zone counterparts. Foreign gold trusts, possession of physical precious metals and precious metal ETFs (GLD is one stock ticker of such a fund, although I would look to a similar fund issued by a company with better physical gold audits) can hedge your currency risk. Check with local laws regarding physical possession of gold. In the USA when we left the gold standard for our currency, the government confiscated all privately owned precious metals and raided customer bank security boxes. Assess your own risk of that sort of thing happening."
