Level 2, Phoenix Arizona So glad that it's over.. I spent Sunday **sitting around.** I made a pizza, sat on my couch, and watched TV shows. I can't even describe how long it's been since I did this. I moved into a new place in March and realized that I hadn't ever laid down on my couch out of laziness to walk to my bedroom.. well, don't be alarmed, but I actually did. It was amazing. That said, I have no idea if I'll pass or not, and so I may have to redo it, but I have 2 months before they'll even tell me how I did, and I'm very thankful for that at the moment :D
