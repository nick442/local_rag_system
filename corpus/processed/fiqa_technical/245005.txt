I generally agree with the other answers. Regarding the bit about your loan from your parents.. Your arrangement with your parents is certainly material to you getting another loan. The mortgage application will probably require you to disclose all outstanding debt. Obviously, if you choose to omit it and your parents don't tell, it probably won't come up. But that would be unethical (definitely) and illegal (probably). Whether this will interfere with you getting a loan is another question, but since it's your only debt it will probably be OK.
