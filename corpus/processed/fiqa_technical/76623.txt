No doubt. But someone who is motivated by greed or money may use that motivation to do great good, at great profit. If someone could become the first trillionaire by turning China and India – and the US – away from fossil fuels, and that's the way they're motivated, and without that motivation they wouldn't bother, I'd be asking how I could help them make the Big T.
