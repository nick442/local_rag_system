Sure did. For starters, it's important to note that many things that people label as public goods are not public goods. Roads and security services are not. Now if you're talking about the air that we breathe and bodies of water, then that is an issue for the legal system. A man could own a section of a river that runs through his property and - assuming that it was a clean river when he took ownership of it - he would have homesteaded the right to have that river be clean. He can only pollute it to the extent that it doesn't hurt others downstream, and he has a legal claim against any who would pollute it from upstream. > If private roads are so great, why didn't private institutions come up with the national highway system? If state management of roads is so great, why did they have to steal land from private individuals to create a national highway system? If the benefits were so great, they should have been able to articulate that to the people along said highway and not taken their land by force. To directly answer your question: because the private sector doesn't come up with just anything and everything. It comes up with things that are mutually beneficial. > Will you trust private security to enforce our laws? How will you privatize the justice system? It's not a matter of trust since I advocate a system of polycentric law, but I *would* prefer a market based system of law because it would provide more flexibility for consumer preferences and reduce conflict. There are videos that explain [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8pcb4xyCic) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o). > In your view, what are the benefits of the profit motive behind private prisons? I actually don't think that a private system of law would have a prison system like we have today. I personally see little use for one at all, but [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYJYSm-MfI) is one theory on the market for a market based system of prisons.
