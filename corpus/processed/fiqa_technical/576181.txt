"I'd replace ""ethics"" with ""morality"" in your comment. While in many contexts ethics and morals are synonymous and used interchangeably this is a situation where the distinction is important. Ethical behaviour is adherence to a code of conduct, such as laws and regulations. Morality is about Right vs. Wrong, regardless of what's been codified."
