not sure if you are serious. golf courses require a large number of people working on it. jobs created. property development (including building of the golf course) creates a large number of temporary jobs, and long term jobs (upkeep services), and the opportunity for new local businesses to open. The rich folk moving in will probably want to keep their house clean (housekeep services), their yard kept (landscaping service), their cars maintained (auto shop / services), their dogs/pets cared for (pet care services), their organic food (food markets), etc. In addition, by having the rich folks there, the 'mid to luxury' store front brands might decide to open up locations in the area - a smart developer would build a small open air mall to complement their housing. This creates jobs. It might not seem like much, but when your family is barely making ends meet, a few extra hundred dollars each week can make a huge difference. In addition, the new business generates taxes for the city.
