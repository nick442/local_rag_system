No, the more conservative approach is to use the market value of debt (at least assuming its trading at a discount). A company wouldn't necessarily have to come to an agreement with creditors, they would just default on their obligations. In which case the company may file for bankruptcy protection, which allows for a variety of scenarios to play out (both consensual and not). As for when debt trades at a premium, we're talking about two different factors that effect bond prices. Credit risk and interest rate risk. But yes, a company does have a higher financial obligation if interest rates decline. They're stuck paying 8% in an environment where they could refinance for 6%. If they refinance, then creditors more than likely aren't going to take less than par. If they don't refinance, then they have the opportunity cost of essentially overpaying on their cost of debt.
