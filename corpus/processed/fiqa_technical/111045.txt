I'm not sure what the point here is. On a macro level, we all know globalization is good and that some markets and types of work die out as others take over. One (digital) computer can do more than a whole building of human computers. However, for the individual who has pride in his or her work as e.g a coal miner, and who made a decent living, won't be better off working for Arby's. Nor knowing that Arby's is a bigger employer.
