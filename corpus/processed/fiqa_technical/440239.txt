Not all will be sold though. They projected their corporate leasing / normal leasing to substantially grow since it was just started and some will end up in inventory at year end. Still is pretty impressive that they anticipate that much demand for a luxury car. Their letter to investors is really insightful too.. I highly recommend you take a look at it.
