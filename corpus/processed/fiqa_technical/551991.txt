I agree with this. I'll also add that if we get a Democrat elected things will stay about the same. If we get a Republican things will get much worse. I could be wrong. Depends on how much influence the Tea Party has on Republican Presidential policy. (I'm betting a lot.) But a Republican congress won't obstruct a Republican president, so maybe we'll actually get some economic stimulus.
