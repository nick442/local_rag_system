This is a massive simplification of what they do. Having low latency is a prerequisite, but the very fastest HFT desks (i.e. those with the fastest links) are often not the most profitable. The reason they need lower and lower latency is simply to avoid the *other* HFT desks having an advantage. Same for co-location. HFT existed long before co-location and the drive for ultra low latency, and they were making money. If it were as simple as faster = winner, there would only be **one** HFT desk in the world, with the fastest connection to every exchange, and they would be printing money. It doesn't work that way.
