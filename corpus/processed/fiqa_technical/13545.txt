"Well, stay in ignorance then and ""trust"" the official sources and listen to the ""official story line"" all you want -- just don't call it ""science"" because it's not, it's *politics*. (I mean they would never LIE to you would they? Saddam MUST have had WMD somewhere.. etc.) What you are neglecting is that most of those ""Official PhD sources"" are engaged in ""cover the asses"" of their own industries & professions. And there are plenty MD's and PhD's who have testified to the source problem -- plenty of well-documented KNOWN incidences of resistant strains long before antibiotics were used in animal feed -- the official orgs are just in a combination of poltical denial, CYA, and shift-the-blame mode. Do you seriously think that antibiotic resistant bacteria ([which pre-existed the use of antibiotics in animal feed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance#Causes) -- and especially [MRSA (circa 1961)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus#History)) were somehow *caused* by using antibiotics in animal feed? What did the cows do, jump back a couple of decades with a cows-only time-machine and infect humans? I mean, get real already. The BS about people being infected with MRSA by cows is far beyond being dubious, it is simply historically false and virtually impossible (if anything it has to have been the other way around because MRSA was found in humans {hospitals} first.. the same with VRSA and VRE -- they were all *iatrogenic* -- DOCTOR-bred)."
