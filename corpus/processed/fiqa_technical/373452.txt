The most important number on your credit card statement is not your available credit. The number you should be focusing on is your account balance. Before the refund, you had a balance of $0. That means that you did not owe the bank anything. You then got a $400 refund. This put your account balance at +$400 (sometimes shown on your statement as $400 CR). This means that you have a credit of $400, or the bank owes you $400. If you now spend $400 at a store, your balance will go back to $0.
