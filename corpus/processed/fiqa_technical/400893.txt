And the truth of the matter is that the majority of entrepreneurs are rich only because they are lucky. Strangely none of them are prepared to admit this either. See if you throw enough mud at a wall, eventually some of it will stick. And if 20,000 people start a business, then most will fail, but some will succeed, and some will go through the roof. The business acumen of the directors is sometimes capable of making a business MORE successful than it otherwise would be, but mostly, it's down to luck.
