Many would suggest that Trump's strategy for trade is outdated and there are the sensational claims he's an isolationist or nationalist. Whatever you want to call him. I believe he is trying to create jobs and a self relying economy within our own country and simply put he is putting our needs first. Instead of focusing on multilateral trade agreements he uses his bilateral strategy to negotiate. He is after a businessman and not a politician. I think its too early to tell if his trade stance is consistent with economic growth. Whatever we were doing was not working.
