The problem as I see it is that multinationals are able to gain an unfair advantage over local, regional and national businesses simply by setting up subsidiaries in foreign tax havens. This is obviously the fault of the government and not the multinationals themselves, but I really don't think it's right that a Starbucks can use loopholes, that only multinationals have access to, in order to avoid paying taxes, while the small business down the street has to pay taxes on all taxable income.
