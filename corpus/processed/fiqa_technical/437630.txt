The typical process is to look at the savings and see how many months it will take to break even on the closing costs. Since you've stated there are no costs, even 1/8% drop in rates is going to save you money. A savings of over 1.5% even on a sub 100K loan is nothing to ignore. You first year interest savings will exceed $1200. How many hours does it take you to earn that much money? (this is a rhetorical question, if that wasn't obvious)
