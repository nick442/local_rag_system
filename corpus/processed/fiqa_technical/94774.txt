Oh Canada, another reason why you're so wonderful. I used to live in Seattle and I loved visiting Vancouver BC. In Seattle, I was paying $20 a month for each of my 4 HD DVR boxes. That's $80 bucks a month. Then I went HTPC with Windows media center. Now I pay $1.75 for a cable card and i can record 4 channels at once.
