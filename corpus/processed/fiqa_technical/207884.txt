I think the points that Edward Conard was making was that the higher the rate investors are taxed, the fewer investors are willing to take the risk. I think the point he should have brought up is that investors and innovators are completely separate. look at facebook, zuckerberg would probably innovate for the sake of innovating, but the people that put money with him would be more wary of the cost/benefit portion. while 2% may not be a big deal to zuckerberg, it might be to his investors.
