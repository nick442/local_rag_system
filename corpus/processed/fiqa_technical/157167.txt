"> Just as we are seeing the repercussion's of Obamas 8 years now. What repercussions? Economy is doing pretty damn good. > Some of it I agree with but I don't think Trump will make the ""american century"" obsolete. I am pretty sure if we bad mouth our friends, piss off our Allies and emboldened our adversaries, the America Century will come to an end real quick. Plus, if Trump pushes isolationism, doesn't that mean he is trying to end the American Century? What is the point of an American Century if we don't come to the defense of our Allies and protect the world order? > That is a vast overstatement with very little evidence to back it up. Ask any economist what they say about getting ride of trade or going back to the days of protectionism. You won't find any economists that say stifling trade is good for the economy."
