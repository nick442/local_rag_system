Actually, I was listening pretty closely and heard very, very few people speaking about the budget. They were typically ridiculed (often, by republican cheerleaders). You make a good point about shills. Unfortunately, the vast majority of so-called deficit hawks are the shills you are talking about. Also, lets not redirect the focus. The article is about the budget. Not Obama, war protesters, or anything else.
