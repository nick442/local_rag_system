well which is why healthy markets have regulations because it turns out that the free market dream that people only spend in their own self interest belies that fact that our own self interests are often not so damn short term. It isnt a failure of community, it is a failure of government. It is naivety to think even good people would change the world through their shopping habits. Look at all the companies using slave labor and people decry it all the time and still shop there. Look at how damn dirty oil is(not just environmentally). and yet we still put it in our car every day. Because people think short term, they think of themselves and not society, and well all of us have trouble with externalities, costs like war protecting the oil fields isnt paid for at the pump.
