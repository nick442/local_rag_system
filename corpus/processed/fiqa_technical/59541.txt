This is automation, a goal that businesses are going to head for no matter how much people moan about it. As long as we have an economy that demands profits, as soon as it becomes viable to use a machine over a human, **it will happen**. It's not a new trend, either. Machines replace humans all the time. It's been happening since the industrial revolution. This is just the latest iteration in a long-running cycle. The correct response to automation replacing human labor is not to fight automation (though it happens every time, and always loses in the end), but rather to embrace the new technology, and ensure the displaced workers have other jobs, or, failing that, the ability to retrain or train for higher-paying jobs. This is an argument for a better, more comprehensive welfare system, more funding for public education, maybe even something as horrific as a basic income system that ensures not only are our most vulnerable able to survive, but those that want are given the opportunity to thrive instead of forcing them to work a low-wage job for eternity.
