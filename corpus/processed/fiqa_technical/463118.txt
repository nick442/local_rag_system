The boomers weren't buying many houses in the 70s, because they weren't old enough. I'm a boomer, I know. When 1970 rolled in, I was still in 8th grade. There are varying definitions but I think those born 1946 thru 1964 are generally considered boomers. Use 1955 as the mid-point. That big housing peak in the early 70s is the Greatest Generation moving out to the suburbs. They are maybe 50 years old, got lots of equity in their house in the city, they are near their peak in earning power. A major factor in the 70s was the inflation rate. With inflation running 9%, it made sense to get a big mortgage. Inflation would eat away almost 10% of the loan (adjusted to constant dollars) every year and a mortgage payment that was barely affordable would be a breeze in just a few years when you were getting paid 10% more (nonadjusted dollars) every year.
