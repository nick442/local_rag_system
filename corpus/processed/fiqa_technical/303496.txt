"People joke about how ""Denver / Colorado is full"" in some sort of tongue-in-cheek way of saying no one should move here anymore. The unfortunate reality is that it's not a joke anymore. We're talking townhouses in Littleton, a not-that-amazing suburb of Denver, still 25 minutes from downtown .. being listed for $900k. Other examples? Broken down houses in extremely ghetto neighborhoods being listed for $400k. We're talking cars up on cinder blocks in the street. Gang bangers rolling down the street with bass shaking all the houses, down to their falling-apart rented place 5 doors down the street. Denver has gotten WAY over hyped. It's not some major coastal hub, an international destination, with a huge vibrant international community flowing through it. Like NYC or SF. It's a generic middle-of-the-country city with a few breweries. Denver is ripe for a major pull back. The prices are not sustainable. And because it has boomed so hard in the last 5 years while the rest of the middle of the country stayed more moderate .. the pull back in Denver is gonna be harsh."
