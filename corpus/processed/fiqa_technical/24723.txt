"Well it depends. I doubt the professor is looking for the ""basic"" answer as you described it. He's mostly likely looking for the above answers (i.e. the Rf is used to value a call in the B-S model). Like in all classes, you need to know what the prof is really looking for, because many questions can be interpreted many different ways and unfortunately most teachers aren't clear in asking what they want."
