1) I don't give a goddam about what Romney said. That's not what *I'm* talking about, and I have no interest in defending or attacking it. You brought up Romney, no one else is talking about him. 2) The state is just as able to make or take *your* personhood as it is a corporations. That blade cuts every direction, remember. Of course corporations are only imbued with personhood (which they aren't, really, it's not like they can vote) because the state says they are. No one said otherwise. 3) >my personal expenses such as food, car maintenance, rent, etc were not tax deductible They most certainly would be if you had your business in your home, discussed business at every meal, and used your car for work. Turns out, a corporation uses the things it owns for business, and thus gets to deduct them as business expenses. It's also possible for businesses to have expenses that are not deductible. Entertainment expenses, for example, are not deductible.
