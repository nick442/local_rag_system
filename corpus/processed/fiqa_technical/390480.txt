So, if it was a personal account, and not an investment in Refco, you should have been insured by the SIPC for $500,000 for your securities, and $100,000 or more for cash. If you had all your money invested in Refco, you weren't diversified, which is one of the first rules of investment. It's not fun to learn this the hard way, I know from experience, but you should never invest more in any one stock than you can afford to lose. Learn from your mistakes rather than blame the big guys vs little guys.
