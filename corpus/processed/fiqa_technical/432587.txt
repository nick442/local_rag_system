"My god, my old boss: * This was a round-the-clock job, but he HAD to know everything. Had to call him every day at 9pm, just to let him know how everything was going. * He would check EVERYTHING. From HOME. Cameras all over the shop. I'd get a call at like 8pm ""hey, how come you left that extension cord plugged in?"". I got scolded one time because a guy on my crew hopped in a forklift and drove it around without putting on his seat belt. While I was inside a control room 50 feet away, out of sight. All from home. * When he WAS there? God help you. To think I would trade THAT for a buck or two an hour? Any day."
