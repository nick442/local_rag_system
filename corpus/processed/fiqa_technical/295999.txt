"And you were criticizing me for making blanket, general statements.. Did you want to talk about something specific, or did you want to keep the discussion to the generalities like arguing about whether taxes are ""noble or ignoble""? If it is the latter, than I get the gist of what you are saying, but disagree with you. And I say this from a position of paying a lot more in taxes than I am betting you do, so it is not from a position of rhetoric but actuality."
