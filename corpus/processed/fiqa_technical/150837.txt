It's a serious problem for traditional cinema: while I personally really enjoyed some recent films less critically-acclaimed like Ghost in the Shell's remake and more widely well-received films like It and Blade Runner 2049, the industry is clearly in a slump numbers-wise. With Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, and of course torrenting - it is harder to get as many people to the cinemas consistently. It's a bit sad - at the surface, it would seem that if a series of really quality, however imperfect fall blockbuster films like It and and 2049 cannot sufficiently act as a defibrillator for the industry, it's not the type/quality of movies that are the only problem. We're still getting plenty of action movies, superhero movies, Disney family movies, war movies, classic remakes, and romcoms..but people are choosing to go less. For the foreseeable future - this is the new normal. Fewer people are guying to movie theatres and the ones that do will go less often. Cinema and Film companies are going to need to work within a model where a film opens to less people and will still be able to make money on the back-end with digital/online release. I think there will always be a niche for people who want to see a movie when it's new on the big screen - so in the long run, I think the more premium cinemas like Alamo Drafthouse with the more premium experience with stylish contemporary theaters with comfortable seats, food, alcohol, etc will still get people in the door. AMC and Regal will need to adapt to this model too and in some major cities, already are trying - AMC might be having slightly more success at this so far, but we'll see. The industry will probably need to begin to operate more like a niche premium product in order to survive.
