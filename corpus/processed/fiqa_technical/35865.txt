Just reading your comment more it is so far off topic. Investor rationality is so far off topic. The outside investor made a decision to invest already. The owner is being forced make investment decisions. Noting in the article is talking about taking those choices away. There should be a separate sub for people like who want to make off topic challenges of capitalism. It's disruptive. I can't make a comment with debating every assumption endlessly.
