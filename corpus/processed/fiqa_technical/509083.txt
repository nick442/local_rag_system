I realize you're probably looking for methods on the large scale. However, I sell a lot of homes to wealth advisers and was always curious about how they consistently pull in business. The obvious answer is networking, then word of mouth. Do right by your clients and they'll brag to their equally high networth friends. One buddy of mine spends a lot of time taking his clients (and their friends) out to dinners, golfing, and mini-vacations. Surprise, surprise, those friends become clients too. Rinse and repeat. Other than that, hang out at high end bars and other places higher networth people in their 30's and 40's would hang out. Then ABC.
