"> ..doesn't strip those people of the ability to walk by without buying. There are plenty of examples where [""framing"" is a crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) despite the victim having the ability to opt-out. > That idea necessarily implies that there are innate human needs that are objectively knowable. That is a textbook [ah hoc relativist fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativist_fallacy) and a big pile of horseshit. You're just being stubborn if you deny that everyone needs food and water and therefore claim improving access to it is not in the common good. Regardless the bar isn't even that high as common good is defined as something that *most* agree is beneficial to all. > ..we have to address the ethical issue of who is responsible for any harm caused to innocent people in the process. You're just spouting a whole bunch of stuff you don't really believe. You have no moral problems with companies pushing people to buy things that make them worse in the long run or removing government regulations that other people thought were needed to protect consumers. You are only intolerant of ""any harm"" for ideas you disagree with."
