For any money you plan on taking back with you to India in a couple of years, you need to consider whether you expect the U.S. dollar to gain strength compared to the Indian rupee, and if so, by enough to make up the difference in interest rates. According to exchange-rates.org, $1 USD would buy you 44.22576 INR on April 29, 2011, and 49.41525 on October 25, 2011. If the Indian rupee keeps on losing strength against the U.S. dollar at that rate, you are far, far better to keep your money in U.S. currency. On the other hand, if the Indian rupee gains strength, you'd be better to convert your money as soon as possible. There are, of course, other options if you plan to keep your money in the U.S., many of which will pay more than 0.01% interest.
