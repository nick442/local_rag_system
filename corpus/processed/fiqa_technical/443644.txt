Prime sucks because it's all weird storage issues pulling it down. Amazon Fresh, though, seems okay. That's the one where they go into Sprouts or other stores and do the shopping for you, so selection is better. Fresh, I believe, is what will be incorporating whole foods as an option. What interests me the most is price differences between using the Fresh serviceable just going to the store. If it's like $5-10 more for online shopping with exactly the same goods, I might consider it. After all, I save gas and time. But more than that for a small trip? Doubtful.
