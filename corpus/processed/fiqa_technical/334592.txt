Buy an accounting for MBA's book and go through that. It's the absolute base of finance. I can't see how you can even wrap your head around most of the articles in FT or in the Economist if you don't know what a balance sheet, income statement, cashflow statement or statement of shareholders equity is. This is absolutely a requirement for any understanding of the finance sector, or you'll become just another schmoe on CNBC.
