McDonald's doesn't do it because no one would shop there if they treated their successful customers as piggy banks. Their model would fail without a captive audience instead of voluntary customers. The only reason why the state can get away with it is because they somehow convinced people that they know better and should be allowed to force others to bend to their will. McDonald's doesn't need to force customers to shop there because they offer products people are willing to pay for without threats and intimidation. No need for doctrine.
