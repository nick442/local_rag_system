Lol to be fair, our monetary system is nutty. Money is created out of thin air because (mainly) 3 institutions trade debt around. I get the basics but also have no clue what some concepts actually mean. Like the national debt; its growing, does that even matter? Its not like anyone is going to call that debt in and collapse the whole global system. Or the big one; so the government doubles the money supply in 2008 but we didn't have run away inflation.. that does not make any sense. Its all imaginary. The only sense there is to make, is that some rich sociopath/s are now richer.
