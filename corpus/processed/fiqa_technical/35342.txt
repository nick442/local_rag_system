Yeah. I'm in my junior year as a political science major but it's not holding my interest and to be honest, I hate it. I've always loved watching stocks and businesses and kept a close eye on financial news. I was just too blind to see that I could get an actual job doing that kind of stuff. I don't care how long it take to get there, as long as I get there. So maybe finance and stats? I was told that there isn't a real specific degree needed to be a prop trader, but some degrees help more than others.
