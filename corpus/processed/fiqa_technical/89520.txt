Tiffany's doesn't signal 'wealth', but poor taste. That's one of their problems: mediocre mass market brand screaming they are super-premium. Have been to their flagship store in NY - as I said: totally mass market jewelry, unjustly expensively priced, huge success with Japanese tourists (no offence to Japanese tourists intended).
