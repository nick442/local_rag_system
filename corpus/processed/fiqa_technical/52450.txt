"Finance/Econ major checking in. I'm not an expert, but I just finished up a finance/marketing internship and I'll be headed into my junior year. In all honesty, I'm not sure you really need to worry about an internship after your freshman year. For the most part, it's the summer's after your first summer that it really becomes the standard thing to get an internship. I almost guarantee you I stressed to the max about the same things you're (probably) stressing about: Am I going to have enough experience? Is my GPA high enough? Am I wasting time not interning during the semesters? Am I a failure because I didn't get this scholarship/internship/program, etc. In the end, and I'm far from the end, I don't think it's going to matter that I didn't get an internship after my freshman year. I have a 4.0, but I'm almost certain I'd be in the same position if I had a 3.5. I really worried about not getting a ""prestigious"" internship, but I think it's more about meaningful experience that you can use to say ""look! I did this!"" even if it's not with a Top-10 blah blah blah. You'll get there. If you're worrying about it now before you've even started classes, you'll finish up with plenty of experience in one way or another. Don't worry about it too much, get used to classes, make new friends, and have the time of your life. Edit: My junior year, not sophomore year.. it's been a long summer."
