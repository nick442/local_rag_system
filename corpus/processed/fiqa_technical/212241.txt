There have been a lot of startups that tried to tackle this same space [Flytenow](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/20/uber-for-x-in-a-tiny-plane/), and [Blackjet](http://allthingsd.com/20121026/people-behind-uber-want-to-do-the-same-thing-for-private-planes-with-blackjet/) for example. The problem is that there is a prohibitively high cost per use and the private jet world lacks the same latent supply issue that Uber exploited in the town car industry (lots of town cars were sitting around during the day because they only had to do one or two drop offs). Wouldn't be betting on this one suddenly breaking the trend. Edit: Didn't notice that the article already mentioned competitors (including Blackjet) but I am not seeing this company's competitive advantage (aside from not doing the membership-sign up scheme). Additionally, I am not entirely convinced that people booking PRIVATE charter flights want to sell their unused seats. Isn't the whole point of a private flight that you don't have strangers on it?
