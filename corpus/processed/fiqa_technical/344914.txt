Problems do not arise from small individual acts of kindness. Problems arise when you attempt to construct a government and a society around false economic morality. People very successfully navigate their own internal altruism and greed because they are allowed by society to make the calculation for how much they can give on their own. Once you start mandating altruism, all bets are off. You mean they aren't paid to build monuments or do science? You mean scientists don't earn patents for their work? You mean science in general has no selfish commercial motive? What a load of crap, dude. There are plenty of self motivated individualistic rationalizations for someone to work in cooperation with others. Namely, pay.
