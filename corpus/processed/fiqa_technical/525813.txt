I have no way of knowing whether you are talking out of your ass or speaking the truth. And if all you can say is 'go read some books' I remain without a way of confirming any of this.

I don't even know what principles you're referring to, so i'm not in a position to argue against them. Nor am I in a position to accept them because you said so.
