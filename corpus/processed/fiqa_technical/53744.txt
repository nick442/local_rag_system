"Its worse than ""won't create jobs"". It will destroy jobs. The main reasoning is partly in the article: ""tax rates don't matter if an investment is a good idea"" Job destruction occurs because there is less of a tax deduction for spending: http://www.naturalfinance.net/2012/04/economic-justification-for-taxes-and.html Executive assistants, newer computers, phones and company cars, conferences in Hawaii are all non-essential spending that when there is less of a tax deduction for that spending, get cut. Normally investments are risky. Paying for a google ad if it fails, at least gives a tax deduction. Lower tax rates, means failures cause all of that investment to be lost."
