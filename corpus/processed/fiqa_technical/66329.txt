You're not being over taxed, the withholding is just aggressive. Employer's don't know your whole tax situation, all they can go on is the amount they pay you minus deductions then extrapolate that to an annual number and withhold according to your W4. You could ratchet up your W4 exemptions and this will help your current withholding. When you do your taxes next April this will all shake out and you will likely receive a large refund. It's also worth noting that your federal withholding, given the numbers above, is just about 19% not 27%; which does match the federal tax table if your annual income was $72,000 as your semi-monthly paycheck indicates. That should be closer to 14% at an annual income of $36,000. The medicare related taxes are flat amounts. So really you're talking about an approximately 5% discrepancy on the $18,000 you'll earn during this internship; or about $900. If you feel like you're being overtaxed, welcome to paying taxes.
