Saving Fortune 500 companies hundreds of millions to billions a year and a small company a few thousand. Who's paying for the shortfall to the IRS? The reality is a small business probably make $0 profit because the owner pays himself out, or has enough employees that the (company) makes a profit saving a few grand doesn't do anything. You know what would help? The 1 trillion profit the Fortune 500 make a year, take half. Give energy companies 0% interest loans to pay off their nuclear plants and reduce energy costs for 320 million Americans by a large amount. Take the remainder and the following 3 years and refinance mortgages at 0% interest starting from the smallest to largest loans. 4 years high taxes on large corporations I just bailed out the middle class and helped the poor with 100% retuned to the IRS.
