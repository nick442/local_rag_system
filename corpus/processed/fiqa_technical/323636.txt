Look, if you think you're differentiating yourself by filling out an application online.. like every other person out there, you're kidding yourself. I have some sympathy for your position, but you need to show some initiative. Pick up the phone and call these people. Go meet with anyone that will let you come see them and ask for a mock interview. Or, ask them if there's anyone in their organization that you can talk to that needs help at the entry-level level. It's time to get creative. It's not time to cross your fingers and hope something happens, you have to make your own luck. Finally, you're going to need to broaden your search. I got it - you want defense finance.. welp.. try something else. There are TONS of entry level finance jobs all over the country. Go work for a restaurant, a clothing store, a grocery store, a bank.. ANYTHING to get 1-2 years of experience.. and keep cold calling. Talk to people - build a network. Get good at your job and then move - ask for more money somewhere once you qualify. If you want someone to review your resume, PM me, I'm glad to look it over. Oh, and you should be sending a custom cover letter for every position. Hope this helps.. be creative. Successful people are successful because they are willing to do the things unsuccessful people aren't!
