I worked at a burrito bar that used the same serving method. They'd been in business for over 15-20 years with 5 locations without any official food poisoning complaints. And we reheated the leftover meats from the day before to serve in the morning (we did so according to standard, but still, higher risk of bacteria problems). Keep in mind, this is only anecdotal.
