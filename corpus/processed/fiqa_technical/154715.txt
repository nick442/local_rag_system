Because the normal and **perfectly effective** regulatory controls in place for the past 130 years, that allowed the states to monitor and intervene in any predatory lending, was dismantled by Bush in 2003, when he blocked all 50 state attorney generals from routinely investigating what they noticed was a sudden growth in questionable banking practices. Not only that, when [ALL 50 state attorney generals protested](http://www.atg.wa.gov/BlogPost.aspx?id=28620), Bush used the OCC to threaten to sue any state AGs who persisted. i.e., in 2003 Bush forcefully undid the longstanding Consumer Protection laws and castrated the state AGs, right as the state AGs were proceeding to stop the uptick in illicit bank practices, leading to the mortgage crisis a few years later. It wasn't until the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that Congress **restored** what Bush dismantled in 2003. (for your historical reference: OCC = office of comptroller of currency. The OCC and the states have long had a fair and balanced dual system, set by the vast majority of past Supreme Court rulings and the National Bank Act. Bush abolished that precedent and used the OCC to give banks the power for the first time to fight off the state regulators.)
