Algorithmic trading at www.quantopian.com or www.quantconnect.com great for getting exposure and building a portfolio of work. I started at 19 and got very into it (75+ hours a week).. not the best for my grades but good for my wallet. LOL. I prefer quantopian but quantopian is python based (and has more features, nicer API, pyfolio notebooks). quantopian also has a way for you to make money (contests) and is free. quant connect has python,C++ no research notebooks, costs money to live trade. For the lols, here's a post of mine about using Twitter posts, ML models, and Tech stocks to yield high returns: [DANK LINK](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/psychsignal-machine-learning-models-and-tech-stocks)
