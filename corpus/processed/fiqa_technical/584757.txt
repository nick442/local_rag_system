"What you're missing in the Planet Fitness model is that they *need* more people to be signed up than actually visiting the gym. Also, some of the items you grouped as ""fixed costs"" are actually variable - labor, equipment purchases. PF depends on having more members than they have capacity. Only about 60% of members actually take advantage of their gym membership. Push that number to 90% and demand would far exceed capacity. People would be pissed and cancel their membership until demand dropped to a point where PF has the capacity. If this were to occur, PF would go out of business. Labor costs would increase, cleaning costs would increase, wear and tear and maintenance would increase. PF depends on the 30-35% of people who don't use their membership to make their margin."
