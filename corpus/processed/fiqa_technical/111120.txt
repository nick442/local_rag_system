"A few years ago, I stumbled across a little-known band and thought about buying tickets to their upcoming show. The tickets were an absolute steal, maybe $20 each because no one had heard of them but I didn't bother at the time. Figured I'd wait until closer to the tour date. Fast forward to about a month before the show. They had released a very popular single that summer and tickets were being sold online for well over $100. I remember thinking ""if only I knew these guys were going to be a big name one day"". I suppose I could have made a killing buy purchasing tons of tickets and selling them just before the event at a mad profit. That's about the only scenario I can think of."
