Yep. Plenty of things could be done (procurement / FAR reform and streamlining, increase small business set-asides, greater transparency in forecasts, fully fund tech modernization efforts, empower the 18F/USDS people) but I doubt they were discussed. This wasn't really about improving government IT.
