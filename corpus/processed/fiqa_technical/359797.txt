How can it be that risky to buy a house right now? They're dirt cheap! Bad comparisons aside, I think you'll find that most jobs which require degrees are a lot more pleasant, comfortable and enjoyable, particularly in terms of intellectual stimulation, than those accepting high school diplomas or below. It's not just about how much more money you make. It's also about how you spend your time during those 40 years of work.
