Thanks!! That's so kind of you. Luckily my boyfriend and I are quitting together, so we're able to support each other. This weekend will be hard because we're going to a wedding with friends who smoke. But we've already talked about strategies and code words to get us out of situations that might pressure us and that kind of thing.
