I think your math is off but I don't have time to work it out. It seems like the top 4 could conceivably have less than 2.2 million jobs between them. Your math appears to leave nothing for the other 46 states which is not the intent of that statement. The other 46 just added less than 113,500 each but the majority of that 2.2 million could still be distributed among them.
