This is just a guess but I would imagine that it has to do with risk. The deposits in Banks are usually as safe as government bonds (broad oversimplification) as: The US government is considered the most trustworthy - even in unlikely event of being close to default it would be rescued by FED (so it can just print the money). So the banks at the same time have very low competition regarding government bonds and the investments they can do have relatively low ROI so they cannot offer much more competitive rates. On the other hand Ukrainian bonds have current rating Caa3/CCC-/CCC - i.e. the Goverment is judged to be likely to default (as you pointed out there is war going on) and in result the government bonds are considered highly speculative. Therefore to attract foreign investors they need to have high interest rating. Similarly the CDs at the banks can be considered at the risk of being lost so to prevent flight of capital overseas (or people keeping USD in cash form at home) they need to offer rates that reflect the risk.
