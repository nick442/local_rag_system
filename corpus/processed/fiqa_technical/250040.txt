Trying desperately to normalize the Rating agencies before the Fed unwind so they can stamp everything AAA and pretend that all is great. They world has not forgotten the magnitude of the Fraud these rating agencies commited and are now preparing to commit and the collusion with the regulators and banks and insurance agencies. Who are you going to sell that shit to, entire countries went bankrupt because they bought the shit you rated AAA. Remember Northern rock . .that was the Tip of the Ice berg And now, 1 month before the Fed gets ready to sell the same shit, the rating agencies conveniently reappear pretending to be able to rate sovereign countries. This is going to be a whole lot of fun
