"Every time people have a little fun with the lotto this comment gets made. Yes, we all understand that your odds of winning are so low that you're basically throwing your money away. For two Powerball numbers, you know what else I could spend my $6 on? One beer at a bar. With that beer, I would get approximately 20 minutes worth of entertainment. Instead, I buy two lotto tickets and have a few days worth of entertainment, fantasizing with family and friends about what we would do if we hit it big. People pool their money with co-workers and bond over the shared fantasy and the ""oh well, I guess we're going back to work tomorrow"" after the drawing. We can all do simple math, but statistics do not usually govern how most of us spend our entertainment budget."
