I'm glad to hear that someone so senior in their organization has so much respect for the rest of the team. As a student, you often hear how finance is ultra competitive/aggressive. As someone that is very competitive and is also empathetic and mindful of how their words affect others, it's nice to see that preconception proven wrong. Just had to share my thoughts. Best of luck!
