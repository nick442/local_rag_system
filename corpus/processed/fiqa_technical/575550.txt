FACE dropped its 10Q on 3/31/12 They reduced their total liabilities by 16%, reduced their accounts payable by 30%, looks like they eliminated their ST Debt, and increased their equity by 6%. I'm not saying that they had a great quarter, but the numbers don't look to shabby. I don;t think you can accurately attribute the increase in their stock valuation to FB's IPO.
