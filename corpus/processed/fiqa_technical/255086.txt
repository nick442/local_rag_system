Excellent summary. I'm going to steal the analogy as it is related to how I discuss the problems of austerity to people convinced it is fiscally conservative and the right thing to do when in a poor income generating situation. (I usually explain the difference as going into debt to fund better education or skills in well-researched high-demand areas, and thereby improve your earning potential, versus cutting spending until you are living in a box eating cat food thereby making it harder to get back on your feet.)
