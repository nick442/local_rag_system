"It's not my industry so I may be wrong, but I don't believe there are any transactions or companies that would provide a worthwhile comparable, hence my problem with the valuation attempt. For the same reasons you wouldn't use a P/E multiple or DDM model on a startup, you don't just pick tangential comparables and slap a value on it. If you're seriously advising companies, that shit will land you in court defending your valuation. It's not a ""floor"" just because you know it's inaccurate. it's irrelevant. Quite frankly, I don't think they released any value, let alone $1bn. It's merely a PR move, with the hope that Tesla's technology will become the standard for all EVs. At best, major companies decide to use some of their patents ""in good faith"" and leverage the infrastructure that Tesla has already put in place. At worst, Tesla still did not give away $1bn in value. How much have they made off of licensing their patents? How much have others offered for their patents? How many companies are infringing, and how many lawsuits have they won from going after them? If you can't put a hard figure on any of those, or a solid rationale on how the patents are the only reason they'll be able to gain market share, then I don't see how we can conclude on $1bn given away."
