I don't really have anything to add, but I've been looking for a study subreddit for International Business, where people can share resources. There doesn't seem to be one however, I wonder if that would be something worth starting. /r/InternationalBusiness is currently banned, so we could claim that from the admins if they'd let us, and start a study sub.
