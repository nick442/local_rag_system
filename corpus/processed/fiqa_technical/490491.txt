You can't really blame company for trying to maximize profits. We are, after all, a capitalist society, and Burger King is just exercising the spirit of capitalism - profit maximization. If you want to blame someone, blame the government for its tax codes which allowed this to happen. It would be interesting, doubt it will happen, if the profit lost due to this boycott actually exceeds the profit gain through tax dodge.
