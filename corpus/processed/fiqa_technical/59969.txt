The primary difference between Japan and most other developed nations is who owns their debt. Japan's debt is almost entirely internal. That is it's actually borrowed from within Japan. It's not owned by China or anyone else. Additionally, Japan owns a fairly substantial proportion of the USA's debt which provides additional security. It's a favorite complaint of Romney and his friends that American is borrowing from China to finance public spending. A lot of people don't realize, that in fact Japan was until very recently, America's biggest source of borrowing. And is still number 2 by a substantial margin. Combine this with pretty careful regulation by the Bank of Japan, low bond yields, and a much larger economy, still with a decent manufacturing base, and Japan's situation isn't remotely like Greece despite it appearing worse. In a nutshell, the Japan is the educated university graduate with a reasonable income, who like many of us who buy a house that costs many multiples of our annual salary, and can afford to service the debt even if it needs to be carefully managed. Greece is the homeless, one-armed drug addict with no prospects that struggles to find a few bucks to spend a night in a hostel. The size of the debt is more or less irrelevant. It's the ability to pay it that really matters. Of course this doesn't mean that if circumstances change, things couldn't go south badly, but right now Japan isn't in trouble and the 230% vs 130% misrepresents the reality of the situation.
