"Its really, really good of you to admit your short comings with a desire to improve them. It takes courage. Keep in mind that most of us that answer questions here are really ""good at money"" so we have a hard time relating. Would you want people that are bad with money answering questions on a personal finance site? While it is intimidating you will need a budget. A budget is simply a plan for how to spend your money. Your budget, based on your new pay frequency, will likely also need some cash flow planning as a single paycheck is unlikely to cover your largest expenses. For example your rent/mortgage might be less than a single paycheck so you will have to save money from the previous paycheck to have enough money to pay it. Your best bet is to have a friend or relative that is good with money help you setup a budget. Do you have one? If not you might inquire about a church or organization that offers Financial Peace University. The teachers of the class often help people setup a budget and might be willing to do so for you. You could also take the class which will improve your money management skills. For $100 you'll have a lifetime pass to the class. If it helps you avoid three late charges/bounce checks then the class is well worth it. Now as far as spending too much money. I would recommend cash, but you have to do it the right way. Here is the process that you have to follow to be successful with cash: Doing cash will give you a more concrete example of what spending means. It won't work if you continue to hit the ATM ""for just $20 more"". It will take you a bit to get used to it, but you will be surprised how quickly you improve at managing money."
