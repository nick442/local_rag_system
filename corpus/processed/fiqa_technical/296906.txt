I'm going to take a different path than the other answers: Given how low interest rates are (depending on your credit), buying a house may be a great strategy. However, I would not put more than 20% down. Putting more than 20% down unnecessarily ties up cash that could be used more productively elsewhere. You need to figure out your cash flow situation both for the near term, and for the long term. For the short term, you probably won't need to help your kids with tuition. They will likely be able to get a combination of grants, scholarships, and loans that will cover the cost. However, the loans are generally not low interest, and that is a huge amount of debt for someone so young. If you want to help pay your kids tuition, you should at least guestimate/budget that amount now. For the long term, without any retirement savings, you may be hurting in a couple decades. Since you also don't have a home, your living situation may be a problem. Buying a home today may be the prudent move, because that will hopefully be an appreciating asset, and, with a 30 year mortgage, you'll own it outright by 75, which takes a big strain off of retirement costs. $1400 a month in bills (apart from rent/mortgage) with no kids in the house (is this correct?) sounds high. I would also recommend looking at your basic expenses and seeing what you can do without if you are cash strapped.
