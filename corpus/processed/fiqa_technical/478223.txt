As in make a value contribution, this particular law has never once been applied to information (which has no tangible value). Its only bearing in case law is on monetary contribution. I might also add, there is no evidence that any contribution, either money, information, or otherwise was passed between the provincial Russian DA and the Trump campaign. Bearing that in mind, how exactly do you feel the Russian government influenced the election, and what exactly do you feel was the Trump campaigns role?
