Amazon's DRM aims to lock-in as many customers as possible (except the tech-savvy crowd that knows how to circumvent DRM, as you noted) at the point of sale, and they don't really care if you then read your book on the kindle app or the kindle itself. I think the blog author's point about a risk of monopsony still stands, if Amazon becomes the main point of sale for ebooks. The internet winner-takes-all effect will create a completely different playing field for the publishers when compared to the more fragmented paper bookstore landscape.
