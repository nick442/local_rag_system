"Author seems bitter. A person who frequently talks in cliches while never or rarely offering any substantive is a problem; a person who knows his/her stuff and uses cliches as an efficient way to get their point across is not. Purposely trying to avoid common vernacular will do more to make a person sound like they're trying to compensate for a lack of understanding. The only way this article makes sense is if it's just the author venting, otherwise it serves to get supposed halfwits who talk in cliches to find a new way to ""fake it until they make it""."
