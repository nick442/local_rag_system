Well that is one opinion on the CFA. My opinion is that if you havent read any finance text books for a year, you probably aren't going to be too sharp on various topics during the interviews. The CFA offers a way to keep your knowledge sharp. I also got more interviews in the 3 months since I started studying for the CFA and listing that on resume then in the 6 months before hand, so it certainly helped me atleast get my foot in the door. And I disagree that I am not trying hard enough. I am certainly trying pretty fucking hard. My post here is about trying to find a better more efficient route since merely trying hard is not a sufficient condition for getting a job.
