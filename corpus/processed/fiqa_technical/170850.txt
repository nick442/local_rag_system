A 2011 study by the consulting firm Management Information Services, Inc. (MISI)[28] estimated the total historical federal subsidies for various energy sources over the years 1950â€“2010. The study found that oil, natural gas, and coal received $369 billion, $121 billion, and $104 billion (2010 dollars), respectively, or 70% of total energy subsidies over that period. Oh look the US has always subsidized energy in general to maintain a strong stable energy position and now they want to move from CO2 producing dirty tech to more green renewables. Personally I'm glad my tax money is being used for it. While subsidizing it costs have fallen by leaps and bounds, long term it's a great move. Do you think Europe and china would be building solar and wind if it wasn't ?
