How many from the board will go to jail? If this was a structural engineering firm and every building that they made over the last decade collapsed, or at least a sizable number of them collapsed, they would be facing multiple life terms. But since they are bankers/investment companies, they can not be charged with gross incompetence/negligence for their failures.
