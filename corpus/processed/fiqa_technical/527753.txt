"They licensed it from another business entity which, presumably, owns them. I mean, if Starbucks UK could decide tomorrow, ""hey, Starbucks USA is charging us too much for this damn logo, we're gonna rename ourselves Benedicts"" and they were able to rebrand and put up new logos and signage at all their storesâ€¦ well, then, if that allowed them to *stop* paying this licensing fee then I guess I'd be cool with them *choosing* to continue to pay it. But I suspect that's really not the case, is it? So I appreciate this is a *hugely* complicated business, but I think there should be limitations on intellectual property licensing to wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries. It allows companies to charge what they like and do what they like, with no reference to the market value of that intellectual property. I don't get to vote for Romney, because I'm in the UK."
