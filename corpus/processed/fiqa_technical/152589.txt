"Taxing the money people earn from others without doing work is no more punishment than taxing people who earn money by working. It's not a matter of who's wrong, but what's fair and what makes a healthy prosperous economic system. I don't think this will do that, but crying ""what did the rich ever do to deserve taxes"" is a ridiculous argument."
