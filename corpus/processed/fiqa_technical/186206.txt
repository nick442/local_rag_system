"I usually say ""no thank you"", but if the salesperson gets pushy I say ""if I need insurance, I guess I won't buy the product because I only want to buy quality that will last a good long while"" I have never actually walked away from a purchase because I generally research these things ahead of time, but I think I mean it when I say it."
