"I don't know what their processes are, but I've gotten a tour of an organic dairy farm and they made it clear: they *did* use antibiotics and it was no secret. It's just that any dairy cow with an apparent infection that required antibiotics was sequestered away from the others and was not milked for the main milk tanks until it was fully recovered and the antibiotics were out of its system. If any antibiotic-contaminated milk made it into the main milk tank, the whole batch was dumped. I would assume ""antibiotic-free"" farms would be similar to organic farms - not that they leave diseases untreated, but that they don't do the blanket growth-stimulator usage of antibiotics, only using them in a targeted fashion."
