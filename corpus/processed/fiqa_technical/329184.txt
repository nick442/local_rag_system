Actually, they wouldn't get arrested. They could probably get away with doing it a lot of the time if the job isn't one where the public visits, as inspectors only come around infrequently. As long as they have someone designated to run ahead and unlock the exit before the inspector sees it, they wouldn't even get caught most probably. Even if they did get caught, the company would just get a fine and a re-inspection. They'd probably even notify the company when the next inspection is coming ahead of time so that they'd have an even easier time of hiding it. At least this has been my experience of things like this. Edit to add: I have no experience of unions myself. Some of my relatives have / do work in unionized shops. Overall their experience has been fair to good. An interesting point relating to the union argument: It was pointed out when they had the protests over the teacher unions that teachers in states where there are unions cost the states a good percentage more. As in their pay rate is higher, and their benefits are better. So the argument of the states as a reason for banning collective bargaining for teachers / public employees is that they'll be able to pay them less because they'll have less recourse.
