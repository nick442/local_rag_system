>The EU focus on fiscal deficit is completely mistaken. They are the result of the crisis, not the cause. The fiscal deficit was *increased* by the crisis, but there would not have been a crisis at all if nobody had been running up debts either. It's possible to shift private deficits to public (as happens if people borrow more money than they are taking in, default on loans, cause a bank to run out of money, and the government decides to transfer the bank's losses to its taxpaying public). However, it's still ultimately driven by running a deficit until an unsustainable amount of debt is public, via one mechanism or other.
