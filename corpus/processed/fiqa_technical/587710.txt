"There are exactly zero experts in the field of Personal Finance that would advise having an ""emergency fund"" (liquid assets available to meet sudden obligations like illness, car accident, AC breaks, etc.) that is sub $1,000. If you have less than $1k in liquid assets you either A. must live at home with your parents, B. very broke or C. being very irresponsible. I think an emergency fund of $10k is really the sweet spot. I can't imagine anyone reasonable funding the shit out of their 401k, IRA, etc. and having less than $1k cash."
