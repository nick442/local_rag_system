"Go ahead, switch banks (and checking accounts) as often as you like. It won't affect your credit score since any credit check will be a ""soft pull"" (unless you're establishing a credit card or loan -- or overdraft protection, then it could be a ""hard pull"" that could affect your credit score). Bad karma? Hardly. Unethical? Absolutely not. You don't owe them anything. Practically speaking, it'd be easier just to switch once to a bank that has a fee structure you can live with -- as long as they don't change the rules on you."
