Yes. I'm not a coder by trade, but learned on my own as a hobby and then launched a barebones version in 2015 and then a full-fledged version just a few months ago. I'm a lawyer by training and I had been thinking for 12+ years that there needed to be a more efficient way for professionals to get clients and for clients to know the level of expertise of a professional through the power of the Internet. I had tried to hire outside web developers on my own about 10 years ago, but got burned but learned some valuable life lessons - if you are passionate about something, learn to do it yourself - you almost always will be better off. The result today is Hire.Bid and I'm happy to say we are kicking ass. If Reddit has taught me anything, it is to chase your dreams and make shit happen yourself. You'll regret not doing so. Make it happen. If it is a hobby and something you are passionate about first, you'll have a much better chance of success in the long run. Just my $0.02.
