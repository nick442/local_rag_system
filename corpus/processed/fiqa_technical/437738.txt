Yep, IMO level 1 is vastly underrated. At 8 amps, I can charge at about 3mph. At 12 amps it's about 4.5mph. If I can plug my car at work into a plain old 15 amp outlet for 8 hours, I'll add between 24 and 36 miles of range to my battery. For most people, that's more than their one way drive into work. So if I leave my house with a full charge, I'll leave work with a full charge too. The primary advantage is that it doesn't cost much to install a couple dozen electrical outlets in a parking lot. BYO charge cable. I travel frequently, and I would love to see more outlets in hotel parking lots and parking garages.
