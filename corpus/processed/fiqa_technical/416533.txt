Here. They want the infrastructure to do Jeff Bezos new model of grocety shopping. Which is great, I actually have a desire for some form of grocery delivered. However, when I have a desire for something more farmers market style, I want a Whole Foods style but Id love it at a better price point for everyone. This does mean there is a market opening for more grocers that are basically indoors farmers market.
