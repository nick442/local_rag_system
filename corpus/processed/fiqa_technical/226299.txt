My wife wanted to return all the unused hurricane supplies we bought before it hit here in southeast Florida. We only lost power for 24 hours so we had a lot of stuff unused. I told her I considered that shady and told her not to do it, we would use it over the coming year. When you encourage the abuse of return policies you can't fault stores for tightening up their rules.
