I would disagree. Not all children are set to have good life outcomes. Those raised in poverty often experience a great deal of stress and suffering. Raising children to be productive adults in beneficial to society. Raising a child to continue the cycle of poverty and crime is not. Many times, people voluntarily organize into a family unit whereby the husband earns an income which can be considered in paying the wife to raise the child. Individuals are amazing at coming to voluntary agreements which help society.
