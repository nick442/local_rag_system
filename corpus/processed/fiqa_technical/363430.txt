In my experience earning interest is not enough to keep the account in a non-dormant state. If payment of interest was the trigger to reset the clock then no savings account would ever be considered dormant. In general as the account got close to the deadline we were notified that a single transaction moving money into or out of the account would reset the clock. I have had this happen in recent years with a bank account and a credit union account. In researching for the exact definition of a dormant account I found this regarding interest on the FDIC website: That means that the state law may set the definition, it also means that you should look at the information regarding the bank policy. I did try and see if the rules for a credit union are the same. The added twist with a credit union is that if the account is closed, they are no longer a share holder and that brings into the discussion voting rights. So the policy/guidelines is even more complex. If the account does go inactive state law will define what happens to the account, and how you can get the funds back.
