"Those fall under ""doing some research"" but I get what you're saying. I'm most likely in the minority from what the lines look like when I do happen to visit Walmart. Also, I'm jaded. I've known people who would just return random stuff to Walmart. Hell even stolen shit, since they will take pretty much anything. It's like an unregulated pawn shop. I have just never found myself in the position that I needed to stand in line to return something there, so I guess the service just isn't for me. I shouldn't have commented at all since my opinion is inconsequential."
