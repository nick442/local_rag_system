Split screen to run multiple apps but not all apps work. By far the best feature is the phone won't turn off the screen when your reading long articles or reddit. The hover feature is also sweet. If you want to see more then the first line of an email or text you can hold your finger close to the screen and it will show you a few more sentences. This also works for websites that have mouse over features. That's just a few!
