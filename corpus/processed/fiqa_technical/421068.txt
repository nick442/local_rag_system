Anyone in the financial sector understands how tightly correlated federal policy changes and actions affect us. Trillions of dollars are at risk depending on the ebb and flow of congressional mandate. I don't see a problem with having political fact or founded opinions discussed logically inasmuch as they aren't coupled with the taint of some of the garbage on ZH or other rags. I like the rules as stated, the downvote button serves a purpose and (at least in our little community) serves it well.
