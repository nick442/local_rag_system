I don’t get how companies can keep saying this. Profit is by definition money you didn’t spend on anything (like research). I realize that profit could be used on research in future years, but presumably you will also have excess income in future years to use for that expense. That’s a bum deal though because you will have to pay 35% tax. Making a profit at all means you chose not to invest that money in research but instead to bank the money (pay shareholders).
