"As a lefty, mixed emotions I guess. On the one hand, I think the criminal-justice system is far more harsh on ""minor"" crime, like some poor guy stealing $500, than crime that really impacts a lot of people and involves much larger sums, for a variety of reasons. So it's sort of interesting to see a white-collar criminal actually being taken seriously for once. On the other hand, I'm not a fan of the United States's ridiculous obsession with jailing people for long periods of time. In some other countries, 110-year sentences don't even *exist*. In most of Scandinavia, 15-year sentences are the maximum for any crime, with a very rarely invoked exception that allows the police to petition for someone's release to be delayed if they would pose an imminent threat of violence upon release. So in general I'm against locking lots of people up just as revenge, as opposed to because they would pose a real threat if they were not locked up. I would also prefer to look first for alternative arrangements, such as house arrest and monitoring, and reserve prison only for *really* dangerous people where there is absolutely no possible alternative. I'm not sure Stanford really counts in that category. So it basically boils down to, by the standards of American criminal justice, white-collar crime is greatly under-prosecuted relative to other crime. But the standards of American criminal justice are uncivilized bullshit, and I'm not sure locking up a bunch of white-collar criminals is a good way to make up for the fact that we lock up too many petty criminals, or even people doing things that shouldn't be crimes at all. The other, somewhat different, issue is that I think we need to go after systemic problems more than random individuals. The system of finance is the real problem."
