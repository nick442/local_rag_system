The Central Valley of California is a mountain range away from the ocean, although you can drive over the range in a few hours or so, depending on which part of the Central Valley you live in. Watch the *Sons of Anarchy* TV series to get a general idea of the kind of people who live there who *aren't* religious, then extrapolate from that what the religious folks there would be like. It's a real nutfuck zone.
