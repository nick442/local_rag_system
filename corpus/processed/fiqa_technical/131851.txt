wtf. look at that image. its supposed to show a horrible, disgusting, greedy, rich, 80-year-old unfairly hoarding money. but check it out -- the mattresses are old and cheap, bare like in a flophouse, and the bills are $1 and $5. statistically, i think being scared and hiding your fixed-income under a crappy mattress is a more accurate depiction of old age nowadays, than being a trillionaire and bathing in champagne. i realize this will be an unpopular thought. its very satisfying to have a group to blame for everything. its scary the extent to which we're being led to hate each other in groups =:-(
