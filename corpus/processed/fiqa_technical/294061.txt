I get upset everytime I see this. Where a part is made is a small percentage of how much it affects and benefits the us economy. If Ford manufactured each and every car in Mexico it would still have a bigger positive on the us economy than Toyota. Toyota profits, r and d, marketing, design and a bunch of other niche jobs required for the automaker stay overseas in Japan. So does the tax revenue from those jobs and profits. A us ceo will pay more in income taxes than a 1000 factory workers. If we lose the ability to design and engineer products we're screwed. It will never come back. There will always be a cheaper place to make goods. That's the wrong rabbit to chase.
