>According to the IRS, penalties and fines are only non-deductible when they are paid for actual violations of laws/regulations. That's not quite correct. Section 162(f) says [bolding is mine]: >No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) for any fine or similar penalty **paid to a government** for the violation of any law. That means they can only claim a deduction on the portion of the fine that isn't paid to the US government. I'm doing a little research to see if I can find out what the dealy-o is.
