>Bush It didn't come out the banks committed fraud under Bush tho. Nor did it come out about the whole sub prime loan mess either. >they were trying every trick in the book in order to try and reinstil confidence in the stock market and US financial system in order to convince people to start lending money again and break the country out of a deflationary liquidity cycle I know, but that doesn't mean they couldn't have gone after the banks tho at the same time. One could argue tho that going after the banks and throwing the crooks in jail would also help install public confidence in the economy as those guys where no longer running things. >Today, even if Sears going boom tumbled a bunch of other commercial real estate firms and retail stores, it wouldn't suddenly make the banks insolvent in the short run. Totally missed the point here. Its much more has to do with who is president than anything else. Trump is gutting the government as much has possible to make it as ineffective as possible. He's going to give a pass on Eddie here.
