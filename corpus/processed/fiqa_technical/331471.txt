My prediction: in 3-5 years when amazon finally has to pay sales tax, they will buy sears. IMO sears website is so atrocious it makes me wonder if the management there even knows how to use the Internet. It has gotten better in the last 6 months or so, but any chance they had at a successful business model with the Internet was already shot.
