Your source doesn't support your point. I don't have a problem paying taxes for services we all use - you do. Charging fees for police & courts is a libertarian notion. As sourced in my previous post, no current tax rates need to be changed to pay for UH. We just need to remove corporate subsides. As a whole, America would save about 10% of GDP yearly by converting to a UH in this fashion. If you can't honestly debate the sources or ideas I've put out and insist on circling back around to these ideological positions regardless of how often they get blown up - then I think we've made all the progress we're going to.
