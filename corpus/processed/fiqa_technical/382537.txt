BB put themselves in a tough spot. They need to be competitive with Amazon, but they have higher cost structure, and a less compelling shopping experience for many buyers. Have you tried to buy a TV there? They have fewer models than Amazon, but still an overwhelming number, and no good way to sort between them. They need to cut the number of SKUs they offer and provide a reason for people to want to come in the store.
