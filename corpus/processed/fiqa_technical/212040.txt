Be honest, and let your expectations be known. BUT ..and I can't stress this enough..you need to let them know your willing to work just as hard as they are. Work with them, help them with their jobs every now and then so you know A) what goes into their work and b) how they work. All ppl are different and respond differently to things but they will be more respectful of you if they know you don't think they are below you and that your a hard worker. Also..a thanks and good job go a long way..
