The continent of Africa has lots of natural resources, but did not fare as well as the USA, so that alone doesn't explain everything. However, there was mass migration from the old world to the new world for the entire US history. 88 people control more wealth than the poorest half of the world (3.6B people or whatever). That is a relatively meaningless statistic, alone. Thanks to automation and globalization, intellectual property, and access to capital, I see the trend continuing until 9 people control 99.9999999% of the world's wealth. I may look up Ricardian theory.
