"Major societal changes generally emerge out of a lot of riots and protests. Social Security literally came out of the great depression where you had Hoovervilles popping up everywhere. All this turmoil lead to an existential crises where issues actually needed to be addressed. The point I was trying to make is that I doubt a basic income will come about naturally. Corporations and those with a lot of money are going to try and push it off for as long as possible. However, if something accelerates automation you would have more people on the streets. Some say a $15 minimum wage would accelerate it, some say it wouldn't. On the one hand you would have people getting paid a living wage presumably. On the other hand you would have more automation which would mean a quicker transition to the next economic system instead of a long drawn out transition. Ideally we can shorten the length of time people are living on scraps. The idea being, one short surge of social unrest is better than many years of frustration, which would culminate in the same surge of unrest at the end. Plus the whole point of a basic income isn't to ""eliminate inequality."" It is an effort to ""reduce inequality."" Most people in the basic income community are against extreme inequality. They do not say that inequality should be inherently avoided. They say that there is such a thing as ""TOO MUCH"" inequality which can cause various problems, and that we have come to that point on Earth."
