"Ah, gotcha. That would be moving the country towards a more socialistic or communistic system where the government controls more of the means of production. I think there would be a problem. Successful companies need to be disruptive and the larger you are the harder it is to try a different approach. I think if the government did try to offer a competing product, the beauracracy would weigh down the offering. The only way the government could be assured a profitable business is to compete unfairly. Consider one of the big government companies, the Post Office. UPS has always been seen as the higher-quality delivery serive. Overnight shipping was considered impossible until FedEx did it. Even today the USPS is in serious financial trouble even though it is granted a monopoly on letter delivery (it is illegal for UPS and FedEx to deliver letters). The Post Office is too inefficient to make money on package delivery so they subsidize that side of their business selling stamps. > so we could abolish income tax and lower taxes over all IMO, the taxes will be paid one way or another. If you cut income tax then it will be replaced with a payroll tax, or sales tax, or property tax, or tariff, or passed to you in the form of higher prices. The only question is the definition of a person or group's ""fair share""."
