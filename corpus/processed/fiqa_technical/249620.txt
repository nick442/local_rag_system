Wow this is a perfect example of the apathy of customers. This scandal is literally about their auto loans, and that's what the article is about. How are you ever going to know if something is affecting you if you won't even read the damn article about a company YOU DO BUSINESS WITH? Seriously this couldn't prove the point of the comment you're replying to more. It's stupid consumers like you that allow these companies to get away with this shit.
