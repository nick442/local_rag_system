Not only do you not understand tech, you apparently don't understand science either. You made the original claim. Not me. What I said is that you're wrong. I CAN provide proof of that, since I happen to do this particular flavor of tech stuff for a living and have reference docs sitting all around me as I write this, but first I'm really interested in seeing what on earth you believe to be true that led you to make your original statement. It's okay though, we both know you can't offer any explanation on that. The objectively verifiable reason is that you're wrong. > you can plainly see whenever you open the uber app that it has your location. You think that just happens magically? So do you have anything to back up what you were getting at in this claim or are you still unsure of how conversation works?
