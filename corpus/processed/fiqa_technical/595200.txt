"business I want to invest in real estate (buy and hold, rent out), which i've already done a bunch of research on it. i figure i'll only need about 4k to begin because of the 3.5% down and i'll live in one unit and rent the others. i also want to start my own business, but that's a little further down on the list I think i went to college in the first place because I felt I had to because all my friends did and that's what you're ""supposed"" to do"
