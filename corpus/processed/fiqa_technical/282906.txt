Algolia is an amazing service and an absolute joy to use. They deserve all the praise they're getting and then some. However, it's easy to exceed their record limits, especially since you need to duplicate your index every time you want to 'sort by' something. For instance, if I wanted an option to sort my results by date, and to then search these, I'd need to create 2 new slave indexes for date ascending and descending respectively. Sorting by anything else, like price, means creating yet more indexes and suddenly it's easy to turn 30K records into 150K. This happened to me and I ended up having to roll something custom instead (Vuejs frontend and Sphinx Search backend), since my client balked at the extra cost. But, if you have a small dataset, or are fine with the costs, then Algolia is spectacular.
