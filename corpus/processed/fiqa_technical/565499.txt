"Krugman argues (and I agree with him on this one) that this is a telltale sign that the US is in a [liquidity trap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap). Basically interest rates are near 0 and the banks are very risk adverse right now, so they sit on reserves instead of lending them out. In this scenario, the government ""printing"" money has no effect on inflation (or much of anything) because it just sits in bank reserves. A more right wing economist might spin a different story though."
