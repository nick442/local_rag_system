> Say profits are 100mil, and a dividend is payed. Say 50 mil worth is payed out as dividend and 30 mil is kept as retained earnings for future investment. This does not equate. Out of net income, it is only possible to either reinvest (retained earning) or payout (repurchase or dividend). You can't have a $20m gap there. > Can the remaining 20 mil be distributed to shareholders A and B, so that they both get 10mil each? What makes them entitled to a separate, special dividend over the other shareholders? > Can certain shareholders be favored and get a bigger cut of profits than the dividends pay out is my question basically. It kinda sounds like you're describing preferred equity, but doing it in a rather round-about way.
