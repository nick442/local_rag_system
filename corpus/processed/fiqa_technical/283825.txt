"The key is to say something like ""after looking around, I think my salary is well below market value, and think I deserve a raise for the good work I've done X, Y, and Z"" Since they've just hired someone like you, they know the market value is indeed higher, and you don't need to resort to ""But HE gets XXX! Me too!"""
