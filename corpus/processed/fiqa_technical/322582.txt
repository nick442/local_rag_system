I'm not saying that they shouldn't be allowed to default. What I'm saying is that if they can't pay back their debts then they should default. The article makes it sound like Argentina deserves to be let off the hook and pay back only a portion of its debt. In the short term this seems appealing because the investors get back some of the money as opposed to none and Argentina gets to keep it's economy intact. However this sets a dangerous precedent in the long run because countries know they have this out and may issue bonds expecting not to pay the full amount. I think it is good that Argentina is being made an example of, this way countries will think twice before borrowing money they may not be able to pay back and will lead to more stability in the long run.
