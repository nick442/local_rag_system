It probably would have already been priced in the moment the markets opened today. So, my guess is, unless you already owned it at $68.78 on Friday, chances are it would have been near impossible to get it at that price since this morning. It already increased more than 18% from the opening bell today. Hope my answer helped clarify some things.
