Pull another Cabrini-Green. Except for the second most populated city, with the poorest people, in Lake county. I live in the county and my taxes are 50% higher fore property when compared to the neighboring counties. The problem is real. It has the largest rail line in the world. Lake Michigan lake front is for Steel. You cannot take away more of it to give to another corporation. 80/94 is constantly under construction. Amazon doesn't want Gary. That laughable. The would rather go to Indianapolis. Land, highway, airport, rail. All these things could support it. Until the riff-raff is moved out don't consider Gary for anything.
