I hope things work out and odds are that they will, but there's always a risk profile with any investment particularly an illiquid one like property. Here you're taking the risk that the local market in your area doesn't tank or that if it does that you can liquidate your houses quickly and retain most of the capital. Some areas are more stable than others, but things can change in decades. My parents live in a decent part of CT. House prices were high in the early 2000s. Then one of the biotech firms around here pulled out. One firm was not so big a deal - 30000 jobs is quite a bit but the area didn't become rich off one company - but it turns out that was the start of an industry trend. 3 more go, and suddenly property values crashed. Luckily, we have a pretty small house for the area so most of the assets aren't tied up in it, but it's pretty alarming to see a formerly upper middle class neighborhood become filled with overgrown lawns and for sale signs that hang around long enough to gather moss. When my parents sell after they retire they might be taking a hit in nominal terms, never mind real terms factoring in inflation. This is about investment real estate though. I do think there is a more intangible emotional and stability gain you get from owning the land or property you live in.
