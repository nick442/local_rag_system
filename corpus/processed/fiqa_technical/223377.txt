"I started looking at this yesterday after seeing a FB ad. In reading the agreements it appears they aren't the FDIC insured entity but rather they hold your money with an FDIC bank who is their partner. What I couldn't tell is if they have one large account that they hold your money in (commingled and I'd suspect far exceeding the $250,000 fdic limit) or if it's individual accounts in your own name being held there and beam is the intermediary. What I'm guessing is beam is actually owned by this ""partner"" bank and that bank is using this as a way to raise funds to fuel their loan growth in much higher rate areas (such as commercial lending). This is probably why they are capping the amount of new users so they can throttle the deposit influx until they've lent it out. The 2% rate paid to depositors is cheaper than going to the bond market."
