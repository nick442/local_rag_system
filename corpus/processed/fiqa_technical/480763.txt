>The entire pharmaceutical industry is floated by a protectionist racket. Drugs that are in fact very cheap to make are kept artificially expensive â€“ we have drugs that cost $1,000 a pill here in America that sell for $4 in India, for instance. Yea, because the $4 Indian pill is a knockoff. They cant be sold here because it would violate the American drug manufacturer's patent. And if you allowed the market to flood with knockoffs, youd kill the American pharmaceutical industry. Which by the way, the rest of the world depends on. All their cheap pills you hear about are because they dont recognize our patents, and just flood the market with generics. So unsurprisingly, we subsidize the rest of the world's healthcare. Our companies spend the R&D money developing the drugs. Our tax dollars fund the FDA to test the drugs. Our citizens pay for the drugs so that the pharma companies can earn a profit and R&D more drugs. The rest of the world just knockoffs our creation. You want to bring down drug costs here in America? Stop subsidizing the rest of the world. Enter trade deals that recognize our drug patents overseas, just like they recognize our copyrights and trademarks. Granted, that will never happen, but in the mean time now you know why drugs cost more here than anywhere else. Because we bear the cost of developing them.
