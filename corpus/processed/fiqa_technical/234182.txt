You take that risk. There are a ton of restaurants that pose a higher health risk. Use your own judgement. You can usually tell how cleanly someone is by the tiny things. One of my things is if they have a cat that jumps on the counters I’m not eating your food. If it smells like a cat lives there I’m not eating your food. If your finger nails are dirty I’m not eating your food. There are a lot more of these rules I have but those are just examples.
