You just explained why I'm boggled that some companies an individuals are willing to utilize such an erratic currency for exchanges. I tried using it as a payment method in my previous services company, but was understanding most people wouldn't and that it could potentially be loss for myself. Which on a smaller scale isn't really a issue, but scale up to some of the larger companies and it could be devastating. It's an entirely speculative market that could depreciate returns quickly.
