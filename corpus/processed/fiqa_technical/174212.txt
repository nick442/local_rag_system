Well to port across platforms, since most of the AAA titles are being built and ported across x86 platforms: xbox, ps and PC. On one side it may cost more, on the other it may attract more devs since it's another platform where their content will be available with low effort of porting. Unless ATARI would take the burden of supporting and producing most of the games.. and that's not an easy task..
