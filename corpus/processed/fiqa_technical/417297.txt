/r/economy is the only place I interact and post, although I do a significant amount of reading on a number of business websites. as with most things on reddit, it's entertaining, but I find reddit to be composed of - as a user base - liberal leaning individuals with quasi-knowledge on all things capitalism, industry, and business in general. I see a lot of things on universal basic income, increased gov't in certain areas, and arguments over taxation, all of which are missing the larger picture. I guess I'm trying to change the minds of a few outspoken people who may be right that 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 2, but forgot to notice the parenthesis that makes it 1 + 1 - (1 + 1) = 0. They're technically right but don't know how to think beyond the simplistic Huffpost crap that is created on a daily basis. And sometimes I'm given new perspectives on things I'm normally not exposed to. I get a chance to see the other side of the coin on things like free trade agreements, corporate redomiciling, and wealth inequality. It's a way to stay active, learn, and be connected. Public forums are a great way to get judged with real time feedback.
