"The statistics are misleading. The German autoworkers do not ""make"" $67/hour, that is basically a $140k job! Back in 2009, some sensationalist articles said that the average UAW worker ""made"" $75/hr sitting in the jobs bank. That is taking the total labor cost and dividing it by the number of existing employees. The most obvious example of why this number is so lopsided is through health care benefits and pensions. You get the illusion that the auto worker gets paid very high when labor cost per employee is very high, but the labor cost actually includes the current worker's cost as well as some past worker's costs, so it gets double counted. So yes, GM went bankrupt because labor costs were $75/hr. No, the UAW auto worker did not make $75 per hour. And yes, labor costs for the German workforce is a lot higher than the US workforce. But no, they don't actually get paid 2-3x more."
