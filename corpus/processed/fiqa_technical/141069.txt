Accenture has several levels of partner. I'd be really surprised if it topped out at 250k because that's not very much even for a public company and also doesn't fit with the lifestyle of a few partners. I googled around a bit and there was an AMA on (of all places) reddit about a year back from somebody claiming to be a partner at Accenture, who reported 300k for a new partner, up to 1M+ for more senior ones (excluding equity) which actually sounds more reasonable to me. Second observation: higher partner compensation does not systematically imply higher bill rates. Private companies doesn't pay dividends, for example, and partner compensation is not the only expense. Bankers in public banks can make that much and none of them are partners - viz. UBS & co. (performance-based bonus at Accenture for non-partners - and Senior Executives are not necessarily partners - can reach 20k, no problem. Hell, a consultant might make almost that)
