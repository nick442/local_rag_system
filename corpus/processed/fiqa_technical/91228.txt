Barnie Sanders is a cheap demagogue without any moral standards. I know, I know, why would I be attacking the guy? Well, he has criticized the Fed with cheap points like this that actually anyone a bit interested in the Fed knows, he jumped in the Audit the Fed Ron Paul push but when the time to stand up came he sold out. Bernie Sanders accepted passing a modified version of the Audit the Fed bill that basically rendered the bill useless because it was only a one time audit and only of specific actions, leaving out a bunch. Then it was publicized as if the bill had passed and was a victory so people were happy, when in reality (as the same Ron Paul pointed out) the bill was defeated. And it was because Sanders, who was sponsoring the bill on the Senate, accepted the changes. He is a sold out. The guy is so shameless that he even brags about hhow he helped auditing the Fed. tl;dr: Bernie Anders talks the talk but does not walk the walk. EDIT: Btw, to anyone interested, Ron Paul is trying to promote the Audit the Fed bill again right now and is gaining traction. Hopefully this time Ron Paul will find someone in the senate to sponsor his bill that is not a sell out like Sanders.
