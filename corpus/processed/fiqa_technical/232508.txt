How are you treated there? Horrendous pay certainly scares a lot of young people away from the profession in the first place, but many existing teachers quit because of the unreal workload, tons of mandatory unpaid after-hours time (duty, must sponsor after school clubs, after school meetings, etc.), tying student scores to your paycheck (or job security), etc.
