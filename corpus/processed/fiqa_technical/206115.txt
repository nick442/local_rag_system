Most people don't see it that way and it may drive me to personally renounce my citizenship even though I would really prefer not to. But I also won't let the crazy over-reach of the US government threaten future financial stability and cost a crazy amount annually just to be compliant. And yes I know about the FEIE and yes it's significantly more complicated than that for anything other than a simple employee-employer relation with minimal assets.
