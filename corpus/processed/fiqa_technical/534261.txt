A business which is completely dependent on highly-skilled labor should /exactly/ construct its workflow to ensure that they keep that skilled labor. It's reason #1 in the article and it is a good reason to allow remote work. I am close to IBM, I know it is hurting from this strict return to office work - they're too inflexible and have taken the rule too far. They've simultaneously closed a huge number of offices so they are having serious problems filling dev roles now that they are only located in highly-competitive job markets.
