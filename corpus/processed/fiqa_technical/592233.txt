"We need more governmental student aid. More Pell Grants and more cheap loans. If we've learned anything over the years, the government injecting billions of dollars of free money and cheap loans into the educational system in no way changes the pricing structure of that of that system. s/ Also, we need more highly valuable, highly marketable majors offered by colleges. Forget the hard STEM stuff, let's focus more on ""Women's Studies"", ""African Studies"", ""Social Justice"" and other majors like these. Because, let's be honest with ourselves, these type of degrees are in no way ""made up Bullsh#t waste of time degrees"" that do very little to nothing to prepare the graduate for how the real world works. s/ BTW, before the SJW's vote me down, let me hit you with this dose of reality: I own and operate multiple successful businesses and hire people on a regular basis. If we get a resume' from someone with one of those degrees, let's just say that they will not be getting an interview."
