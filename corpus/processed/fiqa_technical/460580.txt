"Spain is one of the most socialists states in Europe. I know because I live here. You are totally correct that the former owners broke it, what you are not right about is that they were private. Caja Madrid was a special partnership between the local governments and some private parties. All the ""cajas"" in Spain were set up that way and all had government representatives in their boards. EDIT: I just checked and turns out Caja Madrid, which represents 50% of Bankia, was 100% owned by the Madrid local government. The rest of the 50% of Bankia was formed with other ""cajas"" which were partly or completely owned by their local governments as well. Also is worth noting that the spanish private banks are also in trouble and have survived only because of the liquidity provided by the ECB, but they are not even close to the level of bankruption that the ""cajas"" have achieved."
