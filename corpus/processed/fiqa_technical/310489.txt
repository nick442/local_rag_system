There has been a lot discussion on Iceland as the model response to a financial crisis over at [Market-Ticker](http://market-ticker.org/)/[Tickerforum](http://tickerforum.org/). Just search the search box for Iceland. What would be even more constructive would be to do a three-way comparison between the US handling of the Savings & Loan crisis in the 80s, Iceland's handling of the current crisis, and the US handling of the current crisis. [William/Bill Black](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_K._Black) has had a lot to say on that lately, search Reddit or Google Plus for his name for starters, there are some videos floating around of him doing talks at OWS-LA, among other places. I'm almost certain that US handling of the S&L crisis was very similar to Iceland's, and resulted in short-term pain but long-term stability and return to growth. Whereas the current US response is going to result in long-term pain for everyone except the perps.
