Assuming that blocks, dark liquidity, and auctions aren't available, one of the biggest things that equity traders also have going for them is the availability of different execution venues, as well as the aforementioned ability to strategically time execution/child order placement based on the state of the order book at any given time. A security with a NYSE primary listing (BAC or IBM for example) will be traded on several exchanges/ECNs - Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, the various Bats exchanges - and that in itself opens up a lot of opportunity to spread out an order. As an alternative to simply going through several price levels on a single exchange, you can also route out multiple orders simultaneously to different exchanges to scoop up liquidity. All of that being said, I think it should be noted that you really can't exclude the execution methods that you mentioned in your original question. Any large institutional investor looking to trade in size will only get so far with trading on lit venues especially in the US equity marketplace. Taking advantage of block liquidity/IOIs or floating part or all of an order in a dark pool is a good way to mask intentions and minimize market impact. If you're part of a beta/index tracking strategy, you actually need to leverage auctions (index rebalances, like the MSCI, Russell, S&P all have a ton of participants executing market on close orders to account for adds/deletes/reweights). Overall, the buy side is becoming increasingly sophisticated when it comes to advanced execution, and it has been interesting to see how fintech companies, brokers, and exchanges have been feeding into the innovation.
