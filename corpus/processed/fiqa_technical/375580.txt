Yeah sure. After Brexit the UK will be so desperate to save its economy that they WILL accept chlorinated chicken and all other American demands because they will have no other choice than accepting them. The UK has nothing to offer in negotiations, they will be a sitting duck. In a few years the UK will surpass Greece as a needy country. That Brexit will be the nail in their coffin.
