This sounds like my dad in so many ways. Rather than ask questions and listen to vagueness (or lies) from your dad, I suggest you ask to see financial, tax, and legal documentation. Maybe speak to the accountant, lawyer, bank official - whomever - to see where checks were written, transfers, etc. I'm really sorry you are in this situation, but there needs to be a major family meeting immediately. Good Luck.
