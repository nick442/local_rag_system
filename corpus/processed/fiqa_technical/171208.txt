Except automation produces an increase in productivity through better leveraging of capital. In the past, increases in productivity were often seen through better leveraging of the workforce. When it's better leveraging of the workforce that drives the increased productivity, you pay the workforce better. When it's better leveraging of capital, you pay the capital (investors) and the managers of that capital better. Also, it's hard to say that the middle class has been in decline. The wealth gap between the middle class and the upper class has been growing, but overall the middle class is better off now than at past points in history. The same can be said of the bottom rungs. Access to health care, good food, information, air conditioning, etc is better now than at any point in the past.
