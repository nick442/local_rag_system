>I propose to make the requirements for finish high school and college degrees much much higher, as it was in the past. Not gonna happen. The paradigm is that low scores are entrenched and therefore unable to be lifted without the kids parents having higher education. Therefore, waiting for disadvantaged kids to get higher scores will not happen until they get accepted into college. If you force schools to gain their income from future students earnings they will have high concern for kids that have a good P/E ratio. It will also stop the loan industry from putting these kids into debt. The downside is that it may turn colleges into trade techs, but that is much better than what is going on now: useless degrees and high debt.
