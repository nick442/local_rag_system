My employer offers a citrix based interface that I can connect to from anywhere and do work stuff. It's basically a virtual machine running somewhere on corporate servers, complete with Office package, access to my virtual drive, etc. I think that this sort of set-up is probably the way to go with BYOD, except it's a bit slower and more awkward than working directly on your device. But it still won't stop people from forwarding stuff to webmail, and neither will Siri and dropbox bans. The user is still the weakest link in any corporate security scenario.
