Some of the best leaders I have worked with are quite unassuming. A VP for a large corporation was what I assumed to be a humble, friendly guy. It wasn't until I heard him speak that I was blown away. Several managers I have worked with also have been good leaders. They managed to shield me from a lot of crap
