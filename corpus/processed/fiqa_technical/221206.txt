"The opposite of a cost is an investment. Buying a car is an expense, usually a sunk cost, whereas purchasing real-estate, e.g. productive farmland, is an investment. (Some investments are wasting assets, as the value decreases over time, but they are still investments with market value, not costs.) ""Sunk cost"" isn't a fallacy. It just means an expenditure that one cannot expect to recoup. The action item is, ""Don't throw good money after bad."" The opposite of a sunk cost is an investment."
