What is democratic about today's government? Because we get to choose between two predetermined candidates, neither of whom represent any of us? The government is exclusively controlled by the rich, and only the rich win elections. There are only two parties and both are largely similar. I have never been represented before. I have never had a proper say. The government is illegitimate in my eyes, and I have no recourse whatsoever. Telling me to launch a multi-million dollar campaign is not a realistic option. I don't have millions, and I don't know millionaires.
