I believe he was recommended by one of the investors. After digging a little deeper, it seems the person who invested the most (I believe they own 40%) has his wife doing the taxes and paperwork. We've tried to get them to show us the paperwork and they always seem reluctant. They claim that they're not getting anything either, but they're more of a mutual partner that was introduced to us by the third investor. Basically I invested with a friend, who introduced a third investor (who bought in at the majority). I think it was my friend who knew this manager and hired him due to a past relationship they had. For more insight, my friend actually owns another 2 bars that are quite successful, but it seems he's completely not invested in this one despite owning 30%.
