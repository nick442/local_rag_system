Using the facts in your comment: I use the pmt function in excel and the goal seek tool to determine an original balance of ~$24,241.33 Taking into account the statement in the questions that you have paid $6,072.26 in principal gives an estimated current balance of which almost exactly matches your current balance statement of $18,168.56 a difference of 51 cents. Is it possible that during the time you were in college the accumulated interest caused the balance to grow from 20,800 to 24,241? This could happen if the loans were unsubsidized.
