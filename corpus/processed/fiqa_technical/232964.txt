I'm a sucker for cool interiors and I don't really pay attention to safety (although I should). I have two friends, one who bought a '17 Civic and another who bought a '17 Corolla. Neither of them know anything about cars. The Honda was impressive with the exception of the stupid touch controls for volume. The Corolla, at a similar price, was not nearly as impressive. Until the '18 Camry was announced, Toyota's design language lagged behind basically every major car manufacturer. My point is that Toyota makes some ugly cars, relative to their direct competition. However they ARE getting their shit together - just look at the Lexus LC500, which the CEO of Toyota worked on. The design language is changing but I'd rather wait and see what happens in the very near future.
