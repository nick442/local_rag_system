What you do is you create an infomercial where you sell a booklet about junk investments that you are absolutely certian may survive an end of the world scenerio. Then you sell that booklet to people who fear for their family. It is basically a tax on stupidity but works because it prays on the fears of the stupid. It requires moral bankruptcy, but you can end up with quite a bit of money.. of course if the Euro does crash then you have a lot of worthless money.
