Oh my fucking god, what a stupid comment. You mean the degree he paid for? That no one at Wharton knows anything about? No classmates? No Teachers? Wharton seems real proud of having him there, oh wait, no they don't. They even have an open letter that has 2000 fucking signatures on it from Faculty and Students. Also, just because you have a degree in Economics doesn't make you automatically know everything about it. You have to put in the time and work and he clearly shows his understanding of it daily. >Trump2052 I don't need to comment further for a blinded and ignorant fan-boy.
