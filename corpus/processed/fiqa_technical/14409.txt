I hate to sound harsh, but he's right. No technology, innovation, service or product can overcome your own lack of discipline. That doesn't mean you should give up, though - just like everything else, financial discipline is a learned skill, not something we're born with. Everyone can learn to be financially responsible. If you find you can't keep track of your expenses, try merely saving your receipts. Whenever you get home, pull them all out of your pockets, and look over how much you spent. Once you get to the point where you're consistently keeping your receipts, start keeping a register (either paper or electronic) that you update when you empty your pockets. From there, you can begin tracking how much you spend in various categories, and being setting budgets and adjusting your spending habits. It's not easy, but it's something that we all have gone through. Keep at it, and you can succeed in turning your finances around.
