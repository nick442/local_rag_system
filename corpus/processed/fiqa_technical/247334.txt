If you keep redefining poverty to mean literally what it does not mean, as you have done here, it makes conversation impossible. How useless would it be to discussion if I countered that with “thanks to technology, the middle class now extends to even lower levels of income, thus poverty is reduced”? It means nothing and it’s silly.
