I'm curious as what you guys consider reputable sources? NYT? WSJ? Financial Times? Your trust in the mainstream media blows my mind. The blogosphere is a million miles ahead of traditional media. And there's a little thing called [manufacturing consent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent:_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media) that makes MSM act like gov propaganda outlets. Also, this article is amazing. They were bid rigging very blatantly when they knew they were being recorded.
