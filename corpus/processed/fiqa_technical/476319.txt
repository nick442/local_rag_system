'Pretty' inelastic does not mean completely inelastic, and if there is any elasticity at all there is an optimum price point. Also, in general, drugs are the most elastic portions of healthcare, for example, Drug A, might have serious side effects while Drug B at higher cost might a less serious set. These kinds of economic decisions are constantly happening. There might be specific cases where the drug is life saving with no analogs but that's uncommon across the drug spectrum. These are obvious facts and objective thinking is necessary if we want to really solve the problem. Sadly, judging by the downvotes, mere statement of objective facts is not welcome. This does not auger well for the country, I'm afraid. :-(.
