"America is a really fucked up place. When I was a small child, we were told horror stories about the workers in Japan. They couldn't take vacations, because if they did, they'd find someone else in their job when they got back. They had to work super long hours, and spend 90 minutes commuting each way, on a train packed tight with people. America has taken a leaf from Japan's 1970s playbook: Allow employers to give employees no paid vacation time at all, and employment ""at will"" where an employer can march someone off the premises for any reason. Make workers do 60 hour weeks while paying them for a 40 hour salary. Reduce effective incomes by inflation over decades, and smaller wage increases. Americans have forgotten that you work to live, *you don't live to work*."
