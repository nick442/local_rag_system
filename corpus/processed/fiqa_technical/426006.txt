Struggling startup right here. Software / web based, solid 4 years in. Past the ramen noodle phase now and this year was able to comfortably buy iphones for the kids. (first time ever actually splurging like that, felt great.) 9 years ago I was basically homeless. 11 years ago I slept on a concrete slab. Shit gets better man, keep at it, you will be ok.
