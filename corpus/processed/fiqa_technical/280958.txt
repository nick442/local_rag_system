What do you want to do after college? That drastically alters what I (and others) would recommend. The one thing I don't see anyone recommending, but is probably the most important, is in three parts. 1) learn deeply about the field(s) you want to enter 2) learn about the firms who are the best in it 3) speak to people (start low in the hierarchy, move high, using e.g. LinkedIn to ID them).
