As boomers retire there'll be a lot smaller workforce to go along with a potential smaller employment force. Also as far as having fewer jobs in any particular career path, ask yourself what you think is easier to do, completely change careers in your 20s or 30s or in your 40s or 50s? Fact remains those with less working time left have a harder time adjusting to the new economy because they have less opportunity to change careers or make up their retirement losses.
