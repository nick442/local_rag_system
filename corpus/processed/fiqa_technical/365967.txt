So.. If everybody took your advice, how would you ever be able to hire other people? The economy would be composed of millions of ever-competing single-person ventures, in which some would strive, and the ones who fail would just move in to the next venture.. Being an entrepreneur requires a certain skill set and appetite for risk that not everyone has, or is in a position to take on, so the rational that only entrepreneurs deserve riches is very reductionist and dismissive of how value-creation happens.
