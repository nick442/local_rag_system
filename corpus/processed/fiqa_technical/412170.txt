The new minimum wage hike in Oregon is putting strain on small businesses. $11.40 is a ridiculous high wage and is forcing many businesses to under staff and raise prices on everything dramatically. Gas here is up $.30 since the hike July 1st. A minimum wage hurts the poor, the uneducated, and the less skilled by forcing them out of the workforce. Not all people are worth $11.40 an hour.
