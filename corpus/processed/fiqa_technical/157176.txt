I ate a McDonald's burger about a month ago for the first time since I was a kid. I'll tell you, if that's your standard for a real meat burger, there are definitely vegetarian products that could fool you into thinking they were real meat. Quite frankly, I'm pretty positive that McDonald's could sub out the burger patty for a soy based substitute tomorrow and no one would ever notice.
