>I find that TV quality has taken a real nose dive in the last 10-15 years. You are watching the wrong stuff. TV is in a Golden Age. This is a list of good Dramas that aired this year alone: Boardwalk empire Boss Breaking Bad Game of Thrones Homeland Justified Mad Men Shameless Sons of Anarchy Walking Dead There are dozens of decent shows, in addition plus a few gems on broadcast. There has never been a better time for TV than now. The quality and creativity of TV now outshines the movie industry.
