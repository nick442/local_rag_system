"> I said it wasn't perfect for the long run. Forget about long-run. It was clear from day one that the ACA is far from perfect. > But obstructing and causing it to fail is very different from ""fixing"" it. LOL!! So you want to pump more money into something you admitted is not good? Just wait for Trump and his admin to change the plan and then we will talk. The ""obstructions"" are not by Trump. They are by traitor republicans who suddenly want to keep the ACA."
