Yep, this is a fact - and actually goes double for non-profits and the public sector. I'm significantly more shielded from this than if I was employed as a developer for a private entity. I once worked for a startup where I had to sign a contract to not create a competing service within 2 years of leaving the company. I've been very careful to never put myself in that position again.
