When a product is subsidised the consumer is not paying the true cost of the product. Therefore, the consumer is purchasing the product for less than it costs to make. All the aeroplane industries are subsidised in the world. Therefore all planes are sold for less than what it cost to make. Governments subside industries because they see the long-term benefits and the benefits outweigh the costs. These benefits can be because of increased employment, investment in technology, a country's security or even national pride.
