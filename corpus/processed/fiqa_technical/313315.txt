It's just the downvotes that annoy me. But no, of China were to ban all apple products, the people will go apeshit crazy. Where else are they going to get their phones from? You can ask anyone in China what their opinion would be if the government ever tried that. Also, Xi fagface is trying to make his popularity higher, and the more censorship he imposes on the people, the more they get fed up with him. Maybe dozens of factories, but tens of thousands of workers. Additionally, the Chinese people play a lot of games because they hate work and all that stuff. There's this game they play it's called strike of kings, basically a moba that's a copy of league but on mobile. If the government banned the AppStore than how would the generally population update that game for the new champions etc? And by general population I'm saying almost everyone who has an iPhone. You don't know how many hours people spend on that game. But yeah, I feel like since I live in China and understand the general opinion I know better. There is just no way that China could ban apple. Yeah kudos to you to with the calm reply, I grew up in Australia
