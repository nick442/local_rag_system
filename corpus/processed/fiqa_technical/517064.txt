I like your example. My only issue with it is that it's very anthropocentric. Even at a very basic level, we should be teaching that economy is a subset of ecology, not just about human interactions. I think the great economic problem of our age is not how to spur growth, but how to appropriately factor in costs of natural resources and affects to the world ecology.
