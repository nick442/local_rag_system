Worse comes to worse, you can switch majors later. Going to a 'target' school might make things easier, but I know people from my school (a rather un-prestigious school in Canada) who graduated and wound up at Goldman Sachs and Bridgewater.. If you have the drive and knack for it, you'll be ok. But if you're doing it because you're not good at science, you'll probably wind up with a pretty average job..
