that's not a huge surprise- it boils down to an increased demand for people who can be flexible in their thinking. Business is becoming much more dynamic, procedures change, technology changes, everything changes from week to week if not day to day. If you can't roll with the punches then you're going to have a hard time. Tech firms will hire people who don't specialize in a particular programming language, what they expect is for you to be able to think your way through.
