>The Austrians are certainly on some of the shakiest ground in my view. At least Keynes' work was rigorous. So was Marx's for that matter. That stands in stark contrasts to the Austrians and their ilk. Care to elaborate? (I'm not familiar with the inner workings of Austrian economics nor why it's such a sharp contrast to Keynesian or Friedmanian economics. Other than its worship of the free market and hatred of government, of course.)
