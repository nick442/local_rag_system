No argument there. A few months prior it was a jewelry store, but November it was a place to sell off your gold. It looked the same, but the business model shifted dramatically. Yes, it's just an anecdote. But there were tens of thousands of dollars worth of orders by many people in the days after. I had just been hired to design and learn wax milling. This trickled down very quickly to me just doing photography and ad design part time instead of a full time position at a liveable wage. I got out of there as quickly as possible.
