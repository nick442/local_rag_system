Yep. Also, some research will help you understand which companies target which schools. Linkedin, Google, etc can show you if companies are HQed near certain schools, as well as where current employees went. Companies will also sponsor/host events on schools' campuses. Searching the school website would be useful. But networking helps a ton (easier to fact-check a butt-load of research someone else already did that they shared via conversation)
