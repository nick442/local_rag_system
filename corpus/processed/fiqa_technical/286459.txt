The last week is the most important. The Q and As are the most important because that is where you will see yourself be challenged. 83 is about where I was, but I also passed because I was busting my butt the week before the test. I know people who got confident and relaxed the last week and ended up failing. Finish strong, that's what I would focus on, not what your score is. Also, take the day off before the test and maybe watch a video or two. The practice tests are a better indicator of your score because they are closer to the actual test, but they aren't as challenging.
