>The point of Lewis' speech is that society and culture has (wrongly) been attributing all success to skill alone, and almost completely discounted luck of opportunities as a factor. It's called the [fundamental attribution error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). In short, you attribute YOUR success to your own personal characteristics and downplay situational variables that played an influential role and attribute YOUR failures to situational variables while downplaying personal characteristics.. while simultaneously doing the opposite for everyone else (i.e., Other person's success = luck, other person's failure = idiocy).
