Good move by Amazon. As it is now I go to Costco to fill any pricey prescriptions. For example , a tier 3 medicine will cost me 30% co-pay up to $120 but no less than $60 for a 30 day supply. I went to Walgreens and they were charging my insurance $800 and thus I had to pay $120. Same exact medicine at Costco cost my insurance $260 and I paid $60. Same exact medicine, same dosage , same strength. The markup on meds is nuts.
