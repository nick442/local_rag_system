slash the expenses. tax the bare minimum if at all. let the free market fix thr problem. all the issues here (healthcare, education, military) are problems the gov created. even if they had the foresight to stop spending our taxes on bs and used it to reflect EU norms, I dont trust for one second a top down solution would outperform a truly free market (not a half ass free market). And still. even if we re-prioratize our expenses, we are still stupid in debt. it will crash. thats the only way this gets fixed. or we blow up the world to prevent it. but how long can you flex a muscle?
