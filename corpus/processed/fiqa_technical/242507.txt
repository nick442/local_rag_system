If the Democrats controlled the House the legislation would be equally as crony, bullshit, and corrupt. We just went through the entire ordeal in preventing SOPA from passing, which had explicit support from Democrats. So don't tell me with a straight face that the parties are any different. Obama is no different than Romney, the only issue is that Romney is in election mode and Obama has a Congress unwilling to pass any of his laws. If the situation was reversed (Rep white house, Dem congress) it would be equally as fucked up.
