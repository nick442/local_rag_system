Discussing the existence of a speakeasy is not the same as handing out a map with hand written annotations and directions to the speakeasy. Note that I did not hand out addresses, names, or even discussed the type of content that one might find on a private torrent tracker. I have just stated that they exist and wanted to point out that the fact that because they are not very commonly known about, clearly demonstrates that the members of said sites are (and can be) extremely discrete. I agree that torrent sites require discretion to stay alive, however your post seems to indicates that you, perhaps, are not aware of the existing reality of extremely discrete, private, torrent trackers with extremely large content libraries and user bases. As such, in order to stop the dissemination of bad information to others (ie, that there is no way those could possibly exist!), I thought I would point out to those who may not be in the know, that there are indeed private, discrete torrent trackers that are safe and free.
