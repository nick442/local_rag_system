"> Amazon's bid to buy Whole Foods should be a wake-up call. Our anti-monopoly policies have fallen into disuse and today's big tech monopolies have used that opening to seize too much power. As Senator John Sherman, co-author of the Sherman Antitrust Act, declared as his bill came up for a vote in 1890, ""If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life."" I'm going to push back a little and say that by ending the article by connecting the bid for Whole Foods to the Sherman Antitrust Act the implication is pretty clear , if not bordering on explicitly stating that Amazon qualifies as a ""big tech monopoly"" I could definitely be wrong, I just feel like the wording she chose throughout the article deliberately tries to lead the reader to the conclusion that Amazon should be broken up by the government because it's a monopoly. What are your thoughts on the concluding statement and your point that she is focusing on the potential and not the current state?"
