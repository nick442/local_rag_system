That's the nice thing. You can read the details and even ask the requester questions just as a loan officer would. You can also filter based on criteria. For me, I filter out wedding expenses, trips, home improvement (not repair), vacations and most major purchases. I tend to invest in refinancing (carefully), business expenses, renewable energy project, and educational expenses. That's the nice thing about it, I can support the initiatives that I choose to support.
