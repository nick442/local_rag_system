Can no one read? I never said anything about equivalence, it was an example of an off the books subsidy. And I'll pose the same question to you as the other commenter, do you think that having solar panels on your roof will keep the government from sending our military to other countries? Because if you do, that's truly laughable. Apparently that author is clairvoyant enough to announce a 2016 report in an article dated July, 9th 2014. But I'll just assume you didn't actually read any of it. I did, and I'm not saying those figures are wrong, but that report has a clear stated agenda that is anti-oil/coal. The report I linked was to a US agency that was only making the information available. It may also have inaccuracies, but I'm going to assume that data for identical years in these reports being interpreted wildly differently indicates one is manipulating the information. I'd assume that someone with an agenda would be more likely to manipulate the data than an agency just seeking to publish data. Regardless, those inconsistencies should have some explanation.
