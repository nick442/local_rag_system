> Can almost guarantee the console will be a flop I think there's a big gap in the marketplace. Consoles are moving towards the PC end of the spectrum, abandoning the middle. On one end you have casual gamers, phones, retro systems/emulators etc. On the other end you have PCs converging towards VR and consoles going all-in to catch up so they aren't also-rans. In the middle there's room for a $100 system that plays games that are more fun than just sheer graphics. One that doesn't require expensive annual subscriptions, season passes, DLC, etc. If I were SEGA, I'd be looking at a console as well.
