Yes it is! You don't need the candidate waving a university diploma to find out in 5 minutes if they can read, write or understand. As someone who work with many interns, some of them from ivy league universities, I can confirm that many of them, 30%, have terrible attitudes, immaturity, spoiled, disorganized, and it all goes together with being not so smart, despite the degree. In the past, to be a teller in a bank, you did not have to finish high school. Just needed to be good with basic math.
