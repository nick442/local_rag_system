Not really. Most of the major cloud providers have streamlined their data center processes to the point they can go from deciding they need additional capacity to having another 10k nodes online in a matter of a few months. That's a process that takes a traditional data centers years. Fiber runs are all about up-front capital investments and attempting to target supply to demand despite needing years of surveys, permits, and trenching. Cloud is just getting another dozen rows of servers. It's like saying because a bunch of states overbuilt highways, that a rental car company could overbuy cars.
