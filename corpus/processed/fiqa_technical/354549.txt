"I've picked up loads of interesting and cool items from Aliexpress. Few computers, amplifiers, DAC's, electronics components and so forth. So far it's literally been ""you get what you pay for"", the really cheap stuff was really cheap, the things I paid more for were better quality. If you are careful you can find some gems, or a shipping container full of fidget spinners for $5000K."
