I still don't understand how a restaurant called Chipolte can be so friggin' bland. Their 'hot' salsa isn't that hot, and the bottles of Tabasco sauce by the soda fountain are in insult. Not to mention the last time I got a burrito, it was lukewarm and mushy. I only wish the location across from my work was a Moe's :(
