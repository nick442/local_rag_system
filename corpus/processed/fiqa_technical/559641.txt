The difference of the median of those with a bachelor's compared to those with high school diploma in [2009 was 15K per year](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=77) for full-time, full-year wage and salary workers ages 25â€“34. At 15K per year for the 40+ years of work from 22 or so to 65, it will be 600K. But the gap will widen as the employees age.
