>The assumption that most of the jobs will be automated doesn't necessarily imply that automation leads to job loss. That's the problem. Apparently, it does. Every job can be replaced with a new software. Again, short-term there it might not be noticable, but in few decades, there is a high possibility of most jobs being replaced. But this is not the question, the question is, how would businesses make money in case everyone was replaced with a software.
