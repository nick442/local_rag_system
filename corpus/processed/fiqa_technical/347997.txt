My thinking is that since the last time a drop like that happened was back in the early 1930's, calling a drop of that magnitude, even if off by 2 years, is still an impressive feat. That's equivalent today to calling the SP500 to be under 400 by a certain date. Sheer insanity to make that kind of call. Not saying either of us is correct, I think we just have different perspectives on accuracy.
