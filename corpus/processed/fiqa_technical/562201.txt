Ballmer appears to be way out of his depth at everything except maintaining key personal relationships, but I don't think anyone could have competed with Amazon, Apple or Google. They had very clear primary goals, and are driven by highly motivated and uniquely skilled people. Still, Ballmer shouldn't be given a pass for all the own-goals, which all come back to MS culture, and a lack of vision and leadership.
