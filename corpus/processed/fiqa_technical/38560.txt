You're really confused. You need to go back to finance 101 about the concept of corporation and shareholders This is too much to take apart (i.e.: contribution is not a loan, and can't be called. Shareholders are not partners...). Sorry bro, not trying to burst your bubble, but any academic business finance 101 book or OpenCourseWare will cover this and more.
