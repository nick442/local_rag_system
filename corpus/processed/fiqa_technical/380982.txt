I could see them taking over the old Intel campus in Hudson, or Suffolk Downs. if there's space for an enormous casino, there's space for Amazon. the Globe speculated today they could also do something like the old NAS South Weymouth. I think they will be tempted by the high end talent coming out of MIT, Harvard and the other top schools. Tufts and WPI are great engineering schools. Not just for engineering, but HBS, Sloan, and beyond that BC/BU/NU all have good management programs. There is also already a large footprint for Amazon here, particularly in the speech recognition area. With GE, Massachusetts has already signaled willingness to commit to tax breaks to lure prestige businesses. Realistically Boston and Toronto are the only places that checks all their boxes, short of Silicon Valley. Austin, Denver and Minneapolis might also compete if the public transportation requirement isn't strict.
