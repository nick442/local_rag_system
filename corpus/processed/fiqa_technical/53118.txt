Didn't realize there was so much vitriol in the company. (via first link in article to Brad Reese's blog: http://www.bradreese.com/blog/8-7-2014.htm). Kind of reminds me of HP during the Carla Fiorina days. HP in my opinion started their downward spiral around that time. Especially after they ousted the HP families.
