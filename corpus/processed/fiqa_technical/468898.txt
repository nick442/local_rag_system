"Agreed. One of the comments for this question Good books for learning about tax strategy/planning uses the phrase: ""Don't let the tax tail wag the investing dog."" It applies to charitable donations. Donate because it is expected by your church; donate because it makes you feel good; but don't donate just to save money on your taxes. Once you have decided to donate take the steps necessary to be able to deduct your donation. Get the receipt or use a check or credit card so you can deduct the donation."
