"It is Bitcoin ""Cash"", not Bitcoin ""Stocks"". It is really silly to gauge it by traders sentiment. Sure the value will drop as uninterested people cash out pushing the value down. After that, the value may stabilize to a higher value making traders that jumped the gun really regret being short sighted. August 8 is the day on which SegWit goes into effect, but it brings nothing immediately new to the table. Bitcoin's blocks are no longer full, so the immediate issues of backed up transactions and high fees are no longer present. We saw Litecoin implement SegWit and nothing magical immediately happen. They even are working on Litening Network, but people seem pretty disinterested, at least from a market value perspective (it is all real cool to us tech geeks). SegWit allows Lightening Network to be implemented in the future, which really excites businesses and startups because of the opportunity of profiting off of transaction fees without investing in mining hardware. Everyone wants to profit being a middle man. Hence the constant negative propaganda against Bitcoin Cash. Don't get me wrong, the side chains of Lightening Network will enable some cool stuff, but right now it is simply a corporate money grab to fix the purposely created bottleneck issue of Bitcoin, which Bitcoin Cash disposed of."
