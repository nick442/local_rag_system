>I suspect he would simply cut the minimum wage and unemployment benefits to force Americans to accept lower wage jobs. Don't give him that much credit. He won't touch either of these entities for several reasons. First, it's political suicide. Second, the Congress would give him a huge headache for even attempting to do this, and they would probably never be able to vote on a bill to send to a President Romney anyhow. Third, there is little evidence to suggest that Romney actually *believes* in wanting to do what he touts in his slimy, disgusting rhetoric. The man has not demonstrated any principle, fortitude, or ideological consistency. Once Romney sits down at the commander's desk, it will feel just like the Obama administration did, only less funny..
