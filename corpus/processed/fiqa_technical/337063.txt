I did not know that. I guess they would have to do it that way. So I could potentially convince one of my current profs to take me on as a PhD student? I know one isn't supposed to stay at the same school they did their undergrad at, but it would be easier this way and I really like the finance faculty at my school. I really haven't had courses in those. The econ program I'm doing is in the business school, so other than what calc we do in our classes and the one required calculus class, I don't have much experience. The econ program is pretty poor at my school as well, in my humble opinion (I think the finance program is pretty great though). I understand that I'm incredibly deficient on math as far as quants go. I just ordered a book on stochastic calculus that I'm going to read and see if I like it or hate it.
