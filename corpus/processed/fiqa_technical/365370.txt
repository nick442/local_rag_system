> This constant belief that services should cost a percentage instead of a fixed rate that everyone pays is a joke. Your position makes good sense but if everyone paid a fixed rate in taxes then about %25 of the people would go broke. It doesn't seem fair that someone working within the system is bankrupted by the system. Seems to me we need to first fix unfairness in wages. Anyone who works full time for the system should at least be able to afford a modest life including health care, retirement, and taxes. Then I think it is right to demand they pay taxes to the system. Would you agree?
