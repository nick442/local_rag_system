>Correct. However, consumers do want to have a conversation with employees who do give a damn. This is true, but that's not something I associate with Foot Locker. I have a couple of local shops that I associate with that kind of advice and they're usually busy. Foot Locker either needs to stay price competitive with online direct sales, or improve their staff training so that people want their advice.
