I do wonder if part of this is a phenomenon I've seen numerous times in the US: Woman gets pregnant, barely shows up to work for the next 5 months until birth, camps out on FMLA for three months before simply ignoring any communications from the company for the next several months. Finally, a good 6-8 months after the birth she notifies the company she won't be working anymore. Meanwhile, she's been getting insurance benefits the entire time and HR is too afraid of a lawsuit to cut her loose. Her position has either been unfilled the entire time (requiring her coworkers to cover her share of the work at expense of their own lives), or if the manager is more prescient than most, has already been backfilled, but is still in a blocking pattern preventing other hires but at least not making coworkers' lives miserable.
