the biggest issue with a pure physical dividend is the cost of transfer. Cash or stock dividends are decentralized **and** easy to transfer ownership, hence the majority of value can be transferred to the shareholder. If you were to deliver wine to every shareholder, you would have to deduct the cost of transport from the value of the wine dividend, otherwise it becomes value-reductive to shareholders and they'd be better off keeping the dividend as stock value.
