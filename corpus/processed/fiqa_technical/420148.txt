Lol. When did I ever say that? I said you don't know the difference between the two. The fact that you think JP Morgan is responsible for CDO's and MBS's is comical. So again, here's your post >Maybe if fuckers like him could manage their house then government wouldn't have to bail them out and there wouldn't be a need for as much regulation. But no, he's going to keep gambling and expect tax payers to cover his losses, and then has the audacity to bitch about it. Fuck him Now do please explain how JP Morgan * didn't properly manage their mortgages * needed to be bailed out by the government * gambled * had the tax payers cover their losses I'd love to see what other bullshit you come up with to defend these statements. On the other hand, if you want to cut the shit and acknowledge you're both retarded and wrong, I'm more than happy to educate you on the recent financial crisis and why JP Morgan was a godsend to the US economy.
