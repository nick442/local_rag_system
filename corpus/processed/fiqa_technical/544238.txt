"Welfare (food, shelter, health care) without the means/option to get off of it (jobs) is pointless. Currently, it is a bridge to nowhere due to our leaders' obsession with shipping our jobs away, not increasing compensation, being unwilling to hire and train us, and/or allowing US workers to be undercut by illegal immigration. Welfare (faring well) is a much needed a temporary bridge to self sufficiency. Now it has just become the only ""fare"" available and a slide into employment oblivion."
