"You need ""the list"". Write down EVERYONE you know. EVERYONE. Like, EVERYONE. Then categorise their potential as a customer as ""high"" ""avg"" or ""low"". Then make contact with all the low hanging fruit. Most will naturally ask what you're doing, you'll tell them, and you'll plant a lot of seeds. Some will germinate soon, some will take years, some will refer, some will not. People need to know what you can offer and the best place to start is with people you know."
