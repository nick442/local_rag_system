A pure free market for agricultural commodities would be disastrous. Markets respond efficiently but not instantaneously. Shifts in he supply and demand of labor and capital investment are particularly slow. If a large percentage of corn farmers go under one fall there have to be new farmers/capitalists picking up the slack by next spring or there will be insufficirnt production that cant be recovered for an entire year. Society can't withstand massive losses of commodity production, strategic reserves can help absorb the damage but youre still paying for innefficient production as grains can only be stored for so long and need replacing on an annual basis.
