"I made this mistake and tried calling Paypal..the first time I have ever been unhappy with their service. The girl gave me some number but didn't make it clear whether it was an order reference number or a reference phone number for the company I ordered from. I called within 10 minutes of placing my order and they were unable to cancel or change the payment method. I did find however, that even though you can't pay paypal with your credit card, some banks will let you. I went into my account and ""paid"" my account the amount needed using my credit card from the same bank that I had intended to use in the first place..hopefully it went through quickly enough to not get a service fee from Paypal"
