As someone actively working towards launching a business (as in, a business, not a tech startup hoping to get bought out, not a blog, etc), I’d be interested to get your take on it. I find that most of this ‘self help’ business writing usually just pitches to people’s confirmation bias, and people actually running businesses are too busy with their business to write books and blogs about it.
