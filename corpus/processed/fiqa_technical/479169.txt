> Xerox. (Those are considered tech right?) Not anymore. Burns is probably better chair and ceo than Mulcahy but I wouldn't hold my breath on Xerox regaining its old glory and title as common household name again with its heavy reliance on global outsourcing and business processing strategy Burns has been betting on since 2009. Matter of fact, HP leading the way, Xerox is right up there to be the next in line to be another Kodac.
