Samsung tried making smaller screens with the Galaxy S2 Mini and the Mini S3. They had iPhone sized screens compared to their larger main lines. They had the same specs and price, they were just an inch smaller. Long story short, no one bought them and the Mini line tanked. Now Samsung only makes large phones and they are dominating the smartphone market in terms of phones sold.
