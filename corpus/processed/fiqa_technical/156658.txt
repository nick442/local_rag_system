"So many interesting points you raise .. I only have a minute, so: > the more technology that is created, the less privacy we have, the dumber we become and the more jobs we lose to automation I agree wholeheartedly with your first two points.. as far as the loss of jobs to automation, I'm not convinced that's a bad thing. Who exactly is happy spending 40 hours each week standing on a factory line or stocking shelves? I don't think that's a life anyone would choose if better options were available. Of course, that raises the thorny issue of ""better options being available."" :) I think that the loss of jobs to automation will raise complex issues that are not nearly as black and white - or *predictable* - as many seem to think they are. p.s. You're delightful to chat with!"
