The preapproval is the bank stating that they will loan you up to A with a down-payment of B for Y years at R rate. If you don't ned all the money that is great they will still give you the loan. You can keep the down-payment thew some amount of money or the same percentage of the purchase price whichever you want. For example: Preapproval of $200,000 and a down-payment of $50,000 (20%) allows you to buy a house for $250,000. But you find one for $240,000, you can either: Neither of these needs a new pre-approval. In both cases your monthly payment will be lower than the original loan was expected to be. If you want to change to $200K for the loan and $40K for the down payment. or in other words decrease the percentage of down-payment; you might run into an issue that the bank doesn't think you have enough of your own money in the deal. Or you may now require PMI where you didn't previously. In this case they will need to re-approve you. Now if the price goes up the bank could require more money down, or may need to re-evaluate the loan.
