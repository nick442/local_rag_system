I don't agree with that. As technology improves, less workers will be needed to maintain production. At some point, with automation, we might only need a small fraction of our current workers. Does that mean we should reduce our population in kind? Or perhaps we should start valuing people in society beyond the amount of work they can output. The genetic argument you're using doesn't really work because humans are mostly genetically identical. The superficial, like skin color, is superficial. Given similar situations, being taught similar things, having similar amounts of money, people act similarly and have similar abilities, no matter where you're from.
