Here's my opinion. Families are going to have to hang together more. Since employment is so unstable, they need a way to get through the bumps. Several adults (plus children) living like a clan can do this, and family ties help with the social problems. We already are seeing adult children staying at home now. Families need to build up capital too. In this new world, anyone who doesn't have some capital (i.e. a piece of the pie) is going to be an utter serf. If you're a serf, it's going to be extremely hard to build it up, most everything will go to just survival. Dividend or rent paying capital gives some independence. Families should prioritize working together to have some, even if it means sacrificing entertainment, eating out, etc.
