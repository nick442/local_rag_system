you're a moron. Under Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the top marginal rate was 95%. A progressive income tax like this is justified on two grounds: the wealthy have benefitted most from our system, and they are the best able to pay. With the revenue under the tax code in the 1950's, Eisenhower was able to afford a huge infrastructure project, building the U.S. interstate highway system. the wealthy assholes and their Republican crooks in Congress have destroyed the progressive income tax and thereby sharply reduced federal government revenues and federal government ability to pay for anything. The progressive income tax, as it existed under Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, should be restored to allow America to become great again.
