Iceland had slaves during their 'libertarian' period, so I don't particularly care to look to them as a cultural example. Don't know much about the libertarian societies in Ireland. I also don't romanticize Native American societies, either, which, on their smaller scale, had their own problems and violence. Also, I qualified examples with my last sentence, saying we haven't seen it work on a large scale yet, which, with a population in the billions, is the order of the day for now. >All this to say: Somolia isn't a valid argument against libertarianism. :) True enough. I just like to poke the sleeping bear sometimes, because honestly, I don't much respect anarcho capitalists, much in the same way I don't respect hardcore communists: it sounds great in theory, in reality it doesn't seem to work well when the rubber meets the road.
