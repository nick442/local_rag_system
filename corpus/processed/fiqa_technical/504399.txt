First, contact the new employer's HR or payroll dept, whoever handles this. You might be able to warn them that your wife deposited x$ already. If they can tell their system to stop deposits at ($16500 - x$), that would work. If not, she will need to arrange to withdraw the excess, and pay the tax that wasn't withheld. No penalty, though.
