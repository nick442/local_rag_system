You left out the part where I said cities use it as a source of revenue, meaning there are two factors at play. The city limiting the number of medallions drives up their auction price because there's high demand and the cab companies trying to extract enough profit from the medallion to be worth it. The city decides how many medallions to release, just like in NYC they auction off permits for hot dog vendors which are ironically similarly priced. Imagine for a moment they gave vendor licenses to everyone who wanted to open a stand in central park, you wouldn't even be able to see the park. I wouldn't really say it's fair to call it a stranglehold, more of wringing the last drop out of washcloth because you're dying of thirst. Personally, I think the medallion model is bullshit. In that sense, I'm all for a *regulated* free market, where supply and demand find an equilibrium within the rules. In reality, you only find the medallion model in large markets which isn't really representative of the taxi industry as a whole.
