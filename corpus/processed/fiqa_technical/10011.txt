"If you force people to pay into the system more, then you can spend more and still claim the deficit is decreasing. If you increase government spending without increasing government revenue, then the deficit increases. If you increase government spending while also increasing government revenue, then the deficit doesn't increase. But that doesn't mean shit. Government revenue is mainly taxes. And the middle class pays most of them. Hence, ""the middle class carry more"" line above."
