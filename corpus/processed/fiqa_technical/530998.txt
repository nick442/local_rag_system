''just how much of the troubled southern EU nations' debt is due to the rescuing of private banks? thanks'' My answer rambled onto related topics. In short, not much. While the actual sums involved in bank bailouts are considerable, relative to sovereign debts run up by having structural/trade deficits for ~10 years, they aren't the problem in Europe at the moment..but they ARE the tip of an Iceberg that could sink parts of the EU and leave the rest struggling to stay above water. An interesting question to ponder, with deceptively simple answers, is: If the % of sovereign debt resulting from bank bailouts is so small, why does the media and general public throw a fit every time a major EU bank gets into trouble? People are worried about losing their savings that they have with that bank. Its a visceral fear that is easy to personally relate to. But scratch below the surface and there is a whole buffet of terror for you to feast on. Assuming leverage of ~26* on assets held by banks and that true liabilities aren't completely opaque to average Joe retail investor, the collapse of the right bank could fire the starting gun on a vicious recession, trigger bailouts of other institutions exposed to the original and all sorts of nasty events. These bank assets include the mess created by rehypothecation, securitization of shitty credit/assets and CDS, commercial paper that relies on never having to be realized as a loss and interference in the money markets and currencys by states. Its damn hard to work out what assets and liabilities a bank has these days, let alone what any debt they have taken on is worth. Euro Crisis Best Crisis. *Pulled from memory, I'm not sure if this is accurate for Europe.
