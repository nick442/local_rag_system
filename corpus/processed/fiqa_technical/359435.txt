I don't think he did. I think he was saying lazy implies that people are not doing work or thought. He stated that, in fact, he believes people are fatigued because of overwork rather than lazing about. I would agree. I would like to go to the corner store and buy it, but there's a chance they won't have it. So why am I going to do that if I can eliminate a decision and instead buy it from something like Amazon?
