ODE is a math class, why would you need Physics for it? If anything taking ODE before Physics may help you understand whats going on behind some of the formulas you'll have to work with. The only time physics might be helpful in ODE is when you are modeling things like springs with differential equations. Knowing the basics of Hooke's law would make it easier to understand I guess. That's a really small part of ODE though.
