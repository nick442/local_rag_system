There is mad hat on this sub because he's a young black man. You should be ashamed. Sure it helps to him in this situation I don't doubt, but there is bias in many situations. I don't see how this kid is different then any other clothing line pusher. He made a good product, he marketed himself well and he found a good mentor. sounds like a recipe for success for almost anyone Good for him, he was very passionate about his bow ties and I hope he goes on to make many more millions and that everyone is rocking bow ties You are all some salty bastards that need to reflect on your jealousy of this 15 year old boy.
