Judging by your question, you seem to be a non-accredited investor. Under certain circumstances in some states, you may be able to sue the officers, directors, and other parties in control of the company for full rescission of your investment plus interest and attorneys' fees. You should consult with a locally licensed securities attorney to discuss your options.
