Whoa nobody is championing for *free* internet services. People don't want data caps and throttling. It's obvious that it's completely feasible and profitable to offer services like that without a monopolized control. But your argument hurts my brain. You say the government is the reason these monopolies exist. So your train of thought is to let it continue uncorrected? I'm as capitalist as they come but monopolies help nobody and only hurt the consumer.
