"What an articulated and persuasive argument coming from you! Seriously, just yes or no: 1. Do you think the ACA is good plan and a sustainable plan, yes or no? 2. Trump is pro National health care system, yes or no? 3. Is there a chance that Trump will fix the ACA to make it sustainable and better, yes or no? And if ""yes"" to the 3 questions, why are you so against fixing the ACA?"
