Yes, there is; you are correct. Once I register my phone to the WiFi, the store has access to my phone's IP address, so that's how they ultimately identify me. I just use a spurious email address because I do not want all the spam and advertisements sent to my email. If you haven't noticed, the minute you provide your email to a company, organization, etc., all of a sudden you start getting emails for random places (third-parties). I like you, Sarah. You're a sharp interlocutor that loves to confabulate. You keep me on my toes lol
