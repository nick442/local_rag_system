It's not a false dichotomy. the amount of radiation from the scanner is completely insignificant compared to that absorbed during the flight. The scan gives the same radiation as **2 minutes** at 30,000 feet. If you actually care about the amount of radiation that you get from the scanner, you would take the train. http://www.tampabay.com/news/politifact-radiation-of-airport-scans-less-than-the-dose-in-flight/1135857
