Quite a lot changed since back then, so I consider it highly unlikely that you could point to one single cause. You can think about it more clearly when you remove money from the equation. Know that money is only an intermediary in the exchange of goods, and it is in fact the exchanged goods that matter. So to reframe your question. You produce some goods and exchange them for the goods you consume. The amount of goods that you can exchange what you produced for determines your quality of life. So what parts could change? 1. you could actually produce less. The alledged increase in productivity is really hard to accurately measure because even if you know for a fact that one worker's producitivity increased when buying a machine, maybe that comes at a cost of less productivity in other areas. 2. Not everything that you pay for does actually increase your quality of life, for example speeding tickets don't. Other stuff might increase your quality of life but in a manner that you don't easily recognize. For example more prisoners that you pay for might reduce your chance of being mugged, however if you're not being mugged on a regular basis you wouldn't notice. 3. Other people get a higher percentage. Most countries' tax rates rise with rising income, so when the currency is being devalued, tax rates rise relative to your purchasing power in addition to other taxes and fees that might be introduced or increased. But even without government your bosses might simply take a bigger cut of the company's earnings. 4. We might produce the wrong stuff. If more stuff gets produced that you do not want. The production of the stuff you do want will decline even if total productivity is increased. And that is only what I can think of from the top of my head. You will probably find that all of those happen and most likely other causes as well.
