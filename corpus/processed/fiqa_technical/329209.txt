But this is the same for all businesses. Expenses suck, but their a part of doing business. This is such a predictable expense as well. Interestingly in Norway we have maternity/paternity leave that totals 12 months. Recently 3 months of this has been made into paternity leave only. This means that the risk of losing an employee for at least 3 months exists for both genders (while still the chance of a women being gone for longer is still higher). Realistically, many men take 6 months (and some even more).
