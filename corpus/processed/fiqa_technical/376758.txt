"Thank you for misunderstanding: >then I shudder to think what an explanation of how the price of money can be derived from plotting IS and LM together and extending it's meeting point into the money market to determine the price of currency would do to your notion of control by powerful offices in government. and embarking upon the very rant I knew you had in you. I am well aware of the Federal Reserve's purpose of controlling the money supply, as is everyone else. You are literally the last one to the party. Your mistaken feeling of superiority is derived from a position of complete ignorance. Your shock and outrage at the most simplistic of economic facts that have been the foundation for understanding international economics since the cold war represents a massive twisting of self education: you have wrested your way out of the dark pit of complete ignorance by reading up on how the economy works, but in a sorrowful twist you have learned this information from biased sources, perhaps the ""Abolish the Fed"" folks putting around, and instead of taking steps forward into understanding the world of finance you have flipped your lid and assume that you have somehow become Neo in The Matrix and have taken on a faux-intellectual persona in a desperate attempt to assert an identity of superiority over the masses of far more educated people around you who do not react with shock and outrage to things they already knew. **TLDR: You are just a smug asshole who has reacted to basic facts about the economy by incorporating them into making more credible tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, and I hate people like you because you distract from legitimate criticism of the international banking system by acting shocked by what you learned in Economics 101.**"
