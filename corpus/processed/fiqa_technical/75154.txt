I'm not quite sure what you're shooting for here.. if you're trying to determine that people put more thought into a $1000 purchase than a $1.50 purchase it might be helpful. I honestly can't tell you who the CEO of Coke (Dasani water) or Pepsi (Aquafina water) is. I can tell you that the CEO of HP has talked about getting out of the PC business and his actions in the purchase of and subsequent mismanagement of Palm would have an impact as to whether or not I'm confident in handing his company 1/2 a paycheck.
