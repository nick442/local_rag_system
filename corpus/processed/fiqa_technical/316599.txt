Ask to meet with different advisors, and talk with them. Treat it as in interview process, and do not just go with the first one that comes along. Make sure you ask about their fees, and get everything in writing. Pay close attention to the fine print; it is here where hidden fees exist. If you don't understand something, speak up and ask. It would be worth your time to investigate solutions outside of ML as well at, for example, Vanguard. Not every bank/investment firm is the same. Ask if the wealth management is a fiduciary, meaning they legally must have YOUR best interest in mind when making financial decisions with your money. This is definitely not a requirement everywhere, which can ultimately have lasting impacts in terms of wealth appreciation and even preservation.
