"> Canyonaros Eh, not really at all. When I was a kid everyone was buying Suburbans, Navigators, Explorers, Durangos, Sequoias. Big body on frame SUV's that got 15mpg combined. Most of the stuff selling nowadays is Pilots, RAV4's, CRV's, Sorentos, Compass or other FWD CUV's. They're not the pinnacle of gas mileage efficiency but most will get a full 10mpg higher than the monster SUV's of the 90's/2000's. Bracing for incomming ""my mega-sized SUV always got 25mph always even when towing my trailer, bass boat and with 10 passengers inside"" and ""these modern crossover crapboxes don't get the mileage they say they do"". Sorry, your V10 Navigator doesn't get better mileage than a 4cylinder Civic with a 6 inch taller roofline."
