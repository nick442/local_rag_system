I've grown up and lived in California almost my whole life. I pay taxes. Our system is horribly corrupt and built to empower big property owners. Young couples tend to pay many times higher taxes than older people who are living in comparable homes. Proposition 13 was pushed through by landlord associations. If we did away with it an replace it with a fair and equitable system we could solve many of our funding problems.
