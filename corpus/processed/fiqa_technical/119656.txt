The salary of a coal miner with a couple years of experience is $29/hour. After a couple years at Arby's a good worker might make shift supervisor at $10/hr. Thousands of products are made from coal including pharmaceuticals, soap, dyes, solvents, plastics, nylon, and carbon fibers. Miners would still be needed even if coal wasn't used for energy. Fast food workers could disappear tomorrow and we'd just be healthier.
