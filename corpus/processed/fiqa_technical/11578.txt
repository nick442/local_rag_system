If you don't like the cartel extorting you, you should just leave. So cartels are moral, right? A: I shouldn't have to leave just because thugs say they run land. They don't own the land I'm on, private persons do. Those people should be the ones saying whether or not I can be there. B: I actually can't leave for free. The US government dictates the terms under which I can leave. Currently, it would cost me some 12k to repudiate my citizenship. Oh, and the government can and does change those terms *at any time* without me having the ability to asset or dissent. How is it voluntary if it's entirely unilateral?
