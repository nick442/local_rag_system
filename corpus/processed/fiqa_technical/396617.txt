">Those ""resources"" are often employees Yes labor is also a scarce resource. But just like other resources it needs to be used in a way that is most productive. If the govt spends $100k hiring two people to dig holes and then refill them, those two people are employed, but there is no production there. That $100k contributed to no productive growth and created no wealth for anyone. The two businessmen who did not get loans for their business would have to seek employment with another entrepreneur who could put their labor to more productive use. >No, only the base rate is set centrally. Exactly, but the bank's rates are reliant on the federal funds rate"
