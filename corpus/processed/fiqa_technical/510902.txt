People seem to ignore the massive cost to bottle, test and distribute the water. Sure, the water itself doesn't cost anything, it's the process of delivering a drinkable bottle of water to you that adds the value. Don't get me wrong profits are too high, but I think the fact that the water is pennies is a narrow minded view. Many foods we buy cost very little, as they grow wild in nature, but harvesting, packaging and distributing is what drives up that cost. Not to mention the restrictions they have to follow to ensure safe(ish) foods.
