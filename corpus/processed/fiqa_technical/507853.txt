You will normally have somewhere to designate which tax year you are contributing for when you make your contribution (either online or at the bank). This designation is only required from Jan 1 - Apr 15 of each year, as any contributions before / after those dates will necessarily be for the calendar year that you contribute. You must make sure that your tax forms (1040 and anything else) show your total contribution for the tax year. If you've put $1000 into your Roth IRA during the calendar year for 2010, and then you put in $2000 in March 2011 (but designated for 2010), you need to show the IRS that you put $3000 into your Roth IRA. As stated in another answer, the advantage is increasing the overall contribution limit in your lifetime. If you open a brand new Roth IRA in March 2011, you can contribute $5000 for 2010 and another $5000 for 2011. If you open the same account in May 2011, you are limited to only $5000 for 2011.
