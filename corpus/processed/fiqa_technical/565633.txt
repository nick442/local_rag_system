The 'unequal' treatment is to attempt to correct somewhat for the far-more-unequal treatment from the actual economic system. Obviously you fight inequality by countering that inequality. I'm not sure how you think you fight inequality otherwise. Edit: And the reason McDonalds doesn't do it is because they don't have an interest in equality or the good of the citizens as a whole, they're driven by a profit motive. The entire point of the government is that it doesn't have a profit motive so it can act on behalf of citizens.
