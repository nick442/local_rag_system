"That's the key to modern finance: removing undesirable conditions until the model outcome supports the desired policy or sales pitch. We're safe because our model says so, and if it doesn't, change the model until it does. Anything that negatively affects the outcome is an ""anomaly"" - that anomalies are unavoidable, and will recur, is just an inconvenience better left out."
