Also I think everyone forgets that a lot of the time U.S. Bonds are the ONLY place to park money. Where else can someone invest 1.5 trillion? I think between the bond yields and inflation rate, China isn't really making a profit on this investment. Better to lose a little than a lot I guess. The problem with the U.S. is that they don't use this profitable scheme to pay down debt.
