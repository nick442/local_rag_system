I'm glad you didn't say they were the only causes of the bubble, and I hope you didn't mean to. But I won't argue that those were not partially to blame. I also won't say I personally was not partially to blame. Now, I certainly don't want to defend the banks, at least not a lot of them, but I disagree with some of your assertions. For one thing, they are getting blamed for making loans to readily available, and now they are being blamed (not by you) for **not** making the money readily available. Have you financed any homes? If so, did you just go to a bank and get a loan? I'm sure some people do that, but I don't know anyone who ever has. I go to a loan agent, and get a much cheaper loan. And I think part of the problem is that many of these agents have only one overriding objective - to enable you to qualify for a loan, so they can get their commission. They know all the rules and reasons people get turned down, so they play the system and get people loans who should not get them. I don't really think the banks are blameless, as they allow this, and in many cases, know about it (unofficially). But I don't think it's a conspiracy by the banks; I think the banks were simply naive and thought that the past was a good indicator or the future, so the loans were safe because they would get the house if the owner defaulted, and the house would be worth at least the value of the equity the owner had after the down payment. Lots of people made mistakes on both sides. You can call it a conspiracy if you want, but I've found that most conspiracy theories were simply not real. Other than that, I totally agree with you. :)
