Why do you think it would be easier to defeat a civil insurrection? It's pretty sad you think the people fighting in those countries are dumber then the American soliders (who by the way are mostly there as a result of being to stupid to do anything else), living a less impressive lifestyle doesn't make you stupid, it makes you a victim of circumstance. That aside, context is important, USA has more toys on US soil than the middle east, so you'll be bringing a gun to a drone fight, they would be fighting in territory they have comprehensively mapped using the largest communications collections framework in the world. The leaders of any militia would be found and killed in hours if the entire weight of the US government were looking for them. But hey, you hold onto your AR15, I'm sure it can deal with a whatever the government has..
