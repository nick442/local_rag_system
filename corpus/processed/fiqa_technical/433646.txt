"In these situations, one solution is to use the ""I was just about to ask you the same thing.."" response. This is kind of a famous way to deal with people asking you for money, whether it's someone asking to borrow ""$10 at lunch time"" or ""$3000 for a car"" or the like. So: Person X asks you for money, say $2000. Your reply: Ah, that's bad luck, I was just about to ask you the same thing.. Follow this immediately - just keep talking - by launching in to a really incredibly detailed discussion of why you need to borrow money (pick a slightly larger amount, slet's ay $3500). Just ""keep talking"" and don't let the other person get a word in. Go in to great detail about just what you need the $3500 for and why. It's a good trick."
