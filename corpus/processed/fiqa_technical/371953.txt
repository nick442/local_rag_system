Thank you for your service and sorry to hear about your experience. I have a number of family and friends who had varying levels of civilian career success upon leaving. Some good, some bad. They all came out stronger-willed, confident, some with college (that was mostly paid for) and with other transferable skills that made them stand our from their civilian counterparts.
