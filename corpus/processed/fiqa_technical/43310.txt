(/u/what_comes_after_q & /u/md___2020 - I thought you might appreciate this too). While GE lost it's financial discipline in the 2000s, in the '90s and '80s GE was a supreme integrator of acquired businesses. [Here is a 1998 Harvard Business Review case study on GE.](https://hbr.org/1998/01/making-the-deal-real-how-ge-capital-integrates-acquisitions) > Lesson 1: Acquisition integration is not a discrete phase of a deal and does not begin when the documents are signed. Rather, it is a process that begins with due diligence and runs through the ongoing management of the new enterprise. > Lesson 2: Integration management is a full-time job and needs to be recognized as a distinct business function, just like operations, marketing, or finance. > Lesson 3: Decisions about management structure, key roles, reporting relationships, layoffs, restructuring, and other career-affecting aspects of the integration should be made, announced, and implemented as soon as possible after the deal is signedâ€”within days, if possible. Creeping changes, uncertainty, and anxiety that last for months are debilitating and immediately start to drain value from an acquisition. > Lesson 4: A successful integration melds not only the various technical aspects of the businesses but also the different cultures. The best way to do so is to get people working together quickly to solve business problems and accomplish results that could not have been achieved before.
