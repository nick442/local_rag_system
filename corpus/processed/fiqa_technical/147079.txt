Vaccines do not confer a 100% immunity to anything. They simply bolster your immune system, and different ones are effective to different extents. If your immune system has been recently compromised, there are some things that you can catch despite being vaccinated. Herd immunity is a valid concept. If a large enough portion of the population is vaccinated, there won't be enough infections active at any given time to pose a real risk of catching people who might be unlucky enough to have otherwise contracted it.
