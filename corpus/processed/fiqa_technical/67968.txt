As someone who works on the sell side, I can tell you you're partially right. Yes, we do make money off of trades (so just getting people to trade gets the company money) but we do try to be right. We like to look at overall trends with growth projections and earnings estimates, and (as long as the analyst isn't a bad one) will try to get the right answer. Often, we try to present different angles to the research and aren't afraid to go out on a limb--so that you'll read it. We like being right though. The reason we like to be right and make people understand that we know what is going on is simple: a company won't respect research if it's bullshit. And that goes for trading and buy side firms, but also from the companies involved in the research. For an investment bank, a large chunk (often over 50%) of revenue comes from M&A deals, and often a company will choose to do a deal with companies they know will give a good value-that come's from their first experience with the company-equity research. So yes, we don't like to beat up on companies, but we do want to be right. If the analyst has that bad a rate of success, he's probably pretty bad or you're looking at an industry where nobody saw some huge shift coming. Edit: Oh, and analysts can't buy or sell any company in their sector (I think this is industry-wide, not just my firm)
