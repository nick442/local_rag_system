"Yep, all of these are correct. I sat down and thought about the ""Money can't buy happiness"" line, and at the end of the day it's only correct in the strictest sense. No, nobody is selling joy at the market. You can't go down to the 7-11 and pick up a box of jubilation. You know what, though? Money allows you to do pretty much whatever DOES make you happy. Derive joy from picking on a guitar? Well, if you're fucking filthy rich, you can buy dozens of 'em and do it all damned day if you want. Okay, but what if you're depressed -- what if it's a brain chem thing? Well, if it can be fixed, you can get it fixed with money. Doctors, prescriptions, etc. all cost. I thought about it for a good while, and came to the conclusion that while having tons of money may not reduce the amount of problems I have (it may actually increase them), the vital difference is that none of the problems I'd have if I were rich are actually terribly important. Every problem I could think of ended up being stuff like, ""Well, I'd have to do a lot of research to figure out exactly the best place to build my fuck-off huge house"" or ""Gee, would it be better to rebuild my vehicle to my exact specs, or simply spend time finding an expert and giving them a guideline and hoping it turns out?"" At the end of the day, if you have a shit-ton of money, you can always just tell your troubles to take a flying leap and worry about them another time, ignore them forever, or _pay someone else_ to deal with them. There are a few exceptions, but every single fucking one of them would be worse if you weren't loaded."
