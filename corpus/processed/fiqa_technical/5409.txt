"I'm sorry, I find it hard to believe that a prestigious firm would just ""give"" out work to some random person to do for free. The companies he's trying to get into aren't some mom and pop shops, and you don't ""infiltrate"" them by being friendly with janitors. I'm not saying your advice is bad. I just don't think it applies to MBB."
