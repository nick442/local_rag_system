No shot. Bezos already tried to engage Apoorva and he basically told him to shove off so maybe but I assume Amazon is going to tell them to get fucked Actually, they might have been included (or at least that percentage) but its going to be a discount because of the overall size of the deal. Anyway you cut it, IC just lost their biggest competitive advantage to a direct competitor overnight.
