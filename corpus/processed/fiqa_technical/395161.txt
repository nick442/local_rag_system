Hopefully some Economist will answer this question I have about ZeroHedge. I see all these terrible news about the economy going to hell and the world economy is going to go into another great depression or some kind of disaster. **How reputable is this source and should I take all the negative things so seriously? Are there any information that they are skewing?**
