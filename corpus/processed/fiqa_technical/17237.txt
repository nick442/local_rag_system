"Yellow taxis and Ubers in NYC are TWO TOTALLY different tiers of cabs. I think you're confused with Uber vs Local Car Service companies: which BOTH are FHV vehicles (TLC). Yellow taxis are the only cabs that can pick up street hails (which what the medallion is for.) Uber and all FHV vehicles (including local car service/limo companies) are strictly on a pre-arraigned booking contingent through the base. An Uber can never pick up a street hail. And, contrast, yellow cabs will never be ""phoned"" to pick up. I think you need to research the amount of FHV vehicles there have been since the 60's. That number has always been higher than yellow taxis. Get yer facts straight!!"
