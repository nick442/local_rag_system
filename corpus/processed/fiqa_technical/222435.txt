I weigh myself every day. Every day. I measure my body fat % every few weeks. If I deviate from my ideal weight, I take corrective measures. I train in a way designed to keep my metabolism high. Most importantly, I've made a healthy way of living a habit and a lifestyle. No crash diets. No insane gym schedules. Plenty of cheat days. It was my decision to be fat, and it was my decision to fix it. If I get fat again, then it will be the culmination of my own bad decisions.
