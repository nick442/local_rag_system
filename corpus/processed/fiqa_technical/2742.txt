The other day, I was catching up on some saved articles while sitting next to my girlfriend on the couch. I was reading [Levine's article](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-08-12/biotech-firm-didn-t-enjoy-its-six-days-as-a-public-company) about the failed Vascular Biogenics IPO and kept literally laughing out loud. My girlfriend asked what was so funny so I read her this bit; > I was a capital markets banker for four years, and a corporate lawyer before that, and today I did a thing I've never done before, which is read an underwriting agreement. Nobody reads underwriting agreements! The point of an underwriting agreement is for junior lawyers to get practice using track changes in Word. I don't think I've ever seen a more disinterested stare from her, but I don't care, that shit is hilarious.
