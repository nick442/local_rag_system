"I cannot definitively say this is illegal, but we'll apply some cold hard logic to it: If this were as easy as it sounds, why aren't they using their own account/card instead of yours? Ask them this question directly. They will probably say something along the lines of ""I don't have a card"" or try to guilt you into doing it. You should do two things: Tell them no. Report them to the police/the bank/etc. In all likelihood, they will end up doing something illegal or they are laundering money. When push comes to shove, you will be the one the police come after asking questions. They have complete deniability as it is your card. This is no different than the ""Cash this big check and send me half of it"" scams that are common."
