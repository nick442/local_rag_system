"The percentage of market share alone isn't determinative of whether an illegal monopoly exists, and it's theoretically possible to violate antitrust law with as little as 50% market share. Specifically U.S. courts have interpreted the Sherman Antitrust Act, Section Two, to mean that [""A market share greater than 75 percent indicates monopoly power, a share less than 50 percent does not, and shares between 50 and 75 percent are inconclusive in and of themselves.""](http://law.jrank.org/pages/10247/Sherman-Anti-Trust-Act-Monopolies.html)"
