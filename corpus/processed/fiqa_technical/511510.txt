"The reason that stock buybacks are not considered insider trading is because the offers are open to all on equal terms to everyone outside the company. Even if the company knows ""inside"" information, it's not supposed to tell it (and company executives are not allowed to tender shares, unless they had previously set up a ""blind"" selling program on a""schedule."") If that's actually the case, no one investor is better informed than another, and hence there is no insider trading. The issue of inside trading is that ""insiders"" ARE better informed."
