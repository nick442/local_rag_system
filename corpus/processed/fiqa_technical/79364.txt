Hurricanes are not good for the economy. They might be good for GDP, but GDP is not a good measure of the economy in cases of natural disasters. [The increase in GDP is due to rebuilding and replacing things that existing prior to the disaster](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-hurricanes-are-not-good-for-the-economy-2017-08-28). There is no increase in the size of the economy or improvements in living standards.
