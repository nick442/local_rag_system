"I'm *really* surprised to see Schwab as ""only"" #5. They don't specialize in ""niche"" ETFs, but for the core ""lazy portfolio"" style ETFs, I've always considered them neck-and-neck with Vanguard. That said - There's nothing wrong with obscure players in the market! I'd rather they had more exposure and therefore lower ERs, but the fact that something like $BBC *can* exist makes me sooo happy! That's pretty much my personal ""ultra high risk"" basket in one convenient form!"
