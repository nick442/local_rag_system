This merger will be approved because there is not a monopoly on Internet access. (Fast Internet access, on the other hand..) Comcast and Time Warner do not substantially directly compete geographically. This map shows this. Thus, in the eyes of the regulatory bodies and the courts, competition for most *consumers* is not reduced because they do not have access to both Comcast and Time Warner. I'm not saying that this merger is a good idea, just why it will likely be approved. Downvote me anyway.
