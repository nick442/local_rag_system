"Talking about counterfactuals is hard. The thing is, while these events are hard to predict far out at a micro-detailed level, climate scientists have predicted that such storms would and will happen with increasing frequently such that I'm not sure it's fair to say ""would have"" except in someone's fantasy world where climate isn't happening. Increasingly, these will define the fabric of our existence. When Miami floods, will we say ""housing prices would have been up but for the flooding""? When crops fail, will we say ""crop yields would have been great but for the droughts/floods/heat wave/insect infestation/death of bumblebees""? Or will we at some point acknowledge that these are things as real as cybersecurity that we must build into our infrastructure and that must not be apologized for as ""one time expenses"" but must be seen as ""chronic costs"", even ""chronic pressures on cost with escalating frequency and power""?"
