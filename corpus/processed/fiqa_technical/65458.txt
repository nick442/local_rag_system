>We should expect the courts to be less corruptible because their proceedings take place in public, Why would we expect that? Reality doesn't really suggest that. You also completely ignore how money can (without actually corrupting the court) 'win' you a case. Money allows you to bury a litigant in the law itself. You see it time and time again in environmental lawsuits. Sheer wealth alone is enough to win many cases and avoid prosecution to begin with in many other cases. Dragging it out for years. The average person will have little chance (as they already do) in tackling the larger issues via the court system. And in fact many of the larger cases in this country *don't* happen completely in public. And removing the government won't change that. As for the banks and banksters..the *banks* may have been broke by now without government involvement. The *bankers* themselves would still be wealthier than most of humanity. >Small government that debates everything in the open It's the transparency that's the issue. A big government that debated everything in the open would have most of the same positives and negatives. So would a medium government.
