"I recommend you ask her if her sponsor/leadership has said something like ""if your friends don't agree with you (or say no) then they're not your friends and you should move on"". If so, it's not much of a stretch to apply the above to all her relationships (including you). Many years ago when I was deep down the MLM rabbit-hole I had 'leadership' say the above line many times. They're leaches, preying on the vulnerable. Teaching the teachers to teach? Nope, teaching the leachers to leach."
