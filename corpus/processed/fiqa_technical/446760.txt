"You don't ""prove a model incorrect"". That's not how this type of statistical modeling works. This isn't cognitive dissonance, it's understanding what statistics tells us. If I look at a model that takes a bunch of inputs from two football teams and the inputs tell me the expected numbers of yards, touchdowns, etc over 1000 different simulations, and gives me that over those 1000 different simulations that 750 of them is in favor of team A. When team B wins this doesn't prove a model wrong in a one shot game, it proves that one of those 750 times out of 1000 didn't occur. In this case it's especially interesting because, continuing with the analogy, the yardage was almost near correct (popular vote) just the areas of the field that yardage came from differed slightly. This election was, essentially, when one team out gains the other, but loses due to the exact wrong play in the wrong area of the field. Again, you clearly don't understand how this works, or the definition of cognitive dissonance, for that matter."
