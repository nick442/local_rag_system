"Did anyone in your family die and leave you to take care of kids you didn't bring into the world? Did a random accident leave you disabled in any way or maybe just in chronic pain? Did you have a loved one become disabled and unable to take care of themselves? No disrespect to working hard and saving your money. I agree with that. And I commend you for doing it. But ""Plan your life and live below your means"" is a mighty useless piece of advice to people who are having a tough time making ends meet - sometimes through not fault of their own."
