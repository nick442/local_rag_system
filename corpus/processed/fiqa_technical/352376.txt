I've had a few buy ins at 2-400, done nothing until it came in the news. I sold a few coins 800 before it hit 1000 the first time, I sold 20 coins at 1600 this last time (and then saw it keep going..) I planed on buying back in after it crashed but it's been holding tight so. The actual markets seem like insane bubbles with endless new ICOs. I've thus stayed away from them.
