"But when you focus just on taxes on work, as the OECD does in a new report out this morning, the U.S. starts looking a little less like a low-tax paradise. The total ""tax wedge"" -- which measures ""the difference between labour costs to the employer and the corresponding net take-home pay of the employee"" -- was 31.7 percent of labor costs for the average single U.S. worker with no children in 2016, higher than in 10 other OECD countries. https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-11/why-the-u-s-overtaxes-labor https://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/taxRates.html"
