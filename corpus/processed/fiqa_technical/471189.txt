No, it's not illegal. I think the point is that the largest company in the world with billions in profits doesn't pay its workers enough money. All of us pay for that shortcoming in Wal-Mart corporate policy. It's not a legal issue, no. It's a *moral* issue. Unfortunately, the only political movement that favors fixing this kind of thing and wants to strengthen the power of **unions** are those on the left. The very people that would benefit greatly from a union are the people who wouldn't want to be caught dead agreeing with dirty lefty hippie Negro communist Muslims. The left can't do it all by itself; everyone involved needs to come together. Right-wing, anti-union forces (like FOX News; there are many, many others) work very hard and are very successful in killing the very idea of unionization. So it's a non-starter.
