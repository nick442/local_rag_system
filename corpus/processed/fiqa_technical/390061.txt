>I would much rather have my money in an up-trend. Damn right. Or at least have it liquid. We couldn't sell this house now, even though it's one of the best in the neighborhood. (The nice, but smaller, house across the street has been on the market for over a year.) A few other houses in the neighborhood didn't seem to have any problems being rented, though, so we could likely get rental income from this one if we wanted.
