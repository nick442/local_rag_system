>That doesn't exist any more. This is false. The GSE Sallie Mae buys student loans from other banks, meaning the banks offload their risk to Sallie Mae. If Fannie/Freddie has taught us anything, is that the government will [come to the rescue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_takeover_of_Fannie_Mae_and_Freddie_Mac) if things go south. In a way, the bailouts have shown that the government is backing *all* loans. Second, students cannot discharge their student loans through bankruptcy, as easily as other loans. As long as this is true the risk is reduced for the creditors. If that were allowed, and students began defaulting on their loans (at the expense of their credit), then the assets tied to those loans become worthless, and the banks holding the loans go under, which will probably prompt some massive government/Fed bailout. >Student homes are not like home loans Every bubble is different, but they all end the same way. Cheap credit created by the government results in malinvestments and loans that cannot be paid back. The bubble will pop and the lenders will not get paid back.
