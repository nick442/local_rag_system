Wal-mart pays their employees so little, many of the workers need to be on foodstamps, in fact, the store has programs helping their workers apply for foodstamps. Are you ok with that? The only reason wal-mart gets away with paying them so little is because the government is basically propping them up by paying the employees the missing part of their salary that actually allows them to survive on the shitty pay they give..
