- The scenarios I presented were precisely at expiry - I know it is very unlikely to be in the money at expiry, hence my hesitation to actually take the position - My math is accurate. At expiry January 18th, **2019** if TSLA is at 0$ a share (BK), then my puts will be worth a combined $500,000. - Side note. These expire January 2019. Just making sure you know.
