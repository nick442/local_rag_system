I agree with the principles, but the reality is far different on the ground. We are still moving further and further into hard skills for recruiting, because that is all HR drones know how to do. If we want more well rounded people, we need to change the way we evaluate people, rather than just looking for boxes to check. Unfortunately I suspect the vast majority of these phantom liberal arts jobs will simply be filled by cherry picked Ivy leaguers and those with the right connections, because that is basically how it is done now.
