Well not 100% the sooner production is stopped the better (which is what China is doing) it's WORSE for the environment to replace still running gasoline cars with EVs due to the carbon footprint of production. Stop production ASAP, run gas cars until they die natural deaths, and ban them when almost no one has a running one.
