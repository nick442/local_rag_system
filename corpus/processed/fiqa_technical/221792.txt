Cut back where exactly? Cut out 100% of social spending and you still have a deficit. So we cut back 20% of every Program including military, we now break even. 10s of millions now homeless and dying, unemployed, and starving. Or the 500 companies who make 1 trillion after taxes you make them pay for the deficit.
