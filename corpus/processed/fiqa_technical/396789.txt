I see this as less conspiratorial than the housing market shenanigans because auto manufacturers really have no other choice but to make financing easier because if they didn't, they wouldn't be selling many cars and trucks. The 2008 financial meltdown happened mainly because of derivatives. I don't know of any packaged bonds or CDOs made up of auto loans with credit default swaps riding on their backs. So, a wave of defaulted auto loans just means that it will become a buyers market for used cars - if not another signpost of general American economic collapse.
