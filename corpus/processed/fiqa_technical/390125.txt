Correction: Myspace didn't buy Facebook. And that was possibly the death of MySpace. This is disrupting themselves so someone else doesn't do it, you have to admit they have picked winners thus far. Match.com - serious dater OkCupid.com - freemium model Tinder - mobile apps I mean if you're not on one of those apps and you're doing online dating you're in a niche. Let alone their other less mainstream sites, which gives them near 100% market penetration. I think it's pretty impressive. They are outsourcing R & D and just buying innovation and based on their success stories it seems to be working for them. I might be bias, I met my wife on OKC.
