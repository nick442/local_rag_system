"I have never got my head around how they managed to sell a personal photo blog website for billions of dollars, how they came up with that fart in a bag valuation is a testament to how finance people understand technology. Its going to be hilarious watching the face of the person left hold the stock in the end, because the break up value of this company is going to be a couple of servers, storage and a fucking web page and terabytes of photos of lonely desperate people. And what really creeps me out is how can educated people in this day and age put all of their personal pics and info out there on the internet and knowing the ilk this Suckerberg belongs to, becoming part of that data base with names addresses and picture, and the ever nauseating updates . . .""Hey . .my darling wife is taking a shit and I just want to let her know I lover her"" ""Oh sweety . .I just let out a real soggy wet fart . . .my darling . .can't wait to be out of the bathroom and with you again soon"" Its just so desperate"
