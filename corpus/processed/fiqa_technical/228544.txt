They want cheap food so people can afford it.. If they only approved the most high quality food most people wouldn't be able to afford it. For most of human history people have eaten far less sanitary things than we eat now. Yes now we have crap processed food thats cheap and isn't healthy but thats because humanity literally NEEDS it to sustain our current population. Tough situation but get rid of cheap food that is mass produced and you'll starve swaths of the population that rely on it for sustenance. There simply isn't enough of a supply chain network built out to produce enough fresh fruit vegetables and protein sources to feed everyone on a low budget.
