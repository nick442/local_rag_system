College= 12786 grand a quarter = 38358 grand a year. Got loans of 5640.00 and scholarships of 5976.00 so leaves me 26742.00. Family is expected to put in that amount. Family dose not make a lot. Does not live high on the hog. I want to live a dream that I know I can work for but how do I pay. BTW I got the first 2 years covered with scholarships and military benefits. Dad put in his time so I could do this. I need advice. I will apply for things. I work every summer in jobs where I do see the wealthy enjoy the sport and not the grunt work. I go to a school where the wealthy go and they get the scholarships but they honestly can afford to not. If you pay 40 plus grand for a horse you don't need the 25 grand scholarship. They are lucky I know I have to work and I will; just need more advice on how to cover the cost of the dream :):)
