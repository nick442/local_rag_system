AFAIK, in the USA, as long as you're beneath a staff threshold of something like 13 people (correct me if someone knows the exact number), you can willfully discriminate in hiring however you damn well please. Makes sense to me. If you have a tiny business, one person being out for 3 months can have a massive impact. Not simply one fewer maze rat in the cube farm at GE.
