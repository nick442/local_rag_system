Hopefully is a very good term. It remains a fact because in the current scenario of low growth, companies don't see much of a reason to invest, and all evidence points agrees. So what are companies doing with all the extra cash they are getting from the rich? They are either buying back their own shares (which is a divestment), or they are doing mergers and buyouts, which are both at record highs at the moment. Here too evidence points that neither of these are actual productive activities. Share buy backs only inflate the share price without actually changing the market cap, as there are less shares in the market. Mergers have a strong track record of being expensive and ultimately bad investments that do more to erode value than they do to increase it. Then of course, there are the fees from the finance industry that are from these investments, share buy backs, and mergers that are just added into the spinning wheel without actually impacting the real economy.
