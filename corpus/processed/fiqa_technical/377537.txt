Well I was trying to describe it very generally because I think if other people heard the idea especially on an business thread the idea would be taken easily. And the idea came to me about a month ago and I guess I didn't explain well but I was wondering what kind of homework I need to research. My intention was for people to give me an idea of where to start. I've already started to write out a business plan I just didn't know if there were places to go to find people to invest into it or not. And I'm totally fine with criticism and what not but the way he came out was actually humorous to me, to call someone's idea bad when you don't know what it is is just silly. Snapchat seemed like a stupid idea in my opinion. Why would I only want to see someone's picture for 10 seconds and it goes away forever? But hey that turned into gold. So you never know what can be successful and not these days and how are you supposed to find out without taking the risks and going for it. So I guess a specific question is, if I write a business plan, what is my next step, who do I show it to?
