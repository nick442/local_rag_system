"She can't afford the house she's living in either. A $2,200 payment is about a $400K to well over half a million dollar home depending on her interest rate. Her housing costs should be at most 30% of her take home income, which is about $1,020 and would ***ONLY*** allow her to be able to afford to share a multi-bedroom apartment in Santa Cruz. Homes start in the $400K Range in that areas and go into the (tens of) millions of dollars. The $700/ month loan issue is bad but that house is going to be the final nail in the coffin the moment home repairs need to be done and she can't afford to do them. Personally I gave up trying to make the housing situation work out here in the Bay Area. My rent is jumping from $2,300 to $2,600 next month right over the hill in Santa Clara. I decided to buy a decent, modest, house in a great city the Midwest. Mortgage before property taxes and insurance is only $1,100. Out here in California it would be valued at an $800K to $900K home easily with close to a $5,500 mortgage payment. No thanks. If anything these articles are a good example of people playing fast and loose with their personal finances. The woman in the article is simply living beyond her means. Credit lets you pretend that you're of larger means than you really are for only so long. I made the choice to fund my retirement and pay off a home, rather than sunshine and close proximity to the beach. As the woman in the article mentioned: >""I will be working *for as long as I'm employable*. I will never be able to retire, At her age it may not be very long until she finds herself unemployable. She's right about never retiring, she spent her retirement living some place she couldn't afford to live, while obtaining an education she couldn't afford to pay for."
