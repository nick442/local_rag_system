>There is absolutely no reason why David Siegel, or any other parasite, deserves to make his outlandish gains at the expense of their host organism. Of course the parasite's philosophy is that it worked hard to establish its privileged place within the host body, and it is morally wrong for the host to try to starve it of resources. But that philosophy does not translate to the host. If you have a tapeworm, you get it removed. It's not your problem if the tapeworm dies, because you never agreed to let it inhabit your gut in the first place. Sounds like the argument for communism or perhaps socialism?
