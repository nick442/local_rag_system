I suppose that's true and it would eventually level out. But again, that's pure speculation, especially given the history of TSLA et al. Typically, when we talk about market irrationality, we are thinking of companies that don't just simply have huge PE ratios but also companies with no history suggesting this will ever change. TSLA is like that. Sure there are plenty of companies out there that have giant PE ratios but they also have a history of delivering on promises and growing profits. TSLA doesn't have that history so it makes you wonder why people believe anything will ever be different for the nearterm. It's really just pure speculation. Especially with how TSLA constantly under delivers on forecasts. Nothing wrong with losing money as a start up or even as a more mature company exploring new horizons, but TSLA goes beyond that as just a trainwreck of an investment. They heavily utilize gov't subsidies and continue to lose money--meanwhile their CEO is in dreamland trying to build a Hyperloop, create revolutionary batteries, automate consumer and commercial vehicles, stop AI, explore nuclear fusion, and a shitload more.
