"> http://www.economist.com/node/654077 I appreciate the link but it doesn't support your position that rich descendants squander their fortunes. It repeats your ""shirtsleeve"" saying (evening admitting it is only a saying) and then talks about how it is easier for Americans to invest and preserve that wealth. > Only 4% of dynasties survive 4 generations. Your article does say this but you've rephrased it so it sounds like the fourth generation is wiped out. A family business does not survive 4 generations but that doesn't mean the descendants are now poor. Hell, this entire article is advice to abandon the family business and diversify investments to make the most money. > John Rockefeller was a rich man and his descendants are paupers. You said Rockefeller but your link was for Vanderbilts. Both of these families gave a lot to charities. Bill Gates is planning to leave almost nothing to his kids but that doesn't mean the kids squandered their dad's money."
