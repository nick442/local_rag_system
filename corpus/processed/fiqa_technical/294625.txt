> is there anything that Excel on a Mac will really put me at a disadvantage? Yes. Dozens of things. Solver, for the most basic. Get Windows/Boot Camp or virtualization software for Windows like VMWare or Parallels. Excel on Mac (and office, in general) is garbage and vastly inferior to the Windows version. The b-school at my undergrad flat out refused to allow students to use Excel for Mac.
