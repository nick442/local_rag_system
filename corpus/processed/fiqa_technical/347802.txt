What a lot of people do not know about the SEC is they do a piss poor job of collecting. They are a creditor in a civil case and do not have the same powers as say the IRS. They usually win cases because it is easier to settle with a Federal Lawyer who is taking you Federal Court and proving innocence in a civil trial is hard where as proving guilt in a Federal Criminal case is easier. They get settlement, get PR, move on.
