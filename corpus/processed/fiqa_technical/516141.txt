"Ah, shit.. sorry to hear all that.. been there, done that. The number of idiots in middle and upper management never ceases to amaze me. Nor does the extent of the fiascoes and messes they manage to create, or the amount of money they manage to piss away in the process. (I've cleaned up more than my share, typically on a shoestring {and without all that much reward} -- alas, it's become somewhat of a ""special skill"" -- the downside of which is that once I get the mess all cleaned up and everything working like a clock.. I get bored out of my mind). So you have my sympathies. Best wishes in finding a new work-home. (And keep running a tight personal-financial ship, it not only allows you to be a bit more confident in life {knowing you don't have to fear some individual or corporate jackasses' self-destruction}, but eventually it allows you to say ""F U"" to the whole mess.) Cheers!"
