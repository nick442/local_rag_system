"The answer is simple - those six people represent the *company* and their best interests. They retain all of the records of why they've fired 200+ people, and have every T dotted and I crossed. When it comes to lawsuit time, they will be there to make sure the *company* comes out on top. I know it says ""Human resources"" but read those words closely..you are a resource, human. They are there to manage obtaining that resource until it is no longer useful. It's sad, but it's also true. HR is not your friend."
