"But these are companies just like Samsung, Nike and your local restaurant..profit is ultimately what they are after. Cavaliers is never going to tell King James ""you don't have to score so many goals."" It costs 9 figures and can take over a decade to bring a new drug to market. And it is not until it reaches the market that the companies start to make money. Not only that, many drugs fail to reach market. So not only is a drug funding itself, it's funding the failed drugs and future drugs as well. Keeping the shareholders happy means keeping more funds..like every other company. I understand that the current status quo is far from good. But I don't know any feasible alternative. Deregulate drugs and speed up the approval process? It could work, but do we really want that to happen?"
