Lets do some math. There were 11,620 people who passed L3 last year and became charter holders. Now lets just take the top 25 MBA programs, that'd be 460 people/class graduating to reach this number. Actual numbers are MUCH lower than this. Trust me, I'm a big fan of the CFA, but I know some really dumb people who are charter holders because they learned to memorize a test. These same people would never get admitted to a top 10, no less 25 MBA program. One thing I will give you, there are WAY too many MBAs in general (partially because of all the part-time, night-time, executive ones).. But an MBA is very different then a CFA in that its banded by school and category. Everyone with a CFA has the same CFA; however, a Wharton degrees sure carries a lot more clout than a UMD one..
