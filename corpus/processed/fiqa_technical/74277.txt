"The applicants go through the same process as for any other loan. The only difference is that the ""bank"" is people like me, perhaps 200 of us on a note. We kick in $25 or so on each note and get the opportunity to ask the applicant questions. The investors pay a small percentage as fees to have professionals rate the notes. The worse the credit, the higher the interest rates the note holder recieves. Of course if the person stops paying, we receive nothing. Calculated risk. I invest in high risk notes sometimes depending on what it's for and have several in my portfolio. It's literally microlending. I can afford to lose $25 on a risky loan or two for a 19% profit because the rest of my portfolio is diversified into hundreds of 9-11% notes. It works surprisingly well."
