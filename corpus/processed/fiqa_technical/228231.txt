I've been studying artificial intelligence. You can play around with the technology on your computer. Currently AI is pretty weak but I've seen some videos that convince me it will get significantly better: * quantum computers will greatly exceed the current technology * serious efforts are being made to test theories on how neurons in the brain work and how computer algorithms can be designed to perform in the same way * there is a search for a general learning algorithm which will make it possible for an AI to learn anything One thing is for sure, an incredible amount of serious effort is being put into this work by some of the most brilliant computer scientists in the world. The really technical presentations are way beyond my comprehension.
