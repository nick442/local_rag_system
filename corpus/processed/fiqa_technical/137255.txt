The main things to ask about are going to revolve around the best way to structure your business. Know what your plans are for partnership. Know whether or not you'll need a lot of up front capital, and if you'll be subjected to an abnormal amount of risk in the course of day to day operations. If you'll be working with one or more partners, ask for help with an operating agreement. You'll find out whether or not you need an accountant throughout these discussions. Edit: Going through those points will enable your lawyer to help you file under the appropriate structure. Ask for help with anything you're unsure about.
