Heh, I really like your reply. I agree with everything you've said, though I would tweak the final point: I think if some random customer sees two competing products, one with Zynga gold and one without, at the same price, they'd choose the one with the gold. Given that it's a completely arbitrary, inflation-proof currency, Zynga can sell it in large quantities for reasonably cheap. If nothing else, it gives them more exposure offline.
