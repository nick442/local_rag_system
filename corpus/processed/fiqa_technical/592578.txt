"Anyone remember ""Fucked Company"" dot-com? It was a hit during the dot-com bust. a dot-com company deadpool blog/website.. And I recall the founder tried to sell customized pr0n videos (like 30 secs or so) of POV shot nailing some girl while she screamed your name. I think that lasted all but a week before he shut that idea off. I want to know what he was thought about it, what happened, and what went wrong.. demand? costs? The open flood of just other pr0n movies, and people not caring about stroking the ego of hearing their name, instead of just stroking other things? not that I care so so much, it was just something crazy from way back when that popped into my mind."
