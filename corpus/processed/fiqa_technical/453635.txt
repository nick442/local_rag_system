> You need to look at where the profits are coming from. Sure. If profits are coming from non-recurring revenue sources, then it isn't a great indication of ongoing profitability. If, on the other hand, profits are coming from lean staffing, low costs and a focus on the bottom line..then you're talking about how a well-run business is operated. It has been a long time since I worked on the floor of an IB so I can't speak to work happiness these days, but I do know that much of the exodus is in the form of people leaving for the buyside (as always), or for greener pastures working on FinTech out in SF.
