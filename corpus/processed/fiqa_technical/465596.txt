"A few years ago, there was a TV special with a celebrity chef (I think Tyler Florence) that was trying to get a small town to eat healthier. In one segment, he showed kids how processed chicken nuggets were made, which was some chicken trimmings and the leftover carcass (bones and all), mixed with bread crumbs and seasonings, pureed, strained and molded. This was supposedly supposed to be disgusting, especially to kids. Didn't work, they still wanted chicken nuggets. In the end, there's nothing wrong with using the 'gross' parts of an animal, nor is there any thing wrong with some of the processing techniques. Mostly they're used to get the most out of the animal, which is what we should be doing. Americans especially are incredibly turned off by any meat that isn't pure white, which is ridiculous. Dark meat and offal are used around the world and are seen as delicacies. ""Chemicals"" are used to scare people, but there's nothing inherently wrong with them. Heck, modernist cooking developed as a way to find more interesting uses for chemicals and additives. You'll find no bigger supporter of home-cooking and eating whole foods than I am, but there is way too much fear mongering and squeamishness that's based only on arbitrary perceptions of what's acceptable and what isn't. You could probable start a campaign of outrage against tortillas for using lime, or bacon for using nitrites, or fish for being frozen, all because people are gullible and ignorant on where their food comes from."
