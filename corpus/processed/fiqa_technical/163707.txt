>One effect of this system is job lock. People become dependent on their employment for their health insurance, and they are loath to leave their jobs, even when doing so might make their lives better. Try telling any of this to progressives and they'll be ready to Tar and feather you.. This is one of the reasons that I am hesitant to support unions..
