Their land is cheaper, so the LVT would be cheaper per acre. Basically the rural person who owns $5 million dollars worth of land pays the same tax as the urban person who owns $5 million dollars worth of land. Most people wouldn't hesitate to call that urban person rich. Also to note, an LVT doesn't tax capital assets like farm equipment. So this would be a boon to a farmer who buys assets to make better use of his land without the burden of record keeping for depreciation accounting of those assets. LVT doesn't tax money you don't have. Farmer spends the money on equipment, then no tax on that equipment money.
