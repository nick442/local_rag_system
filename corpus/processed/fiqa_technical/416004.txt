We've also had pretty freak weather throughout the US this past year doing quite a bit of damage. If I recall correctly, there's been major flooding along the Mississippi River in Louisiana that's wiped out a good bit of rice farmland, serious drought throughout Texas (though that may be lessening of late), and a frost in Florida that took out a swath of the strawberry crop. Now, maybe that's the sort of stuff that happens every year and people get by regardless, but still.
