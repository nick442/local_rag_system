Yes, I really don't disagree with anything that you're arguing regarding social mobility. In general, the lack of social safety net in the US and UK don't enable social mobility. I would also point out that rich kids tend to inherit and so tend to stay in the class with which they were born to. For instance, I know a lawyer whose son is a stereotypical fuck up. Sure, he'll have six figure income all his life due to inheriting dad's money, but he'll never earn anything on his own. Is that success? I don't think so. I would also assert that the point is more salient in the middle class. Just because my parents are middle class doesn't mean that I would be middle class. There's quite a few ways that I could have veered off and ended up quite poor. I know a consultant who was solidly middle class who's son flips burgers for a living. Said son is a bloody smart person from what I heard, but never got his shit together. So yes, I agree that decreasing social mobility is a problem. I'd also argue that success is only predicate on luck.
