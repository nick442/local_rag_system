"XE Trade advertises the following features: So if you think you can predict where rates are going enough to set your bid at a level that you think will be a good deal, you have the opportunity to do that with XE's service. I do not work for XE trade and do not care or receive any financial benefit if you use them or not. I'm just aware of an offering out there that seems like it might answer the question you've asked and am providing an answer that seems like it might be helpful. If you do find the answer helpful, feel free to upvote/accept as appropriate; if you are aware of significant cons or limitations please comment or edit. While this may answer the question you asked, the underlying question cannot be addressed without knowing more about what's behind ""Sadly I cannot sell the property."" When it's clear you think ""having stupid Spain in my life is like a ball and chain around my leg,"" sale of the property seems like a good option."
