"While your implications make wrist-band.com (local wristbrand/lanyard company out of Sugar Land, lmao) seem a goliath, they're a nobody small company with a shitty business model. So let's not act like small businesses are being driven out of business when the opposite is true. Anyways, (god I can't take this serious, ""profits"" in this context is so hilarious, I doubt the money coming from a lanyard company is just rolling in the dough) it's real simple; Google is a huge platform that has some safeguards to prevent fraud, blah blah, unethical sellers, what have you. Therefore, things slip! If you'd like, why don't you try to go ahead and do something about instead of posting a ridiculous rant. Here's Google My Business guidelines from a quick search. I'm sure you can report a business that breaks these guidelines and the appropriate action will take place. I'm still laughing at the premise of this."
