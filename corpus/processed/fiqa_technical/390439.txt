"When private companies are dishonest, or ""run roughshod over workers"", if effects no one but those workers. It also puts that company at a competitive disadvantage as employees don't want to work there. This creates an opening in a competitive market for an honest company to grow. Plus, there will always be honest and respectful companies to work for as long as a market is competitive (little regulation). I work for a very large company today that values its employees greatly. When unions are dishonest, especially public employee unions, it takes its toll on everyone. Their salaries and benefits come from our local property and state income taxes. Their dishonesty is a growing financial burden to my family and friends. In no way does a higher percentage of union workers benefit ""everyone"". It benefits those specific union workers who are unfairly given money that has been forcefully taken from a tax payer."
