"Such a ""duh"" article, but depressingly this happens in reality too much. Years ago I was called into an EVP office who asked why my projects continued much longer than the average in the company (good thing - my projects kept going to get more results). I was flummoxed by the very question. Um, I answer questions, I deliver, I talk with the client, I'm above board. What's the freaking magic? Nothing - I am a person and so are the clients."
