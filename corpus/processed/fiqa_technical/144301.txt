I wasn't arguing that people shouldn't be able to have sex or that it should be restricted in any way, so I'm not sure what strawman you are arguing. All I did was ask a question and point out the obvious which is that if you have an irresponsible person, giving them free condoms isn't likely to prevent unwanted pregnancies because an irresponsible person isn't likely to *use* them. They have to have a certain level of responsibility to even have the foresight to consider the long-term consequences of getting pregnant first (and obviously Fran failed at that.. *twice!*). For teenagers, the availability of condoms/contraceptives may help since the problem for them may be the embarrassment of going to the store to buy them, but this isn't the same as not being able to *afford* them.
