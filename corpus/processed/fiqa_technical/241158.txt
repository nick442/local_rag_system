"You'd be mistaken to this there is any morality involved in (most) corporations - neither positive nor negative; running a business is amoral. Some business missions have a moral intent - such as pharmaceuticals, health organization, etc. - but all have an amoral underbelly. It's fairly simplistic - the purpose of a business is to produce a profit. At some point, all successful, well functioning businesses will work down their list of ways to produce a profit - after they've established market share, a lasting brand, customer loyalty, finances well in the black - and eventually look towards capital preservation. In most bodies with a large monetary wealth, capital preservation becomes a key focus (in other words, once you master the art of making money, you then need to master the art of keeping it). Thus the ability to then focus on these things. To continue to just pay taxes is like running an efficient, but leaky ship. The more you preserve, the longer you'll be around and the more power you'll yield to stick around. This last point is also important to keep in mind - unlike you or I - a company will basically last forever (well at least until society collapses). You or I are only here until we die - and whatever wealth we have we may try to preserve for our kids or next of kin. A corporation is always here, the people in the corporation & it's owners change hands, but the corporation survives. Frankly any business that isn't aiming to make a profit, is either going to fail quickly or is by definition a ""non-profit"". Here is where I would believe the government plays a balancing role - to reign in the power of corporations (lest they rival their own). But, any good corporation will handle that problem as well (Regulatory capture, anyone?). Also, consider that for the most wealthy among us, it's probably not about the money anymore. It's now probably about the game. This is certainly where the psychopaths get that manic edge on the rest of us."
