Several Mickey D's in London exclusively have these. Seems to be no shortage of workers at the counter, assembling orders, getting any mistakes fixed. The UI needs some work, but I don't miss the alternative: having the cashier disappear to grab fries and sauce packets when I'm next in line to place an order. To those moaning about loss of jobs, is this really a job you want to fight to keep? Are you from one of those states where it's illegal to pump your own gas?
