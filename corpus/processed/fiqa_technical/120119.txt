"You mean ""offshoring"" I heard this in the Presidential debate also, Every source I could find said that companies would get about 3/4 of the expense of offshoring written off. Meaning If it would cost me 100 dollars to move a factory to China after I payed taxes It would only cost me 25 dollars. I was not 100 percent on the credibly of these sources so I would recommend doing your own research."
