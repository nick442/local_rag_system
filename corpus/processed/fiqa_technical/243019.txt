You are right. This is an oil and gas construction company. Honestly speaking, I have very little information concerning their procedures for hiring and interviewing candidates. The only thing I know is that they have a department of financial analysis and modeling. As you said, that lacks specifics. I would be more interested in development in corporate finance.
