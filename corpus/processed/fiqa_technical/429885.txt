"*The early history of paper money did not evolve the way I described in the earlier posts (although it could have, and would have got to the same place). Instead, the early history of paper money was certificates issued by storage-vaults of precious metals (i.e., early ""banks"").* Do read David Graeber's ""Debt, the First 5000 Years"". The first credit money almost certainly originated with the books held by the temples in the middle east thousands of years ago. The history of our current monetary system can trace it's origins to the medieval gold smiths, but ours is not the first credit money system by a long stretch."
