I'd say it's because they trade balance for culture. But I'm on the high end of the millennial age distribution. I don't want to work all the time. I value being at home with my wife and our cats. I don't give two blue fucks about having Google or Facebook on my resume because in the end, this all just facilitates me being able to pay bills, play games, and buy nudy mags. But for reasons beyond me, younger millennials value having the right corporate overlord over free time.
