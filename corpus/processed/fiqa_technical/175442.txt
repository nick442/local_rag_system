"Is it safe? No in general. Are there any other safe ""paper"" ways to invest money let's say for 30 years and be sure nothing will happen to them and you will end your life without relying on pension? No. In these times only real properly gives you some sort of warranty in 5-30 years term. Land, buildings, production lines. Not necessary in US - lots of countries have 0 or fairly low property tax. Some gold, platinum, silver and other rare elements to diversify. - This is the only way you can be sure you will not suddenly loose everything."
