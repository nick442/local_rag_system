We were close to doing something like this but we ultimately find it cheaper and more profitable to find those who are just looking to sell off their accounts. Within the past five years I believe we have done this six or seven times which benefits us greatly but at the same time more competition comes in, people quit their business and cancel, the business is transferred to a new owner and they cancel, etc etc. We do well, but are always looking for more.
