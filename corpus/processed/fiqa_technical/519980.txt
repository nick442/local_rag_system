"*A Libertarian's take on the above passage*: As long as capitalism is actively working, businessman and profiteer are synonymous, and neither is bad; neither will be able to stay in business without benefitting society by keeping willing customers. So where does the above ideal fall apart? Monopoliesl. Adam Smith himself warned about natural monopolies (think Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Vanderbilt, yet I personally wouldn't call them demons). Yet, I can't think of a single example of one of them today, yet we still have a massive number of demons obstructing capitalism. **The real demons are government-sanctioned monopolies**. * Giant barriers to entry, permits, certifications, extensive tax code, licenses, etc are only the beginning. * A patent grants an automatic 20-year monopoly, for better or for worse. For medicines, probably worse. * Did you know you can patent a fucking *gene* now? Government-supported. * Software and design patents are so broad it's trivial for any established firm to put a newcomer out of business simply through legal bullying. * What if the people are unhappy with which defense contractor the gov't picks to do work in Iraq? Is that capitalism? * The government pretty much gave at&t a blank check to ""own"" the entire Internet backbone as long as they *promised* to invest the money and not dump it to their shareholders (*cough*). * Cable TV trusts.. Argh, corruption at its finest. My family only has the ""choice"" of a single cable provider because of the gov't approved anti-competitive practices. Zip code 18015. Not exactly a remote area, either. All the above examples are clear abuses of power, and none would disagree other than the direct beneficiaries. Where does the Libertarian perspective diverge from the Keynesian one, then? * Keynesians believe that we need rules in place to prevent companies from exploiting positions like these. * Libertarians believe that the government should not have the power in the first place to enable these abuse methods to arise in the first place."
