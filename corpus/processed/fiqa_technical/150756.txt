"Assuming that the assets in the ""old"" TFSA are in cash, you could simply withdraw the money and redeposit it in the ""new"" TFSA, in the following year!!. The yearly limit is on your gross deposits for the year, not the net. This method obviously works best near the end of December. You should expect the new TFSA to briefly question the amount; they don't want to help you make a costly mistake. At other times, the direct transfer in @Grade EhBacon's answer would be better."
