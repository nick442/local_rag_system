headcounts.. I racked 12k in overtime compensation last year, asking the superiour why we wouldn't simply hire someone, seeing that the whole team worked under the same conditions, the answer was, headcount wouldn't get approved, while he was able to get the overtime compensation approved due to sourcing the funds from a different budget, getting a new perm proves difficult - especially if you function in a matrix. it's corporate politics that requires a fight, that only few superiours will risk, if it's not them haging over the edge as a result & a damn shame, if you ask me, seeing that there are so many young well educated people not having any work at all. if you think the extra bucks is nice: working years on overtime bears cost, that's not worth the money - on the other hand, you also have people that have to work overtime without having the choice of compensation.
