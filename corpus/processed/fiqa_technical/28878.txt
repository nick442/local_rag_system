As I tried to point out to people before the ACA went into effect, the 80/20 rule applied to premiums but did nothing to address copays or deductibles. Furthermore, it's not like anyone was going to audit the insurance companies for strict compliance with the rule. But everyone thought that making sure more people could buy a policy from a for-profit company would fix American healthcare. Now here we are a few years later with an unaffordable system that doesn't cover everyone and the for-profit companies still in charge, and paying Congress to do away with what few protections we have. Who could possibly have seen this coming?
