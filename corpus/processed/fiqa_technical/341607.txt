I think retail stores, as we know them are already dead, or at least terminally ill. Some places will survive, but they'll be more focused on providing niche products that should be scene in person before buying. Online shopping is just too convenient and cheap, and as return policies improve less and less people will be worried about actually holding things before they buy it.
