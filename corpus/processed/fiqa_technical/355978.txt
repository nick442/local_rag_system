I agree with you, but to play devils advocate--I am a big fan of self-improvement goals, and I've noticed when I make goals with friends, I am more likely to stick with them and surpass them. And we can even take it a step further where we want to beat everyone else subconsciously and prove we are superior. This is the same.
