"It's never going to be a huge moneymaker. Trillian tried, but frankly Trillian existed because people didn't want to be running a bajillion different messengers and the big ones were open enough that it presented an opportunity for someone to make a single platform. I'm still using Trillian because AIM and ICQ still work on it, but with AIM going down I'm probably gonna trash it. Trillian itself is pretty obnoxious these days and a lot of the ""features"" are pretty much trash. I just want something that has a minimal interface, allows for single contacts across multiple messengers to be logged in a unified way, and has a mobile offering that doesn't suck. It fails across the board. All the ""newer"" messengers (FB, Discord, Skype, etc) don't allow worthwhile third party interaction, so we're back to the days of needing a half dozen things open and using resources to stay in touch -- and all of them have significant drawbacks as well. Shit, IRC is looking damned good now that I think about it."
