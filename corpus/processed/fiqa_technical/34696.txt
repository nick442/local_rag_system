"I had a weird arrangement like this in college with a girl. She didn't want a relationship, or sex. She just wanted to sleep with me. So occasionally my phone would ring at 10:30, ""Dave, this is Pam. I'm at the door. Can I come down?"" (My dorm room was in the basement of the graduate/doctoral dorm) She'd come down, want to cuddle a bit, and go to sleep. In the morning I'd get dressed, reset the alarm clock for her, and go to class. I'd come back from lunch at the cafeteria and my bed would be made, the room picked up, and clothes put away. Since I was in between relationships at the time, it was a very cool symbiosis for the two of us."
