>If you want to claim such nonsense then you have to prove it. Honestly this all scans with the same naivety as the communists saying WELL IT HASN'T BEEN TRIED PROPERLY YET. I mean, it only takes to the third paragraph until you get full on tin foil saying ALL THE WARS ARE BORNE OF STATES. I mean there have been no non-states since the bloody bronze age. Great argument there. Lost my interest completely. I suppose that makes me a 'statist', are you going to call me a cuck next? I do love the irony that you say I have no evidence or reason to support something like 2 paragraphs after you say market monopolies are a myth - I mean it's not like there aren't many historical monopolies to point at to prove you wrong. Why not the east india company for example - got a royal charter to literally do whatever the hell it wanted. Doesn't get more free market than that. Ended up fucking everything up and killing a whole bunch of people, which ultimately seems to be the measure of how badly your philosophy fucks up. Ultimately i find this philosophy unnecessarily reductionist, it lacks the nuance and resource flexibility to deal with shocks to the system such as external invasion or environmental catastrophe i.e.what protection do you have from these private courts if someone is polluting your water supply? Your air? What defines 'your air' and 'your water'? The company that's polluting it want to use that other court which is far more lenient on pollution than the one that you'd like. They also have a lot more in the way of money & resources than you - how do you resolve that? I mean these are all hypothetical worst case scenarios; it's not like there was a complete breakdown of law an order in the old west - but it's not like it was a particularly nice place to live either. I mean, the current system is far from perfect, but all this sounds a lot like burning the house down to get rid of a spider; Democracy is the worst form of government - except for all the others.
