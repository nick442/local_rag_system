"Usually when the government defaults, the currency gets devalued. So as a debtor, that's a good thing -- your debt gets devalued. The ""catch"" is that your income and buying power is also devalued. So unless you happen to own the type of assets that become more valuable during those circumstances (real property, farms, utilities, certain industrial things, etc) you're looking at tough times ahead."
