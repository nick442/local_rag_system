Does anyone know anything about FCAC - Canada's financial bank regulator? If so, a recent article by CBC came out stating that our financial regulator is being lobbied often by the very same banks they are supposed to be watching. My question would be when private banks are meeting with our financial watchdogs in Canada; what would they be lobbying towards; specifically in the case of Canada, and their finance law?
