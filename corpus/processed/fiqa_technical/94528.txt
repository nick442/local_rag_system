"Your numbers are way off, but the point is still valid regarding diabetes, even at 1/10th or 1/100th of what you claim. The long term health (and lifespan) implications of diabetes (not to mention the larger ""obesity"" problem) are NOT something to be simply ignored. Likewise with the long term costs/consequence of other health-related problems (STD's, anti-biotic resistant bacteria, etc)."
