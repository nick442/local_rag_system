"Ahh, two things: * You're an SME, therefore you are much more a small team than a big business - once things get over about 20-30 people it goes through a phase transition. * ""I run a business that employs"" - and you are on the other side of the fence from the workers and have a different, more rosy tinted perspective on the whole employment thing. They almost certainly think its more 'us and them' than you do. In the end, 'employment' rather than 'partnership' is always more about the money first than it is about the camaraderie."
