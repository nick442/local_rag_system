Maduro's regime has enough problems that indirectly reducing inflation alone won't do much to keep him in power. But I don't see any moral argument for increasing harm in the short term to get people to support your side, which is also basically what Republicans want to do with health care, blow it up and hurt people then convince them to blame the other guy. And I'm not defending Maduro, he's gotta go. But the basis for criticizing the bond deal is still bad.
