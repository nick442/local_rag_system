"I am/was responding to your point that beef prices ""should be hitting everyone else harder"". Your initial argument was that vertical integration made them better able to beat the competition due to lower beef cost. Clearly not all competition is vertically integrated, so the initial premise warrants exploration. My comments explore my concerns with your premise, despite the fact I am not an expert on beef or Mcdonalds. Your initial premise also misses the point that not all of McD's competition is selling beef. This sort of implies that McDonalds can completely keep costs the same as substitutes just because they are vertically integrated. But I will ignore that for now too. Now you have abandoned your initial premise and are now arguing that derivatives, combined with vertical integration are the cause for the competitive advantage. I am not going to even begin to argue with this because I don't know about McDonalds hedging strategies compared to their competition. I do know that the derivatives are a) available to the competition and b) would be necessary for McDonalds to even begin controlling ""beef cost"". So, my main point stands, the vertical integration does not significantly help McDonalds control beef costs compared to a pure derivative strategy (regardless of if competition actually uses derivatives)."
