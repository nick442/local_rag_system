The material and the exams are very straightforward. There are no strategies required, there is plenty of time to complete all the questions, and there are no confusing questions, so no worries about deciphering strange wording. Read all the material and you will be absolutely fine. Standard study tips apply, read the chapter over again if there are certain items that you find a bit more difficult. I personally found success doing one chapter at a time, then going through the summary questions. Take a break for an hour or so. Repeat until completed the book. Schedule your time so that you will have a few days prior to your exam to review all the material, re-reading the summaries and targeting your review as necessary. Basically, it's not much to worry about. Just do the reading and all will be fine. Best luck.
