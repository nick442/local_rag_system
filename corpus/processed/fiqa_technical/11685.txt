I don't know much about finance, but maybe you should research some stocks, find one that outperformed the market during a recession or downturn and analyze it. My first guess would be to go onto finance.google click some stocks and look at the graph during a time period when there was a downturn, click the button that compares it against the s&P or DOW and if the stock is higher then, yippee-ki-yay, you found something to analyze.
