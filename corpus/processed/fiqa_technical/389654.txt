I am also neither an attorney nor a tax advisor. Yes, the rent money you pay to your friend is taxable income, but suddenly all kinds of expenses around the house - including a fraction of the interest paid on the mortgage - become tax deductible. For example, let's say that the mortgage is $1000 / month and you pay your friend $500 / month. If you live in 50% of the house, then he can deduct 50% (plus or minus) of the expenses associated with owning the house, including: All of these things (50% of them, anyway) become tax deductible. It'd be quite possible for him to take a loss on the endeavor and actually reduce his taxes every year. Until it comes time to sell; selling a property that has been used as a rental is more taxable than selling a property that has been a personal residence.
