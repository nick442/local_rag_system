Good thing I'm not at Freddie anymore. Not sure what I would have picked (They don't use quite the same analyst/VP/Director framework, VP there is like MD elsewhere). Not sure what someone at the Fed or Treasury would put either, or the rating agencies, or Reuters or Bloomberg. Before Freddie, I was working for a financial software provider. Gonna be hard to be inclusive with that list. And frankly, VP - IB doesn't even tell you much. I'd much rather know what sector everyone worked.
