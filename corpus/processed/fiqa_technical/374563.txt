Thank you, good points. I like the idea of using it as a syndication point. My main blog is actually on a site I have full control over so in many ways this is my real website. The idea you've given me is that I could be using the main (what I call corporate) site as a big summary of everything I have going on and where to find it, almost becoming my agent!
