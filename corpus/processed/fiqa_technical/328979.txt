"He's misunderstanding Buffett's argument, which is that all forms of investment compete, and so when interest rates give you guaranteed low returns, it makes sense for stocks to give you average low returns. That implies *high* prices for current stocks, because your return on equities is the price tomorrow over the price today. Buffett would likely agree with him that this implies slow growth in the future, though he may not want to say so for competitive reasons. Historical P/E norms are a more wrong metric, because they don't capture any fundamental change that might have happened in the economy. What's likely going on is a surplus of capital: as business becomes more efficient (i.e. generates more revenue with fewer workers), that excess cash flow becomes investable capital, but as it becomes more efficient (i.e. less of that revenue filters down to workers in the form of wages that they can spend on consumer goods), the amount of productive uses where that capital can be effectively deployed in income-generating activities declines. More capital + fewer investable opportunities = higher supply + lower demand = the price of securities for the few areas of the economy that *are* doing well increases. This is why you see insane valuations for tech companies. If we do get a major economic crash, it will likely come from a Carlota Perez-style financial crisis, where all the money gets concentrated within emerging new industries focused on new technology, who can't sell their products because nobody else has any money. We're on the path to that already, but it will likely take a decade or two to play out; there's still a lot of money left in the ""old economy"" which can be extracted. Also, these style of financial crises usually are accompanied by war and a breakdown of the established political order, and so all bets are off anyway."
