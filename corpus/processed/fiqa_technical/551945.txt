> Every damn thing is negotiable. Except no its not, if you feed all of your top desires into your HR team and no one hits all of the quals, they simply exclude them. If you feed it into Taleo that you want to pay 48k, and someone applies who wants 50k? Excluded. Further, not having a clear idea of what the pay is for a position is a bad sign for the overall competence of your team.
