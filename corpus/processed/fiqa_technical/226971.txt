Yeah his card doesn't explain much, but I'm guessing he'll explain everything at the interview. Im more so interested in if there was anything that could be known universally amongst financial jobs that would be beneficial to know. I'm extremely organized and my interpersonal skills I think are what got me the opportunity in the first place, but I'm jw if there are any key financial terms/ processes that would help me go above and beyond.
