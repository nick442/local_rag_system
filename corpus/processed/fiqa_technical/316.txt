Yeah, I instinctively knew that the Middle East probably wouldn't be it, even without knowing jack about finance. So, Europe-wise, we're looking at Frankfurt and London, then? As for Asia, what about Hong Kong? Given that it is already becoming a center for instrumentation between different financial systems and its close proximity to Southeast Asia (also, it is part of the PRC allowing for direct access to China, yet doesn't operate according to the same restrictions that Shanghai would under the Two Countries, One System deal), do you see that as a future major hub for Islamic finance? Or will it all be crowded into Singapore?
