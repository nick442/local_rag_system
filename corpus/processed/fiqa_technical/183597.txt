"I have never said anything about liking Obama, so that's pure projection on your part. Classic attitude of wanting to see something so bad, that you see it even when it's not there. What you fail to realize is that the stories that Fox News (and many other ""news"" organizations, but your demo seems to REALLY love Fox because they tell you all what you want to hear and play right into your confirmation bias) are based a handful of crazy people out of literally billions. There's crazy Muslims, there's crazy Atheists, there's crazy Catholics. Your fear mongering attitude talks about a group of a few people thousands of miles away, while ignoring the fact that nearly all mass attacks, acts of terrorism, etc in this cointry are done by white, Christian, American citizens. I think YOU should be illegal."
