No they aren't boom times. Not sure how that justifies overpaying cashiers; the fact that the economy is slumping could be an argument to pay them less. Less money given to cashiers = lower prices = better for everyone in the economic downturn. Sorry to play devil's advocate but there is no free lunch and this isn't skilled work.
