>My iPhone is made with products from Fox con. Last time I check Fox Con didn't make any products they assembled them. And Fox Con is improving their treatment of their employees. >I do not see rival companies (like Samsung) doing the same thing. Rival companies aren't also under heat to do such a thing like Apple is. But that doesn't mean they aren't doing this. As just because they aren't making a PR stunt out of it doesn't mean they aren't doing it. >I would never say that I live a purely virtuous life. So don't pretend to be all virtuous then. Before you jump the gun I am not saying unethical behavior should outright be accepted, but that the world needs some unethical behavior to well operate. As they say there are necessary evils that need to be done/carried out.
