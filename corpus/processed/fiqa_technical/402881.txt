Exactly the point I'm trying to make though. Everyone's downvoting this guy for making valid points about why HE is choosing not to buy Tesla. Sure if someone disagreed because they, like you said, preferred an optimistic long term analysis of Tesla because of a number of things like Elons track record or Tesla growth and position etc. then they shouldn't have *downvoted* him so it wasn't seen just because they disagreed. They should have argued their reasons why Tesla valuation makes sense. Instead, peoples are stifling real discussion that helps everyone learn and participate. I am apart of these subreddits to learn more about business and also the world of finance and I think we can all agree that valid discussion about different strategies or preference and their success is one of the best ways to learn. I don't come view the comments of these posts for one viewpoint throughout the whole thread. Anyway, I think I made my point. Thanks
