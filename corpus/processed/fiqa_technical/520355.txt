"I always looked at it that ""business class"" is the standard class. If you want to save money for your personal travels then you can fly economy, if you want luxury you can fly first. But if your company wants you to travel, they shouldn't force you to fly less than business. Economy is the loss of basic essentials (space, meals, drinks) in return for a lower price. It's not the way it should be as standard."
