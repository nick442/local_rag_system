Completely wrong again. The starving man is starving because has no money. The man who does not fear lack of food has more money to buy better quality eggs. The well fed man thus has a higher willingness to pay for eggs. Mothers affection has no quantifiable economic value or bearing. What you're describing is a category change, a concept completely different from the matter at hand. http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/13/156737801/the-cost-of-free-doughnuts-70-years-of-regret
