The benefits of more vegetation will be cancelled out by more superstorms, disappearance of islands & coastlines, the eventual submergence of large areas of land like India/China region, and likely shifts in ocean currents which may upend a significant portion of life in the seas. So yes, change is coming, some positive, even more negative, but I just don't really see how you're defending the OP to this comment thread.
