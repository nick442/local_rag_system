"To me this is the Entertainment Industy's War on Terror, meaning they use a bullshit excuse of ""pirates"" to do whatever they want. This is simply another way corporations can get around anti-trust laws by shutting down shit they dont agree with and just labeling it piracy, especially since they can do so with impunity."
