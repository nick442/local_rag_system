Not sure how well it suits your case, but did you consider 'car sharing' yet? If you find someone reliable in your neighbourhood, who only needs the car within the week, it might be possible to divide your park and insurance costs by 2. Another option might be private car rentals (for example from relayrides.com). The prices seem considerably lower than $600/weekend. At least here in Germany this is getting more and more popular, especially in cities.
