> If the state doesnâ€™t do it, will it not happen? Correct - if the government/state doesn't provide health care then the poor are less likely to get health care. We know that is the case because we can compare the US to european countries. > Do we not want persons to eat because we object to the state raising grain? That doesn't make any sense - the state doesn't need to raise grain in order to let everyone eat. They could buy the grain from companies that raise grain, and distribute that for free, for example.
