"Definitely depends on the field. I work in derivatives (but not on the pure quant side, though), and that's one of the fields that tends to hire the most mathsy guys. Basically involves applying a lot of stochastic calculus and probabilistic concepts to practical pricing problems. If you want a nice little application from a math perspective (but not necessarily practical), check out ""A Closed-Form Solution for Options with Stochastic Volatility"" by Heston (1992). Should give a decent idea of how typically the problem solving process works in derivative-land: start with a practical problem relating to a probabilistic/modelling concept (eg implied distribution of expected returns) -> apply some math -> come up with some sort of solution. *edit: clarification 1st paragraph"
