You want to bend over and take it up the ass by a bunch of tyrants you go ahead, but true patriots know that the fight to preserve our constitutional rights never ends. It certainly doesn't end on a Friday afternoon because some troll shows up and tells you it ended last week. They are **_inalienable_** rights. That means you or anyone else cannot take them away, and they cannot be signed away. Period. Our grandparents fought and died for this protection and you would simply throw it away without a fight. Shame on you. All of you dissidents should spend some time to really learn what the constitution grants you, and then spend the rest of your days helping defend it against those who would try to nickle and dime it to death. You're either with us or you're against us.
