"Gandhi said once, that no body is a bigger threat to you than yourself. The point is , if communists and socialist governments were doomed to fail, which they did, USA wouldn't have to spend a dollar towards its fall. But I understand, sometimes you buy insurance just to be safe and to ""aid""/help the fall."
