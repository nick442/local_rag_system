This is why single-payer was the only way. The net result now is: * Workers get less hours * Workers make less money * Employer STILL gets to escape without paying healthcare costs * Workers now penalized for not paying same costs giving them even LESS money * Insurance companies still get millions of new customers. This whole idea was really retarded.
