>They are just paper that is worth what it's worth because everyone agrees to accept it. This is only partly true, and it's slightly misleading. Fiat currencies' root value comes from *legal tender laws*, which stipulate that they are honored as settling all debts (both public and private). So they have a distinct (and unfair) legal advantage over other potential currencies. Americans don't arbitrarily choose to use USD, just like the Danes don't arbitrarily choose to use Kroner, or the Italians use Euro. It's written in law. Your OP's are also misleading in the fact they are talking about credit derivatives (currencies) as though they were *emergent money*. They are not.
