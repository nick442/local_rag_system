It would be tough to make that move. The traders at my work look down on the settlements desk, which is wrong because they do great work and without them we wouldn't be able to have a viable business. so thank you for your work! but to answer your question I would suggest making friends with the traders, joke around, find out where they go for drinks and just show up! be outgoing. make friends with them and mention you'd like a shot at it at some point.
