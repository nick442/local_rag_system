Best Buy places heavy emphasis on it's employees to sell Extended Warranty/Protection Plans. It is extremely annoying when they try to sell you a warranty on a $10 alarm clock - more so when the warranty cost more than the product. I avoid Best Buy as much as possible just because I don't wan't to hear the warranty pitch anymore.
