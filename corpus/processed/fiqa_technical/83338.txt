"From the Social Security site, In the case of early retirement, a benefit is reduced 5/9 of one percent for each month before normal retirement age, up to 36 months. If the number of months exceeds 36, then the benefit is further reduced 5/12 of one percent per month. And for a delay past normal retirement age, there's an 8% per year increase in benefit for each year you delay. I believe the ""return it all"" option was discontinued. There's far too little information in your question for anyone to give a comprehensive answer. In general, one needs to look at a number of variables including their taxable income with and without the social security benefit as well as their health to determine the optimal SS start date."
