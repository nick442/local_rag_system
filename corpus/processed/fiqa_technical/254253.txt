>Aren't Saabs kind of notorious for problems? FTFY And yes. I work with engineers. There's one guy who likes Saabs. He spends his weekends keeping whatever Saab he has now usable. Whether it is a gauge problem or a leaking trunk or whatever. The rest of us just smile and shake our heads. He's been driving around his in-laws' K-car for a month now and after so many years dealing with Saabs he actually really likes it.
