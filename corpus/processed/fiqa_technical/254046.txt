The economy stinks because the government targets a straight line rate of NGDP growth that is ever diverging from the rate of sustainable economic growth which has been flattening since the 1970s when the cost of energy sustained significant rises in price and never looked back. The only way to make the economy not stink is to find a miraculously cheap energy source that is as cheap as fossil fuels were before the 1970s. Since the possibility of this is practically zero, the best we can do is make the economy stink less in the long run by intentionally flattening the rate of NGDP growth by gradually pulling back on massive debt spending and tightening loose monetary policies. If we don't do this, we are just setting ourselves up for a future economic correction whose amplitude will not only be bigger than the Great Recession but will also be relatively bigger than the Great Depression.
