"The Investment Management Certificate (IMC) is the base level certification for Asset Management. Should be relatively easy to pass and might get you a leg up on other candidates. Something that demonstrates competence in VBA would also be beneficial. However if you want to get ahead in the City, I would suggest you focus on human psychology rather than qualifications. A book such as ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is going to be more beneficial than another piece of paper."
