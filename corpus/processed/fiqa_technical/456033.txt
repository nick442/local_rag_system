Something I heard while listening to a business news channel was that Boeing doesn't want to let another Airbus slip into the fray. Boeing never thought that Airbus was going to be a true competitor so they just didn't challenge them early in the process of them developing their aircraft business. According to the broadcast, Boeing doesn't want to let another competitor slip through with huge government subsidies without a challenge.
