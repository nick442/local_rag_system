"Gosh this certainly won't drive piracy underground in some modern day version of an alcohol prohibition where bars were shut down. Perhaps this will be marvelously successful and nobody will ever pirate again. Certainly shutting down websites that are blindingly visible won't drive pirates to more creative and closer ties to the very organizations that are ACTUALLY committing physical crimes in what I will term ""realspace"". (see what I did there? realspace? reelspace? HEYYYOOOO!!)"
