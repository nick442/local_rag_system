"LOL!!! No matter what Trump will do, even if he lowers the prices of drugs, you will be against him. Even after what Trump just said, ""time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!"" (the bold letters and exclamation mark are Trump's), you still think that Trump does not want lower drug prices. Clear tribalism on your side."
