For a complete example, do a little research on Monticello MN FiberNet. The project took 7 years to get going, including a court battle. The incumbent ISP fought tooth and nail to stop competition. Now you can get 30 mb up/down fiber for $50/month. Probably one of the best prices you'll find anywhere in the state. And that scares every shitty dsl provider around. Source: Minnesotan, not from Monticello and currently paying $30/mo for 3/1.5 mb dsl and getting shitty fucking customer service. edit: Android thinks I shouldn't curse.
