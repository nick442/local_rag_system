Interested in getting an MBA in economics or getting an MBA after Economics undergrad? If you want an MBA in economics I don't believe that exists. If you want an MBA after undergrad usually you will need work experience first to get into the best (worth the cost) programs. As to the best major to acquire well rounded skills in that area I see I was not clear in my wording. I meant that the best major to acquire well rounded skills in business is literally the major of business itself no matter what you specialize in. Depending on how your school does it the majors may actually be the specializations but any marketing, finance, operations, supply chain, etc. major should have more practical and directly applicable business skills from what they learned in class than an Economics major, BS or BA, will have.
