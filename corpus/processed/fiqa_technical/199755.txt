"Typically I'll carry the charge for quite awhile, up to a year. If it hasn't cleared by then, I contact the institution that should have received the money to see what they want to do about it. If they tell me not to worry about it, then I change the payee to be ""Overdraft Protection"", and consider it as having been spent. That way I build up (slowly) a cushion in my checking account."
