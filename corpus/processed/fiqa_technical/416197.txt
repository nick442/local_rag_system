"Plus the younger Gen Xer's did worse than the older ones. And of course, the ""savvy"" Gen Xer's did much better than the ""un-savvy"" -- the savvy actually saw the whole thing coming, managed to get out of the market at just the right ""peak"" time, and were able to get back in (at least partially & tenuously) near the bottom. (I'm actually in better shape financially now than I was pre-recession, and with zero debt I was in fairly good shape then; and I know I am not the *only* ""savvy"" GenXer who did that). But even given that.. the future *still* looks ""rocky"" to me."
