I believe we already do? We have subsidies and stuff to entice companies to move to certain cities for example. Also the defense companies are still businesses in the end. I used to work at one for what it's worth. But sure if it somehow makes a difference instead of businesses we can fund infrastructure projects, public transportation, education, or really anything else that benefits society in a more direct way.
