There is no distribution limit, only a contribution limit. You can empty your HSA completely without tax or penalty, as long as the expenses are used for eligible medical expenses. In addition, you can reimburse yourself in the future for expenses that you have now, as long as you have an HSA account in place. For example, you said that your dental bill was $3500, and you only had $3300 in your HSA, so you emptied your HSA and paid the rest from your checking account. When you do get more money in the HSA, even if it isn't until next year, you can reimburse yourself for the $200 that you had to pay out of pocket on your dental bill. And if you don't have enough money in your HSA this year to cover all of your birth expenses (congrats, by the way), you can reimburse yourself in a future year. Just make sure you keep good records on what the distributions were used for, in case you get audited.
