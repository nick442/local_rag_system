"Currencies don't really have intrinsic value. You can't compare bitcoins to tulips because you can't grow 200x more bitcoins next winter to push the price down to its intrinsic value. Bitcoins are scarce and like gold, the intrinsic value doesn't matter anymore, it's all about supply and demand and there will always be bitcoin fans with money that won't let it go to 0$. And compared to gold, bitcoin is still very very cheap, so even if the bubble ""bursts"", it will grow again."
