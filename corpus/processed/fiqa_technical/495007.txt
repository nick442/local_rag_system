I suspect that the times you are referring to are those times when there is relatively low volumes of foreign exchange trading. Lower volumes of trading make it possible for large orders to have a disproportionate effect on the market price. This implies that the times to avoid will be the times with the lowest relative volumes. This will occur on the cusp between the New York market winding down and the Asia/Tokyo market revving up. This will be in the hours preceding Tokyo's opening at 06:00 Tokyo time, so the time to avoid is about 04:00-06:00 Tokyo time, or about 20:00-22:00 GMT (if I've worked out the time difference correctly). Foreign exchange is a 24 hour, global market. Although each of the three main trading centres - London, New York, Asia - will operate 24 hours a day, they will maintain only a skeleton staff outside of normal working hours. The time difference between London and New York is only 5 hours, so there is no period of time when both centres are operating with a skeleton staff. The time difference between London and Tokyo is 8 hours, so again there is no period of time when both centres are operating with a skeleton staff. The time difference between New York and Tokyo is 13 hours. This does include a period where both centres are operating with a skeleton staff, as well as London operating on a skeleton staff. Thus, in the couple of hours immediately preceding Tokyo's opening for the regular trading day there is minimal coverage in each of the three main trading centres. As mentioned above, this is the time when large orders can have a disproportionate effect on fx rates and so this is the time to avoid.
