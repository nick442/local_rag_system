I mean, I'm not saying people *need* sex, I think thats stupid to assume, but to say you need to have a lot of money before kids will set us up for failure. Already, the younger generations (i.e. millennials and younger) will have to deal with a low birthrate that will be a huge problem once they hit geriatric age. Not having kids means you'll likely need some form of nursing care, but if no one else is having kids either then who's going to staff nursing homes? I'm not supporting people having kids either willy-nilly just for an illusion of comfort for when they're old. People of all classes were able to have kids back in the day and just saying 'you can't have that anymore' doesn't sit right just because the system is fucked up. This is something that needs to be fixed, not just a bandaid thrown on it, saying 'just don't have kids lol'
