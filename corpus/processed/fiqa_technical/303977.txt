> Current fiat currency has a way to enforce itself if trust is lost. Bitcoin does not. Right. I'm saying it doesn't need to have to enforce trust to succeed. It just needs to be trustworthy. Trust that is voluntarily given is real trust, trust that is taken or forced is just compliance. Bitcoin survives and thrives completely on the former. The fact that fiat requires military enforcement to remain relevant is a glaring sign of it's inherent problems.
