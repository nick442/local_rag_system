Windows 10 is technically more stable and can run for months at a time, but Microsoft has decided that they think it's ok to force the computer to restart after updates are installed, without even asking the user for permission first. So you're probably just one of millions of victims of that issue. Countless numbers of people continue to lose data, and many don't even know why, all because Microsoft is making a horrible decision and refuses to fix it. They've even made it harder to turn off the forced restarts in most versions of Windows now. Aside from that, Windows 10 is actually pretty good compared to previous Windows versions.
