Blockbuster should have done some sort of rental package where you could return their mailers to the the store and get a couple of in store rentals for 10 bucks a month or something. This could have cut down on the turn around time with Netflix. At least they could have made some money rather than no money. I'm sure they didn't think things would turn out the way they did tho.
