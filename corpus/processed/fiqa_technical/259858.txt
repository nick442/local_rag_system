"Wikipedia: > On 24 September 2007, the Department of Medicine of Alberta University reported that after the trial funding was secured, both the Alberta local ethics committee and Health Canada approved the first DCA clinical trial for cancer.[24] This initial trial was relatively small with enrollment of up to 50 patients. The trial was completed in August 2009.[25] In May 2010 the team published a press release[26] stating no conclusions could be drawn as a result of the trial. A paper describing the results was published[27] but not linked from the press release. Only five patients had been treated with the drug during the trial. [.] > Five palliative patients with primary GBM were entered into a phase II trial. Three had not responded to several chemotherapies; two were newly diagnosed. After surgical removal of tumor mass, they were treated with DCA and chemotherapy.[15] > Of the five patients tested, one died after three months. The surviving four were followed for 15 months. Their Karnofsky scores were unchanged in two cases, and decreased by 10 points in two patients.[15] > DCA was associated with tumor regression and had a good safety profile. DCA side effects were minimal.[15] That's not ""established"", that's a long shot. It helped, somewhat, and it did not harm -- but it absolutely did not ""cure cancer"". Based on a 5 patient study no drug on earth would be admitted. And then there's this: > In 2010, it was found that for human colorectal tumours grown in mice, under hypoxic conditions, DCA decreased rather than increased apoptosis, resulting in enhanced growth of the tumours.[18] These findings suggest that at least in some cancer types DCA treatment could be detrimental to patient health, highlighting the need for further testing before it can be considered a safe and effective cancer treatment.[18] Cancer medicine has a long, sad history with super promising drugs which totally failed to deliver. DCA sounds more like one of these than a wonder drug suppressed by evil pharma, although I would recommend to continue public funding on it."
