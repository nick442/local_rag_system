I think dying is too strong a word for sell-side ER. There's no question it's shrinking though. Dying implies it's going to be dead. I believe it will carry on but at a reduced level. Sell-side equity research derives it's revenues in a really arcane way. It can no longer benefit from i-banking revenues so it's dependent on trading volume. Trading volume is way down so that income is also shrinking. At the same time, a lot of equity research shops have just become conduits between the buy-side and management. Their research product isn't great. So why do I think sell-side ER will stick around? Because there are some BBs and independent shops doing real research work that provides value to the buyside. Their product has value. The buyside knows it. Demand for the research from these firms will continue. If you're really interested in ER, I think you need to start to understand the difference between places doing good ER and bad ER. If you go into a good ER shop and learn how to be a good equity research analyst, you have a valuable skill. I'm not going to try to paint a rosy picture of the er industry but understand the best time to get your foot in the door is when everybody else is running away. If the industry can tough it out, you'll be in a good spot.
