Oh there is a mark up, store brand items typically have better margins than the name brands. The quality is usually a hair lower compared to the name brand, but basically the same. Canned Green beans for example, might have a slightly more brownish tint and might not be as perfectly uniform in size. They still taste the same and you're probably not going to even notice the small difference.
