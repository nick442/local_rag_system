Yes. Basically, I see it as a huge giveaway to corporate interests when we have to do things like step in and pay for food for their workers (e.g. SNAP), enabling a business to keep their own wages low. It's basically a wealth transfer to shareholders. A full-time worker should be able to cover their nutritional needs from their salary.
