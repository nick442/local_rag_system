If you aim to help the middle class (business) change the fact a middle class business pays 39.9% and a Fortune 500 pays 35%. Or supposed to pay that is. What waste is going to be found that adds up to the loss of hundreds of billions? You might as well say none when it comes down to it. Taxing apple 90% after 10 billion profit would help the economy. It would either force them to pay 40b extra in wages or give it to the government so they can hire people.
