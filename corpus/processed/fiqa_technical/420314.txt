The only difference that I can think of is that some business checks have two signature lines. The look and feel of a business check used to be more important. So a big check with two signatures and a machine-imprinted amount was a way to screen out fraudulent transactions. Nowadays the check is scanned and shredded, so it's probably not a big deal for 90% of your transactions.
