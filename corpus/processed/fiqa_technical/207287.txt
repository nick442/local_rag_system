Sure, just saying. It does exist. Also I don't understand why people need to return stuff so much. Only thing I can see it being needed so much is people buying something solely to use it for a one time use then getting their money back. Or simply over shopping and not controlling their budget and need their money back after they realize they spent too much on shit they don't need. I mean, if I need to buy something, I do some research, find the best product for the price and get the best offer the first time. Unless it's broken or defective I've never had to return anything. Then again I'm also not a compulsive shopper that blows my budget on shit I don't need. I don't know. Doesn't seem like a make or break feature for me and won't sway which service I use either way.
