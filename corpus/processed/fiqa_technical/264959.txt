If you knew more about how the Walmart Marketplace operates with its buggy software sellers use and how it is constantly taking down listings of item for sale, I wonder if that opinion would change. A lot of 3rd party sellers on Walmart.com are having big issues with not being able to list their inventory on the site due to Walmart constantly taking down offers of items that do not compete with Walmart, discouraging sellers from the platform.
