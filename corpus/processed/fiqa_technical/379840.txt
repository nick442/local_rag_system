"Where did I suggest otherwise? What are you talking about? Prossesing aids that exist in small quantities don't count against the 100%. There are limits in place to prevent abuse. 99.98% is close enough. That pic is dumb too. It says ""100 juice,"" not ""100% strawberry kiwi juice."" The latter is impossible anyway. Fortunately, ingredients are listed right there for anyone to see, thanks to Federal labeling laws. It even says ""Flavored blend of.. with other natural flavors and ingredients"" on the front. Not sure how anyone could really be confused. It is pretty telling that there's more ""natural flavors"" than strawberry or kiwi juice concentrate. Just how concentrated are they? But again, fortunately it is clearly labeled."
