..okay, dude, at *least* read up on Title VII.. I mean, I know this will *also* get downvoted, but there are some pretty big exemptions in it. > (j) The term “religion” includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee’s or prospective employee’s religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business. Downvote the sheer facts of law. I know you want to. But considering this business is made up predominantly of Christians and they're using the business as ministry, it would be more or less impossible to accommodate a non-religious person into the mix, unless they were absolutely separate from everything the company did (like the building caretaker example).
