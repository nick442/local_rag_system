Of fucking course you do. It's a model. Your trying to develop an equation that represents the distribution of data for a stochastic process. I have a random source, assuming data samples are stationary how can I develop a model of the distribution of those samples? One way is to take N samples from that process and fit it to a particular distribution, e.g. Poisson, Gaussian, etc. Now I have a mechanism to predict further samples from my random process. Next step, look at the next M samples. Do the N+M samples faithfully fit my model? No, well then I have a problem with my model. It's not Gaussian, or poisson, or whatever. This is undergrad stuff.. And the model was clearly wrong. He was off by many percentage points in key swing states. The cognitive dissonance is trying to bend the world to fit your failed model. What they tried to do was cook the data with a purposely flawed model which used likely voter models from the first Obama election even in the face of continually mounting evidence that the methodology was flawed.
