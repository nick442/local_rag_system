Thanks for responding. Ive been weighing my options and i still have quite a ways to go before im MIG/TIG/stick certified. But i am actually leaning more towards focusing on welding first and foremost because its faster money. If i get on my cousins crew i could potentially make close to 50-60k my first year (and thats just as a welders helper, not an actual welder) therefore, theres potential to advance to an actual welding job where i could make 100k+ (hopefully i have some luck and get that opportunity early in my career). That will give me time to pay off my student loans, all the money my family has helped me with, buy a house which will eventually become another income, and even save A LOT after thats all paid off! I think thats the safer option for me starting off and then ill have more money to invest in local buisnesses such as the pizza joint and most likely open a welding shop a little later. I just need to bust ass and make as much money as possible for the next 4 or 5 years so i can settle down and not travel for work as much. Nothing is set in stone yet and obviously im weighing all options but i wanted to get opinions on the subject. Especially because the pizza joint expanding idea was just presented to me the other day.
