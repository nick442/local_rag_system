I would expect so--the block from spending funds probably does not put a block in place for receiving funds. But ask your bank. Expect a 50% chance that they give you the wrong answer. (Some banks are better than others, but on average this is how often I have found bank employees to be incorrect about anything nonstandard). It may help to ask the bank how often it happens and who actually sorts out problems with blocked cards--and then talk to that person. Then you should only expect a 25% chance that they are wrong.
