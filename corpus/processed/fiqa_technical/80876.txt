Wall Street is livid because WF is their competitor. WF is mostly an investment bank - they make the majority of their money from equities, bonds, currency trading, corporate services, etc. Small time auto loans aren't a huge portion of what they do. Why would something that's 1% of their business cause a 15% drop?
