"Yea. I know the dimensions too. And it is the exact same wood because it is all imported from the US. The Japanese mills cut wood to mm, but the imported dimensional lumber from the US is cheaper - but not used in house framing whatsoever - people use it for decks and sheds and benches and whatnot. Having the ""name"" for the board be a dimension the board isn't - and not display the actual dimensions as well is lame. That is the key point I have learned being here in Japan. They have an array of 2x4 6,8,10,12, &16ft boards labeled as such and the mm right below them. When I buy 30x40mm thin lumber, that lumber is 30x40 *exactly*, there is no assumption the actual dimension is smaller. The fact that you need to know that the actual dimensions is smaller for US dimensional lumber is both traditional and asinine. ""Inches"" means nothing to Japanese people. They don't know the actual dimensions are wrong. So it never bothers them - everything is displayed in *actual* millimeters, so they are not affected by such weirdness. 2x4 lumber is common and well understood by most people in the US. But they should also have the exact dimensions displayed as well- because ""most"" isn't ""all""."
