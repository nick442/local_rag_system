"Sorry no. I don't like to hear that the difference between me and the bum on the street is ""luck."" Luck certainly makes a difference of one or two notches on the pay scale, or a few years here or there in your career. But hard work and good choices make the most of the luck we're given. Far too many piss that luck away with poor choices or no work and then look on with envy at those ""lucky bastards"" who made it big."
