"So some background here - when corporations, large ones have to deal with tax, they generally try to avoid as much tax as possible. Since there are places that are ""tax havens"" where there is less to even no tax on profit, a lot of money gets routed there to avoid taxes in other places (US or other unfavorable countries). The problem with this from an IRS/government view is that they keep losing millions/billions of dollars in money because of this. I think the corporate federal tax rate is around 35% and that is without state taxes. Unfortunately when you have less and less money at home - less investment at home happens. Corporations stop doing business at home because they have more money somewhere else - and it makes sense to move more of the company to where the money is or to more favorable tax locations. Even worse - the corporation might just ""save"" its money somewhere else and kill all reinvestment - thus the money is effectively dead to the rest of the economy. There is a lot of talk about a 'one-time' repatriation tax to allow companies that have dodged their tax burdens to have their money come back to the US (and thus can be used locally) at 10% instead of 35% since there is theroretically a vast amount of cash that would be injected into the US economy. The government is hoping this stimulation will help GDP grow, taxes grow, and help the economy as a whole. In reality, it will reward corporations that broke the law (even though everyone does it), and probably just go into savings accounts here in the US - and not be the ""silver bullet"" to the economy on verge of collapse again."
