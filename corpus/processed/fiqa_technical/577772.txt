"A coworker put the idea in my head ""what if one day we wake up and thousands of pissed off young people are defaulting on their student loans""? It's Crazy I know but out of curiosity I started doing homework on this and within one paragraph of Investopedia reading, I had questions. 1). How is a loan an asset? I'm the bank and I have 100$. I loan Jimmy 20$. With interest I expect him to pay back 25$. My books sure as shit shouldn't say I'm worth 105$ or even 100$! I gave away 20$. I'm worth 80$ right? Sure I can put it on my books that Jimmy owes me 20$ but I cannot be acting like I HAVE that 20$ can I? Isn't that how the 08' crash happened? Explain why it makes sense to consider a loan an asset. Is the risk of default accounted for? Which leads me to question 2. 2). I came across this phrase: "" because default risk is not transferred with the asset."" Does that mean that when these institutions pass around the loan, the risk doesn't go with it? How is it possible? Assuming loan has the risk of default priced in (which I still don't fully get See #1), how can it possibly be sold in such a way that the risk of default is detached? I am guess I am trying to dig around and learn as much as I can about student loans because the initial theory is not far-fetched to me."
