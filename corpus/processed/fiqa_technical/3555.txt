>This is actual socialism, you understand that, right? Did you forget to read the part of socialism that defines it as workers controlling the means of production? This is not socialism. Socialism is the collective ownership of the means of production. I'm not advocating that. I said the exact opposite. I advocate the private ownership of the means of production. I also advocate the distributed private ownership of the means of production. The more capitalists and entrepreneurs, the better. The scenario i described helps distribute the means of production to more individuals. >Ya, and this is also exactly socialism's end goal The ends are one thing, the means are another.
