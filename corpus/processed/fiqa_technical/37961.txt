"> The article is dead on that cable is grossly overpriced. Cable isn't grossly overpriced. If it were, more people would be canceling their subscriptions, and/or the cable/fiber/dish networks would be offering discounted *à la carte* plans to steal subscribers. I would pay what I pay now to get what I watch now. That's true of most people or they'd stop subscribing. *À la carte* isn't popular with the cable companies not because they'd have to charge less, but because it would artificially limit their window into your living room (obviously they *can* technically provide you with hundreds of channels, since they do today). Take AMC, for example, which has gone from a third or fourth tier channel to at worst a second tier channel on the strength of *Mad Men*, *Breaking Bad*, etc. How much would the audience of those shows have been limited (and thus your cable company's ability to sell ads been limited) if people had to call up to add $4/month to their bill rather than just flip the channel when they heard about a cool new show? Even in a purely ""on demand"" world, how do you build a show's brand? Offer the first four episodes for free, then start charging? That's a big cliff to fall off. I can assure you that when we are living in an on demand world, you'll be paying at least what you're paying now. My guess is that around the time Apple gets into the TV business, your cable plan will become a ""smart TV"" plan, with a unified data/video cost, just like your smartphone plan. Then the cable companies won't care so much where you're getting your content, whether it's traditional channels or streaming."
