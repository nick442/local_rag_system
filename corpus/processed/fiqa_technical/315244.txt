Let me get this straight, if I'm smart and save money to last times between jobs using my own money, I shouldn't take the unemployment given to me? If I'm reckless and save nothing on my own, I should be bailed out though. No-, That's ridiculous. Of course I'll take the unemployment, it's given whether I have 0 dollars or 1,000,000 dollars.
