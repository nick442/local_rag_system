What would you consider good/worthwhile, and why it would give you satisfaction to benefit society? I've done various things that can be considered good/worthwhile, but the more I'm around people, the less I want to contribute anything to their well-being and the more I want to lash out at them. Unfortunately, getting substantial money generally requires interacting with people and showing up. I would enjoy such things as profiting off Target gift cards, if I knew about the promotion or if the idea occurred to me, because it's profit for relatively little effort. The money that I've worked hard for doesn't mean that much to me because the cost was too high.
