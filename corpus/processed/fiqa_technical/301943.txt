as a company owner in Europe, that is correct. the employee would be gone with (iirc) 80% pay for a full year. fuuuuuuuck that.. edit: what employees also mostly don't realize, a bunch of similar ages females create a lot of drama. seriously, I'm far from sexist, but it always turns out like that. if you have 3+ girls sitting together there will always be drama at some point. and I mean bad vibe karma that makes you so angry you just want to fire them all out of frustration. but let me clarify, I do hire women, and I pay them the same amount I would pay a male employee. if you can work like a man, and there is no reason you can't, you're paid the same and you're treated the same. I just got hyper selective of the characters I hire.
