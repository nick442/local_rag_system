">Could that be that you have been SOLD the notion that antitrust laws are a failed and discredited policy.. by those intent on protecting private cartels? (Republicans). Republicans commonly use free market economic truths when it suits their agendas, so I can see how you might be sensitive to that possibility, but no. >Could it be that the enforcement arm of the government (like the SEC) have been weakened and captured by lobbyists in a revolving door between the private sector and the the government (facilitated by Democrats too)? yes, by design, by those who make careers of screwing the rest of us through designing arguments that set us against one another. > In capitalism, unchecked greed leads to the destructive behavior of endless accumulation of resources at the expense of others.. No, ""greed"" is never unchecked in the free market, excess profits ultimately prevent it, unless the government enables it, of course. Monopolies are a government creation, they are the monopolists of violence after all, so I suppose it comes naturally. > How does this environment protect the small business or how does it benefit consumers? More competition and smaller firms that result from said competition, as well as best utilization of resources is best for consumers and society as a whole. It's dynamic, that's important, much more responsive to new factors than government could ever hope to be. Politicians are really bad at adapting to voter preferences in a timely fashion apparently."
