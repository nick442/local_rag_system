"We'll, he provides some figures on the burden on lower income households. It kind of makes sense. Even if both middle class households and lower income households consume the same relative amounts of ""sinful"" goods, there will likely be a higher burden on the poor. It's exasperated by the high tax rate on those goods. The only way to remove that higher burden is for the poor to ""consume less vice"" than the affluent. That's an awkward position to hold. It doesn't make sin taxes bad public policy. They're an effective tax strategy that can be dedicated to helping provide other necessary social services. But, they can be regressive and push other values at the same time."
