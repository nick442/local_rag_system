The CCAPM attempts to link asset prices/equity risk premiums to the 'intertemporal substitution of consumption' instead of the normal beta. So essentially what it's trying to say is you prefer to smooth consumption, you hate volatile consumption patterns, therefore you demand higher returns in booms and will settle for lower returns in downturns. (It may sound counter-intuitive at first, but think in terms of marginal utilities, in booms your marginal utility is lower as you're already well off, therefore you demand more of an asset). The CCAPM tries to link asset prices to real economic theory (consumption) whereas CAPM is derived from the assumption that investors only care about mean and variance of returns (no real link to the real side of the economy). There are almost no real world applications for the CCAPM. Empirically it is almost a complete failure, complex extensions have only gotten it so far, see the 'equity premium puzzle' by Mehra and Prescott (1985).
