Sounds like 'up-selling'. You can harden yourself into being a 'tough sell' but it takes time and a lot of shopping. The quickest way to put up a defense is to never ever make a purchase over $100 without 'sleeping on it'. Just walk away, tell them you'll think it over, and go do some more research. Don't go back into a dealership or store that has hit you with guilt or pressure or a crazy price or whatever. Find a no-haggle or no-frills source, or even a source to buy a used version of the item you want.
