If I claim that I have a goose that lays golden eggs, that does not make it so. What a nation _claims_ has absolutely no relevance when you look at the actual facts. Nazi germany committed genocide no matter what they claimed, and the Soviet union was as capitalist as any other country, no matter what they claimed, with the added bonus that you couldn't even work your way up in society, the classes of society were decided by The Party. Pinochet was a free market dictator, yet you never hear him used as an example of how free market policies automatically turns into authoritarianism, genocide and a police state. And who would say that? It's absurd, and it's equally absurd to say that socializing schools or hospitals in a automatically leads to Gulags. Of course, an expansion of the state mixed with a dictator would probably be surprising if it _didn't_ lead to repression, regardless of claimed ideology. The one thing authoritarian countries have in common is a big, militarized state, the illusion of ideology always comes in second. Not all flavors of socialism wants a state, mind you. So in one way, ironically, a country like the US is probably closer to authoritarianism than a country like mine (Sweden), even though we are clearly more socialist.
