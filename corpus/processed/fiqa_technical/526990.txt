True .. I left BofA about 2 years ago. It wasn't easy but setting up new accounts at the credit union took an hour, then updating all my auto-payments took a few hours to change. I left BofA up for a couple months just in case I missed something (I actually found I missed a CC auto-payment). After those months, I called BofA and cancelled all my accounts. Was it easy? No, but you're right - it's work (and worth it!).
