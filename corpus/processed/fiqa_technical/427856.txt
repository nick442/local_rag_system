I had that discussion with my girlfriend yesterday. She is working in bespoke tailoring. There are already machines that scan your body, the work is way more precise than an experienced tailor. You have digital CAD software that could make up the pattern. If someone would take some time and do some more programming, you could literally make a bespoke suit without a tailor. So here is the problem, the question was, how to do you apply certain styles to certain body types so it looks good. Not every style looks good on you, so it's the tailor's job to do it. Styles used to be something subjective to me, till I started getting more involved with design and then I realised style can be objectified. I truly believe that style is even quantifiable. If found yesterday at least 7-10 data points that correlate to each other and could be used to adjust style to a certain body type. Creativity is not a uniquely human feature anymore.
