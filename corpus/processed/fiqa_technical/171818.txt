"I hear that many women gets tricked with these MLM because it spreads in their workplace and everyone else gets in to them. Also some mothers want to work at home in flexible schedules for raising a child. MLM companies tricks these women in to spending thousands on these scams. Also friend is now really into MLM but he needs to stop. I mean he already had a massive fight with his friends and families about this and now he's hanging out with MLM people all the time. Also he's losing tons of money and it's terrible. I have to tell him to stop but he's completely brainwashed by MLM company in to thinking that everyone who rejects or question MLM is ""ignorant bigot who can't adapt to innovative business"" so it's really hard."
