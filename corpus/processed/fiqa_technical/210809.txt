Retail jobs are not easy to get, *especially* if you're skilled (and advertise that fact). Retail managers don't want to hire someone that's overqualified as they know that person will continue to look for something else and will leave the moment they find something more on their level. They also don't want someone that will threaten their authority. All they want is someone that will show up on time and not cause problems.
