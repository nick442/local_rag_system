"As was suggested here, I checked with the state for ""Unclaimed Funds,"" and despite the fact that I had already done so and found nothing, the funds were now there to be retrieved. So, the takeaway here is, keep checking periodically, it might just take a bit for things to settle out. This link is endorsed by NJ State, and covers much of the US: http://www.missingmoney.com/.
