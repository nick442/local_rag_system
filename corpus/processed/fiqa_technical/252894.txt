"Alright, a few things: 1. The ""crisis"" is likely a recession type thing. There are arguments to be made for avoiding debt (less ""hurt"" from a downturn in sales), or for taking on the debt (rack up the sales early, take the hit, then press on). I'm in the latter category; everyone's going to take a hit, not everyone is going to have the inertia from previous rounds to sustain themselves through it. 2. ""In that case I might just hold off until before that date.."" This only makes sense if you know exactly when it's going to happen. If you don't, then you're making a large gamble. Even if you do, you're sacrificing growth for security. 3. The balance sheet shouldn't have *too* much of an effect. Debt loads will. Debt coverage and interest coverage will. 4. Debt is a tool. It amplifies losses AND gains. A company with a lot of debt and a good sales year will outperform a company with no debt and an excellent sales year. You're in a closed-system of competition. You need to be hyper-aggressive. 5. **""There are only two things a company does: innovation and marketing. The rest are all cost.""** 6. Assuming this is a manufacturing type of company (i.e. Capsim), pay attention to your R&D acutely, max out your marketing budget, and pay close attention to your capacity and production. Read the rules to ensure they make sense, and make a model/spreadsheet if it makes sense. Coordinate with team members rigorously. 7. **Win.**"
