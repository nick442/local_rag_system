"US-Australian tax treaty limits the tax the US can levy on interest payments to Australian residents at 10%. However, that is the ""worst"" situation. There are several exempted situations which your specific example may fall into where you wouldn't need to deal with the US taxes at all. I suggest contacting a tax accountant proficient in that treaty and the Australian tax law. You will still be obviously paying taxes in Australia."
