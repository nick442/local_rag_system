Why would you reference Batman as pro-war propaganda? I feel like you haven't actually seen the movies. As far as Hollywood being a cancer, again I feel like your connection to the process and the product are so far removed that you can't really accurately comment. Everyone should hate DRM. Because at its core it aknowledges that the consumer and the producer can't have an honest relationship when it comes to digital content. It's a flawed outlook and every **major** supplier that's gone against it has been successful. That doesn't mean the current system of getting stuff made is completely ass-backwards and a cancer on art. It's fun and easy to hate on the industry, but I know that if they didn't have such a strong filter what would be showing up on the Silverscreen would feel like you shoulda just stayed home, saved your $10, and watched Youtube clips of idiots. Their business practices are slow to change, but that's the nature of any billion dollar industry. This is not meant to be an endorsement of SOPA or Protect IP, but I think we should all admit that while Hollywood is often full of shit shows, and recycled garbage it is a far better situation than if [this whiny bitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MA0eW8yyw) and his Youtube kin were given time on the Silverscreen. I honestly don't care all that much about the legislation. I don't think the regulations it puts up will last more than 6 months before every professional internet privateer figures out a way around cobbled together idiotic legislation. Honestly, how many tech savy people exist in Washington?
