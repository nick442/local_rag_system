Insurance is not health care. Insurance is a financial instrument designed to protect the insured from short term shocks caused by some calamity by spreading out the cost over time. Not covering someone with a pre-existing condition is similar to an car-insurance company refusing to pay for repairing a damaged car, where the damage was caused prior to obtaining insurance. Not to be rude but failure to understand that utterly simple basic financial concept is exactly the sort of willful ignorance I'm talking about. What you are interested in is 'justice'. Someone was harmed by a desease which is tragic for the individual, and in some sense 'cosmically unfair'. It isn't however the fault of the insurance company that the person didn't purchase a policy beforehand. It would in fact be unfair to existing policy holders if the insurance company pays such claims, as it would raise their rates to cover those who will now rationally choose not to get insurance until after they have a claim.
