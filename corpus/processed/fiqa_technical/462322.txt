Thanks medikit, your answer is 100% correct. Bank of America was forced to accept TARP funds because the US Govt did not want there to be a split between banks who took TARP and those who didn't. Bank of America did NOT need the money, hence they were really unhappy with the strings it came attached with. Rumor has it that they also wanted out of the Countrywide deal after looking at the books, but they were forced by Treasury not to pull out of the deal (a pull-out would signal that things are really bad). The govt offered some deal sweeteners, deal went ahead, then the govt spent the next few years suing Bank of America due to loans originated by Countrywide prior to the acquisition. The CEO ended up having to resign based on the shitshow that was that deal.
