>This is further supported by the fact that when I go into a Costco it's nearly impossible to find anyone to help me, and when I do, they are just about useless. I have to completely disagree with this one. It is true that it can be an effort to find help, but in all cases they leave what they are doing and walk with me to help me find whatever I was looking for. Besides I don't think it's any easier to find help at either Walmart or Target.
