"You don't want to set up your investment account as a savings or spending (budget) account. There are a couple of reasons. First, investment account balances change daily based on the market. If you set it up as a budget account, then your budget category balances would need to have money added or removed from them daily as the market value changes. Second, because you are investing for retirement, this money will be untouchable for many years; there is no need to include that in your spending budget. Instead, enter your monthly investment amount as an expense transaction (not a transfer to another budget account). If, for example, you are sending $400 per month to your retirement account, just enter that as a monthly $400 expense out of your checking account, assigning it to a Retirement category. That money then leaves your budget. If you want to see the value of your investment account in YNAB (so that your Net Worth is accurate), add the account as an investment account. The value will not affect your budget categories, but it will affect the net worth on the ""All Accounts"" page. Either set it up as an online account so that the balance will update automatically, or add it as a manual account and simply update the balance manually when you get your monthly statement."
