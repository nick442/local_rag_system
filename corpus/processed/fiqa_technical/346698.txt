"Here is where you missed it in that article: "" The FCC is right to reject obsolete Ma Bell era regulation that denies this basic fact."" Renders most of your reply moot. This is in fact stating for removal of NN. Its hidden among all of the anti-monopoly screaming. Cleverly I might add. By the way its right above your highlighted line. Edit: in case your not understanding it, those Title 2 ""ma bell"" regulations went into place in the 1930s I believe."
