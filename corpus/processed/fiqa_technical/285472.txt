"> Seven U.S. states currently don't have an income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. So to be clear, you were talking about just income tax in your original comment? Or do those states have no other forms of tax whatsoever? I am still confused because you just said ""state tax"" in your original comment and did not specify a specific type of taxation like ""income tax"" or ""property tax"" or ""business tax"" or ""sales tax"" within the state."
