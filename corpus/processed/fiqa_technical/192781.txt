"Out of Pocket actually means any small expense which is paid for at the time, by the person who gets the product or service, and usually implies a payment to cover it at a later date. i.e. ""I am claiming all my out of pocket expenses this month. It most certainly does NOT mean ""unavailable"". At least not to any human I have had contact with in the last 20 years."
