"Aside from the funky/retro thing, Polaroid still has one thing that hasn't been accomplished with digital: Instant unaltered records. Insurance companies used polaroid film because a polaroid in a file was a guarantee that the picture was an accurate representation. With developed film, you could always ""edit"" things out in the darkroom. With digital, the path from shutter to print offers more option for cheating than every before. We *can* fix this in the digital world, but haven't so far - and until we do, Polaroid still has a place."
