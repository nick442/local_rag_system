"Asking stupid questions scares people capable of rational thought. Everything you've said here is evident of a person with a very warped view of the world. By all means, go ahead and live out in the wilderness, don't pay taxes, and be as happy as you want. But you better not use any roads, mail, EMS, sewage, running water, etc that the ""theft"" provides you. See how long you last."
