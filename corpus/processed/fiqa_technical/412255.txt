The economy is not zero sum. Just because one group is experiencing exponential growth, doesn't mean they're exploiting others to achieve it. To figure out whether or not those people deserve their wealth we have to examine exactly how it was accomplished. Did they lobby to shut out competitors? Did they take advantage of IP laws? Did they receive subsidies? Did they benefit from tax credits? Did they use eminent domain? And for each of these questions, follow up with the question of how much these actions affected their bottom line profitability. Anything less than this level of examination is lazy analysis, and should be regarded as such.
