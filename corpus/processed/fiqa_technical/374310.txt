">In both cases you make exactly the same pledges and have exactly the same obligations. Yes, I got that. If I didn't pay you back your lunch money you're probably not going to report me to the major credit bureaus. You may reserve the right to call me a deadbeat, however. All joking aside, the bank is more likely to spell out the penalties for default than the individual lender because the individual is relying on moral/social obligation to ensure repayment (often unwisely so). The business that lends to you harbors no such illusions, however. Of course it trusts in the rule of law, insofar as any nonhuman entity can ""trust"" in anything, but it is much more interested in managing its risk. >Its insurance also expects that a certain percentage of banks will be robbed. Which in your universe makes bankrobbing kinda okay I guess. Are you really equating people who default on their loans with people who rob banks? >The bank does trust in pacta sunt servanda and the rule of the law. Otherwise it would never do any business with anyone. So there are no banks in Russia, or China, or anywhere else where the ""rule of law"" is subject to interpretation?"
