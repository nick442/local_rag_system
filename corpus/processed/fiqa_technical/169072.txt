">When you look at principles, whether you're a 'true' socialist, a watered-down SocialistLite or somwhere in between, the ideas are still anti-human. I suggest you learn about a subject from the prolific authors of that subject, not people who claim to know it and bash it. Your argumentation is offensive, but I'll give you a reply anyway. I know perfectly well what laissez-faire is, because I am in a way you are not also inclined to read texts of people who I do not agree with. I deliberately do not agree with laissez-faire, even though I believe in personal freedom as I am some variant of anarcho-socialist, but I don't believe in preserving the existing class relations and I don't believe laissez-faire to be fair for this exact reason; introducing it in the world today would only cement existing class differences, class differences brought on by the exploitation of the working class, which is the only way you can get really rich. I suggest you actually read up on libertarian socialism and stop throwing around words like ""anti-human"", because you're quite honestly offending me, because obviously you're calling me ""anti-human"" as well, so even though I know you think you're playing some kind of enlightenment game by lecturing me on laissez-faire, a system that anyone who passed high school here in Sweden knows about, please stop and have some respect. I don't need to be lectured on the alternatives, I know them and I've chosen my beliefs."
