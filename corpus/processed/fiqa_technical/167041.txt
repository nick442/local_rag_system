It is fully coupled with three channel system and makes it so easy to reach in a higher range. With this you are guaranteed to make the descent and flight up, forward and back as well as left and right. This shows that you can also make reverse flight tips with less effort. It comes with a gyro system, which gives the heli sufficient stability. The included remote control includes a trimmer as well as the mobile controls. The main function of the trimmer is that it completely compensates for any negative orientation. For example, if the helicopter appears to lean further to the left, you can easily turn the trimmer to compensate. Also, keep in mind that RC helicopters work with infrared controls. This means they tend to be flown more slowly in direct sunlight.
