"Yes digital can definitely technically a higher quality.. but sometimes it's just not that pleasurable hearing a digital files pristine 19,000 Hz sounds right next to moments of perfect silence.. You rarely ever heard perfect silence in nature.. there is always some kind of background noise.. I think this is a big part of why people say ""vinyl is warmer"" .. because there is plenty of white noise.. and all of the sounds aren't always perfectly crystal clear.. Of course it's a matter of taste, I'm just saying for certain recordings that crystal clear instruments at every frequency can be kinda jarring in the same way that being seated too close to the brass section of an orchestra could be unpleasant. A lot of Music production software has low bit filters specifically because less perfect sounds can be more pleasing sometimes.. distortion pedals and different acoustic treatments to ""muffle sounds"" would be other examples of when musicians purposely create ""lo-fi"" sound."
