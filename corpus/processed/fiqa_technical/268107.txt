Yeah, you can presume anything you want. I'm not going to spend the rest of the night refuting a wall of words that will only generate another wall of words that I will then have to spend the rest of the night refuting. So by sheer might of bullshit, you win. You are right about one thing though, Somalia is an example of a failed government. You seem to want our government to fail as well. What I meant by saying that Somalia is a government free utopia is that they do not collect taxes, they do not regulate their businesses, and they have no influence on the lives of their citizens, which as far as I can tell is exactly what you are advocating for the US. Do you know what to call it when people structure their interactions in order to cooperate? The word is Government.
