You ARE naive in that you are concerned about employees who have already choosen for the most part their career fates. Newsflash buddy, unskilled workers are at the largest risk of becoming unemployed in an increasingly unstable economy. I realize you come from a world of lifetime employment, benefits, retirement, pensions (what's that?!) but that simply isnt the world anymore. For the last few decades this country's potential has been squandered and this is the end result. Very little opportunity for an increasing majority of participants and crushing overhead destroying all but the most profitable and sustainable business models.
