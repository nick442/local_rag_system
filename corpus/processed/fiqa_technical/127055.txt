"Sounds fishy. If you're not sure what the job is, that's always a big red flag. The rep from the company should always provide a clear, bullshit-free job description. ""basically a sales job"" = red flag for ""mindless labor camp that they just need warm bodies for"" 'opportunity to ""make a lot of money""' = red flag for **not** an opportunity to make a lot of money"
