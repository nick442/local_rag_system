Young vs old doesn't really make a difference. What's in play in the Roth/After Tax vs Traditional/Pretax decision is your current marginal tax bracket versus your probable taxation in retirement. Since your company matches something on the pretax account it makes sense to max out the pretax contribution match amount before considering roth contributions. If the match is something like 50% of your contribution up to 3% of your salary, that's an instant 50% return on your contribution and you can't really beat that.
