"Sorry, i always use my phone when using reddit and i'm also not a native speaker. Basically what i tried to say is; The reason the whole world using this economic system is because when people divide their work force and everyone specializes on one thing they are much better at it, gain more experience, become more efficient and basically it is just more productive. Thats why everyone has a job. But jobs has few downsides, most prominent one being making all these repetitive tasks, one can lose their purpose. This is the situation for the poor community. People who do not earn a lot of money and doesn't have a good statue can be depressed by going to same place everyday, doing the same thing for 40-50 years, for..?The reason is, everyone is doing repetitive tasks, even if it is something you love (personally i would hate my hobbies if i had to do them everyday not for enjoyment but for money) but some are being rewarded much more. My goal of telling all these is, this is not a perfect economic system but it is the most efficient one today. People need motivation if they are going to do the same thing all the time. The motivation could be different than money and statue but it is much easier to convince the masses these are important so the machine could work. Only a fool with no regard to history would tell this is the best economic system and it will never change since world is always changing, 5 years ago top10 companies were banks and investment companies now they are tech/internet. My belief is that for now the system is structured and will stay the same until; •War ,which changes the economy. War economy needs other stuff compared to what we are producing normally. Motivation also changes in these times, it's not money anymore but for ""your countries sake"" and ""pride"". •Different political system which is unusual to most since it is the economic change in classes which makes the political system to change."
