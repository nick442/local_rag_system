The only real competition I see in the US market is in the pre-paid service providers. But they are just piggybacking off the networks of the larger carriers. To have an actual functioning market they would have to be some legal framework that requires all carriers to share their networks at some reasonable fee rate and then put value added on top of that. That is pretty much how the POTS worked. We recognized that as a nation it is plainly ridiculous to compete on who can hang the most wires. We lost that lesson and now we're letting carriers compete almost purely on who can erect the most towers. AT&T and Verizon are essentially the same company offering the same service. The entire basis of their competition is who can get the most right of way access to install the most towers. it's crazy.
