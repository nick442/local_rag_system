In some jurisdictions you can donate the development rights. You and the family still own it, but nothing can ever be built on it. In some cases you will still be able to build a cabin or similar structure on a few acres, but the bulk has to be left natural. The advantage is that by giving away the logging or other development rights the land loses much of its value, thus reducing the tax value of the land. There are some hoops that you need to jump through, but this is not an unusual transaction. Another choice it to see if the land touches any similar conservation areas. It can be possible to donate the land to the government or other conservation group, but it would revert to the family if they ever tried to sell or develop the land. Because you don't own it you would not have to pay taxes, but hikers, canoeists and campers could still use it. By donating the land to the same organization a your neighbors it can streamline the paperwork for people who want to through hike.
