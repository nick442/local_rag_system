Depends very much on where you live. Seasonal credits dovetail nicely with hydro generation, which usually peaks in winter and fades in summer, so solar net metering helps fill a gap that would otherwise be fossil fueled. Nevertheless, utilities in hydropowered conservative states like Arizona and Idaho have succeeded in hobbling grid-tied solar by blocking state mandates on credits for seasonal surpluses.
