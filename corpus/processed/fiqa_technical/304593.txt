I love the bold accusatory *YOU*! This is extremely A - B here. Everything you've just stated is ENTIRELY your own opinion, which is so over generalized & filled with conjecture that I won't even address it further. If you're unable to see past your own assumptions & listen to opposing view points, many of which are completely valid - you are a part of the problem. Thinking the way you do where (I'm right & everyone else is CLEARLY wrong & a bigot or whatever) is not productive, helpful or even close to an attempt at teamwork. Please think about that.
