Hmmm. I hadn't considered that energy usage would be considered confidential. How about asking a nearby neighbor to share their next bill. If it's higher or lower than yours, just scale the history up or down accordingly. Other than that, the utility company might offer its own level billing plan where they handle the estimate and offer you the same payment each month.
