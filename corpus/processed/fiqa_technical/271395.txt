You are both right and wrong. A few key things - I'm not charging the government body I work for, it's a free implementation - I ensured I do all the work on my own time, not company time. I live somewhere where most government employees work multiple jobs, so this isn't uncommon. In fact, my government body actually does often hire contractors who are also employed. - I don't live in the US, things are somewhat less different where I am. - It is certainly not illegal, and I would even argue that it is even somewhat ethical. My work saved my employer (the tax payer) a significant amount of money, which is a net positive. The service is of high quality, and I did not break any employment agreements or laws in the process. - I hired a lawyer to double check everything.
