There are a number of ways and it all depends on your concentration and range of skills (or skills you're willing to develop). As for involving your wife .. things that can be done locally for neighbours is always a good idea. The most important thing is not to spend too much time or cash on anything that will take a long time to pay off. That excludes writing your own iPhone apps, for example, which would take long hours of development and much marketing (and luck) to be successful. Good luck and congrats.
