They pay for it with tax money. Why would they have to make people work for free that doesn't even make sense. Thats what taxes are for to make life better for the citizens of the country. I don't think the concept we're discussing would leave people with no responsibility, even providing food and housing there will always be things people need outside whats provided. Removing the penalty of starving to death isn't going to cause the breakdown of society, or overpopulation, or whatever you seem to be afraid of. For one thing most people just don't want tonnes of kids and the ones that do have tonnes without consideration of the consequences already. Your example here seems kind of random and extreme and doesn't represent any group of people I've ever met.
