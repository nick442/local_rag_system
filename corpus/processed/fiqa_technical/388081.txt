Right, but the point is that some professions, such as attorneys, can be paid hourly yet still not be eligible for overtime. I was responding to the blanket response that insinuated all hourly employees who are skilled are eligible for overtime - this is not always true. And you are incorrect as to agreeing to being exempt on a contractual basis. If a non-skilled worker goes to an employer and agreed to work as an exempt dishwasher at $7.50 an hour, the employer will have trouble with FLSA whether or not it was agreed. To say otherwise would be counterintuitive to the purpose of the labor protections and would just be an unconscionable loophole to necessary worker protection laws.
