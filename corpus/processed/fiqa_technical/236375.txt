Okay I will asap. And yes, to getting the business off the ground. I've done all the marketing and will be for some time to come. Not just sweaty hands, but also ideas that shape our marketing strategies and also bringing in loyal customers that I personally know who are going to be consistent with us. But I'll talk to a lawyer and have that figured out. I just dont want to get screwed over and I'm new to this being only 19 so.
