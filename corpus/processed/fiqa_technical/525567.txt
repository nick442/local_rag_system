>while itâ€™s still probably too soon to talk about a tablet market separate from the iPad market I'm really tired of statements like this. It's absolutely absurd. Tablet market share is 60% IOS, 40% Android. Phone market share is 60% Android, 20% IOS, 20% everyone else. Pretending that the iPad is the only thing that matters in the tablet market is like pretending that the iPhone is irrelevant in the phone market.
