Let's be honest though; you would to if accepting reality meant that your way of life, your job, your grossly inflated salary, etc. just dried up over night. They're doing everything they can, hemorrhaging money buying law makers, paying lawyers, fighting tooth and nail to keep the dam from bursting. I can see why they'd do that, it makes sense. And the people who aren't at the top making millions a year in those respective area should also be terrified. The fallout from the newspapers was bad enough, swaths of people were laid off, wages were cut all around. It will not be a pretty sight to see when this happens to TV and Music. I imagine the Music industry will collapse first, mostly because they've been in the fight a lot longer than TV has, and so much new talent is actively avoiding them.
