That's a false analogy. If somebody took me somewhere to eat that made me sick, that's a direct reflection on their ability to recommend places to eat, but nothing else. If he's also a top notch electrician, I listen to him when he gives me electrical wiring advice, I just don't let him choose where we go for dinner. Tiel's presidential choice reflects his political knowledge, and not his ability to be on Facebook's board. Remember, he's not there to provide political insight, he's there to provide business insight, his area of expertise.
