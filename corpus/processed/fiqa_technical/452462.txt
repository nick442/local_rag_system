The trouble is not enough Americans today are willing to do hard physical work for low pay. At the same time, Americans aren't willing to pay more for things like landscaping and fruits and veggies. I would be delighted if we fixed our broken legal immigration system, but since we can't seem to do that, we get illegal immigrants, and every day both you and I use products they produced.
