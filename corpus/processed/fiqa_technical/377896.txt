Prices vary massively depending on what needs to be done. Could be as little as $100 for a press release to $10,000 per month retainer. What we can do for you is contact any journalist that has written about BBQ sauces in the last 6 months, and target specific regions if necessary. We can also do manual blogger outreach to gain coverage in the specific niches that may not give you lots of impressions, but are highly relevant. Yeah you can do outreach yourself, but it makes sense to outsource it to focus on more important things like making quality sauce
