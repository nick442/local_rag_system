New family home sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 369,000 for the month of May. This is somewhat higher than April and about 20% above May of 2011. However, this is lower -- in some case much lower -- than anytime from about 1962 to 2008. So, the good news is that new home sales are trending up slightly. The bad news is that they fell from ~1.4 million units in 2005, so we're down about 75% from those overheated days.
