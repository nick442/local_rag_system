Have a beef with your proof.. measuring at the county level is misleading. Baltimore county has some wealthy areas. It goes all the way up to the state line. There's plenty of more affluent pockets included in that. Same is true for Detroit, Wayne county includes many affluent areas. Rural counties however tend to be isolated and more uniform. If you're looking in Owsley Kentucky (poorest county per that article).. it's not really near anything resembling a major commerce area and there's no pockets of higher-value homes hidden anywhere like you find around major metro areas..
