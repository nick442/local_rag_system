You can use it for medical expenses even if you don't have a high deductible policy. It can cover prescriptions, copays, deductibles, co-insurance, dentist, orthodontics.. As long as it is being used for an approved medical expense there is no tax or penalty. Yes it doesn't save you on the monthly service charges but it does allow you to cut your medical expenses for a while.
