That's why I said, I'm sure the devices I use now aren't much better (hell, I have an app that collects location data and sends me Amazon gift cards and such in exchange, but I agreed to it), but I don't really see any purpose of Alexa besides additional data collection. The only think I could see it useful for is elderly or disabled people with poor motor function that may have trouble operating other devices.
