The assertion that Bolivians' palettes are somehow more sophisticated than dumb Americans' is silly. I don't think anybody actually thinks McDonalds makes good food. It's quick, cheap, and something associated with America, which despite what a lot of people seem to believe, is not a hated evil empire. Local franchises are also a simple and relatively inexpensive method for entrepreneurs to earn a decent wage and foster economic growth in otherwise under-performing sectors. McDonalds might have priced themselves out of the market in this case. Or maybe fast food just isn't part of the local culture. I've lived places where people thought the concept of going to a take out place and picking up food was just crazy weird. You either sit down for a big fancy meal at a restaurant or whip something up at home. What is this go out and pay for something substandard but quick? That model works well in the US where it seems people are always on the go in different directions and might not have time to cook. McDonalds seems to be good enough for our culture on the go and for a lot of countries around the world. Personally, I just don't like it, but I will eat a Wendy's triple with bacon once in a while.
