(I'm a bot) ***** > Congressional defense committees have approved shifting more than $400 million from other accounts into missile defense programs to clear the way for more ground-based interceptors, sensors and upgrades to Navy anti-missile vessels in the face of threats led by North Korea. > The shift of funds reflects a growing determination at the Pentagon and in Congress to bolster missile defenses as North Korea vows to perfect nuclear missiles that can hit the U.S. mainland as well as allies in Asia. > An additional $8 million is shifted to supplement the $219 million already budgeted to potentially increase the number of interceptors to 64 from the current 44; and $15 million would go to software upgrades to the Boeing-developed floating Sea-Based X-Band radar used to precisely track an intercontinental ballistic missile in mid-flight. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/74loz8/us_missile_defense_gets_400_million_after_north/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~223049 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **million**^#1 **request**^#2 **missile**^#3 **defense**^#4 **shift**^#5"
