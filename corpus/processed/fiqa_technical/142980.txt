"What's your take on that website? I find it to be somewhat grating. There are some nice people who want to work together and help others to get a good job, but I feel as though they are massively outnumbered by extremely aggressive jerks. You look at posts that say ""I go to HYP, 4.0 GPA and student body president. Do I have a shot at BB?"" and the replies are mostly ""nah bro, give up now"" and ""some people just weren't meant to be alpha"" and bullshit like that. I also feel like the blog posts give vague, conflicting information. I feel like I get very mixed messages on things like resume formatting and networking from that site."
