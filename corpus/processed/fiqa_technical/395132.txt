Now I remember why I don't read zero hedge. Allow me to summarize: 1) lots of people who write articles said so 2) Brazil concluded a currency deal with the Chinese government. Until China is willing to allow relatively free capital flows they just won't be able make it a major reserve currency. If political risk in all major reserve currencies is a problem, gold provides a better option than a country with an even more interventionist streak than the countries you're worried about. The final chart is just absurd. I'll leave it as an exercise to the readeea .
