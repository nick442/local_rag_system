Well now your going to have to justify the amount of money a student has to pay to get help via phone/text. The problem is you're trying to target only your school. Which limits your options. To add on top of it people are already providing it for free. My honest advice would be to move on from this project. Unless you can provide tutoring for free then leverage the people you meet for another business.
