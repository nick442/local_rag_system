You only have a chance of enacting meaningful political and social change and progress if you run on a platform of strong ideas that enjoy broad popular support, AND those ideas are actually good ones that solve real world problems without creating too many new ones, AND you have a team in place quickly that is competent, skilled and capable of deploying your agenda efficiently. Trump has none of those.
