"You're mostly correct, although I think you're missing something essential about no-arbitrage versus an arbitrage argument. Black-Scholes makes an arbitrage argument, which is that the value of an option should be the same as any portfolio that has identical cash flows, and this is generally a sound argument. Notice, however, that BS is ultimately an equilibrium model: it tells you the ""correct"" price of an option if the assumptions of BS hold, and doesn't necessarily match observed market prices. A no-arbitrage condition or model deliberately incorporates observed prices (or yields, or whatever) into the model, so that there cannot be an arbitrage opportunity implied by the model. This comes up a lot in term structure of interest rate problems, where equilibrium models like Vasicek or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross won't perfectly reproduce the current, observed term structure, and so imply an arbitrage opportunity. No-arbitrage models like Hull-White specifically match the model's term structure to observed yields/prices, so that there is no arbitrage opportunity between the observed term structure and your model of it. It's important to note that this will still allow for arbitrage involving bonds that are *not* part of the observed term structure. As for equivalent martingale measures, you might think about it more generally. The process involves changing the probability distribution from the actual (which is hard to use for pricing) to a different one that's easier to use but will result in the same prices; this is nearly always a risk-neutral probability. You can think of equivalent martingale pricing as asking, ""how would this security behave, and be priced, in a world that is completely risk neutral"", and then making an argument that the prices are in fact equivalent.
