"You do realize that ""analyst"" is just a corporate title for the lowest on the ladder (aside from consultants) in corporate structure? Your statement is true only for Sales Analysts vs Research Analysts. However, entry level traders (capital markets analysts) compensation is quite a bit greater than Sales Analysts and still requires pretty thorough market analysis. Just about anyone in the industry can be a decent sales analyst as that role really only entails relationship management and basic communication skils. Most of the boys over on the sales desk are either pursuing a more relationship management oriented path or want a foot in the door to get to trading."
