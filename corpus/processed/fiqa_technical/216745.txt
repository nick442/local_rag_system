Facebook is primarily a Business-to-business (B2B) company. This means that their customers are other businesses. The vast majority of Facebook's income is selling advertising to businesses. Someone once said something about the online services business model that I thought was brilliant. If you aren't paying for the service, then you aren't the customer, you are the product. When you use Facebook, you are not really one of the customers of Facebook; instead, Facebook is selling your attention to advertisers. Facebook probably sells a few things directly to consumers, such as games, but the majority of their business is B2B.
