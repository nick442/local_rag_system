"Why would you just look at salary and not total comp for a first year? It's pretty misleading to say ""$60k to work 100 hours a week"" when you do in fact get paid well above that. Also, in my 2 years of consulting, I've never come anywhere close to 100 hour work weeks. It usually fluctuates between 45-60 hours. Not to mention Fridays are usually pretty casual/relaxed days since you're working from home or in your home office doing random firm activities/networking."
