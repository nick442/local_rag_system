"If you don't think money that goes to the government ends up in the hands of the wealthy you're incredibly naive. Federal officials end up incredibly wealthy on a middle class salary, how? We also give BILLIONS of dollars each year for foreign aid, to countries that are (or should be) considered to be our enemy and *their* wealthy ends up with it. That money doesn't help our economy or our poor. Furthermore, these tax cuts *do* include cuts for the middle and lower class. I don't see how people can say ""give money to the government then they'll give it to the poor"" when you could cut out the middle man and say ""let the poor keep more of their money"""
