Let's hope some of it is good. It feels like the more they produce, the worse the quality gets. Netflix can hide behind that when they only made Orange is the New Black and House of Cards. When you only put out a few shows the strike rate is probably higher in terms of quality because they aren't actually doing that much of their own stuff. So they spend more time and more money on higher value products. But now with them producing *so much* content the quality has plummeted downwards. It feels like every second 'Netflix Original' title is godawful and headed for cancellation.
