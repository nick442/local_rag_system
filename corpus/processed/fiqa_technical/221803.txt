This is really a question for the paypal folks. as I understand it however, when you setup a paypal account, you are granting it access to your back account, so when you make a payment using paypal, it takes money directly from your bank account, and if you get paid for something via paypal, the money goes directly into your account. If that's not how they paypal account you have is working, then you need to get help from paypal to figure out how to make it work for you.
