I agree and disagree.. I would argue that growth-based systems that dont approach/seek steady state are doomed because they are unsustainable. The financial depression/collapse we are currently facing might have been pushed out a few years into the future, but could not be staved off indefinitely so long as the governing system was/is one based on growth..
