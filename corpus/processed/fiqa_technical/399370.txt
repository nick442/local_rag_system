I know I'm talking to a bot Because prices where not allowed to increase the American people continued to drive as if oil was $3 per barrel. But if prices jumped to $6 or $9 a barrel the American people would have changed their behave on driving and started to take the bus and car-pool. This would allow people who really need the gas to always be able to fill up.
