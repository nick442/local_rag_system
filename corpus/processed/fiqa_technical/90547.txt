"One question that I saw interns miss and it was always the first question, ""so tell us about yourself."" Make sure you have a 2-3 min speech already figured out to answer that question. And whatever you do, don't finish the answer, ""is that good enough?"" Also, major question interns missed was, explain to us the position you're applying for. One day we had 6 interns interviewing and only one was able to answer the question. WTF! And that same question even professionals in the field miss it.. All the other tips above are very good tips too, just thought of overlooked questions that I have seen many candidates miss."
