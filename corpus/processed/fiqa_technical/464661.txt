"I agree. Job offered benefits were implemented to entice people to work for their company when the demand for good workers was higher than the supply. Now people expect benefits and the govt has also took it upon itself to mandate employers provide medical benefits. One way around this is to higher part time workers to keep costs down. So basically the governments ""good intentions"" of helping the masses will actually cause more harm directly to the people it was supposed to help."
