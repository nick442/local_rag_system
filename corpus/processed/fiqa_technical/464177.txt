Maybe, but electricity is used for countless devices already. If people stopped driving entirely, overall electricity usage would most likely stay right where it is. However, if people stopped driving, gasoline consumption would plummet, because its primary use is fuel for an internal combustion engine. Given how much electricity we use already, I'm not convinced a full switch to electric cars would cause the cost of charging an electric car to jump to $30
