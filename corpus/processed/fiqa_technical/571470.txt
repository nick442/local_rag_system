Playing devils advocate here (and I haven't studied GEs financials, so damn I've got to look at that pension). It could be that Immeltz(sp) and management don't want to risk getting removed, and ultimately they feel they can guide GEs transformation to make it a better company and eventually decrease the funding shortfall. Thus placate the shareholders temporarily while changing the business.
