Sorry for posting in this sub instead of personal, but thank you for responding and giving good feedback. I haven't thought of doing internships. San Fran is a 6 hr drive for me as I live in LA, but next summer maybe I could do an internship there. As for resume tips I most likely will PM you soon. Thanks so much!
