"Dad-material = you are missing soft skills but you can provide me with financial security. I am going to take palimony for 18 years in exchange for sex. Outcome.. short-term physical relationship. ""Husband-material"" = you have a adequate or appreciated personality and soft skills. Kids are an option, just not the deal maker. More of a intimate relationship. Gents.. nice guys don't finish last here, they are usually married because personality is still important. You need to have compassion, patience, but also direction and ability to make express your emotions. Had a friend in college that devised and algorithm for sex.. main inputs where ""value of clothes, watch, and shoes"" + ""nice clean car"" + ""good hygiene"" + ""basic knowledge of pop culture"" + money spent on date"".. let me just state he over analyzed and thought this is how women think, and the outcome was little sex and a lot of money spent.... he forgot that he needs to sell trust, security, value to the date and then act on those if he wanted to become boyfriend.. he needed to learn how to be relational and compassionate toward the others' needs. Not rocket science, just work if it does not come naturally."
