I'm not sure, but if it does fall below $70, I don't think the chances of the US emerging as an energy superpower will fall. Nat gas has had low prices (and as a corollary, low prices), for the past couple of years. If Brent really does fall below $70/bbl, then I would assume that natural gas production and efforts would serve as a substitute, and with that, use of the energy source would become more common. But then again, I don't know shit.
