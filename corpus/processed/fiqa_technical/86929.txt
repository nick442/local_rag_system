Actually, my question was mainly rhetorical, I know why it can't be done, however the FTC and the FCC must both approve of such transactions I think, so maybe there is still a way to prevent it. You're pretty naive if you think News Corp is the same as everyone else. Nobody lies like News Corp. Murdoch's employees admit being paid to lie. This is why Canada doesn't allow Fox News to be aired there, because they still have honesty in broadcasting standards.
