Be prepared with examples of your previous work or school experiences that you can share that show you in a good light and have a positive end result. So if they ask you a series of questions like this, you're prepared: * Tell me about a time when you missed a deadline, what happened? how did it turn out? * At times we all have trouble getting along with someone, tell me about a time that happened to you, how did you handle it? how did it turn out? * Tell me about your favorite project/proudest accomplishment/.. at your previous job/school project/.. What did you enjoy about it?
