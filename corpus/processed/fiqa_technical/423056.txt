Came here to say this. Sure Northrop Grumman et al make a shit ton of money for their shareholders and CEOs, but they also employ hundreds of thousands of people whose income and spending account for millions of dollars of tax revenue (not to mention they're.. you know.. humans with lives that would be damaged if we just eliminated their jobs). This is the forgotten factor of defense spending. Real Americans depend on it to live. The American economy may depend on it to live.
