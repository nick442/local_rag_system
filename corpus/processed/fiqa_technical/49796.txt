I would not take any action with the check (neither return it nor cash it), but instead contact the bank. We live in the modern era where you can call someone on the phone or email them, and get nearly instant feedback. Use this to your advantage. Find out why they refunded you the money twice: was it an error on their part (in which case you just tear up the check or return it to them and be done with it)? Is it possible you're wrong about it being twice refunded (maybe the first check didn't go through properly or was only for half the amount, and you're just wrong)? Maybe they had some sort of guarantee that they failed to live up to and are correctly refunding you double your money. Probably the first, of course. But you should call them and ask, and verify what they want you to do, before you take any action - particularly one that costs you money. And certainly don't just cash the check; if it is a mistake, they'll be asking for that money back later, with interest, and be within their rights to do so.
