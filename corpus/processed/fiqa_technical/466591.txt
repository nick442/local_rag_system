That is what happens when you graduate during a recession. I just missed graduating during the last one with a Comp. Sci. degree. I still had no problems finding the internships during the height of the last recession. With the experience and a degree I was hired the week after graduation. I don't know where you live or where you graduated from, but I do know geography has much to do with your employability.
