Thanks for posting this. Funny, but I find myself watching RT far more than CNN these days. I am not a finance expert but as an econ major I can at least follow the argument. Seems credible to me. They are just saying that the resulting downgrade of bank bonds will affect them less than their competition. The second argument is that new (2008) accounting rules allow them to show a net gain on paper when their bonds get downgraded as a result of this loss. It's a complicated argument but I can see how it make perfect sense. I like how Bob English points out the fishy and probably strategic nature of the Thursday announcement. Obviously there is a lot more to this story: http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2012-20-15/truth-about-jp-morgan%E2%80%99s-2-billion-loss
