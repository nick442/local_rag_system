Eh? Companies use the research from public institutions, this is commonish knowledge. >I'm not disparaging public universities that do the research, but you do realize that they sell their patents to companies, right? That's how these big research schools get the big research budgets that they have. Without being able to monetize a new finding, research dollars would dry right up. Yes that's what I'm talking about. Public institutions bare the full brunt of cutting edge research.
