I am a man and I not in Silicon Valley but I work in a similar male oriented industry and there is truth to that. I have worked with women that get the reputation that they are not worth the risk. When a woman calls out what sometimes are/are not sexist remarks or makes it known that she will not tolerate any form of gender differentiation, they are branded as being difficult and redflagged and many will avoid working with her. Its innate. You have to fight against those stereotypes but sometimes women bring attention to issues that are not necessarily there.
