This is exactly what happened with Enron. The 401k was mostly invested in company stock, so when the company went bankrupt the employees lost both their jobs and savings. The plan administrator was also faulted by the government for continuing to allow new purchases of stock even as the stock price (and hence the perceived fortunes of the company) tumbled. http://money.cnn.com/2001/11/26/401k/q_retire_enron_re/ http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/011802.asp
