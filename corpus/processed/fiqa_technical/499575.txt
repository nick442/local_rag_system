While I agree with your sentiment that trades will be more useful than a university degree now and in the near future (at least in Canada). It worries me that the social mobility for this generation will lean to blue collar jobs. After a generation this will build a social hierarchy of blue collar labour workers and company/owners. The university degree holders will be weaned out to the sidelines, intellectualism is being sidelined. If this keeps up we're going back to feudalism.
