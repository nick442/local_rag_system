This is why I have gone back to broadcast TV, because cable TV costs a lot of money for something that is no better. It doesn't seem that long ago that there were no commercials on cable channels. Now there are MORE commercials on cable channels than on broadcast TV. Remember when the scifi channel was full of science fiction instead of..wrestling? Remember when MTV was about music? When Discovery was full of science programming, when A&E was about arts and education and the History channel was about more than Nazis, UFOs and imaginary animals? Now it's all just crap and why pay for that?
