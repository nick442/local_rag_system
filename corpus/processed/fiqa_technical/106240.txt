What intrinsic value does the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) have? The coins may not have intrinsic value, except that they are kept scarce, but I believe the technologie does. The list of things you can do with a blockchain is endless. In theory applications could be build on top of Bitcoin, though that hasn't happened yet, at least not in a major way. I am personally not invested in Bitcoin anymore, because there are other coins now that have more potential for value, to put it that way, but I think the people who argue Bitcoin has no value whatsoever, or that it's a Ponzi scheme, are usually the ones who don't have any understanding of how it works.
