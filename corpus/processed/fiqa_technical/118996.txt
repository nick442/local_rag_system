You're moving goalposts. Of course my backhand calculation is not scientifically accurate. But the point is it's still way more than de minimis like you implied. Buses off the road are still off the road. Cars off the rod are still off the road. Whatever fraction of 400k you feel for whatever weird reason is still a fuckton less traffic clogging the roads. You just seem to have a hate boner.
