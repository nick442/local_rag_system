Having both purchased income properties and converted prior residences into rental properties I have found that it is difficult to get the banks to consider the potential rental income in qualifying you for a loan. It helps if you have prior rental experience but in many cases you will have to qualify outright (i.e. without consideration of the potential income). The early 2000s were great for responsible borrows/investors but today's regulations make it much more difficult to finance income property.
