"Right, there were technological differences between early societies and modern societies. But there is no necessary connection between a voluntary society and violence - in fact, quite the opposite. It is possible to have water and electricity production without coercion. I'm not arguing we go back to those times/societies. I'm only pointing out that it is entirely possible for a stable society to exist that functions along those lines. Also, the technology you see today is not necessarily reliant on monopolists of force. Humans discovered the ""recipe"" to create certain new tools, and we won't lose those recipes in the future, through different forms of governance. Any argument in favor of government is effectively an argument in favor of monopoly."
