"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017086pap.pdf) reduced by 99%. (I'm a bot) ***** > 15 5.2 Pass-Through of the MIP Reduction to Borrowers Was the MIP cut fully passed through to borrowers? Previous research has found that price reductions in the mortgage backed securities market are not fully passed through to consumer-facing interest rates, particularly in times of high mortgage borrowing volume. > Second, the cost of borrowing jumps discontinuously at an 80% LTV ratio, as borrowers have to pay annual and upfront insurance premiums on the entire loan balance once they cross that threshold, in addition to interest and insurance on the additional amount borrowed. > Taking FHA borrowers in 2015, we approximate their counterfactual DTI ratio as: = + 0.005 where DTIc is the counterfactual DTI ratio, DTIf is the ratio in the data, L is the loan amount at origination and Y is the borrower&#039;s income as reported in HMDA. In the merged HMDA/Optimal Blue data, the average FHA borrower in 2015 would have a DTI 1.6 percentage points higher under the old premiums than under the reduced premiums. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6v3vm5/fed_the_effect_of_interest_rates_on_home_buying/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~195634 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **borrow**^#1 **FHA**^#2 **loan**^#3 **rate**^#4 **premium**^#5"
