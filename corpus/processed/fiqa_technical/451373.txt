Think of Ether (the units of Ethereum) as the gas that's required to power applications and transactions on a decentralized version of AWS. If you foresee a future that involves an internet that runs applications without central ownership of the cloud servers, then investing in Ethereum is a good idea. Think of it as buying futures on computational power. Keep in mind, Ethereum (unlike Bitcoin) isn't designed to be a long-term store of value. ~95 million Ether exist today and ~10 million more are mined each year. That being said, demand still seems to be greater than existing + new supply. **Disclosure** - I hold a signifiant amount of my net worth in bitcoin with a much smaller position in Ethereum.
