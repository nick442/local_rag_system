This line of thinking assumes that eventually we reach a state where not one single person wants more or better stuff then they already have access to. Even in the most advanced imaginable future, where machines make everything and robots provide every service, and all the machines and robots are made and maintained by other machines and robots, people will still have jobs. Even if there were infinite numbers of free robots, so that no task could ever be done cheaper by a human than it would cost to buy a robot, everyone's people's job will be to sit around and invent more and better stuff for robots to build.
