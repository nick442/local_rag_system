So if population growth is the largest driver of demand, then why are typewriters no longer sold in big box stores? > Sewing needles are absolutely driven by population growth. Are sewing needles such a durable good? Do they never get lost? Are they all the same size? Is the same percentage of population using sewing needles now compared to industrial revolution times? What did the sewing machine do to the demand for sewing needles? > Therefore if one factory is capable of producing clothes for 100 people and automation doubles its output, growing the population to 400 would create jobs by necessitating another factory, even though automation increased efficiency. You just proved my point. Automation made it so more consumers are reached. Not through population growth but through the ability to produce more goods to meet the needs of more people. You employ 10 people in your shirt company and they produce 10 shirts each. You decide to automate. You have to lay off 3 people, but you now have the production power of 20 people using only 7 now. In doing so, your profit margins are better, and you notice that A- You can't keep up with demand for your shirts and B- There is a comparable factory in the county next to yours for sale. So you buy it, start off with 10 employee's and then you automate again, 14 people now have a job in your business as opposed to 10. Automation has made you more efficient, and has made it so that you were able to reach more people willing to buy your product. In doing so you have given them greater purchasing power. Today, you can be low income and buy an Iphone, a tv, a PS4, a microwave, a car, and some furniture. If these things were around back in the 1915, a low income person would be lucky to afford one of these items.
