Think of it, at least in part, like an insurance plan. You pay some (smaller) amount of money just in case something big(er) happens. Some companies also put their prepaid/insurance customers to the head of the line when it comes time for service, so on a -40 degree day (when F and C match!) you might get service sooner. Personally I do have such a plan for my furnace. Living in Canada, the furnace is an important item for me and my family. Alternately, if you live in an area where a lack of furnace is more like to be uncomfortable instead of potentially catastrophic (frozen pipes and the like), then the money might not be worth it.
