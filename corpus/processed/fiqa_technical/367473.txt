Yep, but only congress can create those debts: Article 1, section 8 states (in part): >The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; [..] >**To borrow Money on the credit of the United States**; [emphasis added] Only the congress can create the debt. The President simply doesn't have the authority to borrow money.
