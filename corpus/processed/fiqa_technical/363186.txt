eallan already touched on this, but generally speaking there is a tendency in this country to lump unions together and put the shortcomings of one local or one unit or one member onto all of them. An example would be the issue of corruption; many people cry about rampant corruption in unions when in fact only somewhere between 1-2% of locals have ever had any corruption charges, whereas I'd be willing to bet that the corruption rate is much higher in the corporate world. > Honestly, I cant think of any reason for minimum wage paying jobs to have a union. If you think the wages are too low for cost of living then the minimum wage should be raised. These people have no special skills, little to no training, and usually no education. Genuine question: What reasons do you think someone would/could have for joining a union? Why would base pay/education/skill level of the job be a consideration? Just so we're on the same page: Collective bargaining came about because workers in certain areas were pissed-off enough that they realized that to improve their situation they had to come together as a group, because only as a group did they have any leverage. All workers have the right to collective bargaining, rights which were signed into law because pissed-off workers were doing it anyway, and the regulation of the practice helped smooth it out and drastically cut down on violence and debilitating drops in production. It takes quite a feeling of injustice and exploitation when not friends, not family, but colleagues, some of which may not even like each other, start seeing that they share common problems, and decide to tie the fate of their working lives to one another. And give up like 1-2% of their paychecks. Especially in a country with an individualistic culture like the US. So if workers at certain Wal-Marts feel like working conditions are that bad for them, then I can't see why they shouldn't organize.
