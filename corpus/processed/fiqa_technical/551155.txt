I believe that kind of micro-tuning for every participant would make the operating costs of the fund intolerable. A better approach, if this is important to you, would be to find a fund or funds designed for people who share your criteria. If the goals and criteria aren't mutual, a mutual fund -- traditional or ETF -- is probably not the right tool.
