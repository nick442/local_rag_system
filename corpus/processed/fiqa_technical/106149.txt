"You're essentially asking the very common ""Do I Need to File a Tax Return?"" question. It's common enough that the IRS answers it right at the beginning of the Form 1040 Instructions, and it's answered fairly thoroughly here: http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96623,00.html There's about 20 questions in that checklist which are mostly pretty specialized, but assuming you didn't have taxes withheld that you'd like to get back, and didn't have any retirement income/disbursements this year, the only interesting question is this: ""Were you self-employed with earnings of more than $400.00?"" Sounds like your losses outweighed your profits, and assuming you had no other income, I'd say you're fine not filing. Can't really speak to state law since that can vary so much, but your state's laws are likely similar to federal, and you can probably find a very similar answer near the beginning of the instructions of your state's income tax form."
