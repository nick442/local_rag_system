It sounds like you are doing great. A couple points: You really need to crunch the numbers such as how high is rent in your area, and of course home prices. Home price gains are not a given. It will depend on many factors such as the job market in your area, crime, schools, how long you stay put,.etc. If you take the standard/non-itemized tax deduction you might not save at tax time if you don't pay enough interest. Your decision to have automatic deductions from your checks was spot on; it is human nature to spend every nickle. Also, money in a savings account won't keep up with inflation. It will slowly degrade; you will want other investments. -Good luck
