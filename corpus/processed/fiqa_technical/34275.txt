Even if you expect to work you might not be able to due to health reasons or economic factors that make it difficult to obtain employment, so it's good to have a safety-net. A pension scheme, especially if it's tax-advantaged or there's a company-match, can be a useful savings scheme. So even if you're still working when you reach normal retirement age, it provides you with a handy pot of money you can use for travel, recreation, or whatever. As others have mentioned, the pension might benefit other family members such as a spouse or children. You might change your mind about working until you drop. With NHS cuts and austerity you might need the money to supplement whatever care benefits you're entitled to when you do fall ill in your old age.
