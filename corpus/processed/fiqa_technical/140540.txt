I worked for US Treasury in Computer Security. There are plenty of systems that try and spot fraudulent behavior, but it doesn't matter much. So many of the regulations either have no teeth, or are designed to have legal loopholes to let them get away with it without breaking any laws, technically. They have vastly more resources than we did, and experts that knew how to weasel JUUUST enough to not be breaking the law, and still achieve their intended consequences. And most Senators get money from these guys to render the Treasury toothless. And, we aren't aloud to talk about it, at all, unless they are found guilty. You can have Millions devoted to hiring people that make sure you get away with it legally, and it's still a drop in the bucket for them.
