He is assuming flat structural growth. Amazon is Turning no profit because they are a services company, not a hardware company. They use all their money to invest in infrastructure to expand their services. AMD needs to spend a lot of money to operate a FAB to produce chips, while Amazon keeps spending money to expand new business units offering greater services. Imagine you are a toll bridge operator. You build a bridge and collect a toll. But instead of declaring the fees collected as profit, you immidately start construction of another bridge, paid for by the profits of the first. You are pretty careful not to go crazy with debt, so you break even all the time. 20 year later, you have 10 bridges paying for the next ten to be built. Those 20 will pay for the next 20. Their “bridge membership” club keeps customers using existing bridges and automatically brings in customers for newly built ones. Of course it took Amazon so long to catch the largest retailer - and so little to double them. The next large play is really large - the 13b Whole Foods purchase. They bought the foundational land for hundreds of small bridges to more easily connect them to even more “bridge users”. Once amazon is done “growing” and they have thousands of bridges collecting tolls all over the world, the money flow will be absolutely insane. But they will still be “breaking even” - as they will be buying fleets of aircraft and other international chains for further delivery footprints, but the small profit they declare will still be pretty big. It won’t be Apple sized profit, but it will be an amazing amount of revenue. Amazon is to big-box retail what big-box retail was to mom-pop retail - the oxygen remover. They want to be the toll booth operator for all retail in the entire world.
