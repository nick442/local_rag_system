"Holy fuck do you seriously not understand that I was trying to understand your perspective before I explained an alternative? Do you really find it offensive when people ask you questions before presenting a solution? Do you have such a limited attention span that you forgot I began the discussion by saying ""I'm happy to answer your question if you will first answer mine"", then tried to obtain clarity in your answer by saying ""Is it fair to say that you don't believe that ""only taxes can provide these things"", but you are simply unaware of how anything other than taxes can provide these things?"" You seriously look like an asshole when you claim that asking questions to understand your perspective is ""not offer[ing] an alternative"" when I *started the discussion* by telling you I'd offer an alternative *after I understood what you believe*."
