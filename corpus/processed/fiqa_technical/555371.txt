Have you tried social networking? (apart from asking questions) but actually connecting with individuals/firms? Try LinkedIn, there are groups that are very focus-orientated. You might be able to have an influence there. Prove to them that your advisory has more to offer than your competition - this might be putting out free information for everyone to see what you have to offer. Perhaps even free consultations to gain credibility?
