"What interests me in the article is the way California seems to be quite happy to be losing people who pay taxes because the state can so easily attract new warm bodies. What happens to a state when there is no incentive to retain its people? It struck a cord with me because I've been reading about the history of mining. If an industry can always bring in newer, poorer people, conditions for those working in that industry will never rise. In mining, conditions can be so bad that you can almost think of it as if the workers are expendable. Working conditions can be so bad that many die each year and nobody seems to care because if one group of workers gets a little uppity, management simply starts importing them from another country. You can disagree but I see a parallel with California.Sure one is an industry and one is a country but this is a state that seems more than the rest of the country to depend on cheap Mexican labor. As Mexico stopped breeding people for export, California begin to simply import new slave labor from Honduras or any other place that still exports people as though they were only cattle. Of course this makes it difficult for those who came in an earlier wave to improve quality of life. In fact, life gets harder and grittier. Just look at what happened to the world class famous free public education in California. Yeah, distant memory now. I also wonder if allowing California to ignore national immigration law, is good for the rest of the nation. What about this quote: ""Also, more than 30% of the nation’s welfare recipients are Californians – even though California has just 12% of the nation’s population. It is not surprising, therefore, that California is ranked number one in poverty."" California has so many electoral votes that I don't expect to see them prosecuted by the federal government (like AZ) no matter what they do. The state is too big to piss off. But it is becoming a cancer to the rest of the nation?"
