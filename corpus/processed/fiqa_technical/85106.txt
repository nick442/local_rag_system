Thanks for the info. I am quite familiar with FAs and I definitely do not want to go that route. I highly doubt I can get an equity research role considering my lack of real experience. I was just trying to get an entry-level position and given my resume, I'm having a tough time doing even that :\ It's really unfortunate, I wish I articulate my experience to a hiring manager BEFORE they looked at my resume!
