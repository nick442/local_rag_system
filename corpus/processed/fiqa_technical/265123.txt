Junk mail and direct marketing are all the PO has left. If the markets didn't think that crap worked they'd quit sending the stuff. But it does work enough to make it work the effort. It's not enough to fund the PO expenses but if the PO raises prices on their last golden calf well then maybe it won't really be worth the effort anymore. Just think of al the people who will be out of work once your policies are enacted. Yes, junk mail means lots of discarded paper products but it also means UNION jobs. We need useless stuff to keep those people employed.
