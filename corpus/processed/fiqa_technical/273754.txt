It is. So if we force companies to pay a living wage to everyone, why would a company pay skilled workers more? If they had to pay everyone a minimum of 36-60k, why pay anyone else more? By setting a livable wage, the government would also be setting a possible maximum wage. As a side note, the cost of goods would go up if a grocery store had to pay all of its employees a livable wage. Where is the happy medium and how would you calculate it?
