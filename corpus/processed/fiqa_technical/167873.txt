">I'm an idiot. Yup you are. >I implied that Gen X, as middle managers, had direct operational control over decisions that led to financial crisis. But the very BASIS on which you made that claim (which is false BTW) was your idiotic confusion of GenX with the Baby Boom. So your entirely argument was flawed from the get go. You don't get to have your cake and eat it at the same time dude. >You chose to ignore that point entirely. Nope. Didn't ""ignore"" it at all, I cut the proverbial legs out from underneath it, and the whole construct toppled over as a result. *But hey, don't let that stop you from making and even greater ass out of yourself.*"
