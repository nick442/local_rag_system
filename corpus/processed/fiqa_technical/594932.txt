The New York City press and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have been treating us to an elaborate charade. It goes like this: the press complains that the cops have prevented it from covering Occupy Wall Street and the mayor claims that's not true. What a farce! The press had to be dragged kicking and screaming to cover the Occupy movement when it should have been the first to defend the protesters' First Amendment rights to assemble and dissent. Neither the mayor nor the press gave a damn about the protesters' rights, but now the press wants to get in front of the story and pretend its First Amendment rights were abridged. Mayor Bloomberg got filthy rich off the First Amendment, but he was the first to abridge it in the name of all sorts of bogus excuses,
