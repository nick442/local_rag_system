If there are idiots saying nasty things, they will say nasty things about your competitors as well. There will ALWAYS be unhappy people. However, if there are significantly more unhappy people for you than there are for a competitor, then they're not dumb - you are doing something wrong. And you are right - you will sometimes disagree with the aggregate regarding relevant factors in judging a business. That happens, and there is currently nothing you can do about it. It does not diminish the value of the aggregate's opinion, though, for the vast majority of businesses.
