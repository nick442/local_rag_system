Ya I guess in Canada since the drinking age used to coincide roughly with first year of university college, it lended it self to some crazy drinking. Funny to look back at some of those times, as now I probably wouldn't even drink 12 drinks total in a year. And it is only that high cause of the Irish backgrounded weddings I attend via family lol.
