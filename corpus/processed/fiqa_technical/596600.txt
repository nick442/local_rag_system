"> In 2009, under Obama, the US had a deficit of 1.4 trillion dollar. Actually, that's Bush's last deficit. That was the 2008 budget and appropriations from the Bush administration's last year, and it's also the result of the financial crisis, which happened during Bush's time. It's also TARP (which was passed under Bush with Bush's support) and, to a lesser extent, the stimulus (which was a direct and necessary reaction to the financial crisis). That 1.4 trillion deficit is Bush. It's what Obama *started* with, and worked from, not what he caused. Consider it the handoff deficit from Bush to Obama. > In 2014, the deficit is now 744 billion dollar. You're commenting on an article that says the current deficit will be $506 billion, so why are you saying it's ""now"" $744 billion without explaining the contradiction?"
