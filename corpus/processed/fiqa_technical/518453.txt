Let's base teacher performance off of student value added growth scores! Surely nothing bad will happen when we create incentivize teachers to make sure that student performance continuously rises. I mean, Campbell's law is just a load of horseshit, right? It's not like these policies led to widespread test cheating in Atlanta and Washington, DC, and several other cities. In all seriousness, look at what happened in Washington, DC. Student performance was used as the metric by which the district meted out both the carrot and the stick: the $160k paycheck or dismissal. 103 schools out of 200 or so were found to have statistical indicators of cheating, in some schools nearly 100% of tested classrooms were found to have wrong-to-right erasures in statistically aberrant levels. This wasn't found out until years after these test scores were used to evaluate a whole crop of teachers. Suppose you were the teacher whose children had previously been scored by cheating teachers or administrators. The model used to evaluate you expects that these children will see test score growth of *x* percent each year. If you don't cheat, you will get fired. If you do cheat, you become eligible to get a shitton of money. All that aside, the debate shouldn't even be about using student performance to evaluate teachers. The debate shouldn't be about who gets laid off. The debate should be about how we prevent teachers from getting laid off.
