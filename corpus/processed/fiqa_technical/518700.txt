Lol, thanks for that. All you are saying is that electric motors struggle at an arbitrary high speed. All motors struggle at high speeds. Just stating that electric motors aren't suited for speeds > 100 MPH isn't convincing. I think it's more of a trade-off between transmission design and top speed / acceleration. You can get an electric car with top speed of 125 mph and world-class acceleration. This car would blow a Camaro away.
