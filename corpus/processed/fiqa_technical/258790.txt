"According to IRS Bulletin 2007-39, you can elect the maximum contribution allowed by your new employer (please note that though the IRS allows a maximum limit on Health FSA of $2,600, your employer's plan can limit that to a lower amount) so long as both employers are not part of a ""controlled group."" The complicated part of this is that your wife is covered by HDHP w/ HSA. Under IRS Publication 969, you cannot make contributions to an HSA if you are covered by any other health care coverage. Since your spouse would also be covered by your FSA, that would disqualify your spouse from making any contributions towards her HSA."
