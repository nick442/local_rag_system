You sound ahead of the game. I personally regret locking myself in rooms in post-hs depression with the Internet and books. Honestly, I have regrets from that time a few years ago. Recognize and cherish your freedom. I know this sounds clich√© as hell but at this unique stage it's priceless and fleeting. Hang with friends, drink, chase girls, have adventures with friends as much as possible before you go separate ways permanently. In your free time, lift weights to have even more fun in college. It sounds like you're hustling. In a few months life is gonna hold a proverbial gun to your head and say you can't NOT hustle for years and years and years. It doesn't have to be like that but it is for most ambitious people. Especially in finance. Assuming you're not about that or have your bases covered, any coding is great. Check out R. CSS, HTML if you wanna know web design. Read Wall Street Oasis instead of this sub. Excuse the rantyness of that
