"Shall we discuss the vast closing down of brick and mortar stores due to Amazon's increased presence? While I agree with you on not buying Amazon right now as there are much ""safer"" investments if you're looking for long-term growth, let's not deny reality - their numbers are great and one sub-division's flop (the Fire brand) is not a basis for demeaning the accomplishments of an entire company as a whole. Bezos is doing a great job and has proven all the early nay-sayers dead wrong, and this purchase was a great move for something they've been moving towards. Amazon has had grocery delivery in select cities for a while and it's flourishing, no reason to assume that increasing their presence via Whole Foods won't improve that."
