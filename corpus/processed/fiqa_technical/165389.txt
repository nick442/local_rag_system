I agree. ZH is way ahead on some big stories. The different spin on Russian propaganda was interesting for a while (Syria, Iraq) but has become worse than the Western media on Ukraine and some other nutty stories. Western media is influenced by the banks and Russian media is controlled too much by Putin. But despite the distortions you sometimes get clear picture if you keep an eye on both.
