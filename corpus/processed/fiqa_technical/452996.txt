Where do you get them? We have a ton we're clearing out to move from my grandpa. Some Beatles and earlier from my mom and lots of heavy old foxtrot and similar records from grandpa (victor, Decca records, nice heavy weight, in their original papers). Trying to see if there is a market for these old ones before I just garage sale them.
