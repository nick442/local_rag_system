>if the underlying economy hasn't been sufficiently capitalized, that will present juicy returns to investors. That is not true in an era of excessive regulation at the Federal, State and local levels. Its also not true when the machinations of government have kept interest rates artificially low for thirty years, thereby causing a massive increase in household debt. Now we have a recession caused by the explosion of some of that debt. People are wary of going into more debt and they do not have the income to spend right now. In that circumstance, capital investment in productive ventures is riskier than normal. Recovery of investment is less certain and will certainly take longer. Add to that the increasing debt of the US government. The debt can only grow so much before there is a shift in the economy and capital markets due to high inflation, capital controls or other direct government intervention in the economy. Since there is exactly ZERO possibility of addressing the US debt with the current batch of criminals in the Capitol and the White House, investors are very nervous. They need to be able to earn considerable profits to outweigh what they see as great risks. If, on top of all that uncertainty you tell investors that if they manage to hit a home run and become profitable, that the government is going to take a bigger bite out of their profits... well, many of them are going to say, Why bother? I can live on my savings.
