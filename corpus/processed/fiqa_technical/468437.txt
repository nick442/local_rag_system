RobertHalf is the company that got me the temp job, the lady I met with has been easy to get in contact with and has been actively searching for me it seems. I have been e-mailing and every week and calling her every other to fill her in on my progress. I also use Parker Lynch, not sure if they are out that way but they seem rather nice as well. I have been doing about 5-7 a day with the apps as well, I am starting to run out of places to look and starting to feel a bit defeated and getting a bit stir crazy sitting in front of my computer all day hitting refresh on all the job boards every 10 minutes. The two actual interviews for positions I have had both ended up going to someone else, I got both interviews through networking and was told by them that they found a more qualified candidate. One a Yale B School uma cum laude and one a seasoned analyst.. I interview well, but my credentials are just not good enough yet. Both companies called me and let me know they really liked me but they could not turn down the other opportunities they had. At least I got feedback I guess.. As far as learning SQL, I learned VBA with VBA for dummies, my friend recommended SQL for dummies to me as well. He knows SQL forwards and backwards and tells me it is a great learning tool.
