Can I still use the old EIN from partnership times for the new sole proprietorship? Or should I apply for a new EIN? You cannot use the same EIN. Unless you have employees, you should use your SSN for the sole proprietorship. If you have employees - you should get a new EIN (if you don't have one already for yourself as a sole proprietor - you can only have one). Can I actually start to use my SSN in this situation for the sole proprietorship? In this particular case, not only you can - you should.
