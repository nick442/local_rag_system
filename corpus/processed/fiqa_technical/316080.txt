Can you explain this to me? I'm under the impression that the CEO is generally hired by the board because he/she is supposed to be the expert, and the board provides broad guidance as to where the business should go. There is no one really above the CEO in the traditional sense as I understand it, but I would like to see what you mean if you don't mind explaining.
