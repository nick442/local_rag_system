Sorry brother, that line works well on city-dwellers, but I live on a farm. I produce eggs and beef that are consumed locally. It still costs me every time we fill a tractor with diesel, and for my running around with my pest control company. Sure, I could take the bus..but I'd imagine that folks would give me strange looks..a guy with hazardous chemicals and a bag of dead rodents. The plus side is, I'd have a few seats to myself.
