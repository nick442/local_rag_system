I just switched careers from IT to investing and my first step was to sign up for the CFA and started studying to learn the field. When I talked about it during my interview, I could tell they were impressed I was doing it on my own and fully believe it helped me get the job. The position is entry level but still. Also, I got a scholarship through the local CFA society and borrowed Schweser books from a friend. So yes its tough and expensive but if you can do it now, definately do it.
