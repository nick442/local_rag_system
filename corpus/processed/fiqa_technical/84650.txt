Well there is a gap. In a democracy we vote for our government. We believe in them - at least the majority does. And generally government fights on the side of capital and produces rhetoric on the side of capital and the same people who voted for their government believe the shit they're being fed. Government generally has the difficult job of balancing labour and capital. Both are incredibly important tools to manage. If I voted for the governing party and they produce vitriol against a labour dispute, well no shit I'd believe them - they're the people I voted for and trust. It's unfortunate.
