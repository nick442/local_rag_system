Don't have the interview be the first time you wear the suit for an extended period. Days before the interview pick a fancy place to go out, and wear your suit. Then it will stop looking brand new (which you don't want) and you will become comfortable in it, and not present as a guy awkwardly wearing a suit for the first time.
