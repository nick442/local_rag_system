"hahaha oh this is great. Rich people dont want to pay taxes because they dont want to 'pool our resources' but fuck those poor people, they can live with mom and dad til they're 30 and who the fuck cares? I really hate people like you. Your post is like watching Fox News. Spin, bullshit, and more spin. ""No no, it's a WIN WIN for you to live at home til you're 30!"""
