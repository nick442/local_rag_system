Oh so you were serious. Maybe you should check out the 200b surplus Clinton left us, and the 1.4 trillion bush left us after his tax cuts. Maybe once you come up with a logical answer on if apple didn't didn't do the grand things you claim they will after they're making 20b extra a year from 5 years ago, why they would do it if they made 68b after tax cuts and not 65b like they do now? What's a company who makes 15b now going to do when they make 17b after tax cuts that they couldn't do with 15b? The answer is absolutely nothing. They will hoard more.
