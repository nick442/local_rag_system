You have to be careful. For example if you disliked a company you could go get a job there and then deliberately commit a relevant crime. Get three people to do this and they are out of business. Walmart is an obvious target, but I'm sure you could find people who dislike almost every business even Costco or Starbucks. (And the airlines would stand no chance.)
