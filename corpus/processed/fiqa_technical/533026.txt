I work at a large accounting firm. The reason major accounting firms don't have mass layoffs is because the regulatory environment creates a huge demand for accountants. In fact, many of the newer regulations that create this demand are a result of legislators attempting to remedy the problems that caused the financial meltdown in the first place. It's the same with fields such as medicine. Certain jobs simply have steady demand that isn't impacted in the same way as other jobs during a recession. It doesn't mean there's some sort of malevolent profiteering going on (not that that doesn't happen).
