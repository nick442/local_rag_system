"And? What's the big deal? For the people who are upset about Netflix not having the Star Wars content, those are more than likely big fans of Star Wars, and said fans, if they consider themselves to big a big Star Wars fan, already own the old and most recent Star Wars movies. Watch, people are going to down vote my post, and it will be from those will most likely are a fan but don't own a copy of the movies or will say, ""Why should I have to buy them in order to watch them? I should be able to stream them whenever I want."" Think of the price of buying the movie, let's say $20. You can watch it over and over again. With watching it via stream, you'll have to pay between $15-$20 a month in order to watch it."
