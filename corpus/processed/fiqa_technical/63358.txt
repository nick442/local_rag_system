> Is this good? No. It's way too much information, ..For now. Given that computer processing speed (per price unit) is still increasing exponentially each year, and that our collective knowledge of genetics has been increasing rapidly (if not exponentially) in recent decades, establishing something like this today could clearly lead to substantial clinical improvements a decade from now. > and has real ethical-legal implications (what happens when we find other mutations?) Presumably, you'd inform the patient so that they can watch out for any subsequent symptoms of disease related to that mutation, and - if possible - treat it before it becomes a problem. This is the entire promise of personalized medicine, gene therapies, and rapid gene sequencing.
