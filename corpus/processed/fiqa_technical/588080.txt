Yes, many people want to be solo operators. Being an employee sucks, but having employees of your own also takes away a lot of your freedom. Thing is, I know a lot of freelancers who make great money. His math isn't totally wrong, but you can reduce a lot of those expenses depending on what you do- working remotely and cutting out the time and money of a commute helps a lot. Also, you can charge more than $100 an hour if you're providing a really valuable service- a lot more.
