"Ask yourself, where do you want to go and what do you want to do? It may be worthwhile to set out some goals, alternatives or a so-called ""bucket list"". This would provide more structure to your budget than a flat rate prescription. Are your contenders the kind of thing where you might save up several years and have a big trip once or twice a decade or even once in your life (Antarctica cruise!) or more planning out annual vacations? Would you seek trips to connect to another hobby (art museums, battlefields and historical sites, wine regions, performances of any kind - opera, sports, Broadway musicals), or do you simply want to get away to the beach for a few weeks a year? Do you want 4 star hotel amenities? The answers to these will help you figure out what and how to budget. Bon voyage!"
