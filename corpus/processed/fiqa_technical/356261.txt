All good points so far. To build on what's already been said, remember that the market is pricing in future earnings. If Facebook and Cisco were, for the sake of argument, the same book value and spitting out the same net income, the market could price Facebook much higher than Cisco's because the market believes FB can return more than Cisco can. The idea is that Facebook's competitive position relative to its competitors and is a much more stable and defensible position than Cisco's. You're right though, that the market could be overvaluing Facebook's future and being overly optimistic. How do you price the fact that most people around the world who are getting access to the internet for the very first time, are doing so only through Facebook? This probably partially explains its inflated market cap.
