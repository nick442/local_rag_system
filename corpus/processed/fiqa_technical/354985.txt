Fund the Roth. If your loan interest is deductible (see firedfly's comment) then your effective cost for the loan is lower than 6.25% You get tax free earnings on the same amount in a Roth. Assuming you can get 6%, it's at least break even, probably better. And you can never gain back the time for compounding on the retirement account. With that said, there may be an emotional component to the decision. If you really just want to get rid of the debt, go ahead and do it.
