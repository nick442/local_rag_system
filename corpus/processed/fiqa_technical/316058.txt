This is bullshit. It's only doing what it's programmed to do. This completely avoid the issue of: 1) who did the programming to make a business this way? 2) is this, in any way, ethical? Cancer cells are just doing what they do best, so much so that they excel at doing what they do. Doesn't make them good for the organism.
