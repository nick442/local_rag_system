"Would not be shocking. Amazon already has massive ""fullfillment"" centers here which I know they have all over but that area is prime for something like we are talking about to happen. The land is crazy cheap and the areas around Hamilton County are technically the ""richer"" more high end areas around Indianapolis. Growing up in Indiana and seeing the amount of farm land for sale and how cheap it is seemingly going does make me a bit sad though."
