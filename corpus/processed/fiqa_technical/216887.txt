Unless you're going to claim that humans lack free will, you can't reduce human action to deterministic processes that you can test in a particle accelerator. You reference experiments, but there have been no experiments. If you really are a physicist, I find it seriously disconcerting that you'd so flippantly conflate experimental data with observational data. They are not the same thing. If you happen to know any statisticians, it might be worth your while to have a refresher chat on this distinction with one of them. To put is very simply: the tools of physics are inappropriate for an analysis of any phenomenon that involves human choices, and if you insist on an empirical approach when key variables (the internal state of the mind) are not measurable, you are wrong.
