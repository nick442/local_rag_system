"You didn't even bother to scan the article I linked. ""Real"" organic milk for example has double the CLA and ALA and 60% of the LA of conventional milk and ""fake"" organic due to organic's pasture rules. Grass-fed beef shows similar numbers. Pasture-raised eggs have been [proven to be significantly higher in Omega-3s, Vitamin E, D, etc.](http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2009/05/pastured-eggs.html) Granted for a lot of fruits and vegetables there are smaller health differences but there are still large differences for the land and farmworkers. Cancer for farmworkers sucks, even if it doesn't personally affect you. Vaccines don't cause Autism."
