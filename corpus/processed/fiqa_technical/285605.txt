Wow this is a bad article. This is a notional amount.. Eg. $500M US equity fund in Australia wants to hedge their US exposure. They buy a $500M forward contract and roll it over quarterly. Each quarter they settle on the difference (let's say $50 - 500k +/- depending on the way FX moves). What matters is the amount owed..not the notional value. Same goes for interest rates. $1B bond fund could short the 10yr to lower interest rate sensitivity..the end value isn't $1B. It's whatever they owe on the difference at settlement. The issue of swap spreads or settlement/liquidity is so much more important!
