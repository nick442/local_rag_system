Good for consumers, Foot Locker will be forced to make adjustments to their business model in which I imagine in turn will give consumers great deals on their products. When you buy directly from Adidas, they already give you 2-4 free shipping just by creating an account with them. I just bought the Triple Black Japan Boost NMD and they came in two days from Adidas. A month ago, I bought the Multicolor Ultraboost from Foot Locker and it took 1.5 weeks.
