Imo there are too many people expecting a correction for one to occur. I hear both smart money and retail investors talking about keeping/ raising cash for a correction.. that's not usually when they occur. In all actuality it shouldn't matter, you should always invest expecting a correction. The market could be another 20% higher before we get a correction, or it could go down 10%, and then another 10% from there. If you can't weather the storms then stay out of the water
