You're not proving anything by showing me the job specs. I'm completely aware that there aren't high requirements for getting the job. What you don't understand since live in a world where your resume gets you in the door is that the difficulty of a job, the skill required to do it well, and the pay required to keep a guy doing it day in and day out for 30 years doesn't always depend on any kind of credential that would show up on paper. And just for the record, Boeing's thousands of union professional and technical aeronautical engineers would like to have a word with you about lack of credentials required to get a union job at Boeing, if we're going to split hairs.
