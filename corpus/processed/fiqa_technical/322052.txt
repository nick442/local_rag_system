Actually it's a perfectly good way. There is solid evidence showing most top level corporation CEOs do relatively little. A huge amount of the time their profits are down to market increases, they claim responsibility. Yet they blame the market when it is on a downturn abduction avoid losing bonuses etc. So they win every way. Really share holders needsimple majority (not super majority as it is now) to oppose remuneration packets and for the votes to be binding not merely advisory as they are now. Also share holders should be able to offer counter remuneration packages etc. The remuneration committee system is in need of huge reform because it does not work (as committee members are industry peers at or around that level it always pays to inflate offers because they benefit as it inflates exec wages in the industry) and is full of perverse incentives. Share holders need more power and claw back systems introduced for poor performance and more modest bonuses, bonuses spread over long periods of time and linked to long term profitability, no golden handshakes or welcomes, more measured bonuses and some claw backs set against market indicators so they dont ride on successes out of their control. There also needs to be more willingness to fire poorly performing execs.
