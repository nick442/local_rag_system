The reason California is suffering for housing is that they refuse to build up and tear down older suburbs. They want to keep the smaller city vibe and don't care about the long term effects or costs. If sf had the density of nyc which itself is far less dense than most major european or asian cities, then housing wouldnt be an issue. Think about it this way, housing in sf and metro area is more expensive than tokyo, even tokyo houses way more people. Combine the area of LA metro plus nycmetro and you about the size of tokyo metro, but it houses 10x as many people. Its density, clinging to the past and poor planning problem, not an industry is evil problem.
