"I don't disagree that many times psychologists can exaggerate or even present fabricated claims about human behavior only in an effort to rack in some extra money. HOWEVER, any close to normal person can see that there are a whole lot of people with serious issues that nobody mentions to them (or they themselves are afraid to acknowledge) because they don't want to deal with all of the drama. Anyway, let's see how legitimate the (25% of americans suffer from mental illness) claim is. 1)http://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/advisories/1201185326.aspx ""A new national report reveals that 45.9 million American adults aged 18 or older, or 20 percent of this age group, experienced mental illness in the past year. "" http://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/advisories/1201185326.aspx 2) http://wwwapps.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america.shtml ""hen applied to the 2004 U.S. Census residential population estimate for ages 18 and older, this figure translates to 57.7 million people.2Even though mental disorders are widespread in the population, the main burden of illness is concentrated in a much smaller proportion — about 6 percent, or 1 in 17 — who suffer from a serious mental illness."" ..You can find countless studies like this online. Now, obviously somebody is thinking about pointing out, at this point, that all of these studies were conducted by psychologists or psychiatrists only trying to validate their initial claims and ultimately for economic benefit. And, well--if you that's your argument, then yes, you are absolutely right that there is absolutely no way ""prove"" that the 25% statistic is correct. And, just to be clear, the term ""Mental Illness"" in this case(according to the above studies) is really anything from anxiety, to depression, to schizophrenia, personality disorders, and even more social things like compulsive lying. Obviously, the definition is very broad and that is precisely why the statistic(25%) is so shocking."
