"Then my 100% honest answer would be the same. But an insignificant and uncorrectable number of people. Not that anyone going without healthcare isn't concerning, just that it will happen no matter what path we choose, and a free market diminishes it the most. Some people won't act in their own interests. Did you read the original article I posted? It appears you did not, I encourage you to do so. Everyone would like to receive ""free"" stuff, no surprise. I'm coming from an honest admission that the market would and should provide a variety of differing qualities of healthcare to best serve everyone and their differing valuation of their health. Government cannot do that, but a free market can. Like shoes or anything else. We can't all afford italian leather loafers, but most people can get shoes of all sorts of sizes and styles and colors. That's because the market works. Let the market work in healthcare, and you get the absolute fewest people without it, and they can spend what they want on it. People who exercise every day will probably spend more on it, those who drink and smoke everyday probably won't, and that's not my business. Or yours, quite frankly."
