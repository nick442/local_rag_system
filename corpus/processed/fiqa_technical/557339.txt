No shit. The reason the Resource Curse myth exists is because of the strong correlation between resources and poverty which exists because Europe is resource-poor and high-IQ, and Africa is resource-rich and low-IQ. It has nothing to do with resources causing poverty except in an evolutionary perspective.
