A home equity loan (not a HELOC home equity line of credit) typically comes with far lower fees, but a slightly higher rate. As rates fell over the last decade, I saw a choice of the Equity Loan with no cost at all, or a refinance with a few thousand in closing costs. We refinanced 3 times with the home equity loan, the last one was 5%. As the 15 year regular mortgage hit 3.5%, it seemed worth the costs, about $1800, to get the low rate, and expecting that rates would go lower. The 1.5% savings on the balance put our breakeven at fewer than 6 months. If you truly meant HELOC, the variable aspect is the risk, as rates how little room down from here, but much room to rise.
