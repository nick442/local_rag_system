"The markets now are projecting inflation over the next 10 years of only [1.19 percent](http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/data/inflation_expectations/). That's the lowest since the deflation that drove the Great Depression. And prices just **fell** [in May](http://tucsoncitizen.com/usa-today-news/2012/06/14/consumer-prices-fall-0-3-in-may/), *deflation* once again. The last time before this that prices *fell* was the last half of 2008 -- the start of the Great Recession. So we have prices **falling** again, and the last time two times we had unexpected significant price falls they gave us the Great Depression and Great Recession. Anyone who is actually afraid of inflation today is somewhere between being totally out of touch with reality and being an obsessive loon. >So just help me figure out why there are economic arguments against purposefully high inflation (5%) You *don't* want ""purposely high inflation"". One party's gain with that is just another party's loss. However we are eons away from that, for better or worse. But what we ***really don't want*** -- with deflation pressing all around us again, creating a real need for monetary (not fiscal) stimulus to prevent the third ""Great"" bad thing -- is inflation paranoids running around trying to stop it screaming ""Weimar! Zimbabwe! We're about to turn into another Weimar / Zimbabwe!"" Paranoia about inflation is absolutely destructive in this economy. Yet, [Conservatives prefer socialism to 3% inflation](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=14918), forgetting everything Milton Friedman taught them. Alas, it's true."
