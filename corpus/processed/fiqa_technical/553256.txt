Why not ask Willard Romney about this, he has 138 differant accounts in the Cayman's island, all with the post office box of 908. Not to mention his accounts in Swiss banks,banks in Ireland and a few more. The only problem with asking Willard Romney about this is, we will get a differant answer each time we ask.
