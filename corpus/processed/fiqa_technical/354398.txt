Being from outside the US and the media's bias towards Obama, you probably see more of Romney's screw-ups than Obama's. Trust me, Obama has had some major gaffes when not reading from a teleprompter. Example: the only news I've seen reported on the major networks about Julia Gillard, is when she tripped on her heels a few weeks ago, unfortunately this is what the media thinks we need to see rather than actual news events.
