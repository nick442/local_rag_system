Where does the accounting come in? Is that in addition to your other undergraduate? I am still confused. Regardless, I wouldn't really worry about calling it a double major. Just list each degree. If received at the same time and with the same GPA I would list on one line. If the degree is distinct (separate GPA, received at separate time) then make a new line.
