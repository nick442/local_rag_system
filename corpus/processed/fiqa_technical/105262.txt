You need to think bigger. It's perfectly possible for a couple people to create a search product that could rival Google/Bing. DuckDuckGo was created by one person, and it's quite good at finding things! People said the same thing about Paypal. Look how that turned out! Stripe signed a deal with Starbucks to handle their payments. I believe that also started as two people.. Maybe Simple will take on this problem one day.. https://www.simple.com/
