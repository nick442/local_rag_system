> Where I live, the delivery people are so bad they just leave super expensive packages on the stoop/porch. It is very risky to have anything of value ordered to an address in my neighborhood. If you live in an area that's so risky that you can't leave a box outside, why would you give a company and anyone who works for them, including local labor and thus their friends, a key into your house? > Amazon Key solves that problem, and probably has enough insurance if anything goes wrong. What is your issue with it? I'm not willing to take that bet. I think anyone else who wants to is an idiot.
