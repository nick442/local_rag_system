I need you to open your eyes just a liiiiiiiiiiiiittle bit more. You act like the only kind of weed available are indica strands. I smoke marijuana because it fights my chronic fatigue and nausea. And every time you smoke doesn't get you stoned off your ass to the point where all you can do is sit on the couch and bum it. Some of the greatest minds smoked pot. You're just being willfully closed minded.
