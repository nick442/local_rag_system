> Why are you against making sure their pensions are funded? Pension actuarial analyst here: Pensions can give employee's benefits for time worked long before the plan came into existence. Those 'liabilities' are paid off over 30-40 years. It's absolutely normal. In addition, pension plans may also pay off increases in benefits, such as an early retirement window, over that same 30-40 years. Pension funds use assumptions on future investment earnings to 'guess' their contribution. Sometimes, they don't earn as much as they expect the plan to earn. Sometimes, they try to keep contributions low *as an alternative to scrapping the plan entirely*. So putting this all together: if pension plans are instantly and always 100% funded? You don't get pension plans, with defined and guaranteed retirement benefits. You get plans where the employee defers their own money into accounts, with no particular guarantees at all. And that's why we are fine with unfunded pensions. Oh, by the way, the PBGC charges higher fees to covered pension plans that have more unfunded liability! So if a company doesn't want to pay contributions, they have to pay more elsewhere. It all evens out.
