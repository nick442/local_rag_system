I got sucked into working with a tech company when I was striving to be an Investment banker in San Francisco. I can't stress enough how much better I have it now working with a great tech company, with great pay, flexible hours and great vacation time. But i'll admit, sometimes it feels like we're in our own little flourishing world.
