You have not answered the question of total market and total amount that works out poorly for municipalities. You keep listing examples where it went badly, and have not compared that to the total size and those that went well. Without that ratio one cannot make a reasonable, informed decision. The total municipal bond market has about $3.7 trillion in it. You (and the article) list problems totaling in the tens of billions of dollars. Let's round up to 100 billion. That is still less than 3% of them going bad, which is a pretty good default rate. If 97% of such projects were a success (and I'm not claiming they are) then they should continue. >Not included are the hundreds of smaller venues such as arenas and ice hockey facilities that almost never produce the sorts of economic benefits promised Yes, you keep listing only one side; I asked for the other sides data which you still have not provided. If I only list those auto airbag incidents that result in kids dying, you'd conclude that airbags are bad and must be removed. However, by avoiding honest data you'd be making a mistake. All I ask for in this case is the honest dat, not stories only about when municipal bonds fail. The statistics seem to me to be that the vast amount of them are not included in these stories of problems. >why does the public have to foot the bill? Because they often choose to, and cities certainly complain pretty loudly when a big name team moves away, so apparently cities like having sport teams.
