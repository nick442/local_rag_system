"Throughout the mid 00's, TV was filled with crappy ""reality"" shows like ""Flip This House"" showing people spending an obscene amount of money on a dilapidated house, then spending an obscene amount of money on it renovating it, and then selling it for an obscene profit a month later. There were even shows where they would rip out new kitchens, spend $100k on a new one, and make $200,000 on the sale. The housing market was insane, and was being pushed by realtors, and mortgage companies to trick people into thinking an obscenely priced house was doable on their barely middle class income. Buyer beware. If prices are going up 20% a year, don't buy into it 4 years into the run and expect it to last forever."
