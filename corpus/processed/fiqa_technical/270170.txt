Minneapolis, St Louis. ...I would agree that Taco Bell is better than Qdoba. ..but that's because health wise it is worse than Qdoba...Qdoba is good if you find one with a great manager that knows you have to change out the trays often. They are the original ones as far as queso goes...last time I ate there they had this great bacon queso that was so good..but you have to be very high on weed to enjoy any of these fake mexican restaurants. When I'm sober, I can only stomach real mexican.
