"Well they've ""created"" what $5trillion in the last few years? Many people are arguing that they'd created too much not too little. That money, the new debt being issued, just isn't being very effective and we see people/banks/corporations hoarding cash and bonds instead of investing and creating new wealth. If everyone went out and spent their money and invested in new factories, farms, malls, or whatever, we would see tons of new jobs and the Dow at 20,000 but that isn't happening for whatever reason."
