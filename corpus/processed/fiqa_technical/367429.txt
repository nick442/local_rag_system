>There’s no simple way to estimate the cost of UBI. But let’s assume the program is intended to alleviate poverty. The U.S.-defined poverty line for individuals with no children is $12,500. If the government were to give that annual sum to the 250 million adults in America, the cost would come to $3.125 trillion a year. It’s a massive figure, but not as crazy when you consider the cost of existing entitlement programs. >According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Social Security payments came to $888 billion in fiscal 2015. Medicare, Medicaid and other health-related subsidies were $938 billion, while food stamps and other safety net programs totaled $362 billion. All in, that’s $2.19 trillion. So cut social security and medicare for the elderly who have paid into it all their lives, AND increase spending by a trillion. See, here's the part that doesnt make sense about UBI. The people who need the money the most get less and the program costs more. Then somehow it's labeled as a more efficient distribution of welfare. It's really quite baffling how retarded the concept is.
