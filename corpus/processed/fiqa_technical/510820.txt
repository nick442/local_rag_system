"The advantage of pictures or video is that it is fast to get your records up to date. Pan a video camera over a bookshelf or CD rack, and you can later pause it and either say ""200 paperbacks"" or ""40 PS4 games"" or you can actually list out all the titles so you can go and replace things. Take a picture of your TV/VCR/DVD player/radio receiver and later you can determine the manufacturer and model # from the picture. (Or whatever expensive electronics you have that you treat as furniture and don't remember the technical details about.) My house was broken into and robbed. The insurance people were not content with ""we had a TV."" They wanted to know the make and model. They didn't ask for proof, but they wanted to know the make and model. An inventory to this level of detail is insanely boring to create. Even if you write up a digital document and only update it with things you bought this year. Taking an hour to wander around your house recording video, which you could add narration to if you wanted, is much quicker. Should you suffer a loss you will then have to do the insanely boring work of producing the list, but you will have the video to use for that purpose. No loss, no writing up the inventory needed. And even if insurance doesn't want to know the exact titles you want to replace, or how tall the bookshelves in the living room were, you may want it, and the pictures or video will help with that."
