Most of my coworkers and the number of crappy looking hybrids I see in traffic everyday would disagree with you about the status symbol bit. Nobody wants an ugly car, but people give a crap about the money they're spending on gas. The environment may not be the primary reason, but neither is status. Having an cheap, efficient car you can comfortably commute in, is pretty valuable to most people.
