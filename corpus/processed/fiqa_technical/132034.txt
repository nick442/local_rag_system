"And what's wrong with lower cost? What makes you entitled to higher wage when someone can do it for lower cost? Why do you like eating like a king in from pre industrial era? Why do you not like paying fortune for bacons? Call it use or abuse. That's how it always have worked and made capitalism so successful. I didn't claim ""in ideal economy"". I said in competitive market. There are many industries that are competitive. Many of them have shown that outsourcing portion of IT is the right move. Even Cloud platform such as Azure and AWS are replacement of some IT work traditionally done. Free trade of goods and services(barring externalities and risks) are econ 101. If you don't get it, I suggest you take up a reading on Ricardian Theory. Honestly, I was lucky to have a good professor go over it with me."
