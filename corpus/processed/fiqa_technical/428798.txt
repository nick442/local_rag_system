College for Financial Planning. I completed about 80% of the series before I quit being a financial advisor. It's all very straight forward, but buy some extra highlighters.. lots of material. If you have a finance degree you'll know a lot of it already. It's not too difficult, just stay committed and put together a study schedule.. oh, and take the practice tests. Those help a lot.
