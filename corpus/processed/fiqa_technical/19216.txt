I predict that WP7 and eventually 8 will fill the hole that RIM is leaving this coming year, largely in part due to Nokia and their ability to deliver really nice handsets and market to Europe. RIM has nothing to compete with in 2012 until their BB10 phones come out, but I think it will be far too late to stem the decline. By then we'll have Windows 8 tablets, WP8, a very mature Android market and the iPad 3/iPhone 5.
