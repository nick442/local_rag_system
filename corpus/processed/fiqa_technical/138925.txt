hell even the gulf arab states are doing..well they are somewhat functional. Canada doesn't suffer from a curse. Australia produces nothing but commodities yet still does well. Japan has no resources. korea doesn't either, were colonized and still have done decently. look at the difference between Haiti and DR. same land. but the Dominicans aren't really black.
