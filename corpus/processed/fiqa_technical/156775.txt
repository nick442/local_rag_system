Well my privileged friend, let me tell you that it's over. I live in a place where there are barely contracts anymore, let alone permanent contracts. Overtime is a fond memory. The future will be tougher for the unskilled as these jobs are automated. Once more, it's over. People smart and ambitious enough to be come employers didn't get there by overpaying.
