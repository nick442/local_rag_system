As someone who worked for the federal government when they were hacked, and 23 million people had their ssn, private info, background checks, fingerprints and even secrets that someone could try to blackmail you for released. You guys are lucky, I can't make a new fingerprint for both hands and all fingers! Yeah all of that information is likely in the hands of some hacker group or foreign government. Its shocking at first, but nothing has come of it so far in terms of actually ruining peoples lives (at least released to the public).
