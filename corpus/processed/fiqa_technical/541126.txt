>**Firms responded to this act by significantly increasing repatriations from foreign affiliates.** This paper analyzes the impact of the tax holiday on firm behavior. It controls for endogeneity and omitted variable bias by using instruments that identify the firms likely to receive the largest tax benefits from the holiday. Repatriations did not lead to an increase in investment, employment or R&Dâ€”even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of approximately $1 in payouts to shareholders. Offhand, that's all I would think that they were going to do. If you remove a tax from something, you effectively get more of it. You're removing a tax on *bringing capital home to the US.* This is a good thing no matter what is done with it, because it means our money isn't being used to build up another country. With the dividend being returned to stock holders, you have to realize that retirement plans are the biggest holders of dividend paying stock. Your parents, your grandma, just got a raise. Since they're living on fixed income, this has a very high stimulative effect. They buy something nicer at the grocery. They give their kids and grandkids a $20. This improves the economy from the bottom up. This is undoubtedly a good thing, and certainly much better than keeping that money overseas.
