>You would be extremely delusional if you think the average joe could go to Princeton Well that happens all the time, as long as the 'average' Joe is very intelligent. [15-20% of Princeton's incoming classes receive Pell grants](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/opinion/princeton-takes-on-class-divide.html). >and then get a senior executive position at age 29 Interesting, since a quick look at [Forbes' 30 under 30](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2017/immigrants/#7288b6ef2cc0) suggests that you're wrong again, unless you think that most immigrants that come in are flush with cash and insanely privileged. It turns out that people who are becoming executives under the age of 30 are probably just really gifted people, regardless of upbringing. >I also would know because Im also privileged like David and so are most of my friends. I don't I have a single friend that is paying for their own tuition out of pocket. Thanks, Donald. Nice humble brag.
