> Panasonic hasn't yet agreed to put up a penny In your own link it talks about their 200-300 million initial investment. Which you would know if you knew anything about the company, or the news on Thursday. Which, of course, you don't, and yet you keep talking. Really, you are aggressively ignorant. I really don't understand how it's possible, or what your motivation is to be so intentionally wrong about everything you say. Seriously, get a clue. Try talking about things you know about..if such a subject even exists.
