The counterfeit bills that are most popular near my school take a 1 dollar bill, wash the ink off, and print a 20 dollar bill image onto it. A pen cannot detect these. If you have a good printer, you can go from 10 one dollar bills to 10 twenty dollar bills in a day. Mostly teens do this, so 200 dollars is a lot of money. Also, the paper keeps all security feature except for the metallic ink, so the bills don't work at a bank. a guy I know makes money, turns it into bitcoin, transfers it to a zcash account, and then to another zcash account. the money becomes untracable.
