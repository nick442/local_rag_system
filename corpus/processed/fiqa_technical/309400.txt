"This is a great data find. I've been trying to explain to my friends for years that outsizes corporate profits have been caused by outsized corporate leverage but they never believe me (and never bother picking up a 10-K either). I do, however have an issue with this statement: >If corporations really are people, it's time for them to start acting like people--and sharing their wealth. I don't know that many people who actively ""share"" their wealth. My parents have always seemed much more concerned about saving for retirement and college than they did about ""sharing"" their wealth with others. To somehow imply that sharing wealth is the natural human thing to do is a bit presumptuous."
