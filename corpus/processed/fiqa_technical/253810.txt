Exactly. There's not unlimited points out there. Classic innovation cycle where at the end the returns are ultimately directly correlated to capital and it is not particularly profitable for most market participants. Incidentally, never understood why retail investors care about HFT. IF they squeeze a few basis points out of you getting in and out of a position, it's still way less than what brokers are taking you for. And if you're wearing it for years, should be basically noise relative to the overall performance.
