I wasn't real impressed with the journalism. It's just a list of accidents and emotional appeal. Industrial accidents happen everywhere, not just Alabama. Believe it or not - you don't remove someone's crushed limb because they'll bleed to death. Yes - that's what people are trained to do - leave them in till the ambulance gets there. And the guy apparently just entered a press without communicating with the operator or employing any lockout/tagout protocols? Having worked in factories most of the incidents were people doing exactly what they were trained to not do.
