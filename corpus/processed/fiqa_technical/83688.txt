I know its a stretch and I'm not saying that I totally agree with it but you can argue that one person's own selfish consumption habits can be costly to the rest of us. Perhaps it is a little like drunk driving, however, the harm there is physical first rather than financial. I think that they should go ahead with the ban. If nothing changes at all then reverse it. Give people that one (totally unimportant) freedom back. However, if it does produce positive results then what? That is probably what Coca-Cola is most worried about.
