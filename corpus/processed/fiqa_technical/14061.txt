From InvestingAnswers, the price of a bond is equal to the present value of its future cash flows, as shown in the following formula: Where: By induction, this is equivalent to: or, using more familiar formulae, it is equivalent to the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity to represent the coupon payments, plus a term for the discounted value at maturity: For example, a 10 year semiannual bond with coupon payment 10%, priced at 1095 with maturity value 1000. Solving for r yields 0.0428332 or 4.28% semi-annually. (8.75% per annum) The solution can be found by plotting or using a solver, which many pocket calculators have.
