For the present if you can't figure out anything big with a small budget, then start something small e.g Make brownies, bake cakes etc experiment and put up your name tag on the product and see if your friends buy some stock from you, then link them all on facebook. If you are good with your product, people wouldn't care a lot about the packaging add-ons or frills and if orders start coming consistently well, then implement your book build systems, jack up prices, etc. But don't blow all your cash on day one if don't have a queue waiting for your goodies.
