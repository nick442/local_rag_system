There's a lot of foreign small and big businesses - as well as foreign individuals - that would love to invest in India. But they can't because of the strict regulations and outright prohibitions on foreigners. And instead of tearing down barriers to entry, Indian government is introducing more protectionist measures (as cheap goods come from China and Indian businesses can't compete despite cheaper labor force.) I don't know the answer to India's problems. I don't know what's going to happen. But I agree with the Infosys guy: India is no China and will not see that sort of success anytime soon. Sure, India is gaining ground every year, but to even catch up to China of today, it is going to take decades.
