You could easily move to Nashville TN. Enough jobs, low cost of living and high median wages. But no you insist on living in all of these trendy places and complain life is so hard and expensive. You americans really don't understand how fucking entitled you are. If you have ever endured poverty you'd understand what I'm talking about. But you insist that a life without traveling and smartphones is miserable. You americans are nothing but a bunch of privileged pigs. The sooner the likes like you die off the better. America should be in the hands of those willing to work and look for opportunities, not for those waiting to get them handed.
