The first thing to realize is that MLM is not really a selling job, yes they all sell products but that's not how you make any money. And be careful not to stockpile inventory, you'll end up with $4000 dollars worth in your garage that you'll never use. MLM is really a recruiting and training sales people job. If you are willing and have the talent to recruit and train sales people then it may be right for you. The only people that make a good living recruit new sale people all the time, and have hundreds of sale people in there down lines. There is a lot of attrition and you have to keep recruiting to replace those lost. Don't think you are going to get rich at this part time. There are a lot of millionaires from MLM but they work a lot of hours recruiting and training. If you don't have a lot of time to devote to it I wouldn't do it at all. MLM is not for everyone, but the ones that are good at it and put in the time make a lot of money from it.
