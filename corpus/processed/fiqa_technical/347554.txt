So I actually just messaged him like why do you need a copy of my college diploma and he said his lawyer said he needs a copy of the diplomas of the people he specifically supervises on an Italian client (we work in PR and have companies and sometimes government subsidized companies as clients).. so maybe it does check out? I mean I did my due diligence I'm not sure what else I can do. If he photoshops it, that's on him.
