if in america, actually voting out your state and national congressperson is the best start. Find a privacy bill and if they signed to erode privacy (patriot act, state consumer laws, national consumer laws) then vote the fuckers out and send them a note why.

Congress has low ratings like between 10 and 20 percent favorability yet a 80 percent incumbent range. my Primary residence on the books is California, and I always vote against our congresspeople democrat or republican based on their votes. It just takes about 15 min of research to see if they are worthy or not.
