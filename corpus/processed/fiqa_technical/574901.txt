It's good advice that I use on occasion. It typically only works for small businesses though. You need to keep in mind that everytime you swipe your card that business pays 1.5-3% processing fee to Visa/MasterCard and probably won't see your money in their account for at least a month. Also since cash has less of a paper trail many businesses don't accurately report it come tax time (ie. they subsequently pay less taxes).
