My gut reaction is to agree with you. Then I realize that I'm shopping for a laptop that would have been a supercomputer ten years ago and planning to spend about $500. I think there's going to be a tipping point in 3D printing where it will just explode. And with the platform vendors locking their platforms down, figure a lot of the hobbyists are going to explode in that direction. Pick the date you think we'll be able to print an electric motor (or at least the parts so it can be assembled) and I wouldn't be shocked if by that date some geek has actually printed him/herself a car.
