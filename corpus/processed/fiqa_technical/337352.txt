> Because the cost [in the past] was still going to keep most people out of university. Trust me: anyone with excellent grades got in the university for free or almost for free back then. And if they had to take a loan, I doubt it, the costs of universities was much much less than today. No major debt. > Finishing high school was never as hard as you suggest and didn't guarantee you any sort of job There is no way, no way, that today's high school kids can pass math and English tests from 20, 30 or before that. No way!! > Overall high school graduation rates in 1968 were 5% lower than they were in 2004. Because there was discipline in 1968 and if you graduated, you really got education, discipline, manners, focus and the desire to work hard to get results. Do you really believe that today's high schoolers will survive a 1968 high school? Yes or no? **Do you doubt what I said that 30+ years ago you did not need a BA degree to get a job as a teller in the bank?** In 1968, a warehouse worker could support a large family with the wife being a homemaker. Try it today. Am I right? In 1968, with a BA degree, with almost no exception, you are guaranteed a very well paying job and excellent career prospects. Am I right?
