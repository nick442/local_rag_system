Kaspersky has been the top or in the top couple performers in independent tests for years. I agree with this move though, just as I agree that the government ban on purchasing Lenovo (my recommended enterprise laptop manufacturer) is a good move. None of this is for economic reasons, but because there is a small risk these companies could be forced to abuse their access and act maliciously.
