Can you point me to where you got the figure for number of car crashes? If it cost $230k per accident, based on the the total cost of $270 billion, that would mean there were ~1.17 million accidents. [Based on the 2010 census, there were 5.5 million accidents](http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1114.pdf) Unfortunately, they didn't have the 2010 figures which this report is based on but let's assume this figure would remain around there. Then we'd come out to $49,000 / accident.
