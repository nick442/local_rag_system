What are you trying to buy that's not on Prime? I find that almost everything (something like 99%) of what I want to but on Amazon has a Prime option. Free shipping alone makes it worth it and it is soo nice getting things in 2 days. Then you get Prime video and some music (niceties that I would never buy alone but nice perks on top of the shipping)
