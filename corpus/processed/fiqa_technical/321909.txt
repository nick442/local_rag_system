I think it's impossible to work for an evil company without realizing they're evil, just as it's impossible to work for a sinking ship without realizing just that. Any worker with half a brain would be able to tell the store is going under (open for business and nobody home? More employees in the store than customers?). If I worked at any of those places, I'd be sending my resume out day and night looking for a way out. However, for most of the people on the actual store floors, they're McJobs anyway, and as much as it sucks to axe them, those jobs come and go by the dozen anyway.
