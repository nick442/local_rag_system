While there certainly are many specific predictions that have proven completely wrong, the fundamental complaint is that the structure of our economy is unsustainable, with the prediction that this will eventually be revealed in a terrible way. Simply pointing out that the day of reckoning has been staved off for the immediate future does nothing to address or rebut the actual complaint. For example, we've been some 40 years now without a catastrophe attributable to global warming; should that be taken as indicative that the fundamental logic that predicts an eventual catastrophe is a load of bunk? Should the reasonable advance prediction requirement be harder for economics than for a hard science?
