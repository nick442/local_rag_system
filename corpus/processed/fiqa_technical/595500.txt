I feel like if you go to a non-target school that gets no love then it's a good way to show that you learned finance and you're just as good as the other folks. Whether its worth the time it takes to study, that's for you to decide. Although I've heard if you have an undergrad degree in finance the level 1 is not ridiculously hard.
