Kroger is the largest grocery chain in the U.S. and generally not seen as 'expensive'. Unless you are going to Aldi or Save-A-Lot, I don't think you are going to find anything 'lower priced'. You do know you don't have to provide real information when signing up for those cards, right? That's basically a non-issue.
