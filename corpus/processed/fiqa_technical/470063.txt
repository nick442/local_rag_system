That's a great answer. Now here's how it really works. You forgive student debts, the lenders take major losses. This creates a major credit crisis and the financial institutions need to be bailed out all over again. This means using taxpayer dollars and printing massive amounts of money. The value of student debt is over $1 trillion. That is about a third what the government pays in a typical year, so just imaging how that would effect the deficit when they have to foot the bill because there is no way in the hell the banks are paying it.
