You will likely have an options pricing course in your degree program. If option pricing is not part of the curriculum at all, I would transfer out. I've had a few co-workers and interviewed candidates who graduated from satellite campuses of major schools. It's surprising how many of them somehow made it through a finance degree program never learning about options and other derivatives. The guys that never learned them end up having to play catch up on the job. A good portion of them end up figuring it out, but a group of them also end up being let go or they leave because they just can't figure it out.. Options are a key and important part of Finance, make sure you understand them! They also aren't that hard to figure out.
