"Which hedge fund outperforms consistently, year after year? Hedge funds are over-rated, and few truly outperform.. nor do many actually provide a hedge as they were originally intended to do. Some funds have great years, but only because most hedge funds take much bigger risks via derivatives.. and thus they have huge down years as well. BTW being ""VERY well-funded"" is a DISadvantage, not an advantage. It's tremendously more difficult to make large percentage gains on $1 billion than it is to make gains on $1 million."
