"This is one-sided and a terrible guest for freakonomics. 'Marriage rates re low because men aren't marriage material anymore"" That's laughable. Marriage rates are low because men don't want to marry loose girls, marriage itself is a lose-lose financial contract for men, men don't want to marry an obese and unattractive woman. I could go on and on."
