"As of right now it looks like you can't issue an ETF at least because the underlying ""commodity"" isn't regulated. (See Winkelvoss ETF). I suspect you would run into this problem with any 1940 act fund (mutual fund), but it's more a situation of ""not approved"" rather than illegal, so an MLP hedge fund structure would probably be fine. And some googling finds Iterative Instinct Management's Storj SPV."
