So, what is the argument to be bullish on Roku? I absolutely love the interface, so much so that all 4 of the TVs in my house are on a Roku device - or are Roku TV's. The simplicity and speed destroy most smart TV set-ups, especially Samsung. I understand that they can be easily copied by the big guys with deep pockets, but is there a scenario where Roku emerges as the primary interface for streaming on TV's?
