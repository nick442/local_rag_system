Ah yes! The filthy rich have let us schlubs use their equipment and their buildings, so we can be thankful that they artificially increase prices with virtual monopolies and take their manufacturing jobs out of country, creating an reduction in labor wages. I’m totally thankful that they are rich enough to control politics and tell us how thankful we should be for it. Yes, big money has done and used to do great things. These days, however, the cash that isn’t bent towards directly making more money is bent towards putting policies in place to make them more money. There is no recognition of “how will this impact the populace at large.” Do you remember that age old question they put to inventors? “You asked if you could, but never stopped to ask if you should.” We have let money control so much that people have become worth less than big money’s interests. Thank the Gods we live in a country that treats money better than people, because that isn’t going poorly at all. /s
