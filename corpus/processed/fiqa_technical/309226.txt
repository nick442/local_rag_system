In a fixed currency system large corporations can easily fund big new investments and it's super cheap. That's because they are using retained earnings and not competing with lots of fractionally reserved money that is squandering resources chasing whatever bubble is in vogue at the moment. If you know that a company called Toyota with no access to any retained earnings should build a car for $1 billion dollars and it is guaranteed to be a success before you ever even got started well then you've solved the central planning problem and can just do away with private industry and omnisciently run the whole world by dictatorial decree because you have perfect information about the future. That doesn't mean that government shouldn't exist. In a gold backed system the government can tax the population and invest in infrastructure or whatever but when they do that the population will have less to spend, consumption industries will contract and production will be reallocated to the government's whim until the investing is over and then the people will all get their money back through wages or business profits from selling to the government. It's important that the government have a stable and predictable spending program so they don't cause undue damage to the capital structure.
