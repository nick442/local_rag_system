"As everyone else has said, we're producing gasoline, not crude oil. But since you asked, even if we did produce enough crude for our needs, we would still import if someone else can produce it more cheaply, or if our resources would be better spent elsewhere. The classic example from economics class is a dentist hiring someone to mow his lawn. Sure, the dentist is a healthy guy, he could mow his own grass for free. But that would take him an hour, and he could be using that hour to be a dentist, instead. And an hour of dentistry is worth a lot more than an hour of mowing the lawn. This is called ""comparative advantage"" - for trade, it doesn't matter how productive you are in absolute terms, just that you can do one thing better than another."
