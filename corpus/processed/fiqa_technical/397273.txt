Companies in Korea are unlike companies in the West. While he was CEO by title the person who actually wielded top power was the son of the Chairman who was set to “inherit” the company due to..being the son of the chairman. In Korea, people liken CEOs as essentially a royal-family system. It’s not merit based, and you often see incredibly hands off, young, and/or irresponsible CEOs while the working class within the company actually maintains its success. It’s weird for us to think about as Westerners because we see the CEO being a merit and experienced based position optimized for shareholder earnings.
