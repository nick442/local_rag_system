Fortunately, I enjoy veggie burgers a lot more than real burgers. Black bean burgers especially. Occasionally I'll go have a real meat burger once a month maybe when I go to five guys but that's about it. If you haven't tried veggie burgers, I highly recommend it. If you like it, it will benefit you health wise. If you don't like it, try a different kind of veggie patty.
