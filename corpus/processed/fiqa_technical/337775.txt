My answer is a combination of the the one from Aaron and Joe. The IRS used to have a December 31st deadline for when the procedure needed to be done. They extended it a few years ago to cut down on the number of people buying glasses between Christmas and New Years. There is an even later deadline for submitting the paperwork. Check the documents for your plan. Some will have a way for you to specify which plan year to use. They will also specify how they handle ones during this overlap period for expenses automatically submitted by a Doctor or Pharmacy, or when using the special credit card they give you. Ask them how they address splitting it between the old and the new plan year.
