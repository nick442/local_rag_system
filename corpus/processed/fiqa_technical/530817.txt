I always thought that it was really hard to get into a PhD program without at least a masters? Looking at most of my professors resumes, they seem to all have masters from schools other than where they received their PhDs. I would prefer to get a MFE then PhD if money wasn't an option(if I decided to go the academia route), but because money is an option a PhD without paying for a masters would be ideal.
