">During the dot-com boom, tons of people with liberal arts degrees and no experience wound up as ""software engineers"". Not all of them sucked, but many did, and the dot-com crash sorted that out. As an engineer, I saw this first hand, and it wasn't a bad thing -- I had a lot of co-workers in 2000 who weren't pulling their weight. This is going to sound heartless, and maybe it is, but if someone has been unemployed 3 years, maybe it is time for a career change. This was what I'm arguing about not the economics of the situation. You make the argument that it is not a bad thing because their skills were lacking. But that isn't the case with the receptionists and this is not just one branch that is suffering. I think its a terrible thing that has little to do with the skills of people and the ""right"" career path. When there are no jobs or very little jobs being unemployed for 3 years is hell and considering a career change it not as simple as you make it sound."
