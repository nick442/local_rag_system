"Man, it's amazing when someone so blatantly telegraphs that they have no idea what they are talking about. ""I'm not even going to bother"" is such an obvious copout. If you really weren't going to bother you wouldn't even post, you would just move on. Instead you are compelled to post but have absolutely nothing to counter the argument with. What incentivizes a person to post and dispute someone when they know full well that they are too ignorant to actually argue or articulate a point? I would love to understand how your mind works."
