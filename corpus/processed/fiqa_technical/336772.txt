"Look, we don't have to agree but the US has the most advanced military in the world, one of the most stable societies, and an amazingly innovative economy. Why do you think ""investors"" are still buying US debt with such low rates? People don't buy US debt as an investment but as a preservation tool. These people have such large amounts of money that they give it to us knowing they will see it back. The US controls the printing press of the world's most important currency. The US has such an upper hand in this world. Can you provide me with any good arguments for your position?"
