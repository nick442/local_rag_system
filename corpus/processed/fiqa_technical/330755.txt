"As a rule, if you will, recruiting is broken down into ""targets"", ""semi-targets"", and ""non-targets"". A target school is one where almost all bulge bracket investment banks recruit heavily, semi-targets are where some recruit, and non-targets are where almost none recruit. This isn't an end-all-be-all, because many middle market and boutique banks recruit at a wide variety of schools, but use this as a guide essentially. **Targets**: Harvard, Wharton, Princeton, MIT, Duke, NYU, Stanford, Columbia, Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell, Chicago, UC-Berkeley, and other top schools I might've left out (Amherst or other good liberal arts schools, I'm less familiar here) **Semi-Targets**: Vanderbilt, UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, Notre Dame, Emory, Michigan, Indiana, Texas, etc. (think great state schools) **Non-Targets**: You get the picture. Less recruiting here, but some might still get recruited at. As far as programs go, Economics, Finance, Engineering, Physics-it could be a million things. What matters is that the degree is at least somewhat challenging and you show an interest in finance."
