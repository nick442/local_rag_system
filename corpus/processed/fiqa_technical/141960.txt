"> No, it's realistic to try.. I disagree. I think most minimum wage people would better off investing in lottery tickets. (And I think lotteries should be illegal). > I'm not 100% on clear on why some new businesses succeed and some fail. Let me give you some reasons why a minimum wage person will almost certainly fail when trying to start a business: * No skills -- If they had skills to offer they wouldn't be making minimum wage. * No product -- Few minimum wage workers are in positions where they are working with a product they have the ability to improve, a-la Eli Whitney. This means any company they start would need to be selling a skill, not a product, but then see ""No skills"". * No business savvy -- A business takes a minimum of three diverse skill sets (administration, marketing, product). Again, ""No skills"". If this person did have some skills (s)he would still need friends to fill in the gaps. * No time -- Many people working minimum wage have other responsibilities (kids or second jobs). They simply do not have the cycles to invest in a new business. * No starting capital -- Since they work minimum wage they have no money. With no money they can't afford tools needed to make or provide their product. The also can't afford to go without a paycheck as the business ramps up. * Barriers to entry -- Existing companies will defend their customers and protect their market share. The local store will chase you away if you try to sell lemonade in front. You would need to buy a storefront or booth but ""No starting capital"". In addition, any good storefront or booth is already taken by the bigger guys so you're going to get poor traffic in whatever you get. * Bad information -- There are many companies whose business is to take advantage of low-wage entrepreneurs and push terrible ideas. These people become disillusioned pushing bad products or getting into multilevel marketing schemes."
