">most tax incentives are not a literal, real-time transfer of money from the tax payers to the corporations. But they ARE in fact exactly that, they are just not DIRECT transfers. >I have had quite a few discussions with people about this and some folks think that their tax dollars are literally being transferred form their paycheck withholdings to a company's bank account and that is not exactly true. No, it is not *technically* true -- but in the end, it IS ultimately more true than you are attempting to characterize it. If someone scatters poison onto ground, grows plants that they know will take up that toxin, feeds the resulting grain to a chicken, and then serves the chicken to his guests, he is not DIRECTLY poisoning his guests.. but in fact he still is poisoning them. --- Go reread Bastiat (or Hazlitt) on the ""Seen versus the Unseen""."
