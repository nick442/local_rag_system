It all stems from the Olympics trying to clean up its sports, so they required all of the governing bodies for the sports under their umbrella to begone signatories to the WADA code which, in an effort to harmonize and strengthen enforcement put a mutual recognition clause in their Code. This way, say a French athlete is found to have doped at a US event, he wouldn't still be allowed to compete in France or in some other sport. But the Pro Bowler's Association is not a WADA signatory, so you can dope and still bowl there. Just don't be a member of the Fédération internationale des quilleurs.
