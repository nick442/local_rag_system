(I'm a bot) ***** > In their effort to find &quot;Pay-fors&quot; for a lower corporate rate, some have suggested that Congress reduce or even eliminate the R&D tax credit, a tax incentive for companies to invest more in R&D that has been in force since 1981. > We should follow the model from other nations, many of which have not only reduced statutory corporate tax rates but also expanded, sometimes significantly, their tax incentives for business R&D. In fact, the United States continues to lose ground compared to other nations when it comes to tax incentives for research, falling from 10th among OECD nations in 2000 to 25th today. > While ITIF does not believe that corporate tax reform should be revenue neutral, at least on a static scoring basis, one way to pay for at least some of the static revenue loss from lower rates is to eliminate many special tax breaks. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6m6m00/why_expanding_the_randd_tax_credit_is_key_to/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~162833 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **tax**^#1 **credit**^#2 **research**^#3 **rate**^#4 **corporate**^#5"
