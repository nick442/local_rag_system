I'm Asian (Korean). My parents gave me a choice between doctor and world-leading anything. Want to join a band? You better be the next fucking U2. I ended up getting into Stanford for engineering and working for Google. They won't be happy until I launch a world changing product or become an exec. It's exhausting.
