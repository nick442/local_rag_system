Well, if that's the case the whole article is rubbish because it's not Goldman-Sachs who are excluded, but practically everyone. This [Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&FundId=3820#tab=2), which you might have in your 401k, is holding $26M worth of them. That was the first place I thought to look for Venezuelan bonds - I'd expect practically every global emerging markets bond fund would be holding some. [The executive order only applies to some new funds which have been issued to two government entities and which appear not to have been sold outside Venezuela yet.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-25/with-u-s-bond-sanctions-walls-close-in-on-venezuela-s-regime) Edit: [another article from Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-08-25/it-s-hard-to-quit-venezuela-s-debt-when-it-pays-so-well): > And yet investors have actually been warming up to Venezuelan bonds in the past week. The nation's dollar-denominated debt has gained nearly 1 percent in the period, while notes of the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela have returned 1.7 percent. > â€¦ anyone who's been plowing money into emerging-market bond funds recently is most likely also investing in Venezuela because its debt makes up about 2 percent of a main broad benchmark that many EM investors use as a guide.
