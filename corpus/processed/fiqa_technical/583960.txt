What is shocking to me are statements like this: >Basically, the MID encourages affluent homeowners to buy more extravagant homes than they otherwise would. No shit sherlock. When anyone is buying a home and they have $X/mo to spend, they factor in the deduction and conclude they can spend 10-30% more on a house, so they buy bigger or more expensive houses. Its like the authors of the law thought people would spend the same amount on a house regardless of the deduction rather than factor in the deduction into what they can afford.
