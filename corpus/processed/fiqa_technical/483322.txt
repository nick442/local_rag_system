Fair points, but these things all use our existing body functions, aside from electro-mechanical assists. It's when we start doing genetic alterations that I'm wondering about. Will it be like GMOs â€” immediate gains that everyone takes to, but with genetic effects that don't become apparent until later, or will side effects become immediately obvious and correctible? But I probably am worrying for nothing (my personal makeup). The western world is already a couple of generations ahead of the undeveloped world. A leap like this won't have any tangible effect on them that doesn't already exist. And maybe this will be something that can level the playing field for our poor (like downloadable learning).
