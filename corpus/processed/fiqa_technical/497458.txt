Sorry, but I found the opinion piece a very weak argument for deregulation. Mr. Salter backs none of his assertions with a single study or researched fact. Mr. Salter shows a lack of any nuance when it comes to understanding that not all regulations are stifling competition, and in fact some do help 'the little guy'. Most of his baseless complaint revolves around the idea that the 'too big to fail' mega-banks are making out big time with regulations killing competition. Fails to grasp the idea that deregulation is what created these economy destroying mega-banks in the first place.
