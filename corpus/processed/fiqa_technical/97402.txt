"That sounds about right. However, and this is just a quibble, it's not 90m notional of swap, or at least I've not heard it expressed quite that way for a total return instrument.. generally I hear the word exposure, in this case the # of ""shares"" purchased at a specific index level. So 90mm exposure in S&P 500 at today's closing price is: 90,000,000 / 2411.8 = a swap on 37, 317 shares. If you want to maintain the 90mm exposure month to month, you will structure the instrument with a ""variable notional"". At each reset, the swap's # of shares will vary inversely with the index level to maintain the 90mm exposure. You rightly point out that the financing is based on the 90mm figure. As a final note, the dealer may also guarantee some profit by quoting a spread between the swap's initial index levels, depending on whether the portfolio wants to go long or short the index."
