Uber seems to be a risky endeavor but if they find the most profitable areas and squeeze out competition might be able to bet a sustainable model. Might take a while to recover the invested capital. Late investors might not recover. Then again mass transit and traveling habits might increase or decrease need for Uber. Anyway they have plenty of capital for now so enjoy the rides.
