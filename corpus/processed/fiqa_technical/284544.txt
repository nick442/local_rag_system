The connectors are long out of patent, so there's nothing to stop someone from manufacturing compatible components - eapecially ones that don't duplicate anything in LEGO's current library. LEGO's just making the best of it - knowing that it will happen regardless, so they may as well make sure everyone is making pieces that match LEGO's quality.
