"No country or place will be heaven. No matter how good a place is, heaven is partially defined as what is unattainable. This is also why ""the golden age is never the current age."" Part of what makes this country good is the free market and its capitalistic greed. If workers don't like what they're offered at Walmart, they are free to leave to a better paying competitor such as Costco. I do agree with some of your statements about tax reform and political financing. However, people lose sight of what this country offers and bashing the US is a popular pastime on Reddit. If any of these people actually lived in some of the countries they often idolize (China), they would gain a newfound appreciation of the US. As for the insults, they don't particularly help your case."
