The key to getting a job in college and for the rest of your life is networking and knowing exactly where you want to work not a business card. During a career fair, recruiters get flocked hundreds of students who don't know shit about the company or industry. All you need to do is research the company and figure out what makes it better than it's competitors. Then when you talk to a recruiter at the fair, be sure to slip it into the conversation. Recruiters are looking for people who fit the companies culture. Make sure you structure your elevator pitch in a way that aligns with it perfectly. If you do these things, I guarantee you will get an interview assuming you have the minimum GPA
