I think there are multiple mafia's involved. Clinton mafia, deep state mafia, and various fiefdoms within the kingdom. Trump is a wildcard. He sees his job as ripping out the old mafia and installing a new mafia, which is loyal to him. The only way to destroy the mafia, is with a mafia. There is always a mafia in control, but during a changeover, the people get glimpses of what is really going on. I believe that Trump knows he is insane. Clinton does not have this level of self awareness, and that actually makes her more dangerous. I am not FOR Trump; I am for a wildcard, and change, and the glimpse of what is going on behind the curtains.
