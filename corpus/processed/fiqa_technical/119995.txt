Edit: I'm going to restate my original point without calling attention to charity being considered squandering because I feel it takes away from what I was trying to say. I wanted to leave this here though, because I think the statistics that show wealth is squandered by the third generation include people who chose to give their fortune away. It's also worth noting that for future generations to maintain a fortune, there needs to be an unbroken chain of people who decided *not* to give it away.
