I have a fb account, I never use it. I wont delete it, because those bastards actually wont let you. So Ive intentionally become a dead customer to them. I actually campaign to my friends to communicate with me via any other method. I hate everything fb stands for as a company. Imo this company defines narcissitic scum, a stunt in our socities development selling out our privacy for the quick buck without even realizing the damage theyve done. I know they wont go away anytime soon, but their user base is dramatically loosing value to advertisers. Talks of less fb engagement is no secret in social media buzz. A lot of lame attempts to blame it on the new algorithim or newsfeed changes but when you read between the lines, you can tell more and more people are using it less and less. With an exception to the older gen, who quite honestly dont really understand fb anyway. Seems like any fade after it reaches mass adoption.
