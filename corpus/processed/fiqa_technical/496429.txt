Does anyone here have a source to find free PDFs of books related to finance, specifically corporate finance? I would like to truly learn about the subject but all the books I've found so far are too expensive for me to rent. Alternatively, any other quality sources (doesn't have to be books) about corporate finance for a beginner would be fine as well. Thanks in advance.
