CFA level 1 was much easier for me in school, because I was regularly studying finance and it was easier to balance time studying than when I first started working in banking. That being said. I didn't have parental duties. MBA seemed to be about socializing and networking as much as the class work. Group projects made scheduling more difficult where as CFA was more on my own time. I doubt a CFA will automatically qualify you for a specific job, where was MBA will likely require internships and give you a better network. It's tough to explicitly say one over the other.
