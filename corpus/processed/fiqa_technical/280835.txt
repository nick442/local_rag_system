In any case, for sure, the wages went up.. a lot.. and most likely wage increases are most of the 30% increase in costs. As for consumers paying more, maybe they will get better quality, maybe they will be able to afford it now with extra income and maybe they will not raise the prices as they already have huge margins, people have choices and the real estate prices is only based on relative price of neighboring houses, used or new.
