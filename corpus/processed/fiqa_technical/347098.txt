Tax is payable on one's income in India. All funds are not necessarily income as long as they can be proven not to be an income, for instance a interest free loan & return of its capital. Otherwise, yes the fund can be considered to be income. In your case, from a practical purpose, the 200-300 Rs. transfers per month, if you get audited by IT Dept., perhaps would be discretionary considered to be non-income by the auditing office. Again, from a practical perspective, if Indian IT dept. ever audits you, it perhaps will be for a much larger liability and 200-300 Rs. transfer per month may not matter much.
