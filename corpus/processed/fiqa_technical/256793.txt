A single corporation known for their mistreatment of employees and price/sale scamming taking over markets nationwide is bad for the majority of people. Sure they've provided consumers with a decent and innovative service, but I can't imagine an employer that treats the majority of their staff badly and lies to their customers will have much in the way of altruistic ideals.
