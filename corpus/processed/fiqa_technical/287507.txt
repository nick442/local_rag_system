>But reddit loves to use this stuff as an excuse for bitching and whining about how unfair it is that we have to actually pay back student loans/mortgages/cards/etc So do you think we should bring back debtors' prisons? The key to success with a US education is to take out the massive student loan and flee the US. Get your MD and go earn a living somewhere else where the long dick of the creditors can't reach you. Move to Dubai and practice medicine for a decade and laugh your ass off. Should a person who has racked up 120k in student loan debt be condemned to a lifetime of serfdom? I mean the whole system is broken, and you cannot force people to stay in the country and you cannot create a life of serfdom while paying that debt off. Creditors should have to take risk too. When government regulation moves in and says you cannot default, they've effectively made you a serf, reduced the risk to the lender. It's a lender's job to assess risk. Start by looking at what degree program someone is entering. Medicine? Okay here's a truckload of cash for you. Liberal Arts? Nothing. It's become a farse. Take out massive student loans where anyone can qualify, pursue a shit degree no one cares about, and be stuck paying it off for the rest of your life. The regulations are all wrong. You absolutely 100% should have the ability to free yourself from your debts through bankruptcy.
