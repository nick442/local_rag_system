That's absolutely what will happen. Computers are far safer behind the wheel than people. We're distractible. We drink. We talk on the phone. We speed. We get sleepy. We don't leave enough space between us and the car in front of us. We pull out into the intersection and get stuck there by traffic so the cross traffic can't move. The list goes on and on. Driverless cars are going to change the world. That's what I'm investing in.
