"Not sure what you mean by ""missing"". Credit card debt can be paid back in full when you get the bill, or you can ""take a loan"" and ""pay in installments"". If you do the latter, and pay back at least the minimum required amount on time, you are not ""missing"" your payment. Technically, you are taking a small, but expensive loan, and if you pay that loan back according to the terms and conditions that apply to your credit card, this is reported to the credit bureau and improves your credit. If you are really ""missing your payment"", paying late (more than a few days), less than minimum or nothing at all, this won't help to improve your credit. A ""first-time offender"" won't always be reported to the credit bureau, but if he is, it won't be a positive report."
