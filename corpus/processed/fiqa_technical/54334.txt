S&P 500 are a relatively small portion of the entire American economy. Any number of things could cause them to increase in value at a greater rate than total output. For example, distribution of total spending could shift from the public sector to the private sector if government tax receipts and outlays were decreased. It's also possible the economy is becoming more centralized towards tech and industrial giants, with an increasing market share in the hands of fewer, larger companies.
