Not just America, and I assume not ALL companies, but heaps in Australia are doing the same thing. I work for one that does, I mean all of the Visa workers in here are wonderful people so it's not a big deal to me. I can definitely relate to people being annoyed about this though, especially as many foreigners send a lot of their money overseas instead of spending it here.
