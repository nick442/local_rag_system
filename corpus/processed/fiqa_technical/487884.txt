Don't get all the hype about Tesla. They can't make a profit and they can't deliver their products on time and yet everyone has such high hopes for Musk and his vision. What am I missing? Edit: Thank you for the replies. This is leading to some great discussion. (Although have to agree with some comments below that getting downvoted for raising reasonable business questions in a biz sub is frustrating.) Adding a few things that still trouble me- Tesla burned through $1.2 billion in cash in the second quarter, almost double the $622 million it went through in the first quarter AND $2 billion spending is forecast for the second half of the year. Negative cash flow aside, a lot of the hype is focused on the Model 3. But how about cannibalization of Model S and X from Model 3? There seems to be a somewhat fanatical following of Tesla and Musk but I do wonder if other carmakers that are ramping up their electric vehicles and self-driving R&D and have their finances in order isn't a safer bet.
