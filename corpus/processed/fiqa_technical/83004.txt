If businesses cannot turn a profit while paying for a healthy minimum wage, they are bad for the economy and deserve to die. Wages are a business expense and must be allowed to react to the factors that naturally shift that expense. Subsidizing businesses by keeping wages low hurts the economy in the long run by reducing the ability people have to buy goods and services. Labor is not the only cost a business incurs, and increasing wages does not correlate to a 1:1 price increase.
