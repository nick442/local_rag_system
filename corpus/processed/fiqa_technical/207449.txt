"The biggest problem with this that others seem to have missed is that a corporation must have a profit motive. Meaning at some point after a ""startup phase"" your company needs to turn a profit to not be considered a hobby. Will your employer be paying your corporation for your salary? Is that the company's business endeavor? If you run profits through the company and treat it like a true business, this may be technically possible, but as others have mentioned probably will cost more than any benefits you'd receive. And at every step you'll be throwing tons of audit flags. Rich Dad Poor Dad advocates a light version of this. Essentially running a business like Real Estate through an LLC, and then using that LLC for ""business trips"" (vacation with some justifiable business motive) or capital purchases (laptop, etc..) and the like, such that you're paying with ""Pre-tax"" money instead of ""Post tax"", but again the business needs a revenue source."
