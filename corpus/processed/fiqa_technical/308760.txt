> Also, we're not talking about a car, albeit uber expensive, like Rolls Royce, we're talking about an airplane that costs hundreds of millions of dollars that needs to work within very small tolerances over thousands upon thousands of operating hours. Any school child can see the dangers in outsourcing too much of that. But Rolls Royce have the experience to build in those tolerances with their years of experience in building jet engines. This is the design experience that Boeing does not have in it's in-house capabilities. Because of the tolerances and knowledge these components need it is very hard for one company to have all the knowledge, resources, manufacturing ability and skill to produce all the parts. Even engineers as great as NASA delegate the design and build of components to other companies. For example, if they can outsource a lot of the spacecraft interior to other companies they can focus on what is important - getting that big and heavy tube of metal into space.
