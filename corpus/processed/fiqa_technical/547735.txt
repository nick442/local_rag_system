In general; Yes. Your personal property can be possessed. However the financial institution has to send notices, get a court order and then possess your property and auction it. They can also freeze your Bank Account, or any other assets you have. There is no restriction as you have given a blanket guarantee. Note depending on Jurisdictions your estate and or legal heirs can also be liable to this if you die during the course of loan. can my property be mortgaged as a guarantee to his loan? Depending on how this is worded in legal contract, you can mortgage your property ONLY as a guarantee to his loan. In such cases financial institution can only take your property, but cannot take any other assets such as Bank deposits etc.
