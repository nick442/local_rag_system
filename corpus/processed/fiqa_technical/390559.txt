Short answer is yes, all the firms are required to keep enough resources on hand to pay claims that may arise from even extreme events like the recent hurricanes. Insurance firms are rated based on their claims-paying ability and it is absolutely critical for them to maintain enough cushion to pay claims. If insureds lose confidence, they won't be able to write any more business, and they are done. In addition, to manage tail risks, primary insurers like Allstate will often purchase reinsurance. So, for example, Allstate might go to Swiss Re and buy a policy that kicks in once Allstate's liability exceeds $5bn for a given event.
