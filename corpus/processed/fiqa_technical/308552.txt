The key to a successful cold call is to figure out the one thing that keeps them worried at work. Once you identify that, create a 15 second pitch and lead with that. Also, make sure you do your research on the the company/person before the call and try to figure out how to quickly create rapport with them. I use social media to do find out as much as I can.
