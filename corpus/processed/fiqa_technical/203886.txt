What?? What a strange (and horribly wrong) thesis. Buybacks are economically the same as dividends. They are a way of distributing profits to investors. A company does this when it cannot find any good investment opportunities. It does not cause a lack of those opportunities. This guy has it completely backwards. After the buyback the previous stockholders now have cash to find opportunities that the firm wasn't itself either wasn't equipped to move on or didn't know about. That buyback distribution doesn't just get incinerated - it gets reinvested as per the previous owners desires. His example of how previously a firm had to invest since it had no way to return profits to investors is a perfect example of capital misallocation caused by taxation. This piece should be nominated for worst of the year. All intro econ students should read this and learn to dissect such claims.
