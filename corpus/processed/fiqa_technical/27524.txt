It is much more complicated than WW3 = Economic stimulus! If you check again, right after WW2 the U.S. fell back into a recession. The U.S. come out ahead for the reasons of Europe being in shambles, Roosevelt ensuring the US dollar would become world reserve currency. The world saw a massive gain in productivity because so much infrastructure *NEEDED* to be built new and rebuilt from destroyed old, factories had been geared up to produce maximum amount of goods from the way, and with a huge chunk of working age population lost left many positions open for work. Of course my two paragraph overview can't ever do justice to the ramifications to the world economy.
