Sounds like a poorly written piece at best.. The way you make money with a mortgage, if you're careful and/or lucky and/or patient, is to use that loan to make leveraged investments. If the return on the investments is higher than the interest on the loan, you win. Of course if the investments don't do well you can lose money on this deal.. but at current interest rates it isn't that hard to make a profit on this arrangement, especially if you can get the tax deductability helping you.
