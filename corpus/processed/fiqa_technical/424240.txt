Imagine you are at an enormous sporting stadium with 100,000 seats. Would you notice if there were 110,000 people in attendance, as opposed to 90,000? Even if you had no idea how many people or seats were there, you would notice if it were crowded or not. This same concept works for the availability of money vs. resources.
