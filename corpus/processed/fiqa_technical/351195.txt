This is inside the special economic zone. There are lots of wholly owned European/US companies that do the same (though no car maker as of yet). This means Tesla has to pay the same import tariff as if the car was build in the US. They also have to pay the US/EU import tariff if they ship it back to the US/EU from there. Super strange arrangement if you ask me. China can only win with these rules. Either the product is made in China and there is 25% tariff or the product is made in China and some Chinese company owns 50% of it.
