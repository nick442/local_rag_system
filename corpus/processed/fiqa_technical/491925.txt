I'm literally employed by a multinational company to find ways to pay less tax, so I know first hand how it works. Trumps job isn't to write the legislature, his job is to sell people on it. He starts out at 15% knowing full well that the left will want it higher and will have to negotiate with 15% as a starting point. Edit: tax reform is coming, regardless of how much the left is gonna make this about benefiting the rich and taking from the poor. Idk about you but personally I'd like to pay less tax and have more disposable income..but that's just me
