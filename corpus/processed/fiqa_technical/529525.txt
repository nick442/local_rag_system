"Looking back, we used MS because that was the only viable option and it's complete dogshit. I think it's this legacy that's turning people away from Microsoft devices. Their OS, Mp3 players, Phones, and tablets..people don't want them anymore. We dealt wit their confusing garbage technology for so long that as soon as someone else showed us a new ""way"", everyone was on-board. How many times did we wipe machines to make them faster? Field phone calls from relatives for help? Spend hours upon hours setting shit up for ourselves and others? That was all because of Microsoft design. My 65 year old parents do everything on their ipads. My dad just bought an iMac today. My 88 year old grandmother uses her ipad daily. They never ask me how to do anything, they figure it out on their own because it's well designed. So I think Microsoft's past is their downfall. We didn't like having to deal with all that crap for decades. People who lived through MS tech don't want it anymore and they don't trust their new stuff. We've already broken up with MS and moved on."
