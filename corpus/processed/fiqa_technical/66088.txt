Markets are definitely not efficient 100% of the time in thousands for ways. For example, why does implied volatility of options spike right before earnings when everyone already know the earnings date? Sentiment can also change in a blink of an eye based on analyst downgrades or a technical sell off. That said, most market inefficiencies are not salable. Its not possible to make a play off a illogical sell-off when your AUM can buy the company many times over.
