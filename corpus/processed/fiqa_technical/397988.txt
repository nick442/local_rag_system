> Yes, you reduce your tax bill if your profits go down due to a losing business. It's not debatable. That's utter stupid ignorant garbage. Why would anyone ever buy a failing business so that it loses money so they aren't taxed on the losses? Why the fuck would he just not buy the business? You lose the capital, only to get back a portion of the loss as tax credits. Why are you unable to understand the stupidity of what you're saying? How have you not wandered into traffic if you're this fucking stupid?
