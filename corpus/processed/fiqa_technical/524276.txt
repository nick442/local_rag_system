I'm not sure there will ever be some moment in my life where a person walks up and asks me to install a cybernetic arm and I have to debate the merits. They will develop alongside the culture like most innovations. Knowing how to use a PC is often a requirement in the First World, when I have to deal with people who dislike the internet or upgrading to new tech it's a huge pain in the ass. If you invented an enhancement that became that essential to productivity or life, like someone said above with coffee or medication, I imagine it would be a similar situation. The point being, this is already how it works.
