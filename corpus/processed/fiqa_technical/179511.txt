Not a whole lot of people. Google thinks that by acquiring Meebo and dozens of other companies in the social space, it is bound to eventually succeed in social. Like, maybe my melding meebo with google analytics with gchat they'll come up with something. This kind of thinking is very typical of internet companies. Instead of going strong in a single direction the company hedges its bets by going down 50 different strategy paths, because hey, coding is cheap. The problem arises when this attitude becomes ingrained in the company's culture and nobody is left to take bold steps in a single direction. Apple is different, it takes bold steps time and time again.
