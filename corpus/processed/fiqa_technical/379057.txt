"It's not well-defined, since the [term ""middle class""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class) has been used in *dramatically* different ways. However: >The modern sociological usage of the term ""middle class"", however, dates to the 1911 UK Registrar-General's report, in which the statistician T.H.C. Stevenson identified the middle class as that falling between the upper class and the working class. Included as belonging to the middle class are professionals, managers, and senior civil servants. The chief defining characteristic of membership in the middle class is possession of significant human capital. > >Within capitalism, middle class initially referred to the bourgeoisie and petite bourgeoisie. However, with the immiserisation and proletarianisation of much of the petit bourgeois world, and the growth of finance capitalism, middle class came to refer to the combination of labour aristocracy, professionals and white collar workers. > >The size of the middle class depends on how it is defined, whether by education, wealth, environment of upbringing, social network, manners or values, etc. These are all related, though far from deterministically dependent. The following factors are often ascribed in modern usage to a ""middle class"":[by whom?] > > Achievement of tertiary education. > > Holding professional qualifications, including academics, lawyers, chartered engineers, politicians and doctors regardless of their leisure or wealth. > >* Belief in bourgeois values, such as high rates of house ownership and jobs which are perceived to be ""secure"". > >* Lifestyle. In the United Kingdom, social status has historically been linked less directly to wealth than in the United States,[4] and has also been judged by pointers such as accent, manners, place of education, occupation and the class of a person's family, circle of friends and acquaintances.[5][6] > >* Cultural identification. Often in the United States, the middle class are the most eager participants in pop culture whereas the reverse is true in Britain.[7] The highest income professionals in the United States are IIRC neurosurgeons, which average ~$400k, so that's probably about as far as the middle class can extend. Then there's the [upper class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class): >The main distinguishing feature of upper class is its ability to derive enormous incomes from wealth through techniques such as investment and money management, rather than engaging in wage-labor or salaried employment.[4][5][6] Successful entrepreneurs, CEOs, politicians, investment bankers, some lawyers and top flight physicians, heirs to fortunes, successful venture capitalists, stockbrokers as well as most celebrities are considered members of this class by contemporary sociologists, such as James Henslin or Dennis Gilbert.[4] There may be prestige differences between different upper-class households. An A-list actor, for example, might not be accorded as much prestige as a former U.S. President,[5] yet all members of this class are so influential and wealthy as to be considered members of the upper class.[4] The [working class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_class): >As with many terms describing social class, working class is defined and used in many different ways. When used non-academically, it typically refers to a section of society dependent on physical labor, especially when compensated with an hourly wage. Its use in academic discourse is contentious, especially following the decline of manual labor in postindustrial societies. And the [underclass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underclass) or poor: >The underclass is located by a collection of identifying characteristics, such as high levels of joblessness, out-of-wedlock births, female-headed households, crime, violence, substance abuse, and high school dropout rates. The underclass harbors these traits to a greater degree than the general population, and other classes more specifically. Obviously, it's all a set of essentially arbitrary and artificial lines to draw; we don't have a true class system (as existed in the Middle Ages, where there were real legal distinctions between members of the clergy, the nobility, and the peasants, or as happened under India's caste system)."
