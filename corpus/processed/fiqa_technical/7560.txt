They offset pay a week. So this year GE employees get paid for 51 weeks. They still get paid for that week, when they stop working, but it just made that one quarter look good by reducing wages by one week. GE digital is mostly rebranding existing projects. They spent more on commercials than actual development. They won't hire/pay actual software people because they're too expensive. So try to have hardware manufacturing people develop software products. They are constantly gaming the vouchering. Like.. To am absolutely insane degree. All to make the numbers work out just so.
