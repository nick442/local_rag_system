A lot of Chinese are buying U.S. property for the sake of diversifying. A lot of Chinese still have a the grass is greener on the other side mentality when it comes to the U.S. They know very little about how many people on the U.S. are on food stamps. And a lot of people that have communist party wealth are afraid that there will be an uprising against them so they are preparing escape plans. edit: I think it's likely that the elite here in the U.S. also have escape plans.
