The paper is appealing to its readership to consider the profit and loss generated by Starbucks in UK operations as independent of other operations in other countries. Starbucks was profitable in the UK, but they offset these profits with investments in other overseas operations (not UK), to lower their tax rate in the UK. To the Guardian this seems unfair, even though UK law permits this. Seems like there is some case to be made for considering a change in the law.
