"Another interesting point by you. So what's your definition of the ""right move"" then? Just let the market correct? The reason I can't ascribe to that is because we've mucked with the market too much for it to be as self-managing as it could be. Price supports, protective regulation/taxation and things like that are creating artificial stability. We won't let anything big die, so nothing can grow into its place."
