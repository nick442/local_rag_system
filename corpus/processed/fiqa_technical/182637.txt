"It is like you are your own boss on the side.. Could seem reasonable, but.. Let me guess, this will NOT count as part of a regular 8 hour day, be applicable toward a 40 hour work week, qualify anyone for over time, and/or qualify workers on the borderline of qualifying for full time benefits as full time. Also, if packages come up missing it will count directly against the employee and/or be deducted from their normal wages BEFORE the employee receives them. Walmart will also find a way not be responsible for the administrative overhead required to use one's car in a work capacity. With employees feeling the social pressure to provide the service ""for the team"" while Walmart doesn't put the procedures in place to make sure that employees ALWAYS have the proper car insurance. What could go wrong?"
