"Does your new job include life insurance? Most ""professional"" positions *will*, making your old insurance a moot point. That said, even if the answer is ""no"", **and** you really, really need to maintain some level of term life (ie, newborn kid and unemployed spouse).. You would **still** want to shop around rather than just automatically converting your former employer's plan. ""Group"" is a nice-sounding way of saying ""the young and healthy subsidize the premiums of the old and sick""; if you're not old and/or chronically unhealthy.. You can probably do better on your own."
