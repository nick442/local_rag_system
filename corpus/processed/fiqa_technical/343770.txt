"I recently switched from a very ""creature-comfort"" heavy office to working as a consultant with virtually zero comforts (free coffee and a desk). My new role is much more rewarding because I love the work and freedom. When I look back I wonder; were the creature comforts really important or were they just helping to mask the dismay and borishness of the office and work type? I pay for all of my own supplies, beverages, food, etc now. But I also dictate exactly what I will do each day, everyday. That I wouldn't trade for the world."
