Paying yourself first involves getting some part of your income somewhat out of reach, with the intent that you don't spend it during the month. It could be a retirement account, a savings account, or something similar. It's in contrast to saving whatever is left over at the end of the month: paying yourself last. The intent is to renormalize spending levels down, effectively living on a smaller income and saving or investing the difference. The lower spending levels will become normal, and it won't feel quite as much like a belt-tightening exercise.
