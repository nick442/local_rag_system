REally, don't let this ruin your traveling to the usa. I fucking hate the tsa thugs, but one thing about them is that you can actually refuse to go through the porn scanner, and then they will do the pat down, but the pat down is really nothing; Try that shit in London and you'll probably be banned from boarding the plane. Also, it helps to strike up a conversation with the TSA thug who is doing the pat down. I've been chosen a few times and I start the ordeal with, 'having a rough day'? And really, it hasn't been bad at all. Yes, pain in the ass, but you shouldn't let that stop from visiting the USA.
