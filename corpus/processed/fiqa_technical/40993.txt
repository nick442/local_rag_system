Wow, crappy article. To answer the question: extremely cheap areas in proximity to urban wealth are the best places to speculate in terms of large-scale real-estate developments. A golf-course developer ideally wants a huge amount of cheap land in close proximity to some combination of wealthy retirees, business-executives, or vacationers. Traditionally that means farmland or undeveloped land on the fringes of urban areas. But there's not a lot of that left in America. Blighted and depressed suburbs or neighborhoods with lots of abandoned housing are the new under-utilized farmland. This is how gentrification happens. Some factory-town goes under, gets poor, goes to the dogs, and eventually the big old mill-building becomes cheap enough for a movie-studio, nightclub-impresario, shopping-mall developer, art-gallery, or whatever to take an interest. A lot of them fail, but the ones that succeed drive up the surrounding property-values a little bit. Shuttered storefronts get rented to restaurants and retailers catering to the moneyed visitors. Richer people move into the nearby homes and drive up property values. Savvy real-estate developers work on a multi-year time horizon. They are not paying cash, they are borrowing, and they are counting on the totality of circumstances to repay the debt not just with greens-fees but with real-estate appreciation. You or I could not simply buy one house in a poor neighborhood and hope to reinvigorate it, no matter how nicely we kept our lawn. But someone bringing in $500mm in financing is *counting* on transforming the area, not on getting poor people to pay the greens fees. They're not selling golf to poor people, they're selling cheap land to golfers. It might fail spectacularly, but if it works, the plan will bring jobs, capital, development, and appeal to a blighted, jobless, decaying neighborhood.
