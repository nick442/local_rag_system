I helped my friend who has a Lenovo and he wanted to completely reset the system back to factory settings. I couldn't believe the amount (or rather lack of) bloatware from the factory. I mean sure, it had a few things but I have an HP computer and after the Lenovo factory reset, it probably had 1/5th the amount of bloatware on it than my HP. If Lenovo improves on the quality of their computer parts in the near future, it might be my next laptop purchase.
