People have been saying that since it's launch. I believe facebook will be around for awhile. They have too much valuable data and are continuing to expand the platform. For example, they are trying to include AI into Facebook's messenger. As much as ppl hate Facebook, they are here to stay. And to answer ur question, I would think most of their money comes from ads and what not. That's why google hates them haha
