That's the weird thing about job interviews, same as when I'm sure Ballmer interviewed for this teaching position - nobody cares how you actually did at your job, they just care you have experience doing it. Edit: I'm sure the interviewers' eyes lit up when the former CEO of Microsoft wanted a teaching job at their school. Never mind the company's been stagnant the entire time he was running the show, but the former CEO of Microsoft, wow! /s
