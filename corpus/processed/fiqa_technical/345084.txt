"Well, ""faux healthy"" anyway. That burrito ain't doing you no favors.. 1,200.0 calories, [source](http://www.sparkpeople.com/calories-in.asp?food=chipotle+burrito) Truth be told, I will select Chipotle for lunch sometimes, but I never order a burrito. I order vegetarian tacos on corn tortillas with black beans and guacamole. I don't put cheese or cream on it, just any vegetable on the steam table that looks appetizing that day. And I am not a vegetarian.. TRUE STORY: The last time I did this the two girls filing the order looked absolutely stunned. *NO MEAT?* they asked incredulously. I said yes, generally that's the idea of vegetarian tacos. They still looked stunned. I then inquired: *Am I the first person to ask for black bean tacos with no meat?* They replied in the affirmative, saying they ate black bean tacos at home (they were both immigrants), but *nobody* orders *just* black beans on their tacos.."
