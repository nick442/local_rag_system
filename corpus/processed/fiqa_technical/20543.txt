Ok thanks for this. I am curious, how would they know its facebook that is directing these increased sales. If it's TV or radio, you can tell by increased revenues from increased spots. But for a facebook ad or a google ad, unless this is the only form of marketing, how are you sure (unless again you can ask, did you hear from us by google or fb) its from one of these websites. My thinking was for a physical product when i made this comment.
