I used to go as a child and I WANT to go back but in good conscience, I can't. :( I WANT to enjoy the shows where wounded or rescued animals that can't be returned to the wild can be shown or emotionally stimulated. But -- I can't while they have the whales there. :( **I miss you Sea World but I will not go as long as they are there**
