See that's just it, the value of AIM is purely in the user base. Unless you could purchase the user base, there are already stronger competitors. And AIM clearly believes that its not even worth the sale. What I mean is, suppose they believe they could raise 5 million by selling the user base (say $5 per active user). They must be estimating their costs of transitioning it to a new owner to be higher than that. The main issues are privacy and security. Read the other comments in this thread, you're talking about oil companies and banks using it, they need a very high assurance level that a startup probably won't be able to provide. Only an experienced tech company with strong financial backing would be able to make a move here, and I highly doubt they made the decision to shut it down without examining these avenues already.
