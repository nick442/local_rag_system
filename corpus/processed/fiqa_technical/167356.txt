I think the logic in your example demonstrates it is silly to make a decision for tax benefits alone. Saving 75 is much preferred to a cash outflow of 100 less tax savings of 25. To answer your question, paying mortgage interest represents the fee for the cheapest money most people will ever access, which in itself is a benefit (e.g. renting vs buying). The benefits are maximized when the aggregate of appreciation, inflation, tax savings exceeds total interest expense.
