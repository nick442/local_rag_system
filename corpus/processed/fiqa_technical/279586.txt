"A thorough ignorance of history, and economic principles, and substituted in its place an indoctrination into socialistic dogma. Ignorance of the fact that in America the poverty levels were steadily decreasing .. until the ""welfare"" system was created. Ignorance of the fact that similar systems (previously called ""poor laws"") had been tried, and roundly failed in the past, etc. But left-wing drones don't really comprehend reality, and much like computers, the GIGO principle applies."
