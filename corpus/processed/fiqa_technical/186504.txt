Not having a job does not automatically disqualify you. If you had capital or savings or easily liquidatable assets and previous good credit history then you would qualify. This is a catch 22 for most people that are ever applying for unsecured lines of credit, and an oximoron when seeking UNSECURED credit, but this is how it is regardless. Hope that helps!
