There are rules but they have made the rules so almost any spending increases the GDP because the government can claim they are helping the economy. Deficit spending doesn't make us richer, it makes our children poorer. The idea that deficit spending is a harmless way to pay for this UBI is wrong. The numbers don't add up. The cost is more than we can afford unless we just charge it to future generations. Some people just look at this truth and say I'm not going to live forever and putting this debt on future generations is okay with me. I say fuck you piece of shit. Your life is waste and nobody is going to be better off because you existed.
