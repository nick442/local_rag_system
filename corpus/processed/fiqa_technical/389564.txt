That's your mind resisting. You have this fallacy you have been believing for so long, you're conflicted. You know what I'm saying is logical, but the left has been filling your head with lies for so long, you believe them. I'm interested to see which side wins. If you're smart, you'll start to understand what I am saying. If you are a dumbass, you'll continue kidding yourself with the Left's lies. Let's see how strong your mind is, brother. Also, there's no shame in being wrong. Everyone's wrong, about big stuff, all the time. The genius can admit when he's wrong so he grows. You can do it. Shed that Left wing bullshit propaganda they drenched you with.
