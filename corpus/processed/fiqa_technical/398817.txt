Full disclosure: I work for Amazon. All we do is lower prices because it benefits the customer and builds trust. I'm not in the kindle or books teams but I know that they have been held back by the publishers from setting prices as they see fit. I'm pretty sure Amazon is doing whatever it can to bring this price fixing to the light of day so that they can have the freedom to price as they see fit. This is why when you try to buy a book it will tell you if the price is locked by the publisher on the amazon site. oh and I should probably drop a source :) http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/dec/06/ebooks-price-fixing-apple-inquiry
