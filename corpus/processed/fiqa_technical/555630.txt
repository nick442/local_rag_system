"There is no risk-free way to turn $500 into ""much more"" in less than 2 years. If there were, everyone would be doing it all the time. Your best bet is to work for additional pay. In the meantime, you can invest the money in tools for your work, in education, or in savings that pay a bit of interest -- but you won't earn much interest in such a short time. You could potentially earn much more, or nothing, or lose a lot, by investing it in the stock market instead."
