If I can play the Devil's avocado, though, these foreign-owned entities will still be subject to the laws of the country they operate in. I mean, if they're State-owned, there's little accountability because the government is largely shielded from being called out if they screw up, whereas a privately owned enterprise is accountable if they make mistakes.
