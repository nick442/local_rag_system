> Only one path exists by which the citizens of the low-wage country can enter the affluent one, and that path is fraught with obstacles. Not totally true. You can get into the technology field without an education. You still need to be something of a genius, but you don't necessarily need to go to college. There is plenty of freelance programming and web development work available for anyone capable of doing the work. And when you are dealing with clients over the Internet, there is virtually no requirement other than getting the job done. > The effects of technological change and globalization could be altered by political actions I doubt it. Artificial intelligence is coming whether you like it or not. Also, smartphones have altered people's behavior and nothing can be done about it. The cops don't like to be filmed but they are powerless to stop it when everyone carries a smartphone with a built-in camera. The social rewards for filming anything that is going down ensures that all incidents will be recorded.
