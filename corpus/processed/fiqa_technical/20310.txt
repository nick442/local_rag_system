There is nothing wrong with private greed. Even if your sole purpose is to make money, you still have to provide the means of services or products that the public wants to buy. You are still providing people with things they want/need. And if you're a corrupt business, capitalism wouldn't allow you to fare well, or at least for long. You couldn't not continue to provide society with goods and services in pure capitalism if your aim is simply to be a profiteer. The problem is corporatism. When you merge private and government greed, you get problems. This quote from Keynes is just plain ignorant on his part.
