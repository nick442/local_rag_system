"There are a couple of reasons to diversify your assets. First, since we cannot predict which of our investments will perform best, we want to ""cast our net"" broadly enough to have something invested in what's going to be performing well. Second, diversification isn't intended to provide the highest returns, but rather it is used to soften the effects of market volatility. By softening the downsides and lowering the overall volatility among our assets, returns are more consistent. If a model does not address future downside risk it is only telling you part of the story. (Past performance does not guarantee.. you get the picture)"
