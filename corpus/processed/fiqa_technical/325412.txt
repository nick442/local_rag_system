In general, just make sure you are on the same page as them. For example, are they supplying the antlers at cost? If their product manager asks for too large a cut of the profits of the product line, they may decide it makes sense to sell the antler to the side business at a higher markup. Or they may find someone else willing to take the product manager job for a lower ownership stake. Either way, good luck and be sure to get your agreement down on paper somewhere.
