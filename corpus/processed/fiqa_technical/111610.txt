Before the iPhone, Nokia was worth around 250 BILLION $. That's nearly the same ballpark as Apples current valuation. And it evaporated to less than 8 billion and then to nothing in a few short years. The level of incompetence required at every step of the way to destroy that much capital is quite simply staggering. So many incompetent idiots, stumbling around with no clue what they were doing. Ballmer and Elop get most of the flack, but I'd say the old guard of leaders at Nokia deserve the brunt of the blame.
