If a person owes someone money, he can be sued for it, and forced to pay via court order. It is completely irrelevant who that person owes money to (here: a not specified 'estate'), and irrelevant what source they get money from (here: life insurance payout). What makes you think there is any special combination that allows the owing person to not pay their debt? If it would exist, everybody would use it to get out of his debt.
