> You can't be both down on patents and vigorously defending your own dubious patent. I disagree. You could argue that Bezos is lying about wanting to change the patent system, but I see no contradiction with his statement. Besides, if Amazon stopped enforcing their patents, the system would be unaffected. Their goal here is to change the system.
