> Also, in the past, a person with lower socioeconomic background, if they finish high school or got a BA, it would (for sure) really change their lives and they become middle or high class. Because the cost was still going to keep most people out of university. Finishing high school was never as hard as you suggest and didn't guarantee you any sort of job: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900934/ Overall high school graduation rates in 1968 were 5% lower than they were in 2004. Seems like what you're arguing for doesn't support that education is bad, there is just more competition among workers with higher levels of education than ever, so degrees are less valued than the used to be when far fewer people had access.
