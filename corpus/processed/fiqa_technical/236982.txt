"If I open up fraudulent bank accounts, I go to jail. I guess if I work for a bank and do it - because my boss tells me I need to to make quota - who goes to jail? Laws were clearly broken, why no prosecutions and just civil fines? Also, the whole ""businesses can regulate themselves"" is clearly BS for big banks because it took an independent investigation to get to the *real* truth. Even when called out a year ago, Wells Fargo couldn't give the truth. If there's a bank that deserves to be broken up because they're just plain shitty overall, it's Wells."
