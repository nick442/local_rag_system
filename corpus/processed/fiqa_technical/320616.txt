"It'll be just like any other loan you make, on your end, and receive, on your LLC's end. You pay taxes on the interest received, and your LLC can deduct the interest paid. Do make sure you set it up properly, however: If you want to loan money to your business, you should have your attorney draw up paperwork to define the terms of the loan, including repayment and consequences for non-repayment of the loan. It should be clear that the loan is a binding obligation on the part of the company. As a recent Tax Court case notes, the absence of such paperwork negates the loan. For tax purposes, the loan is an ""arms length"" transaction, being treated like any other debt. From: http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/financingyourstartup/f/investinbusiness.htm"
