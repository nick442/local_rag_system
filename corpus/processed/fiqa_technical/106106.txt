"You keep saying you want to do big things, you want to have an adventure, you want to be the mayor. I think you are misguided if you think becoming an actuary is even close to the correct path. I can tell you that this line of work does not itself lead to any of your goals (except making money). Nothing *prevents* an actuary from becoming a mayor, being respected in the community, or being known as ""doing something big"" but the JOB/line of work will not get you there. All of those goals would have to be accomplished outside of normal work. Also keep in mind the studying and examinations will limit your time outside work to do those things. Based on the description of what you want in life I think actuary work is about the worst idea unless you want to put off your ""real"" goals until you are in your 40's or 50's. TL;DR - Actuary work is not ""glorious"" in everyone's eyes. You will not be as respected (outside of work) as you think. Maybe reconsider."
