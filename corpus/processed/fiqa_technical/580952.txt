This is also true. Part of the strategy was to no longer battle for better prices than ups with large retailers. UPS and FedEx end up undercutting each other so much that they lose money on large accounts. UPS is so much bigger that they can manage that better. FedEx is much smaller so it doesn't make sense to battle on price. Also see my comment below about shifting IT costs. They moved it to FedEx services. Bill the other fedex companies for IT services and then operate FedEx services at loss. There is a lot of money moving around in big corporations like this to avoid taxes.
