Yeah that's a little different though if you're enrolled in a law school. Presumably you would have had to make living arrangements ahead of time and then committed to them, and then once you decide to take the bar it would have extended that (though I suppose a fair question is why you chose NY for the bar if you had no plans to stay?) Also what the hell is CLT?
