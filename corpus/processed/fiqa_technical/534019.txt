You can illustrate why expense ratio fees are in the numerator with an extreme example: Let's say you have $100 in a mutual fund, their expense ratio is 50%, your nominal return is 900% and inflation is 900%. Thus, without the expense, your investment would give you $100 in present value (because your return and inflation are identical), and $1000 in future value. So with the expense ratio of 50% and no change in present value, you can reason that you would expect the expense ratio will eat half the present value. If you apply your equation and include expenses in the numerator, you end up with: ((100 - 100(.50))*(1+9))/(1+9) = $50 present value as you would expect If you apply the manager's assumption that fees are applied external to inflation, then you end up with: (100 * (1 + 9))/(1+9) - (100 * (1+9) * .50) = $-400 present value. With this example you can see applying the fees externally acts as though they are charging you the fees on future returns today. *Edit: It's probably not worth fighting with someone senior to you over, as inflation rates are noisy estimates to begin with and the difference between these is typically not material to the decision being made; but pissing off someone senior by showing them their math is off will probably have a material impact on you.
