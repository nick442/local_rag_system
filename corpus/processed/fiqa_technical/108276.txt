You would be surprised at how little coordination there is in some large companies. I remember when the Walmart store that I used to work at sent a company in to install these new electric hand dryers in the restrooms. Then, two weeks later, they started a complete remodel on the restrooms, ripping out the hand dryers that had just been installed. Clearly, someone knew that hand dryers were going to be installed, and someone knew that the restrooms were going to be renovated. But I imagine that the two parties never spoke to each other.
