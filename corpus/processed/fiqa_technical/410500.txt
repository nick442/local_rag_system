The made a lot of bad decisions: - Putting the cash registers in the middle of the store. - Cutting the number of employees in each clothing departments. (I know someone who was alone, on a Saturday for all women's clothing). - Firing the experience employees working on a % base in certain departments (like the tools) for minimum wage unexperienced ones. - Keeping the same buyers who were clearly still stuck in the 80's. Even my Dad would have done a better job. - Waiting too long to renovated their stores.
