By that logic, saying all weed smokers would disagree, is almost like saying all non weed smokers are closed minded. I suppose that is your freedom, but you come across as really ignorant, emotional and irrational in your communication. After we talked for a bit, I feel your not as crazy as your impulsive comments are, but your perspective could be expanded upon. I personally feel the risks of people choosing to be ignorant is far more dangerous to our society, and our freedom than people smoking weed. Ultimately which freedom will you choose? Sure lazy people use weed as their excuse, so what about successful people who use weed whats their excuse for success? Same thing it is for everyone, valuable idea combined with effort to make it happen. I get the sense you really dont like weed, which is your freedom of choice, but comparing it to all other drugs is flat out ignorance. Ive lost handful of family members to opiates and alcohol, so I personally know how harmful some substances can be. I found it interesting being able to talk about this topic, so thanks for opening up. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
