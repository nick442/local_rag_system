My ex job doesn't require 'skill' just because it requires a degree doesn't mean it takes 'skills'. She removed guts from bugs and puts them in tubes. She cuts leaves up and puts them in tubes. She's not doing brain surgery. And I'm not taking anything from her or her work because she works hard. But to argue cleaning kids vomit and shit off the bathroom floor takes less skill and should be paid less because he didn't have to spend 4 years taking math and reading more Shakespeare? Yeah no. Pretty sure a janitors job is more exhausting.
