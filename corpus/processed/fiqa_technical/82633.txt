But it does create wealth, as shown by the GDP graph. It gives money to people whom otherwise wouldn't have it. They then spend it and create the demand for the things they buy. Demand demand demand. DE-Mand. Wealth. It's what's going wrong now. Rich people have more money than they've had since 1929; same for corporations. If they (the rich and corporations) created wealth with their spare change we'd be doing swimmingly. But they don't and we're not. Empirically, scientifically speaking We need to give money to those that don't have it to kickstart demand. Then the economy will come roaring back. If you have evidence otherwise, I'd like to see it.
