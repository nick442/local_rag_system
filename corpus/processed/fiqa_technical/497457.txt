In the Canadian system there is still health insurance plans. They cover things like optometrists and dentists which are not covered by the government. The real problem with drug prices in the US is that the government gives the drug companies a monopoly ( through patents ) and prohibits negotiating prices. The financial incentives make doctors and insurance companies favour more expensive drugs (for bigger kickbacks)
