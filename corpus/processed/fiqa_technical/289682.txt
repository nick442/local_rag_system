> As an employer, why would I not want to hire someone who is philosophically similar to me? Because you've got that covered. You already think like you, you don't need everybody else to think like you *too,* any more than you need a whole company full of people with skills you already have. Sure, having *some* people who think like you can help spread the workload of thinking like you around, but unless you have plenty of people around who *don't* think like you, the company will never think of the things *you'd* never think of. And, obviously, the more different ways your company can think, the better.
