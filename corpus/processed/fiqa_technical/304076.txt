> Giving people free shit turn them into vassals of the State. I think you know it is not really that simple. Does the police force teach civilians to ignore lawbreakers? Does public education cause people to only learn what is taught in schools? Do people not learn CPR because 911 exists? If people don't have the skills to manage their lives and hold down a job, wouldn't forcing them into a job guarantee failure? Would you agree they would need to first learn these skills and that probably wouldn't happen in an unstable environment?
