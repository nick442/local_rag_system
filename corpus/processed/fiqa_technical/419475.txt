First thing, ask your real estate agent who should have been involved in writing the contract, and can explain your options regarding the contingency. That being said.. The inspection report is the decision point. For every issue/problem mentioned you have decide: Ignore; have the seller fix; have the seller give you money to fix; have the seller drop the price; or walk away. Minor things you can have the seller fix. They need to be done, but they can be done by the seller. Expensive things that are difficult to estimate the price in advance should also be done by the seller. The difficultly estimating the cost to repair will make it risky for you to negotiate a price break. Getting a credit of $1,000 when it ends up costing you $20,000 is something you want to avoid. For items that you want to do the fix yourself you want money at closing to do them, or ask for a price break. Items in this category include replacing an appliance. You can take the money and get exactly the one you want, or let the seller of the house buy one that has the least options and won't match the color. Buyers also take this option when they were going to renovate soon anyway. Walking away. This happens when there is a large expensive issue that is hard to fix. Or a very large list of mid-size problems. Issues in this category can include foundation cracks, major electrical problems, extensive leaks, mold. It can also include beautifully constructed additions that aren't up to code and were done without permits and inspections. Which category is your Radon in? You need to ask your agent, and read the inspection report. The agent can explain your options, and how likely the seller will be to agree. They can also tell you how likely you are to not lose the deposit if you do walk away.
