Sell a product of $4 w/ COGS of $10, corner the market by driving out competition for a majority in market share, raise the price or squeeze supplier's margins by either lowering BOM or delaying terms from 30 to 360, then voila, big sustainable business. You must be delusional if you think Amazon did otherwise. They used the above strategy for both their retail and their AWS. Their Lab126 did the exact same thing. You clearly showed you don't understand either growth equity or competition.
