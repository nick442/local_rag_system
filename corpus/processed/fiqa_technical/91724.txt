I got $26,000/month for Group B. If they spend $26,000 that gives $390 in fees. It will take on average 1.5 months for them to pay the credit card company. With a monthly cost of funds of .04 divide that by 12 and multiply by 1.5, to get a .5% cost for every dollar of customer B spending on cost of funds. This leads to a $130 cost for a total profit of $260. I'm sorry for the lost job. Things like that happen to lots of people. As long as you're still alive, there's always going to be more opportunities. Most people only notice a tiny percentage of the opportunities that come their way, and even fewer take advantage of them.
