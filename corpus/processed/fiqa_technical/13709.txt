I go to a brewpub if I want a good steak. And I can get beer that was brewed in house. If I want good wings or burger I go to a real bar. If I want good ribs I go to a BBQ place. They are only roughly 15% more expensive than Applebees and Fridays anymore and the quality far exceeds the price difference.
