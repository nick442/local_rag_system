I hope Amazon does something to revolutionize school textbooks. I know it's a pipe dream, but it'd be pretty rad one day to have students using a kindle of sorts to study instead of those archaic textbooks. I think an interactive textbook style application makes for some pretty amazing possibilities, and it takes a lot of capital to really take control of the abominable situation in the school textbook situation.
