Agree that he needs to be doing some guerrilla marketing to get things moving. Get involved with a local realtor/builders association and start networking like crazy. Can he do small adverts in a local neighborhood magazine? Create a plan for the business. Nothing complicated.. Just get an idea of how many people he needs to talk to in a day or week to get a job and go hit that number. Pretty soon he'll be so busy that you'll need start worrying about bringing on somebody else to help him out. Keep going!
