I'd love to see the sources for this article's numbers. It sounds like a compelling case even though I don't much care for the writers tone. It's clear the aim isn't to convince anyone who is on the fence but rather reinforce the belief of those already firmly against Wal Mart's policies. I'm interested in the argument but not in the writing.
