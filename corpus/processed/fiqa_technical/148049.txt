"Sounds like a different ""right-sizing"" project. The one I mentioned was when they took CEs (now called SSRs = computer hardware techs) from the FE division (think it had another name by then) who used to work on AS400s, cash registers and other equipment and shuffled them off into a poorer paying job doing primarily cash registers (I think - it has been a lot years since I thought about that). It would have been in the late 1990s because I left in 2000 and it was a year or three before I left. One co-worker actually died in training - probably from the stress. His heart burst while he was away from home. Most of us went to his funeral so I guess they flew him back to Texas. They also announced they were taking away some of the AS400 guy's work and handing it to VARs so I asked in the announcement meeting if we could become VARs. Management was not too happy with my question. It didn't really affect me because I managed accounts with all four types of mainframe accounts (air-cooled, water-cooled, refrigerated and RISC) and only backed up the AS400 guys."
