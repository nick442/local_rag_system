In 1970, lots of people supported one senior on Social Security. Now, comparatively few people support that one senior. In the future, demographic projections say we're going to get to the point where there's more than one senior on Social Security per working taxpayer. This is expected to be a Problem, since it's a lot easier for a government to pay for one $5k Social Security check on five peoples' $3k tax payment than it is for them to pay for one $5k SS check on three peoples' $3k tax payment, and everyone's scratching their head wondering how they're going to pay for one $5k SS check on one person's $3k tax payment. (These numbers are of course made up, intended more as an illustration of the issue than an accurate summary of the numbers involved.)
