Thank God for this. I'm getting a cold sweat just reading some of these replies. Especially since you end up with about a million things to consider, frequently contradictory, until there's so little of yourself left it's a little pointless turning up and you can't think straight for analysing in advance and the interviewers sound like brutal robots willing cracks in your facade.
