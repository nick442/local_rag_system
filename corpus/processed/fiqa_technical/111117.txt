Sure, all the income gains have gone to the top, along with gains in wealth from capital appreciation. However, the Fed's expansion of money supply doesn't change that one way or the other. I suspect the root issue here is the erosion of wages by automation, which concentrates wealth and income among the elite. The Fed can't fight that alone, but Congress won't touch it as they depend on the same elite for campaign funding and TV exposure.
