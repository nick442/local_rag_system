Someone please explain to me why we cant simply expand and morph Medicare into a single payer type insurance plan (80/20 plan for everyone, $1000 deductible, $3000 out of pocket max, 100% preventative covered, etc.) that is funded from a VAT on all businesses? Employers already pay a lot of money to provide insurance to their employees. If the math worked out well, then we could aim to make it a near net zero change in the employers out of pocket expenses (i.e. employers would pay close to the same in VAT as they would in the current system). What's wrong with this idea?
