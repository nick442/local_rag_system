There seems to be a disconnect between brands and channels in which brands advertise. While I see and agree the point of the article, it treats all media channels as equal, where there are clear differences between them and as an extension the level of confidence given to a brand as a result. The author does focuses on the millennials as a target group that is less receptive to advertising, but neglects to take into account the sheer volume of advertising that is around us - compared to ten or even twenty years ago - the increase has been exponential. Today itâ€™s almost impossible to even go to even a family without having it sponsored by your local dentist, real estate agent and pizza chain. The fact that millennial are performing more due diligence is not just a reflection on the group as a whole, but speaks volumes of the sheer quantity of (many low quality) options of media and advertising we come across on a daily basis.
