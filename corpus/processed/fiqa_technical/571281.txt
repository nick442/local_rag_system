There will be none of the problems related to privatizing roads if roads simply don't get privatized. I mean, in principle, if someone owns certain highways leading to a certain place and these highways are the only available roads to reach that place, doesn't that mean that the owner can basically refuse passage to people who they simply don't want to pass for whatever reason? Privatizing public infrastructure is such a dangerous idea.
