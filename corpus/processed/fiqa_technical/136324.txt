"This is a joke article, right? Besides the fact the author apparently can't use a space bar to save his life, the article is basically saying ""Silly CEO, you expect all these creative free spirits to do actual 'work'?

If you want to hire a bunch of disloyal slackers who will jump ship the second someone else utters the word 'stock options', you're going to have to get over this whole 'work ethic' thing."""
