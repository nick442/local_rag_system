Workers don't always create value, though. If a capitalist that owns a company has a vision for something and they piece together a team of marketers and salesman, engineers, managers, and workers, then the value that's being created is based on the initiative of the capitalist. The producers and others involved in the creation of the item or service are a part of that, sure. But the idea that each one of them is going to be given a portion of the margins on that item outside of what their pay is based on is simply ludicrous when the only one risking their actual money is a capitalist.
