> an investor is more valuable to a company than an employee is. It IS possible to run a company without investors. Now try it without workers. > Furthermore, an investor takes on risk, something an employee does not do. When I purchase CAT stock, I may very well lose everything. I am the last in the long line of creditors. However, the employee does not stand to lose anything.. Incorrect. When you invest in CAT stock you stand to lose everything *that you invested*. If you invested more than you can afford, then that's your own stupidity. An employee risks their entire livelihood - including all income, healthcare, pensions, etc - on the hope that the company will succeed..and they have less choice about the employment (especially in these days of 'take whatever job you can get') and much less access to the financial statements and company facts that an investor would get.
