Their headquarters are just north of Sioux City, Iowa, across the river in South Dakota. They located there for tax reasons, same as Gateway Computers back in the 1990s. Much of the area's wealth is located just across the river in South Dakota and starves Sioux City of the taxes it needs to serve the overall population. It's one of the quirks of being in a three-state metro area (source: this is my hometown). I could tell you more about Beef Processing Inc (BPI) around here. They're one of the biggest sources of wealth in the area, the owners are heavily involved in the charitable scene here, too.
