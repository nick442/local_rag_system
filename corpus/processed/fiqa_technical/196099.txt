> No, the main difference is dividends don't take shares out of the marketplace to artificially inflate a quarters EPS. Because buyback decreases shares outstanding it also decreases the company's total future dividend payouts as well. You have no idea what you are talking about. Buybacks are almost exclusively *better* for shareholders than dividends because they can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate, whereas dividends are subject to a higher tax rate. The fact that corporate buybacks have increased so much lately at the expense of dividends is a sign of good management by insiders.
