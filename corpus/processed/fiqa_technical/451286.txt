"What would be the ""up front"" stuff? I make more than 40k, and have no debt. 0 debt. I don't own a house yet, so I pay rent and bills. No car loan, no school loans, etc. Don't run a balance on my credit card. Yet I still feel financially strained. I don't make 75k, although I do believe that would make me feel much *closer* to stable"
