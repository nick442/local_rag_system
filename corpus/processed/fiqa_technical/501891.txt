> Economics will generally be more respected if it is a Bachelors of Science. The BS will have (in general) more quantitative coursework as compared to a BA. What kind of nonsense is this? My school offered a BS/SB in Economics and the other major school in town offered a BA/AB. There's little difference between the two. The exception is going to be when schools offer both degrees. You could argue that a BS Economics at Penn is better than a BA Economics, but that's only because Wharton is seen as more competitive and prestigious. It has nothing to do with the intrinsic qualities of a BA compared to a BS.
