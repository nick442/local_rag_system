CD Laddering is a process of buying multiple CDs at longer terms to take advantage of better interest rates while still having liquidity. The benefit of a CD ladder is based on this assumption. Without higher rates for longer terms, I wouldn't ladder CDs. So, let's assume you have $10,000 to invest. And let's say you have a 12 month CD at 1% and a 24 month CD at 2% available to purchase. You could lock all of your money up for 2 years and buy the 24 month CD at 2%. This is a good rate of return, but locks up your money for longer than you might otherwise have planned. The laddering approach is to buy longer term CDs over a regular interval. In this case, we could buy a 2 year CD at 2% every 6 months. Your ladder would look like this: This gives you the 2 year rate (2%) but you are always less than 6 months until your next CD matures giving you some liquidity. When each CD matures, you then purchase another 2 year CD at the more beneficial rate. You'll always have something maturing every 6 months. Now, if you want to start with your money immediately, you can seed your ladder by buying partial terms like this: The two year time maturity time frame and the interest rates are all examples. You could have 12 CDs with one maturing every month, one maturing every quarter, etc. The benefits of CD Laddering are that a portion of your money is never far from maturity and that your interest rate is better than it otherwise would be. The risks of CD Laddering are the same as the risks of buying CDs. If you think CDs are a good investment, CD Laddering is a good way to invest at higher rates.
