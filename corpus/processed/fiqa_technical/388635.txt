1. It's a differentiator. Everyone who you're competing against for jobs are going to be the same Finance/Accounting/Econ/Management majors. Having the Philosophy in there will help you stand out a little and make you seem more well rounded. 2. No other field of study develops your critical reasoning and analysis skills as well as Philosophy. Particularly with the increases in automation in Finance that has made much of the more menial work obsolete, what is going to determine someone's success or failure is their ability to synthesize disparate pieces of information into a coherent narrative and communicate it effectively. Any idiot can learn how to read a balance sheet in a few months. Really honing your critical reasoning skills takes years and cannot be learned on your own nearly as easily as in a classroom setting.
