"I blame that ""no concealed carry"" sign on the outside of the building. We live in a crazy world, and I won't patronize a business that suppresses my right to self defense. I'm probably a small percentage of why BWW is failing, but it's notable that there are others like me who also refuse to voluntarily visit a GFZ. GFZ's don't work. So I don't go to them. I'm not missing anything I can't get elsewhere."
