"You have absolutely no concept of a business plan if you think 30-50 pages is going to be read. I have to agree with the guy you called an idiot, this whole thing is a pipe dream and your idea has either been done and failed or you haven't done the research to see that it's already a thing. Your friend has no concept of what a patent is and you have no idea how businesses are run if you're ""rough estimate"" is 2-3 *million dollars*. I have a feeling you have no concept of the value of a million dollars to begin with. Scrap this bullshit idea, go start a lemonade stand or something and get an idea of what business is before you go spouting off shit like this. You sound like a stupid kid."
