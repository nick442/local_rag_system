I worked at MB for 4 years, ending back in 2008. I loved that place, it was a great job for high school student to have, it shaped a lot of my character. I'd hate to see a store and company so beloved by the public to disappear but it seems that the Demoulas family can't get their shit straight. They'd rather watch it all burn down than admit defeat and allow their legacy company to thrive as it once was. And I fell for my former co workers, who are risking everything to stand for what the believe in, it's remediable to say the least. Honk if you see them, letting them know they are still supported is important even to the bitter end.
