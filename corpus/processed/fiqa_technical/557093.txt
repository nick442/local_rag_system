"At fault doesn't mean negligent.. If a driver were doing 150 on the wrong side of the street and gets in an accident, no insurer is paying that out. Likewise a credit agency not properly handling sensitive info and not giving proper disclosures of a breach won't lead to an insurance policy giving them a dime. I'd say google ""does insurance cover negligence,"" but you should probably Google the definition of negligence first. What your saying and the links you've provided clearly shows you don't even know what that word means."
