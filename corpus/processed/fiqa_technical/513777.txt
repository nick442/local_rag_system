The Truth is that the Orange Lorax never wanted to be president, he was just going to make a shit load of stupid promises he would never have to keep, and then he would make a lot of noise about how bad things were and how he would have done much better had he been elected. But as luck would have it, this incompetent buffoon got elected and has proceeded to destroy, step by step what has taken decades to build and daily pisses on the very values America is supposed to protect and cherish. I don't think that even the trail of parasites who saw a great opportunity to consolidate their hold on American society through their vassal, even imagined how bad he would be. I look forward to the vengeance with which he will tear through the Fed.
