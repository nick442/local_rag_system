"The type of savings account your are referring to is an ""Instant Access"" account which offers little or no interest in savings. To solve your problem I would suggest opening a higher interest Current Account, there are several on the market which offer equivalent rates of interest as an Instant Access account but still allow access via a debit card. Usually there are requirements for a regular salary transfer into the account or a minimum balance to qualify for interest. Banks that are well know for offering high interest Current Accounts include Nationwide, Santander, TSB and most of the build societies."
