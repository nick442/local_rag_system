Tesla can't be valued, and its earning this year are completely irrelevant. Will it ever sell 1M+ annual vehicles? Even if one day 10M annual electric vehicles will be made, there is no guarantee that Tesla will maintain a majority share. No guarantee that Tesla will acquire or prevent the patents that allows them the share. I can appreciate respect for Musk though. Betting for or against Tesla is like betting on the 2017 Kentucky Derby today based seeing a few promising newborn fawns.
