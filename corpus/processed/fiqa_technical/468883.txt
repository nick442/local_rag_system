I don't think this should be very surprising. If you make more than someone, over a long period of time the gap between your total income or wealth is going to increase. Say a person makes $100/day while another makes $50/day. Day 1: $100 v $50; Day 2: $200 v. $100; Day 3: $300 v. $50 and so on and so forth. Now, make those numbers $1500 v. $100 and you can see why the wealth difference is so wide. They may have to choose between lowering the person making more, or increase the pay of the person making less.
