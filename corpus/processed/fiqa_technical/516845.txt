This is easier than you think: 1) At the end of the year, AirBnb will send you a 1099 form. You will need to report the amount on this form as your rental income - they will report it to the IRS so it has to match. As a bonus, turning your condo into a rental property can become advantageous in that you can deduct repairs and improvements against any rental income. 2) As a host, you will have the option of charging a cleaning fee. Take a look at competitor listings to determine the average cleaning fee in your area. You do not have to clean before and after each guest, only before. 3) As a host, you also have the option of charging a security deposit to cover any damages. Don't get confused by AirBnb's host protection plan - this plan protects you against liability for damages incurred by your guests. Now take a look at competitor listings to determine your rental price. (You may want to lower your price initially to get positive reviews going). Deduct your cleaning fee plus any reasonable wear and tear not covered by the security deposit above. This is your rental income. If your rental income is a positive number - and as long as you charge a realistic cleaning fee/security deposit, it will be - you should rent it out. The worst that can happen is low occupancy i.e. you can't rent your place out as often as you expect. In which case you will be no worse off than you are today. Good luck!
