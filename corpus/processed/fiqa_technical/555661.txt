Could it conceivably be that these executives had standing orders to systematically sell a certain amount of shares each month or quarter? Could we also extrapolate that this was part of their normal compensation package? Optics are still very bad, but the amount of shares sold and the monetary gain were so small as to be negligible in the grand scheme of things. Worth a thought.
