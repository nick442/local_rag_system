There are several factors that can help you make a decision. How friendly are the laws to tenants as opposed to landlords? How easy will it be for you to collect rent? How much management is needed? Do you desire to own rental properties? What does your schedule look like? Based upon pure numbers I would keep this property. It looks like you can earn 3K per year, which you may have done some math wrong, on about a 15,000 per year investment. About 20%, very good. Even if you only collect half your profits due to maintenance or missed rent checks the numbers still look really good. If you don't need the extra funds, you can always pay more on the mortgage. The other thing to consider is the rest of your fiances. Can you cover a couple of months of missed rent? Do you have an emergency fund? Do you have other debts?
