"People are arguing the irrelevant net income/sales debate. It's a moot point. The papers are bringing to light 100% legal tax-avoidance schemes limiting tax liability. Ikea does it. Apple/Google does it. Everyone does it. 1. All Starbucks European sales are charged 6% of total sales in intellectual property royalties to a Swiss and Dutch subsidiary. Dutch sub is officially labeled as the HQ and has 73M euro revenue, but only has 97 employees and 500k euro profit. Moreover, those countries have only 2% corporate tax, and the EURO President is based in London. 2. Starbucks owns vertical supply chain subsidiaries that does the coffee buying, roasting, packaging and charges a premium called ""transfer prices"" to Euro Starbucks. Those subsidiaries are located in Switzerland (2% tax vs 24% tax in UK). 3. Starbucks UK is funded through debt as it takes out inter-company loans at 4%+Libor (McD pays at or below Libor).
