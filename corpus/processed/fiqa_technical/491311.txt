Well it has not been proven that any of that actually happened as far as i can find out. I do think they are pretty sketch, however yelp ranks high in a lot of searches and people tend to use it a lot. I look at yelp like paypal. I hate the company and wish other good alternatives where around, but everyone uses it so its best to use them. If he gets reviews from established yelp members they will stay.
