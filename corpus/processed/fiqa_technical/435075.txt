I do understand what a creditor and equity holder is. I'm just saying my teacher NEVER brought up ponzi schemes and tied it to anything related to our accounting. He didn't think it was worth his time to go into details how ponzi schemes break accounting principles. I also posted the question in finance as my finance courses dealt with financing money.. And banks..
