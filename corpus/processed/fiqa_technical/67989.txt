It's a lot of conjecture but definitely take a look at the Australian economy. Their minimum wage is over $12 an hour and prices have reached an equilibrium with that number as their starting point. Money is all relative, there aren't easy solutions for low skilled labor besides subsidizing their lifestyle. Too early to source stuff.
