> Air is an abundant resource with no scarcity thus a poor candidate for a for-profit venture. Scarcity can be artificially manufactured. Just pollute the atmosphere with a chemical that makes breathing difficult, and you can now charge for access to clean air. In a similar vein, health care can be socialized so that it too becomes an abundant resource. Many nations now have taken steps in a similar direction, with results that [speak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) [for](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_\(PPP\)_per_capita) [themselves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems). > The rest of your post really reads like you have committed to the zero-sum fallacy of economics That is certainly not what I was going for. I am merely pointing out that attempting to profit from a life critical resource like health care is likely to result in a global net loss. That stands in complete contrast of the idea that the economy is a zero-sum system, since in that case we should at least break even. While I understand that profits made from health care can be reinvested to drive the economy, I do not believe that is enough to make up for potential cost to the society. Essentially, my argument approaches the question from both an economical, as well as a ethical perspective. I believe that a high-tech society like ours has enough resources, production potential, and cash flow to be able to completely address all basic moral obligations to all members of the society on a on a non-profit basis without sacrificing too much economic productivity. The resulting boost in the health of the populace should then more than make up for the lost profits by increased productivity in other sectors. Granted, some established organizations may lose a cash cow that they have been milking for generations, but the volatility of the world does not guarantee any perpetual profit machine.
