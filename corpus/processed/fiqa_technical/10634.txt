"chapter 8 page 154: >""My point is that it's doubts and cynicism that keep most people poor and playing it safe..only a person's doubts keep them poor..'Cynics criticize and winners analyze' was one of [Rich Dad's] favorite mottos"" -from chapter 8 page 154 of Robert Kiyosaki's first print edition of *Rich Dad Poor Dad* The whole page is about abandoning cynicism and has nothing to do with that Glenn-Beck-style rant/editorial you've linked to."
