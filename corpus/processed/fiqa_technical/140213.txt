Well, reserve requirements concern, as the name suggests, the reserves, e.g. a position on the balance sheet. The price of equity only marginally impacts the balance sheet (via positions in their own stock), not nearly strong enough to be significant. The French banks mainly had trouble with liquidity (this year we witnessed another collapse of the interbank lending market just as in 2007. watch the Libor-O/N-spread.) and solvency through deterioration of the asset side of the balance sheet. Naturally your ability to raise additional equity is influenced by the historic return of your stock, but sharp price drops in fact can help you to raise equity, simply because your ratios improved (P/E, P/B, in fact any ratio that includes the price part) and the stock became cheaper.
