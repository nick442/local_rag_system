"I have no fundamental problem with unions; I just think they've overplayed their hand of late, and perhaps would find it valuable to work on better defining or improving the unique value of their workers if they intend to regain even a small sliver of thir previous influence. On to your point .. As I (poorly) tried to say, the PR hit from a strike is one ""cost"" that a company must evaluate in determining whether it makes sense to replace workers. In many cases, the cost of the PR hit is considered lower than the cost of appeasing the union members these days."
