"One big thing you have to worry about is tax penalties and accrued interest. You don't want $1000 to turn into $3000 because of interest. IRS does not play around when it comes to being owed money. CPA is a certified public accountant who should be savvy enough with your local/state laws to know how much taxes you owe. Usually, if your taxes are simple, they charge about $100-$500 to do your taxes (you'll have to look around). Also, I'd look around /r/personalfinance. If I were in your shoes, I'd take the money and invest in something relatively passive so that when you do graduate college, you'll have a good amount of money to start your ""adult"" life with."
