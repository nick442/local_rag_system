I do not think it is work ethic. I think the issue is people just do not have a choice but to do whatever their employer wants. If everyone was say rich then they could just tell their employer to F*** Off. Or if the USA had a strong economic safety net then people could tell their boss to F*** Off. But since the USA does not then the people are just wage slaves. I think the work ethic in other countries is more extreme than the USA but those nations people do tell their employer to get lost.
