Finance involves money. Financiers and bankers keep money flowing around the market. kinda like grease monkey's on a large crane. Economics studies the inputs and outputs of the system, (think resource, labor and capital, not money). Economists tend to produce work that is more relevant towards policy than a business plan. And now for something completely different. Marketing. It sells what comes out of the back end of the crane. They ask the economists what looks good and the financiers if the machine is functioning properly.
