"I like that guy's writing style! Yes, from a judge point of view I think they made a reasonable decision. They throw it back on the legislature to fill in the gaps if any are to ever be filled. The critics in /r/personalfinance are probably right that businesses will find new ways of organizing so as to avoid being scrutinized under that law. But that is the way that laws work. If I were writing the next law, I would consider a requirement that transfer of debt have transparency to the debtor so as to give the debtor information about how much was still outstanding and how much the new ""owner"" paid for it."
