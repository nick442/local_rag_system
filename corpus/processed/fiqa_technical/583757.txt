The state of California shouldn't be commended and given credit for removing shitty legislation that shouldn't have existed in the first place. Also, to repeat myself because it cannot be stated enough, the government does not create businesses. Hell, the state of California might be the most anti-business state in the union. In no other state is it as expensive or as difficult to run a compliant business due to the mountains of unnecessary bullshit California makes businesses navigate through.
