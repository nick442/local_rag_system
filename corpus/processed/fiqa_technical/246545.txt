"I guess it depends on what you think ""tough math"" is. A lot of finance folks have only a passing familiarity with algebra in day-to-day use. At the portfolio-building level, it depends on the style of management. Pretty much every PM will be somewhat familiar with statistics into the concepts of linear regression. The quants, however, start going into all sorts of things. Multiple regression models to start with, but ARCH/GARCH stuff, vector autoregression, et cetera on the econometrics side. Other folks bring in things like martingale theory and some other things I don't know about. Derivatives and arbitrage are where you'll probably find the most ""fun"" math. They use of binomial pricing models, various types of calculus, and whatever else they dream up these days. I don't work in this area, so I'm not as clued in here. If you'd like to do something a little bit more guided than self-learning, check out the curricula for MS programs in Financial Engineering; they'll give some leads, too."
