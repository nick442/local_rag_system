Ive had Sprint for as long as Ive had a cellphone and Ive never had any issues with reception or dropped calls. I get service in basements and cemented locker rooms where most others do not. I also get a nice military discount. I dont own any Apple products so not having the iPhone was never an issue for me. I've also always had great customer service with Sprint. Can't say anything about the other networks but I very much enjoy Sprint.
