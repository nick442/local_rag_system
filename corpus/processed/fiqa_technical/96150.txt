"TL;DR: It doesn't matter. At a point of sufficient credit score, your income is far more important, for loan approval, than your credit score. Apparently this was a big mistake because it caused my score to drop to 744 Not really, except for the questionability of opening a margin account. A credit score of 744 is sufficient for the best rates. Credit score algorithms are dynamic and advice that may have been good in years past may not be applicable today. Pay your bills and don't have unnecessary credit, that will lead to your best credit score. For me, despite not following conventional wisdom, I am ""enjoying"" the highest credit score of my life. I have closed accounts that are just unnecessary and have done some other things that the experts say I should not do to keep a high credit score. However, all that doesn't matter. I do not have a need for credit and will likely never have a need beyond my rebate card. I feel like this is also true for you. What difference does it make if you have an 822 or a 744? Probably none. At that point, your income counts more toward loan eligibility."
