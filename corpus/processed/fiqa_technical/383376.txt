So true. My bf works at the shipyard and can go through some damn steel toed shoes with all those stairs. He always has a pair of Timberlands and a pair of cheap shoes. Every 6 months his Timbs break, but they had (I'm not sure if they still do I heard they were thinking of stopping) a lifetime warranty. He would send his shoes back when they broke and use the cheap ones in the meantime. Then Timberland would send his new shoes back within 4 weeks and he could keep going. He's gotten at least 6 free boot replacements from them at the initial cost of about $100.
