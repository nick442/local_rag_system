Yes they do. There are billions and billions spent on subsidies for pharmaceutical companies. It's the lion's share of the annual expenditures in the health sector and up there. If you're not happy with cbo.gov, there are countless other sources just a google search away. If I can find them in under a minute you can, too. If you don't have a problem with it then contribute the share of your income you see fit voluntarily. But who entitled you to decide for others that they have to do the same? And I say it again: mandatory public healthcare is not a service we all would use, that's why it has to be mandatory in the first place. And what's wrong with libertarian notions? Well, you never have to raise any taxes if you find and cut expenses of equal value before introducing a costly system. You don't need a source for that, that's maths 101. But I'd prefer the US to cut subsidies to 0, replace them with nothing and finally lower taxes. Which will eventually leave a lot more people with enough money to easily get private insurance. Just without the administrative effort and without forcing people to partake. It all comes down to ideological positions. We can talk numbers once we've come to the conclusion that mandatory public healthcare is the right and just thing to do. And for that you would have to convince me that exploiting a minority against their will is the right thing to do. Good luck with that. You can try to seek refuge behind sources, but you can't refute the moral argument with those.
