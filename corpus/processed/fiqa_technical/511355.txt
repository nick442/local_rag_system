Airbnb always knew hotels would eventually fight back. Now they are. That’s why they are offering experiences. When that concept dries up and the people with listings realize guests want a better price they will adjust the price lower. This is short term. I don’t think airbnb have any thing to worry about. The users on Airbnb will win over hotels forcing hotels to close. The hotel market will be less saturated and hotels will eventually slowly but surely die out.
