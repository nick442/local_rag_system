What? You kidding? Manufacturing robots are really well designed and maintenance time is minimal. I have two robots at my company for mass production and in the 4 years of operation they've only needed repair once. In this case the biggest factor would still be a person required to actually clean the damn thing and to keep it loaded with food but an engineer? Nah. Maybe the regional fast food office has an engineer on hire but they would service the entire area and not a single store. Even then, they would probably be technicians and not engineers.
