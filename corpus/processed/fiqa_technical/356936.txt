May want to post in /r/landlord but stains on carpet are not normal wear and tear. When you say hanging things left holes in the wall do you mean small picture nails, larger holes from toggle bolts, or holes from mounting a tv bracket? Picture nail are normal wear and tear, the others are not. If they are repairing homes in the wall then there will also be painting charges. If the have stains on the carpet and it wasn't that old then the price isn't bad.
