Feel free to shoot me a message anytime. Also good point to note that social networks excel at brand awareness, not necessarily sales. They can have a direct return on investment and often do but the value lies in more and more people seeing you thanks to your growing community. Also, demographic info is huge. I use the PEW research all the time to see what network is right for which client based on how it lines up with their target market.
