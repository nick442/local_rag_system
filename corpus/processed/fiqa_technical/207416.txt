The obvious ones are retail sales and the service industry, you know McDonald's and Starbucks (sigh). You simply need people where the transaction takes place. I would like to say actual doctors (as opposed to X-ray technicians etc) but some diagnosis is being done over the net these days so even doctors will face some pressure though probably not too much. They say software project management will survive but I'm seeing that gradually move overseas - that or US project managers end up managing such a huge number of overseas projects at once that the job is crazy stressful. The only high-paying jobs I can think of that should be pretty safe from outsourcing are marketing and advertising. You need to know the local culture pretty well to do that job well. However, the pendulum's bound to swing back a fair bit. I've worked at several places that were pretty hard core with outsourcing. One of the biggest outsourcing cheerleaders said that it would stop being worth it when the wage ratio got to 5-to-1. When it hit 5-to-1, he changed to 4-to-1. When that was hit, they found a cheaper country. But eventually, the travel, inherent inefficiency and frequent quality issues will force jobs back onshore. It will likely be 5-10 years til we really see things turn around much. A lot of the delay won't be that it's still a bit cheaper overseas than at home but rather that US companies love holding outsourcing over the heads of their workers to keep wages lower and keep us working all that free overtime.
