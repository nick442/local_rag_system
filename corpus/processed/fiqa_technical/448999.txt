Not really. Transfer pricing determines where and at what level you should have profits and what level is considered arm's length. Profits are going to follow where the functions, risks and intangibles are borne under the current regulatory framework. Inverting allows a company to shift intangibles and risk to another country. You cannot just say I want 100% of my profits in Ireland and get away with it. You need to have economic support for why your profits are what they are in each of your jurisdictions.
