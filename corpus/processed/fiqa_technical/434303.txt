*Paternity* leave. The situation now allows managers to hire a man over a woman because he can't take off when he has a child. Requiring that he be offered the same or similar option reduces or eliminates that incentive for hiring a man instead of a woman. Another way of looking at it: most people think that the way to promote hiring women is to make them better potential employees, but another way to do it is to make men worse potential employees (by giving them the same time off).
