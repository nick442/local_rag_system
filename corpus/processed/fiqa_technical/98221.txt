"> In Germany most terror attacks are made by right-wing guys who want to save Germany from the muslim terrorists That's absolutely not true. You know that! Please tell me about the recent right-wing ""terror attack"" against **civilians** in Germany! Also, how many terror attacks were done by Muslims at the same time against **civilians**? (I am not pro far-right wing people, but they are not the level of Muslims.) **Hey! Did you just say hate speech about right-wing guys? Are they terrorists?** > So the problems comes fron people saying things like you did: Muslims are terrorists. Taking a group as a whole and given them an attribute. If you say americans are fat idiots you say all of them Repeating over and over that if someone says ""group X does such and such"" means that all members of the group do it will not work. You just said: ""*most terror attacks are made by right-wing guys*"" and also ""*americans are fat idiots*"" I say ""terrorist attacks are carried out by Muslims"" (I did not say ""Muslims are terrorists"") and the Swedish old lady said ""Muslims shit in the street and burn cars"". Only the ""*americans are fat idiots*"" implies that ALL Americans are fat and are also Idiots. Do you understand why? If not, I will explain further. **Do you think I think all Muslims are terrorists?** > heres a link to the sweden Problem No thanks! I don't needs stats from a Swedish source. Here are the stats from a [non-Swedish source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Sweden): Crime is up a lot. Why? One quote: ""**In januray 2017, the the Löfven Cabinet denied the request from member parliament Staffan Danielsson to update the BRÅ statistics on crime with respect to national or immigration background of the perpetrator, as had previously been done in 1995, 2005 but the 2015 was overdue.**"" > Your Right about the nazis though. Ignoring isn't helping. Sadly I have other fights to fight .. You have other more important fights? Like to fight ""haters"" of Muslims? Anyway, my question was: > **As you know, Nazis hate Jews despite Jews being one of the best and most contributing groups in society throughout history. Would you defend Jews being criticized by Nazis? If you do, do you realize what you just did?**"
