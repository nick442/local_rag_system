"First, are you sure that no interest accrues on the student loans until six months after you finish your studies? My understanding is that you have to start paying back the student loans six months after leaving the university, but that doesn't mean no interest accrues in the meantime. My concern about student loans is that life happens and when it happens in an unexpected way, the powers of the student loan companies exceed pretty much everybody else's with the possible exception of the IRS. If you are in a position to be able to pay cash for the tuition then I would cut back the ""lifestyle"", scrimp as much as I can and pay cash. You'll be in a much better position afterwards - for starters, you won't have a student loan payment which means you're in a much better position financially than most of your peers and have a lot more options open. Plus, you're not carrying around a mortgage before you even bought a house."
