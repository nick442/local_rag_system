"This is one correct answer. Googling ""cable card host"" and poking around is another. Neither Motorola, Cisco, nor Pace will sell directly to consumers. The problem here is the perceived lack of a ""real"" market. Each CableCard host to be deployed needs to be certified via [CableLabs](http://www.cablelabs.com/), and no feed provider will allow non-certified hosts, which makes sense. You'd think there would be a line running around the block for certification, but there's not. You'd think someone would put together a CableCard 2.0 (implying two-way communication, vod, etc) box with youtube, netflix, hulu, etc support, but there's not."
