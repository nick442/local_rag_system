TL,DR; Good point, but there are arguments why you should allow others in. _____ I think one an idea is steeped in the culture, it unreasinably depletes the commons not to be able to reference it, someone dressing up as mickey mouse at Disney world 100 years later not withstanding. Trademark law should differentiate the original artist's work from derivatives. Having said that, addition to the world that substantially and materially add to the cultural impact of the work should be protected for the term of 20 years or so. You should allow the creator the rights to Harry Potter merchandizing after the movie rather than the books. But overall the intellectual commons is under protected in law. In fact it's not even recognized, except where someone has owned something and given it to the commons. But in as much as you can't kill all the deer on the common because it depletes the resource, if the space of intellectual commons is reduced so much that there is no way to say something (or no way to write a program to do something), then that should not be legal either. And at some point in his interaction with our culture, Yoda is the best person to say some things. And to keep him from us depletes the commons.
