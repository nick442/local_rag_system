"GNUCash won't show 'Credit Card' type accounts in ""Process Payment"", as of v.2.6.1. A workaround is to create another account of type A/Payable. Then, transfer the operations you want to pay via ""Process Payment"" to this new account. It should be visible now. A drawback is that you have split your current Credit Card debt, which makes it harder to track. Alternatively you may wish to only use this new account for all your credit card related expenses. Another alternative is processing payments for these purchases manually to keep the 'credit card' accounts consistent."
