Right. We all get normal compensation, either salary or hourly depending on the nature of the job. The CEO salary is about 3.5 times that of the lowest paid worker. That is just salary and doesn't include benefits and the profit-sharing (which is completely even). If you included those things, it would be even flatter. There are no back-door golden parachutes or secret stock options.
