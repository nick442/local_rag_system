">Americans are much more supportive of negative rights. True freedom means freedom from government coercion. Thus, calls for healthcare as a ""right"" are rejected by huge numbers of Americans. ""Huge"" numbers maybe, but the [majority](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/13/more-americans-say-government-should-ensure-health-care-coverage/) of Americans see health care as a right. Americans actually believe in quite a few positive rights, such as the right to an attorney, the right to a K-12 education, and the right to things like Medicare and SS when you reach a certain age."
