It's been their strategy for years, I have colleagues who've worked in the packaging design departments for both Lidl and Aldi and it's blatantly obvious. When the briefs come in, designers are instructed to base the new design on a leading exisiting product's design, they have minimal time to design it and success is based on the careful balance of 'reminds consumer of brand, but is defensively differentiated.' So in other words make it close enough that it looks like and existing product but different enough that you could point out as many differences as there are similarities. It's considered a pretty shady practice in the industry.
