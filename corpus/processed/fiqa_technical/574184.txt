Im with you there, and it's not 50% of the population, not sure what magic number factory Zuckerboy pulled that statistic from. Support of Trump is intolerable as an American at this point. He is demonstrably not qualified or capable of doing the job of President in any capacity whatsoever. Most of us recognized that before he was elected. At this point, if you still support Trump, you have failed yourself and society around you and need to take responsibility for your foolish life choices. America has been diminished by the actions of Trump and his supporters. Im of the mind that no more ground must be given to these fools, fight their rhetoric however we must. Cheers.
