">We can also always use some English and history majors, but we should make sure we get just enough to satisfy the demand. Or at least those who attend and go for those degrees should not be doing so under any delusions (as they currently are) that the degrees will entitle/enable them to obtain a high-paying job. The same, BTW would be true of engineering degrees if/when the demand for engineers should go down. There are no guarantees in life -- and colleges are LYING to youth when they are (even circumferentially) promoting a ""degree"" as if it were."
