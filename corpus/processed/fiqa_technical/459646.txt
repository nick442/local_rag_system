> I think there is a valid argument to be made here, but you canâ€™t make it by choosing to redefine words.. Poverty is an extremely loosely defined word, and the way I'm using it (to refer to people without much money) is well within the established definition. The problem I'm talking about is hard to discuss, but it's vitally important. People dislike discussing it for many reasons but mostly because people like having hope, and this problem points to a bleak future with no ready solution. Pretending there is no issue is the surest way to perpetuate it though.
