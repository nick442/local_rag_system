Best advice I've ever gotten from anyone that has helped my career tremendously is this; no one cares. No one cares if you're tired, or hungry, or busy, or bored. Just get your job done. Mistakes are binary. Either you made one or you didn't. If you fuck up early, it'll hurt you immeasurably. Develop a reputation for being early, staying late and doing solid work. You'll be fine.
