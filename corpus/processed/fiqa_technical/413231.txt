>I take advantage of this distortion to offer to buy your gold for half its free market value. This is where I disagree. The price you get *actually is* the market value. If not, you clearly don't have the skills to be trading in gold, and should immediately get out of that business. But let's continue with your example, where starvation is the *only* alternative. The only thing preventing your death by starvation, is the *ability and willingness* of David Siegel to accept your offer. In your example, he has saved your life. Ah, but how did he come to be in a position to do so? It took him many years of his life, and he chose to forego many of life's pleasures along the way, to ultimately attain the ability to save *your* life. Suppose he had never done so. Perhaps you would have never ended up with gold, as it would be worthless to you. Or you still would have acquired the gold, and then just died. As far as the timeshare thing goes, if people are willing to accept a vacation in exchange for allowing someone to attempt to sell them something, I see nothing wrong with them doing so.
