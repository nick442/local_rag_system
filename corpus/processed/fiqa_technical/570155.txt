"Yes, so much for audit. We are audited yearly by one of big-4 and me being in IT Management was asked by the Auditors prove that ""the system will not allow to enter an order for a customer that does not exist."" ?!?!?! As for finance, I was once asked to setup credit card processing of a new type of orders. Done and tested! I then asked them to tell me when they start accepting the new orders, because I need to setup a job to send the charges to the bank. They did not inform me and accepted orders for $100,000s. Suddenly, after a year they discovered that we do not get paid by the bank. You would think that one of the basic jobs of accounting it to make sure Total Sales = Total Payments. We had write off $100,000s because I can only charge customers for orders in the last 30 days, before their credit card authorizations expires."
