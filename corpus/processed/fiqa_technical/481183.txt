> correction. walmart hires them because they have a low marginal utility undeserving of a higher wage. Good point Schrute. Except that we're talking about people, not animals. Guess what, making money hand over fist and being a tightwad about wages isn't sticking to some principle, it's just you being a greedy, avaricious asshole. There are plenty of success stories that don't involve squeezing everyone in your supply chain plus your American workers as hard as you can so as to maximize the profits of a very few at the top. Does everyone in the Wal-Mart family, everyone with the last name Walton, really need to be a multi-billionaire 20x over? Do their CEO's and other execs really deserve 1000x more pay than their workers? Why is it that Costco, Starbucks, Microsoft, Trader Joes, Ben and Jerry's, etc, can all take good care of their workers, or at least better care, and still be considered successful? There's this insane idea floating around Republican circles that the only way to really make it in business is to fuck everyone below you as hard and as fast as you can otherwise you aren't really as 'successful' as you could be. It's just an infantile view of socio-economics and it deserves to be shamed. Wal-Mart could very easily raise wages and offer healthcare and benefits and still be a very successful and powerful company. No one is saying they need to pay crazy wages or lose money offering insane benefits or what have you. Just that they should take a little bit better care of their workers, that's all. They choose to act from the notion that the floor workers are dirt to be exploited, rather than an asset that helps the company succeed. It's backwards, dickish thinking and it's finally becoming an issue for public debate, thank fuck.
