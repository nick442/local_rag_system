I worked in hr recruiting software for 6 years,(job applications web sites). While this all sounds heavy handed, our experience was that this was an individual problem not a corporate problem. In other words if you can show the hiring manager they are being racist, and educate them both on the their bias and on the tracking capabilities, people changed their hiring bias or they were fired for cause. Yes big companies wanted the data to prove they were not being racist, but even small companies benefited from having the data. If a company wants to be racist in their hiring I am ok with that company going away.
