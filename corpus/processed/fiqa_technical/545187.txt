The test is very detail-orientated. So be thorough in your studying. As others are saying, the math is very basically tested and it is more the theory/memorization portions of the test that are important. One tip I would give is don't study too much. This is a completion mark on your resume at best. I came away with a 96% on Exam 1 then realized what a waste of time that was. Got a 75% on Exam 2 with roughly half the studying I did for Exam 1. If you're nervous study more but honestly it's pretty straightforward
