"It should be made very clear, all funds from these fights were directly paid into ""Mayweather Promotions"" and from there Floyd pays himself. As a result any cheques he posts are entirely irrelevent since its a cheque from his company to himself, he can place whatever value he wants on there for the picture and subsequently void the cheques. This is nothing but an attempt to stay relevant once he has retired as the most hated boxer in boxing."
