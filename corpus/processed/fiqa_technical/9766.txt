A log scaler on income would help visualize the data a little better. The physician is just so out of line with the other wages that it makes every other job seem to pay roughly the same. Or a break in the scale to look at outliers. Or the data could be perfect and the zoom feature isn't working on mobile. TLDR: According to this chart I should be a physician.
