Did you even read the article? It's about salaries at the NY-NJ Port Authority whose commissioners are appointed by the NY and NJ state governments. Statewide elections actually have a huge bearing on these employment contracts. The mayor has no bearing on these employment contracts. It's sad that idiots like you can blatantly lie and other malleable morons upvote without doing any independent research. I guess that is to be expected in such a liberal forum.
