I recently engaged in a dispute with a ski resort that was proposing several hotels (about 500 rooms) along with a new lodge, which will host conventions. I have a home (3 bedrooms) I rent on Airbnb located next to the resort and was a statutory party to their permit hearing. After all was said and done, I managed to take away approximately 250 parking spots, forcing them to build a parking garage. They were permitted for the new lodge, which they are building now, but not for the hotels. I will now be able to raise my rates as there will be a severe lack of short term housing to accommodate the new lodge.
