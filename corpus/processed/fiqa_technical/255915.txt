How many people spend $120 or more a year seeing movies? There is a lot of opportunity to convert people into more regular movie goers. Theaters aren't necessarily losing, because many of these customers are only there because of the pass. Theaters with strong concession sales and beer offerings would do even better. There's a pretty strong case to be made that this subscription plan could compel people that might see half a dozen movies a year, to spend a bit more for the perceived value in seeing far more movies for only a marginally more expensive pass. Vail does the same thing with ski resort passes. A season pass is like the same price as buying 3-5 days. They do this because they know many of their profitable ski vacation customers only come out for one holiday weekend, and by offering the season pass at an intriguing price, they provoke a good chunk of people into taking longer or multiple ski trips that otherwise wouldn't. The locals that milk the season passes are a small price to pay for all the extra revenue they get from people coming an extra weekend or staying an extra night or two.
