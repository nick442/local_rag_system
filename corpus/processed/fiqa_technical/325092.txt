"Secret formulas are legal, ""privileged information"" is not. And that may be the whole point. People are allowed to trade stocks profitably if doing so results only from their skill. A ""secret formula"" (for evaluating information) is part of that skill. But having ""privileged information"" is not considered skill. It is considered an unfair, illegal advantage. Because company officials (and others) with privileged information are 1) not permitted to trade stocks while that information is privileged and 2) are not allowed to share that information with others. Inevitably, some do one or the other, which is why they are prosecuted. ""Raj"" took the process to new highs (or lows). He not only ""dealt"" in privileged information, he PAID for it. Anything from a new car or house to $500,000 a year in cash. In essence, he had a bunch of strategically placed ""spies"" inside or close to corporations including one on the board of Goldman Sachs, ""selling out"" their companies, and thereby practicing a form of corporate ""treason."""
