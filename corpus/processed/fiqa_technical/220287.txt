> Management consulting as a major? Job. > Would minoring in CS be good enough? or for maximum aptitude should I major in it? IDK. I would dual major TBH. Minor better than nothing. Everyone (including bankers) value engineers over straight finance degree people, because engineering is harder and those graduates typically have higher IQs. A 3.5 gpa electrical engineer major > 3.8 gpa finance major.
