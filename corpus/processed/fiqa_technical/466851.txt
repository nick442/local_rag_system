I stand by my original comment. The push for 10G switching (and 40, and 100..) does NOT come from Facebook. It comes from everywhere. Service providers, telcos, and just about everyone who operates a datacentre. It is the fastest growing segment of the L2-3 switching market (for reasons that should be clear to everyone). Opencompute is a nice enough project, but hardly unique, and it's not going to change the world - it's focussed very much on specific workloads that suit Facebook and similar companies, but it's not going to change the datacentre as we know it. I also think it's a big waste of resources on Facebook's part. There are many manufacturers that create similar hardware and/or will do so on your behalf, rather than distracting yourself with non-core competencies for tiny margins of efficiency.
