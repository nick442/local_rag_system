Absolutely nothing about it was stupid or for notoriety, it was simply a vote on the definition of celestial bodies in the galaxy being voted on by an international coalition of scientists (IAU). Either Pluto was going to be downgraded to a dwarf planet, or Xena was going to be the 10th planet in the solar system after it was discovered (since it's larger than pluto). I'm sure if that had happened you'd be claiming it was a stupid publicity stunt then too.
