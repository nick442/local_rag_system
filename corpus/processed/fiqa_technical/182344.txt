> ..he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! You do understand that I see President Trump's flip-flop on Medicare negotiating drug prices as evidence that he does not care about actually lowering the prices on drugs? If he did, part-D would be the obvious first stop. This tweet just reinforces my belief. President Trump is saying it is not his job to lower drug prices but Ken Frazier's.
