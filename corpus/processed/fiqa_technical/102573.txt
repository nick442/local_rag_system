My buddy was recruited hard by McKinsey, and I use him as a reference point whenever someone asks (because they want him so badly). Briefly, he's a physicist and we did grad school together in London (I in neuroscience). He later went on to Cambridge to do a course called Part III, which some consider the hardest math course in the world (http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/). Afterward, he went on to do a PhD in theoretical particle physics, but went to a recruiting session just on a whim. We talked about this at length. McKinsey likes people who have extremely strong analytical and math skills, but not necessarily from a finance background. They like this because you don't use most of what you learn in school with respect to economics or finance, but you do use lots of math, and you do use lots of logic. Basically, they're looking for people that really good investors look for: people who are academic rockstars. You do not need to transfer. You should not, actually, because you're going into junior year and have a good GPA. What you should do instead is try to do a Rhodes. Plan for it now. You can apply for a Marshall too. And a Fulbright. You want your resume to look like you're someone that shouldn't be ignored.
