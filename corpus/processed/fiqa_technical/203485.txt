"Congrats you pulled some irrelevant statistics. No where in your response does it verify your claim that the majority of small businesses aren't turning a profit. And many small businesses do have a multiple stakeholders. Since we are on the subject, do you know how large a company can be and still be classified as a small business? [It is 500, 1,000, or 1,500 employees depending on the industry.] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecooper/2012/09/20/the-government-definition-of-small-business-is-b-s/#58848cee360a) Five-hundred employees is not exactly small. Oh by the way, I've worked for multiple small businesses under 100 employees and they've had owners, stakeholders, investors, a board of directors, etc. on top of all of the employees. Not every small business is some mom and pop company of 5-15 employees. >Then put your money where your mouth is and get out there and create some jobs. Hahaha. This has nothing to do with the discussion but whatever dude. If we were both to start our own companies, I'd actually value my workers and you would just complain about labor costs of the people that are needed to run your business. Here is the thing, I don't consider creating minimum wage jobs as true job creation, [because the tax payer is still footing the bill if the company isn't paying a live-able wage.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/14/when-work-isnt-enough-to-keep-you-off-welfare-and-food-stamps/) The majority of people on welfare are working families (see same link), so what good is job creation of minimum wage positions if the people that work them still have to rely on the government? Think about this, if we were to remove the minimum wage and I could pay someone $1 and hour, I could ""create jobs."" But we all know that is asinine because no one could live on that. Yet the same thing happens at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and people like you don't see that there is no difference between the two examples. In both scenarios, people still don't make enough to live without some assistance."
