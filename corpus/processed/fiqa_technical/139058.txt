I don't know what you're talking about. If anything bankruptcy has become more creditor friendly over the years, which is only logical because business debtors don't really lobby for friendlier bankruptcy rules when they're not planning on being bankrupt. The only difference is that debt is more readily available and a bigger part of doing business today, so you'll naturally see more reorganizations.
