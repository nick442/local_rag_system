The joint narrative here is that a Democracy is a poor form of government. That’s why it is great that we don’t have a Democracy. We have a republic. And our Republic is showing fracturing. What causes fracturing? It isn’t just difference of opinion, as Madison states. It is also a refusal to listen to, work with, or acknowledge the legitimacy of the arguments of our opposition or dissenting members. We fail to communicate properly, holding attitude and superiority above understanding and attention. You won’t fix a communication issue with a change of government. Our communication issue has festered into distrust. How can you trust someone who won’t even acknowledge your point of view? How can you trust someone who is willing to dust you to save their own skin? I doubt any government can survive poor communication. Our government waste can be seen as poor communication as well. People with one interest refuse to acknowledge their opposition, and put into place inflexible and unsustainable rules. Those rules address the one issue those people saw, but fail to account for market forces, new social views, geography, or sometimes simple greed. People love that the first issue is handled, and are willing to watch the ship sink rather than change. Opposition refuses to acknowledge the reason the rules were originally created. Both sides get defensive, and division increases. Let’s always look to the source of the issue, that we may cure as close to the root as possible, rather than be content fighting the symptoms.
