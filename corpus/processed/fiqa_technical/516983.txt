"This is back breaking work. Our crops are not going to get picked. So here is my conflict. We used to have this weird system that was much like slavery. ""Illegal"" people (God, what a fucked up term) would come over the border and work for less money because actually living in their own country and actually having a life expectancy was totally fucking impossible. So they would come here and do our hardest jobs until they could figure out how to become citizens and start their own businesses (because they had found out what hard work and dedication was) and grow our economy. So now if they can't get in at all we are either going to have to stop growing a shitload of food or we are going to have to start making more things a crime so we can arrest more people and put them into slave labor. 13th. The title of Ava DuVernay's extraordinary and galvanizing documentary refers to the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States."" The progression from that second qualifying clause to the horrors of mass criminalization and the sprawling American prison industry is laid out by DuVernay with bracing lucidity. With a potent mixture of archival footage and testimony from a dazzling array of activists, politicians, historians, and formerly incarcerated women and men, DuVernay creates a work of grand historical synthesis.
