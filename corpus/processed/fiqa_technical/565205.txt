"This is a stupid question. Operating an elevator or train is very simple, and even a kid can do that. In elevator, just press the button for the floor you want. In a train, a ""gas pedal"" and a ""break pedal"". If a ""mistake"" happens, at least in trains, it may kill few people on the train or something on the tracks. An airplane is much more complicated, and if a ""mistake"" happens, a large section of town and buildings can suffer with many many deaths. P/S: unmanned trains are only for slow-moving trains with small amount of people on them, e.g. in airports."
