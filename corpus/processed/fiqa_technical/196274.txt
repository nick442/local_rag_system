The legalization of marijuana has led to higher wages for unskilled workers. People who would normally work in fast food or the restaurant industry is a good example of this. Instead of taking a minimum wage job, these marijuana companies are offering higher wages to work for them. These jobs tend to be a less stressful and pay more than working in a restaurant so more and more unskilled workers are going into this field. In fact this has created a shortage of jobs in the restaurant industry. Colorado literally cannot find enough people to work in their restaurants. I've worked in the coal Industry for 3 years but I can't comment on the coal situation since I've been out of that market for a while. All I can say is nuclear is our future.
