That's a good point. What I should say is that PF doesn't lose money on each gym user the way Moviepass does. My understanding is that Moviepass gets a flat subscription fee from each user per month and then, whenever a user wants to buy a movie ticket, Moviepass go out and purchase the movie ticket at full market value (the same price that the customer would pay if they just went to the theater and bought one). For example, if a user pays $10 a month for a pass and decide to see two movies in that month, they've already lost money on that customer. And two movies in one month isn't really crazy for some of the people who go enough that a monthly pass makes sense. And all this is assuming that ticket prices are lower than the subscription fee; where I live, the ticket prices are actually a little bit higher. If Moviepass was here even *one* movie would make me an unprofitable customer for them (looking just at subscriptions, of course). The data analytics play is the only viable strategy I can imagine for this. I understand that certain business models rely on overbooking, but I can't think of one where each customer that uses the service actually loses the business money.
