I don't know much about how student loans work, so there might be some caveats (e.g. does the interest rate stay constant, do you get a discount if you pay off early etc.). Ignoring those caveats: The interest on you student loan looks quite small. Depends a bit where you are in the world, but it seems very likely that you can get more interest than that on a 100% guaranteed investment form, e.g. term bank deposits. So, it seems a no-brainer to not pay back you student loan and invest the money securely for a higher interest rate instead. Similar situation when you think about taking the money as a down-payment for a house. More factors come into play here:
