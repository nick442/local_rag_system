"It isn't what you want to hear, but there really is no substitute for the CFA if you want to work in research. Fortunately, you don't need to have passed all 3 levels to make a jump. Plenty of people are able to move having only passed level 1 or 2. If you really do want to end up in a more quantitative/data driven role, start learning R/Python & looking into data science/machine learning/statistics. That said, you aren't going to magically become a data analyst over night. Learning VBA/Macros in excel may be more achievable, and is likely to help. Alternatively, if you do want to be a ""thought leader"" with regards to macro/trends etc, a masters may be of use, but your mileage will likely vary. Learning Bloomberg/Factset/Morningstar is unlikely to clinch you a role."
