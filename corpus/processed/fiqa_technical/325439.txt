Yoooooo you pissed? At least have the courtesy of leaving a TL;DR cus that's exactly what I did. I worry about myself and my family. We're capable of picking and paying for the insurance coverage that works best for us. I don't like the idea of being forced to buy something I don't want. Worse yet, I wouldn't like paying for some drug addict/lazy asshole who can't get a job to get medical care with my money indirectly Anyway, thanks for the rant. Introduced me to some new ideas that I don't agree with, but I always like hearing multiple sides of the argument.
