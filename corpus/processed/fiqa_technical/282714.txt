"I usually go to a theater closest to me owned by a smaller local company. However, once I ventured to my nearby AMC to see a $28 ticket price! WTF!? I just want to watch a movie. I don't need a handjob or a glass of Dom while I watch. I asked the ticket guy why. He said ""it's got Dolby sound and it's the summer I guess"". Fuck AMC. I saw the same movie 3 miles away for $9."
