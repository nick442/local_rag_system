"Look at the link to the SIPC. I don't know exactly what you mean by ""runs out of funds,"" but the SIPC will replace shares of stock stolen from your account, and up to $100,000 in cash. The real risk is when a shady brokers sells you shares in a stock that becomes worthless, that's when ""buyer beware"" kicks in. No help there."
