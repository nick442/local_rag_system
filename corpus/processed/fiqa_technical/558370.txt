Orthodontists have an extensive education and are dedicated to helping your teeth and jaws work in union so that you can speak, bite and chew comfortably and effectively. There are a lot of treatment options these days, from clear aligners to modern braces. They each have their function, but only an orthodontist has the specialized knowledge to identify and plan for all the variables in your mouth. A good orthodontist will take your unique needs and wishes into consideration when recommending the right treatment option for you.
