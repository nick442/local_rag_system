We buy data various providers (sharadar and quotemedia to name a few) and to answer your second question how we pay for it â€” with credit card :-) If you mean where we take money from; from our personal budgets. We want to introduce subscriptions in future but what is free currently will stay free forever (at least thats our plan).
