Long time /r/economy subscriber and early Ethereum investor here. I'm 100% biased (full disclosure) but I believe this tech has legs. There are a lot of companies backing it, governments exploring it and developers building upon it. It's currently at $365 with a $35bil market cap. Look for 3 upgrades in the works: 1) Raiden - Should increase transaction capabilities to that of Visa 2) Sharding - Allows for lite clients and partial downloads of the nodes 3) Proof of Stake - No more video card farms wasting electricity. Put your ethereum as stake to help the network reach consensus and earn a percentage return I've you've got commodities in your portfolio, I would strongly suggest taking a look at Ethereum
