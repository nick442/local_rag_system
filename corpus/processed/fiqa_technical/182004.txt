"One idea that wouldn't require getting into any special ""SMS-only"" type of software project is to just use email groups - for example, to send an SMS message to a Verizon customer you can email using their phone number like 1234567890@vtext.com. So ""Joe"" might have an email address of joe@company.com but you could create a new contact named ""SMS-Joe"" that has the cell phone email address. Look up what domain name each cell carrier uses for that purpose on the page below, put a bunch of those into an email group and 'text' away. https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-send-e-mail-to-sms-text/"
