"Hah, Canada has had Fox news available for years. Canada also has the Sun News Network, which although not financially connected to Fox News, is in line with them philosophically. In other words, they reject the pro-left tilt of the MSM and present an opposing point of view. The Left can't tolerate other viewpoints because they don't have arguments to refute them. Instead they shriek ""Lies"" and the intellectually lazy are drawn in. You should try educating yourself, not to mention *think* for yourself. Quit embarrassing yourself by parroting left-wing talking points."
