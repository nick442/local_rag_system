"Others have told you about the soap (bubbles doesn't mean cleansing) and toothpaste (mint scent doesn't mean ""clean""), and I can tell you about the laundry detergent: stains and whitening are due to agents added to the detergent specifically for that and have downsides (faster wear of garments, faster loss of other colour, some people are allergic). I know absolutely nothing about ""honest co"" products, but your complaints are somewhat off."
