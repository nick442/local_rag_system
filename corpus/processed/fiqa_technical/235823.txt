Best bet is to talk to a lawyer who is familiar with the area. Most will give you a free consult or bill you for an hour. Bring the contract. You don't want to end up in small claims court (or worse) because your writer doesn't agree with you. If you can't cough up $200 for this, you need to rethink if you are in business or playing at being in business.
