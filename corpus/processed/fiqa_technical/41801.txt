>Until there is a significant price pressure, it’s always going to be cost prohibitive to build high in earthquake prone zones. Those mitigation measures don’t come cheap at all. It doesn't matter what the economics are if it's literally illegal. >As for the skyline, eh, that’s subjective. If the local culture values a “small town” or even bucolic feel, keeping buildings below tree lines isn’t regressive at all. Sure.. But blaming the problem on immigration when 75% of the city is zoned for <3 story structures is ignorant.
