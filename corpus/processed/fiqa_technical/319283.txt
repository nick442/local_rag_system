Sorry, but you are the exception and not the rule -- and from your description of how stressful the parking and shopping experience is you must be in a large city. Maybe it makes sense in SF, I never lived there but having worked there it's a PIA to get around. $60/mo as added expense to isn't going to work for many. A large percentage of American grocery shoppers use coupons which indicates how price conscious they are and explains the failed adoption of these grocery delivery services. My grocery bill is $200/mo so a 30% convenience fee is ridiculous. Until they can bring cost parity for grocery delivery to the same as I can pickup in store I don't see any of this panning out.
