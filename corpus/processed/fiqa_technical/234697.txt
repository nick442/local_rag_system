OP, where did you get those percentages? Your post got me interested and the only article I could find was [this one](http://iphone.appleinsider.com/articles/17/01/20/report-claims-apple-music-pays-more-to-record-labels-in-royalties-per-stream-than-spotify), which actually indicates that Apple pays more than Spotify. Would be interested in reading more, if you could pass it along.
