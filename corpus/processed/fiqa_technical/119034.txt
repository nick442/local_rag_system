Hello Reddit friends, family & future guests of The Greenhouse Inn, Asbury Park's (NJ) first eco-friendly bed and breakfast. I have wonderful news from the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the local community bank, as they have agreed to finance 90% of the startup costs to open The Greenhouse Inn. Woo hoo! They have affirmed their support, and are ready to get the ball rolling, but I will need to supply 10% of the projects total cost in equity. For instance, a bank will usually lend only if you have 10% of the amount you require. Therefore, if we have $1,000, getting a bank loan of up to $10,000 should be feasible. This is oversimplified, but in a way, it means that every single dollar contributed gives The Greenhouse access to ten more. If we make $20,000 dollars on RocketHub, we might be able to get a loan of $200,000 dollars!
