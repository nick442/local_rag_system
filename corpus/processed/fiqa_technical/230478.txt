Had a guy, out in a store in Plymouth I was at, try to steal a case of crab legs. Manager stops him in the vestibule, gets bitten. Was about twice a month that we'd have people in the office waiting for the cops. Nevermind how many times the bank there got robbed at gunpoint. Affluent neighborhood too.
