"The answer depend nearly 100% on how the offer and contingency read. When I have a client make an offer, the contingency includes an inspection, but the buyer would have no obligation to accept a counter offer. i.e. the offer can be withdrawn due to ""I didn't like the inspection report, and do not wish to negotiate any repairs."" In fact, the buyer need not disclose which fault was the cause. The buyer pays for the inspection and the report is his property. On the other hand, I agree, if it's only radon, the venting fix is common, and you may be paying for many inspections only to find one house after another with this issue."
