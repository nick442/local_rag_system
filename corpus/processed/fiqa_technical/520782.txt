I have no problem with what ford is doing. I have a problem with the attitude in the comment > Those companies that are locked into doing so by huge numbers of _legacy employees_ and retirees to whom they still have legal obligations (the automakers, some airlines, etc.) need to figure out how to dump these liabilities ASAP. Chinese, Brazilian, European and other global competitors.. It seems to forget that skilled workers are what generate the profits. The company is not its own entity. The company doesn't use workers like disposable fuel where any warm body will do.
