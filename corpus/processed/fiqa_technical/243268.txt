"This doesn't say the whole story (like the length of the HELOC). if you have 15 years left on a mortgage and ""refinance"" into a 30 year HELOC then yes, your payments maybe 20% lower, but you add 15 years to pay it off. Just remember that interest occurs daily on what you owe. If you move 100K of debt from 5% mortgage to 6% HELOC you'll be paying more to the banks no matter how you slice it."
