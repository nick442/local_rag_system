I think there's no single one size fits all way to do hierarchies and flat structures. One can have very insular divisions where everything goes in and out of the division via the supervisor in charge of them, but all of the divisional supervisors having a very flat structure working among each other, for example. I think this resolves a lot of the noise issue from low-ranking employees talking to people that they really shouldn't be while still maintaining the efficiency benefits for low level management which presumably has enough seniority to understand how things work (or are new people in those positions who are important enough to handhold them through learning that quickly).
