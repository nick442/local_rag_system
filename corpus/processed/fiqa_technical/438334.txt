I'll still only probably buy in stores. Who wants to keep sending shit back? Even within the same brand you have two shirts/shorts/shoes/jeans that are pretty much the same but different sizes. Puma is great at having similar style shoes that are the same size but one will run big or small. Its ridiculous. They don't even bother to tell you on their site a shoe runs big or small. With clothes, you want it to look good on you even though it fits. I try on a bunch of shirts and pants and might buy 1 or 2 of each. I would need to order and return a ton of clothes if I were to buy online. I still do with some things like gym shorts, underwear, etc.. but not with everything.
