Did you account for college? That's 40k per year in tuition alone. Also I'm not sure you accounted that the number included income forgone, as in if they weren't taking care of the kids they could've been earning more money. The article says the cost to *parents* is 900,000 per kid, but that doesn't mean the parents are actually spending 900,000 per kid. Lots of other things to account for..a couple w/o kids doesn't need to get a 4-bedroom house for example. Does your co-worker own a house? Did you account for the cost of ownership?
