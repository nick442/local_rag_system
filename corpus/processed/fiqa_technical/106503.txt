There is an alternative if something (i.e., chicken) is 100% chicken. If it's anything other than straight chicken, it obviously isn't 100% chicken. It's only deceptive if you literally don't think about it at all. Obviously a chicken meatball isn't 100% chicken. Then it would just be ground chicken. Do you have any evidence whatsoever of the intent behind the law, or does it just feel that way to you?
