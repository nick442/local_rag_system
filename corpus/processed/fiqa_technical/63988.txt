"My problem with this is that there's no ""one size fits all"" approach to eliminating poverty. These are very much middle-class values and I don't think imposing them on impoverished children is the right approach. And besides, poverty itself can be fluid. Most kids already in poverty are stuck in generational poverty, but there's also situational poverty that can affect anyone at any time. For kids in generational poverty, it's about survival. They don't plan ahead because they don't have the luxury to do that. It's day to day with them, with each day bringing a new challenge. Do I know what we have to do to eliminate poverty? No, and I don't think anyone does. But I do think whatever approach we take should be multifaceted and take into account the environmental contexts that shape a person's life. This kind of lazy policymaking isn't gonna cut it"
