You might consider looking in the mirror. You are continuing to launch your verbal tirades. I've provided a significant amount of support - I could continue if you like. You, however, have no provided any support at all. You are just some guy on the internet shouting from lonely mountain about how undergrad students should go straight to business school. It's foundationally wrong. You don't like being challenged and I'm challenging your views. Additionally, you do know in business that you need to provide support, so saying that you don't need to back anything up flies in the face of any business sense. Simply making a comment first doesn't entitle you to a free pass, you should defend your position if you feel so strongly about it. I do have an MBA and I'm a CFA charterholder. I'd be more than happy to connect with you outside of reddit to validate my credentials.
