"This is great. The ACA was objectively bad for healthcare/insurance companies. Now that it's a huge mess, people are looking to blame the GOP. ""It's republicans' fault Obamacare failed"" is ludicrous. It's more likely that the ACA was designed to fail. But why would our lord and savior Barack Obama do something like that? No way would the Democrats ever do something malicious. They're the party of the People! The downtrodden! The little guy! I'm willing to rail against the GOP just as much as the next guy, but this is next level mental gymnastics. Obamacare failed; it's the Dems fault. Own it."
