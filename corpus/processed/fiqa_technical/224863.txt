There are some great tips and advice in here. Here's something you may not have considered. The capacity for income is limited by your time and the tuk-tuk rates. For example, if you become the best and most well-known tuk-tuk driver in Siam Reap and all the tourist want to use your service, the most business you can do is 1 customer per day. However, if you were to make Trusty Tuk Tuks a booking service you could make a margin from multiple drivers. Heres how it works: You find 10 drivers who all agree to do the same features - Cold drinks and snacks, curtains, help tourists with tickets, trusty tuk-tuk business cards. Paint or decorate the tuk-tuks so they all look the same. All drivers agree that for every booking you bring them, they will offer the same service and pay you 10%. Set up a stand at the market with someone that speaks English and take bookings. Tell your potential customers about the price, the tuk tuks, the cold drinks, the ticketing help, and what temples they can visit. Soon Trusty Tuk Tuks becomes a brand. This way you are not limited to 1 tuk tuk and 1 customer a day. The key here is that all drivers must agree to the same price and the same service. Its the consistency that makes a brand.
