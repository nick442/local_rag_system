When businesses use arbitration-only clauses, they essentially force any enforcement action for wrong doing onto government. No matter how egregious are the actions of the business, it is not financially feasible to arbitrate for small dollar issues and it is thus up to government to litigate. This allows businesses to act with impunity as they know that the risks of government action are slim and there is no chance of getting sued by private parties. Remember all of those unauthorized bank accounts that Wells Fargo opened? When sued by private parties, they successfully argued that it must go to arbitration. The bank committed fraud against their customers and they still get to pick the venue and terms of any litigation.
