"> You must understand that the major difference between borrowing from an individual and borrowing from a financial institution is that in both cases you make exactly the same pledges and have exactly the same obligations. Yes, I got that. > The bank expects a certain percentage of its borrowers to default Its insurance also expects that a certain percentage of banks will be robbed. Which in your universe makes bankrobbing kinda okay I guess. > Your bank doesn't ""trust"" you any further than it could throw you. The bank does trust in pacta sunt servanda and the rule of the law.
