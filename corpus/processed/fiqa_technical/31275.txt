I live downtown in a pretty big city where taxis (or car2go) are the dominant form of public transportation. Fuck taxis. After dealing with them for years, I hate them. They're always driven by shitheads from Somalia who are always rude, they and their cars stink to hell, they're always yelling on the phone in Arabic, and that's just once you actually get in the car. First, you have to stand your ass on the street and flag one down, because if you call the dispatcher, you get another fucking Somalian who doesn't give a rats ass about where you are or when you need to be picked up. Going to a meeting or have dinner reservations? Good luck. After going out and trying to get a ride home, there's a 50/50 chance the asshole taxi driver won't let you in until you tell him you're destination, then he'll just speed off if he decides its not far enough. When it comes time to pay, they will agressively get in your face and demand you pay them in cash, *not with a credit card*. I've had my credit card info stolen after using it in a cab. On more than one occasion, my girlfriend paid with a card, the driver grabbed it from her, *entered his own tip* and bitched at her the whole time. Every **EVERY** single time I've used Lyft its been a great experience. The cars are always clean, the drivers are always super friendly, I know exactly where and when to expect them via the app, and paying is a cinch. Fuck taxis. Taxis are an old, inefficient system and I'm glad they're being replaced. I don't care about whatever consumer protections they don't have, Lyft had their own algorithm to calculate fares and its at least consistent.
