My 2 cents:As I understand it, stochastic math doesn't seem to cut it for pricing derivatives. Ito's Lemma and Feynman-Kac SDE solutions both impose constraints on higher order moments of the PDF. So you can't just drop in your forecasted return distribution and get a price. All the fixes seem somewhat ad hoc. Shit gets real when you move from options to their first cousin: term structure of interest rates. The Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework was intractable in the original paper, but there are some promising simplifying assumptions. I think there's real money there for someone who works that out and comes up with new arbitrage possibilities. On the other hand, you get some phenomenally bad math like the Gaussian copula that was used to value the subprime tranches and bring them a mind-boggling AAA rating. A lot of folks here do fancy nonlinear time series analysis to forecast the 1st, 2nd & higher moments of asset returns. Not a lot of theoretical basis (well neuroscience), but if you can do it better you win.
