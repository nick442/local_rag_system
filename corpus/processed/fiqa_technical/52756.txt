> Actually, the thing they need is debt, not depositors money. I was trying to explain how a bank could be a ponzi scheme. But on second thought, even the example I provided is wrong. Depositors are creditors to the bank. Ponzi schemes are paying out returns to investors or equity holders and has nothing to do with paying out liabilities to creditors. No matter how the bank sourced the assets, paying returns of interest to depositors (creditors) can't be deemed a ponzi scheme.
