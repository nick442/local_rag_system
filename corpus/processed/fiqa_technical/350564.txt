They originally planned to have the WiMax rollout start in mid-2007, which would've brought some nice speeds to US customers by 2009. Infighting with Clearwire delayed the rollout for over a year. I explained the situation (based on whatever info I've gathered to date) in greater detail in [another reply below](http://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/11ido4/japans_softbank_poised_to_supercharge_sprint/c6mug06). I think that picture is fairly accurate but I'm not an insider so I can't say for sure.
