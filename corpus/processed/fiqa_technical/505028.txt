Many developing countries have restrictions on foreigners buying land. For example, Thailand. If you ever move there, you will never be able to own any land. Period. But countries like India go even further. If you want to buy some land in J&K province, you can't even if you are Indian. What if you marry a woman from J&K? Nope.. then you are both screwed and both of you can't buy land in J&K. Similar restrictions are in place for other provinces (HP, AP, etc) Imagine living in New Jersey and never being able to buy land in Pennsylvania.. that's India. Building and hoping no one notices worked 15 years ago, but not anymore. (unless you're rich and connected, of course.)
