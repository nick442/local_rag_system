The value of the car is only of interest if there is an intention to sell it aqain. I would make the following calculation: This gives you the costs per time period that the car really costs you. Now do the same with a new (used) car you intend to buy instead of this car. With the new car you also need to add the costs of buying it (sales price, plus any interests and fees if you finance it). If the old car costs you less than the new car, keep it, otherwise get the new car.
