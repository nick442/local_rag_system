"Here's another perspective - I work in FP&A at a large Chicago bank. I originally was interested in treasury, but here it is mostly cash management/reserve requirements/etc. - not really my cup of tea. A lot of our M&A activity and fundraising roles are held by former I-Bankers. It might be hard to make it into that role. I don't have any ""Accounting Functions"" - the accounting teams do that. While I am involved in planning and forecasting, I also provide a lot of strategic analysis on projects and ad-hoc/pro-forma reporting. Here, FP&A is more the voice of the financial function in strategic decision making. One other piece of advice - see if you can talk to some people on the team and see what their day-to-day is like. If you're interested in FP&A in the true sense and not accounting/GLs, try looking for a larger firm."
