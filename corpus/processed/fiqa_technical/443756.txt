"He's saying: 1) Make juice from fruit (100% juice) 2) Remove water (still 100% juice) 3) Mix water, food coloring, and juice concentrates together (still 100% juice?) I mean sure, if you define ""juice"" to be ""water, fruit stuff, and other shit"" then yeah, it's 100% juice. Also, you said: >You can not say it is ""100% beef"" unless it is 100% beef. But the whole point of this thread isn't that something is labeled ""100% beef"", it's that something is labeled ""MADE WITH 100% beef"". Can you spot the difference?"
