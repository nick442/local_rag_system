"There's enough places that directly accept BitCoin today that, call it whatever you want, it looks, walks, and quacks like a duck. And for transfers between two people that use different native currencies, it works a hell of a lot *better* and cheaper than most existing solutions. As for ""growing faster"", in eight years Bitcoin has gone from nonexistent to the 266th biggest ""company"" (in terms of market cap) in the *world*. Though still technically smaller than them, it makes the likes of Microsoft, Apple, and Google all look like sloths by comparison. To address ""trust"" - You're conflating ""trust of the issuer"" with ""trust of the bag-man"". With USD, you need to trust the good faith of the US Treasury; while that is certainly a pretty good bet, with Bitcoin, you don't need to trust **anyone**, because there *is* no issuing authority (no, not even the core devs could magically create more bitcoins out of thin air). That's different than, for example, trusting an online wallet or exchange with it, because then you have a third party holding your assets that *can* vanish to the Caymans overnight.. But that wouldn't be any less true if you trusted USD to a random guy online. All that said, I'm **still** not invested in it because, although I love me some high return high volatility, I *don't* like the high risk of governments making my assets illegal overnight (China and Russia have already done so, though *for now* it seems more a statement of official policy than a real crime they go after people for). But as a medium of exchange - You *bet* I keep a small amount in my offline wallet for convenience!"
