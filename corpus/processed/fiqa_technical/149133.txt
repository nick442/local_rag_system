Speaking as a liberal arts graduate working in a big financial firm: liberal arts graduates tend to have a generalist's perspective that lends itself well to picking up skills on the job, and are often very good at communicating very complex information in a digestible format. For instance, one of the MAJOR complaints where I work is that there is a higher tendency among employees with STEM backgrounds to be very anti-social when interacting with clients. They are very good at the specific tasks they are trained to do, but absolutely abysmal when it comes to building business relationships, internally and externally. To put the above in perspective, I consider myself to be a reserved person, but at work I feel like a social butterfly compared to a good chunk of my colleagues. It's very odd.
