"Honestly, I see we don't see eye to eye but I can't put my finger on it. Take the American heart association for example - you mention people who weren't middle class might not know who they are. I didn't get to eat at a sandwich restaurant for the first time until right before I graduated high school. I was so happy when I got to eat that first sandwich someone else made, and then when I saw the american heart association logo on the menu, I just assumed it was healthy. I didn't need previous experience. Perhaps my example seems like something a middle class person would do, because I grew up aspiring to be middle class and the things I did wrong are things I thought middle class people did. To most of my point, all that is irrelevant. When you are poor, no one wants to give you advice. When you are middle class, the advice you can afford is not good but it presents itself as good. When you are well off, everyone wants to take advantage of you and good advice is hard to discern from poor advice. Your use of the phrase ""the system"" is interesting to me. Under no circumstances would I advocate ""the system"" be trusted. In fact, in my mind, what I've described is ""the system"" accidentally but perfectly preparing people to be unable to transcend socioeconomic status, because we were prepare people to think the haves are lucky, as opposed to teaching the have-notes how to establish a plan such that their children will have opportunities and their grand children will be well off and their great grand children will be rich."
