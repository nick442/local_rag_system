Ehm, the 2008 crisis was effectively a debt crisis. Debt levels are higher now than in 2008 and default rates are on the rise. Furthermore the ability for monetary policy to absorb has been spent. What helped in 2008 was the high savings rate of China. Now even china is in a debt bubble. Stocks are beyond expensive in a historical context, and the reason is, with money so cheap where else do you stand to get some return? This crash is coming.. not sure when as market timing is impossible, but i would advise you to take a big crisis into account in your planning..,
