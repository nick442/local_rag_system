Can someone please explain the following in more detail please. I'm not exactly sure how and why synthetics work. > Instead of having credit default swap reference a single company like Exxon, J.P Morgan bundled together a large, diversified basket of credit derivatives that referenced hundreds of corporate credits.. those who invested in J.P Morgan's invention didn't own a piece of the actual corporate loan. Instead, they owned credit default swaps - the performance of which was determined by the performance of the underlying corporate credits. This is from *All the Devils are Here* by Bethany Mclean and Joe Nocera
