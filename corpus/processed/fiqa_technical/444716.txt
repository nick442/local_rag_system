"No, there's no justification for saying that the resource ""needs to be used in a way which is most productive"". That's not consistent with either capitalism (which does not take a moral stance, but observes that it goes to the highest bidder) or with social welfare (which is concerned with maintaining a reasonable rate of employment). And we were not discussing govt employment."
