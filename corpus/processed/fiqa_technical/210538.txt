"> A government can run out of gold. It cannot run out of its own free-floating currency. When it comes to borrowing, whether or not you can be unable to service that debt is very relevant to how much interest you pay. > As Japan cannot run out of yen, Japan can borrow yen very cheaply - despite books that don't make a lick of sense if evaluated like a business. So you don't think two ""lost"" decades going on three and a debt of over 200% isn't a problem for Japan? You want to try that here when it hasn't worked in the most orderly society in the world? And there's more to play out in Japan. No where near ""recovery"" and in a tail spin again."
