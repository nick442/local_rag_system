So here's our [answer](http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Treasury_Regulations,_Subchapter_A,_Sec._1.162-21). What it looks like, is basically that the **fines** are not deductible, but the **damages** are. At any rate, I don't think it's questionable at all. It reduces the overall amount of the amount they have to pay, but it's certainly not like they come out ahead on the deal. Further, I presume it's been argued before a court that since the income was illegally obtained (through some sort of illegal function of the business) then the business paid taxes on income it shouldn't have made in the first place.
