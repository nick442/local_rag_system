I HATE Best Buy. Things might have changed because I don't think I have been in one for almost 2 years but I don't like overload and Best Buy is overload. Overload in every way. - You walk in and someone is right in your face. - There are about 7,000 TVs and 14,000 different other screens shooting shit at your face with so much sound in the background I feel like I'm at an arcade. - Employees are trying to sell you DVDs (*who even buys those anymore?*) and magazines or whatever rando shit they are pushing that week. I fucking hate that place. It's like the worst retail experience I could imagine. There is nothing enjoyable about it at all. The last few times I've been have been to grab a cord or something I really need and I'm like some shell shocked Vietnam vet. I brace myself and run in as fast as possible grab whatever looks right and make a dash for the cash registers.
