It's not that Millennials *can't* get a summer job, it's that that the perceived ROI on an hourly basis of going to college is higher than the minimum wage they would receive at those jobs. The earning power of a bachelors degree is about $23k per year ($51.2k - $27.9k average salary for those w/ and w/o degrees). By taking classes over the summer and finishing 48 weeks early, one can make an additional $21.5k with a college degree. Meanwhile, one who works for those same 48 weeks at the federal minimum wage could expect to make $13.9k. And if you're not pursuing a degree then it's not really a summer job anymore. This basic economics explains why many people have chosen to forego the summer job. I know there are many exceptions, such as places with higher local minimum wages and degrees that earn less but this is macro economics we're talking about and the basic math checks out.
