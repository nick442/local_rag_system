local by me is a market/store that is basically veggies and fruits. they have some meat, some fish, but people are there for the vegetables and ethnic fruits I rarely go because I can see from the main road all their parking spaces and hardly ever is there a spot available. when I do see a parking space, I wheel in and buy like $40 worth, mostly veggies. high quality, low prices, great variety point is, people want to pick out there own fresh stuff
