This is a good and bad thing. Former technology consultant here who dealt with a lot of healthcare orgs including pharmacies. The small mom and pop shops that are around, similar to CVS or Walgreens but MUCH smaller will hurt from this. For us consumers it will probably be good but one of the largest factors for consumers is the ability to go pick up your meds immediately. I have a feeling we might be seeing more Amazon micro types of stores for a miniature brick and mortar strategy where it makes sense to carry items that are often time sensitive.
