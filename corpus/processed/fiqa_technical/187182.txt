Used to be big on netflix culture, but after working in a place with very similar culture then reading a recent post from their CEO comparing their teams to professional sports teams (the implication that there are starters and folks who are on the bench, and the folks being benched should be cut/fired). I'm not so sure. These kinds of cultures breed toxicity, the stench of with they try to disguise with the faux perfume of hyper-meritocracy (the best survive, everyone else can go). Truth is they're not willing to invest in personally improving their employees, so they just want to do the easy job of picking the most talented people and discarding them as soon as they stop performing .. its lazy, and its pretty ugly once you figure out how it all works.
