Feel free to link to any research that supports his claims, I'll read it. And since Google isn't unionized, he doesn't really have much legal recourse. He can sue, but it's unlikely he'll win. More likely is that Google could be successfully sued if they continued to employ him and he exposed them to any kind of harrassment claims.
