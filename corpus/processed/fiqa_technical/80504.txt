Not that I disagree with your points, but what would you suggest? Can enough of us voluntarily drop out of the system to crash it? What does someone do if they realize they chose a bad major and can't afford to go back to school? How would you instruct someone to take control of their life, that has next to no money, or is in debt, or needs a rat race job to survive another day? What are some viable alternatives to being held hostage by the system?
