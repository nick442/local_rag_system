"So back in the day, DOS had different types of memory. The first 640k was called ""conventional"" memory, and DOS made it available to everything, to use as they will. After that was ""UMA"" (upper memory area) that ran from 640k to 1024k. UMA was generally reserved for mapping various system devices to memory. After that, ignoring some system stuff, there was ""expanded memory"" that went from 1024k to 4gig (you'll remember the Win98 max memory size was 4 gig? This is why.) called ""expanded memory"". In the 386, there was a various combination of device drivers, system features, and extremely clever programming that allowed the user to move most device drivers, and other ""system"" stuff into expanded memory so more of that first 640k is available. DOOM was a huge game, at the time, and required almost all the 640K, so you would have to make a boot floppy (or a bunch of clever config.sys/autoexec.bat stuff) that would boot the system into almost bare minimum mode and run DOOM. DOOM would fill up most of that 640K and then load up EMM386.exe, and get at that sweet expanded memory for loading assets and such. If you had enough expanded memory, you could just punt all those drivers into expanded memory by default and still have enough left for Doom to load in that 640K *and* have enough expanded for the assets to load."
