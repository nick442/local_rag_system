USPS is a private company entirely. We fulfill a government contract and receive zero tax dollars. It's more because we deliver to every house daily as it is, and our carriers almost all work more than 40 hours a week already, so there isn't a benefit to having us deliver that way since we go everywhere once a day anyways.
