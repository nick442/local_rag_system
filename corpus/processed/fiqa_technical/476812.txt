I'll give you a stark example of China's debt-driven construction growth: Since '09 China has constructed enough physical office space buildings to give every Chinese man, woman, and child their own cubicle - 3 times over! Given that these buildings were largely financed by debt, its hard to see how those creditors get all their money back given that there simply are not enough Chinese people to occupy and pay/rent that space in order for break-even to occur.
