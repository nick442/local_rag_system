"I mean, honestly, what kind of weird insular bubble do you have to live in to take that seriously? I know a lot of people that work at Microsoft or worked there over the last 15 years, and for much of that time Microsoft's culture was all about ignoring everything else that was happening around them and assuming that they were the only company/ecosystem that mattered, because they ""won"" during the 90s. This should have been a huge red flag to anyone that cared about the future of the company."
