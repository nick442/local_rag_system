It's not a church it is a company and needs to adhere to legal and ethical practices. I used to work at a company that brewed their own beer and staff could drink it at the end of the work day.. that doesn't make it a bar. Your thinking is fundamentally flawed if you were to replace religion with something like gender, race, sexuality, age etc. It is discrimination, there are laws in place because of it, and religion has no exemptions.
