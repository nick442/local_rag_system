That's exactly my predicament at this moment. I checked out both iPhone 5 and gs3 side by side and gs3 loses hands down. The only thing it has is size and it's a bit too big for me. But the iPhone has a dated OS and looks like a remote control. No such thing as perfect phone for consumers such as I. Ideal would be a 4.5-5in thin bezel or no bezel screen that is wider than iPhone, iPhone build and image quality, with coolness of android OS. Doesn't seem like a lot to ask for. But gs3 feels cheap. Nexus is going to come slightly dated, and software updates are hit or miss.
