One way to think of net worth is to think if you sold everything you owned, how big of a pile of money would be standing next to you (assuming your net worth is positive). If you started with $100K and then bought a house worth $100K you would have $0 in the bank and a house. If you sold that house for $100K you would pay the realtor 6% (typically) or $6K leaving you with $94K. This means the act of buying your house has reduced your net worth by $6K. I asked a related question about how to value your home in your net worth.
