"If I may play devil's advocate (and that is all I am doing), it is certainly possibly for money to get ""lost"" in the complexity of the instruments these people deal with. Crazy derivatives, swaps, packages, etc. are not well understood and I can easily see how Frat Boy Finance Johnny can mis-price some column in a report somewhere and lose track of money. Also, even though there may be records of the money, you might need 10 lawyers, a few physicists, 20 accountants, and a whole department of finance people to be able to trace/understand the flow of capital. I'm not saying this complexity and lack of transparency is a good thing, but I don't think it is totally crazy to suggest that honest people could lose track of the numbers. Of course, it's probably a healthy mix of corruption and naivete.."
