Minimum wage worker here. I agree wholeheartedly. Its not like I don't have the skills to do better. But when even entry level jobs these days demand experience in the field, its pretty damn hard to break in. Those internships haven't panned out as anything but an expense either. I've got student loans, and you want me to go into further debt to do real work for the negligible hope of eventually getting a real job? But I live in the US, where unpaid work is illegal for wage slaves doing menial work. Instead, I have a cap of hours I can work, to keep me from earning overtime. Its better than an unpaid internship.
