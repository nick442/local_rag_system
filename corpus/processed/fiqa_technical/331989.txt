Honest question, in UK, who pays the salary while the woman is on the maternity leave? I bet it's not the employer. If so, any cost concern is bullshit, and if the person (or rather a group thereof) can't step in effectively, the place has bigger issues stemming from poor management. tl;dr: the only reason for this discrimination is that management is **bad**.
