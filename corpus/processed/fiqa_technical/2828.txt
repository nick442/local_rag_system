"> ""The thing that is working to Foxconn's advantage here is that there were several states competing for this"", thats exactly it. This is the problem. It's a net loss for the country. Sure, Paul Ryan's district (what a coincidence right?!) benefits, but that's at the expense of Pennsylvania (the last place Foxconn claimed they were building a factory and never did.) It's just a race to the bottom."
