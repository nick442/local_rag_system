"Most people don't understand the fact that most of the extra ""Ticketmaster fees"" go directly to the venue/promoters of the event. Instead of charging $80/ticket, they are able to advertise $50/ticket with $25 service fee, $5 shipping fee, and $3 convenience fee. Ticketmaster gets a small slice of the overall pie and allows their brand to take a hit for it. I don't see Amazon entering the game changing much about that unless they find ways to systematically bring down scalpers."
