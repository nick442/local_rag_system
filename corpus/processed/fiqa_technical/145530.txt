This has nothing to due with class warfare and you'd have to be a complete fucking moron to infer that what works for a family has any correlation as to how a country can operate financially. It's about making long-term financial decisions to try and increase your quality of life. If you take your blinders off, you'll realize that multi-generational households are a common phenomenon worldwide. It has gone through waves of popularity throughout U.S. history as well, usually with immigrants. The Italian side of my family did it back when they immigrated and it's becoming a trend yet again. **Families that are experienced with poverty know it's the best way to survive - that's the only statement I made.** I stayed with my parents until this year (age 28) and left against their advice. They wanted me to stay longer and save as much as I could before leaving, but I felt it was time to leave. I have a stable job (self-employed), I downsized my car for financial purposes, and have paid off all of my debt before purchasing my apartment. It would have taken me much longer to save enough money to be a homeowner if I didn't depend on my family. I'm glad you hate people for making smart financial decisions. It really shows the type of person you are.
