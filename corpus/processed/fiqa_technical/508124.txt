Unlike conventional retail stores, malls offer experiences, as /u/grant622 said. In a world dominated by social media, this not only provides businesses with free publicity if they execute well and people talk about what they did online, but it also provides an incredible amount of value to the consumer, and people are more likely to come in and buy even if they weren't necessarily planning on getting anything in the first place. Movie theaters, bowling alleys, hell, even restaurants are basically becoming the foundation for retail businesses. I work in one of these , and the amount of customers we bring in from the area far exceeds that of any of the other businesses.
