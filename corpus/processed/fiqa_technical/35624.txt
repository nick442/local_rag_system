Have you ever made pizza? Like American style, tons of toppings pizza? I worked at a pizza restaurant for years and I can still never get it right at home. The premade dough at Trader Joes is OK, but to do it right I have to make my own so I have to start it first thing in the morning. Major pain in the ass. That huge flat cooking surface that you can heat up to 500 degrees makes all the difference in how the crust comes out and my wife won't let me tear out the breakfast nook to install a pizza oven. Plus if you want anything like a combination pizza that is just a ton of prep work with a lot of potential waste. A well made steak? A great pasta sauce? Fried chicken? Those I can make at home without a ton of work and at a fraction of the price. But pizza I'll go out for every time.
