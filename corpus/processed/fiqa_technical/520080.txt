There's a difference between a functioning financial system and the unregulated dysfunctional one we have now. Apple can still make IPads if there's some reasonable usury law, and if there's separation between government-insured deposits in banks and investment banks, as there was prior to Gramm-Leech-Bliley. Apple could also operate if there were some reasonable regulations on derivatives and all those other obscure financial Instruments. Apple could also operate if commodities markets weren't wide open to speculation. Apple could also operate if there were some reasonable regulations in place to stop vulture capitalists from cracking working companies open like ripe nuts, extracting all the value, and then discarding the bankrupt husks. None of this stops an actual business from running.
