"Yep, I would have this conversation repeatedly with customers at a previous job. ""Sir / Ma'am, I understand your frustration as you run your business from your home. However, you explicitly signed up for the residential service even after being reminded that it does not have any SLA's or guaranteed time to contact / time to restore."" It was very common that they would penny pinch on the connection and then raise holy hell when it inevitably went down. Then, they'd try to upgrade for a month and roll back, forcing us to begin signing them to contracts. From a business standpoint, we'd have to have additional staff as well as higher skilled staff to deal with their issues. More staff as you need to have someone able to immediately / short time dispatch. Higher skilled to deal with issues like VPNs, static IPs, bridging, and small to medium business type issues, along with the increased communication and presentation for the business clientele. Those additional resources also come at higher than usual pay."
