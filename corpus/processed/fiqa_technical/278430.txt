I am the vendor and I pay the 2 to 3%, not the customer. And I will pay it with a smile on my face. It's either that or deal with cash or other payment methods that are a) difficult/expensive or b) not possible because I am an online merchant. I would *like* the fees to be lower but right now pretty much every other method is either difficult, expensive or both. They know what they are doing. EDIT: Merchants like debit cards. They have the cheapest interchange rate. Reward cards are the most expensive - where do you think your 1% cash back comes from? :)
