"Well first, this program wouldn't exclude people from privately funding their own education if they have the resources. But second, the investors wouldn't be investing in individuals but entire classes so it isn't whether or not an individual student is worth the investment but whether or not that academic program was worth an investment. If a basic physics degree from a particular university was typically attracting people that were going to school for ""knowledge and a deep understanding of the world"" then the investors would demand a larger fraction of the student's future income, which, presumably, the students would be OK with since they weren't ""wanting an 'income'""."
