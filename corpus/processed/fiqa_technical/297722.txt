I would say you can ignore calls but not a summons. You can send a drop dead letter at anytime too if they keep calling. Here is an example one. http://www.fdcpaclaims.com/gathering-evidence-to-win-my-fdcpa-claim/what-constitutes-abuse-of-the-fdcpa/sample-drop-dead-letter/ John Oliver, on a show not too long ago, illustrated very plainly that this can be passed around from 3rd party to 3rd party with no evidence that you even owe money. And every time a new third party gets word that you might owe money a whole new round of calling could begin. So off topic but.. If they decide to take it to court and you do not show, the court rules against you and you will owe the money even if you didn't. It's absolutely crazy. Never ignore a court summons.
