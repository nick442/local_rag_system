Hey, I'm also a software engineer in Cleveland. There's actually tons to do, but it sounds like you just don't know anyone in your age range/not married. Check out the east bank flats or w 25th in Ohio city. If the bar scene isn't your thing there are still tons of other options so long as you have some type of hobby or activity you like to do for fun.
