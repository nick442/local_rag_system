"Sorry dude, my company is profitable and people come knocking trying to buy a piece of it. But I believe in ""neither a borrower nor a lender be"" - except that when you take venture capital, you can't just pay it back. Instead, you have people who don't care at best, and meddle and fire you from your own company at worst."
