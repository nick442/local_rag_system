I have this problem with my parents. They have stuff that they inherited or collected, and they have memories of them, and they want their kids to have them. The problem is, we don't have those memories. We didn't grow up with the stuff they have now. So, while it's nice stuff, it's just that: Stuff. I don't need more stuff. I have no place to put their stuff. I can't afford to store their stuff. It points to the whole issue of materialism. What is the point? One day you're going to die, and someone else will have to deal with all the stuff you collected.
