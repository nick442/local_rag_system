I suspect that the new VATMOSS rules come in to play here. So you owe VAT for donations from EU countries, providing you are below Â£81k there would be no UK vat payable though, however then you couldn't recoup the vat you paid out. Note I am not an accountant but I did speak to one this week about a similar issue.
