Finance..there aren't really entry level jobs in economics. Of course people get jobs as econ majors but real economists only get hired at the senior (phd) level to implement a strategy that they studied in academia. Finance gives you a better understanding of financial statements and operations. Kansas may lack financial career opportunities and on campus recruiting.
