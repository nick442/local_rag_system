#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; [**Siberia Airlines Flight 1812**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia%20Airlines%20Flight%201812): [](#sfw) --- >__[Siberia Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S7_Airlines) Flight 1812__ was a commercial flight shot down by the Ukrainian military over the [Black Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea) on 4 October 2001, en route from [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv), [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) to [Novosibirsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk), Russia. The plane, a [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet)-made [Tupolev Tu-154](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-154), carried an estimated 66 passengers and 12 crew members. Most of the passengers were [Israelis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis) visiting relatives in Russia. No one on board survived. The crash site is some 190 km west-southwest of the Black Sea resort of [Sochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi) and 140 km north of the Turkish coastal town of [Fatsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatsa) and 350 km south-southeast of [Feodosiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feodosiya) in [Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea). Ukraine eventually admitted that the disaster was probably caused by an errant missile fired by its armed forces. Ukraine ended up paying $15 million to surviving family members of 78 victims ($200,000 per victim). >==== >[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/77HfnX0.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tupolev_Tu-154M,_Siberia_Airlines_AN0558517.jpg) --- ^Interesting: [^List ^of ^airliner ^shootdown ^incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airliner_shootdown_incidents) ^| [^S7 ^Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S7_Airlines) ^| [^List ^of ^accidents ^and ^incidents ^involving ^commercial ^aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft) ^| [^Aviation ^safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjmknah) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjmknah)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
