I'm not surprised after shopping there. The items don't feel like they are of any higher quality than say Adidas or Nike, and they feel really overpriced. I didn't think the styles were great in terms of looks, and the clothes didn't seem to fit well for me(wider and loose). If it wasn't for a gift card and a 40 off 100 code, I would never have bought anything.
