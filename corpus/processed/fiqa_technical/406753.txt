I disagree. 100k in the bay area is a fair wage for a full time career, my household income is higher than that and i still am not comfortable. The OT and benefits could be looked at but really this guy seems to have accrued the majority of OT available, or at least that is what the articles lead me to believe. 20 dollars an hour is laughable, nearly criminal in fact. Am i supposed to laud a giant private corporations business practices? I'm not even sure you are correct there either. I am pretty sure facebook pays their support pretty well, but i could be wrong in this specific case. Wages and COL are a problem in this area. The janitor should be the rule, not the exception. We should be working to get everyone a fair wage instead of tearing each other down. What seems to happen is that instead of funding our vital infrastructure( bart and California's 60 billion dollar backlog in highway maintenance) we focus on op-eds that castigate an edge case janitor who happened to work the system.
