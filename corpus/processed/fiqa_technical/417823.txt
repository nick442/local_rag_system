This is a good thing. This person is a parasite. I don't mean that metaphorically. I mean he fits the dictionary definition of a parasite, the same way a tapeworm does. His host organism is the healthy and vibrant society of the United States, and its people, who do work that creates enormous economic value. Like a tapeworm, he has insinuated himself into the body of the organism, and removes whatever resources he feels like taking. There is absolutely no reason why David Siegel, or any other parasite, deserves to make his outlandish gains at the expense of their host organism. *Of course* the parasite's philosophy is that it worked hard to establish its privileged place within the host body, and it is *morally wrong* for the host to try to starve it of resources. But that philosophy does not translate to the host. If you have a tapeworm, you get it removed. It's not your problem if the tapeworm dies, because you never agreed to let it inhabit your gut in the first place. *Of course* a tapeworm, if it can, will find ways to make sure that extraction kills the host, in the hope that the host will simply allow the present state of affairs to continue. But again, there is no reason why the host should agree to this. And so, when your tapeworm writes you a letter demanding that you cease a particular course of action, the only thing that could possibly mean is that you should *pursue* that course of action, stronger and harder, because clearly it is *working*.
