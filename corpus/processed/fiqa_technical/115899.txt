"From the perspective of a small business owner: First there are no entry level positions. There are only lower paying positions and higher paying positions. Get the idea that employers are supposed to be your post secondary education out of your mind. Replace that with working your ass off and impressing employers with your skill set. The reality is I make a hiring decision based first on these two accounting factors. #1 How much do I have to invest in this person to make them effective #2 How long until this person is covering his/her own overhead and begin to turn a profit. Then you get into ""is this person going to fit with my team"" etc. I am always going to choose the person that has the best return formula for my business. Here's a hint, it's the same formula for choosing vendors and making capital purchases. It's also the very same formula that my customers use when they consider buying from me. Even a single person in my organization that doesn't fit that formula will cost me business through the loss of customers or not getting a customer we're going after. For me it works, for candidates looking for a career guidance councilor, it does not. In the capitalist economy my job is to make sure the lights are on, the products or services are good, and your paycheck clears. If you like me doing my job, then your job is to make me more money, keep my customers happy, and bring new customers to the company. Entry level doesn't do that so there are no entry level jobs in my company."
