I didn't realize the min wage in NYC was higher than the rest of NY state. WOUld $11.50 change much, in NYC? Childcare at $400? I live in a pretty rural area where you can get an acre of land and a decent house for under $100K. To get daycare under $1000 a month you have to find someone working under the table, not registered and not paying taxes. Even then, it is $800 a month for two kids.
