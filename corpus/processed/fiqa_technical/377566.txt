Supply and demand? A bad/poor taste joke, and I agree with its lack of relevance here in this sub, but I definitely agree with it, too. If you feel bad, and have a gun easily available, it is very easy to end your life with a twitch of the finger. If you don't have a gun, it can be much harder to make a snap decision with ease of execution (no pun intended, honestly) like suicide by firearm.
