"..Tell this to a professional or let's say a consultant in the real world, and they'll shake their head and walk away, realizing your knowledge is akin to a child in this context. Equifax does not represent corporate America. It's in a heavily regulated industry and credit bureaus essentially have immunity. People scream bloody murder about enterprises like Amazon & Google taking over the world, but what they've accomplished has continually added more value to the end customer. Why? Because they have to continue to server their customers better as there's plenty of competitive forces to continue motivating them to do better. There's quite a few reasons why CEOs ""step down"" or ""retire"" when the intention is not much different than firing. For one, CEOs are under contracts generally, and those contracts present a lot of legal risk that can backfire. If the CEO isn't too happy and feels a grudge, he can bring a lawsuit that brings more public embarrassment, gets messy, and even if the company has the stronger case, it doesn't just get resolved easily. So study why they're labeled as ""retirements"" to understand what needs to be fixed instead of whining corporate America is evil and doesn't give a shit. Everyone gives a shit about surviving."
