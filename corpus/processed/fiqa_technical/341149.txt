I can't tell if it's very clever marketing or very foolish; I'd settle on a combination, especially since the former chief executive admitted that it is due to cases like this, where people were encouraged to live beyond their means, that took a needle to the property bubble in 2008. It's quite dangerous, as you say, to present adverts as news. What's slightly more insidious in my eyes is in the way in which it's presented as a blog piece, which comes with connotations of informality and honesty, constructed to leave a feel-good affect on the reader. The advert seems to have struck a chord with a lot of people, who were very vocal in their disappointment. Critiques of the article were leads in two of Ireland's biggest newspapers, The Irish Times and the Irish Independent. Either way it's great publicity for Bank of Ireland, I guess.
