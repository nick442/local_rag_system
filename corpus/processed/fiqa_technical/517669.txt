"I cannot stand TV commercials.. If you take a basic lesson on advertisement tactics, then you learn how humans are predisposed to certain things, and that these things are used by advertisements to manipulate human emotion and attention. These ""things"" being: * humor * catchyness/rhyming * repetition * emotion * a ton of other ones(patriotism, testimonial, bandwagon, generalities, etc.) Now, when you aren't consciously thinking about these things, its a non-issue. You might laugh at the commercial, or hum along to the song, whatever. But when you are consciously aware that these tactics are being used to manipulate you as a consumer.. quite frankly, it just annoys the hell out of you. It's like having a dead pixel on your brand new LCD screen. When you don't notice it, all is well, when you see it; it cannot be unseen. There is another thing that is becoming more prevalent in advertisements that I have not really seen addressed at all.. how should I describe it..""Anti-Reality"". I think this is the most disconcerting aspect of them all. When you read a comic book or watch a superhero movie, you see Superman flying around and it is just totally natural and acceptable. I don't think there is anything wrong with that, it is entertainment. But watch these commercials, *and pay attention*. You will see the most unrealistic, fantastical, embellished nonsense that you could ever imagine. Even in the most basic commercials for the most mundane product. The thing is, you will not even think twice about the absurdity of what you are watching until someone points it out to you. For the average Joe who is watching 5 hours of TV a day, every day, literally watching tens of thousands of commercials a week, for years!.. I honestly question if they can distinguish that the absurd shit they see in commercials IS NOT REALITY."
