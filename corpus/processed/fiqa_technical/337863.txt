"It won't hurt your credit score, but it may hurt your ChexSystems score. ChexSystems is another consumer reporting agency that doesn't keep track of your debts, but of your bank accounts. Banks (most but not all) check ChexSystems before you open an account to see if you bounce checks, overdraft, make a lot of teller visits, lose ATM cards, etc. They use this to estimate your profitability. Banks aren't allowed to discriminate against a protected class, but ""unprofitable"" is not a protected class. BTW, most banks don't make much money on checking accounts; they view them as ""get-you-in-the-door"" inducements so they can sell you the things they really want to like mortgages and investments."
