whenever these securities are bought by the govt, they are retired. Treasury sells bonds to the private sector market, if the central bank buys them back from the private sector market, then they are retired. Treasury no longer are beholden to them. When central bank buys toxic mortgages bonds, they bought only enough to ensure stability and trust again in the banking system. The homeowners mortgages should be forgiven since the US govt bought them, but, since we don't know who owns what due to mixing of the MBS and grading them triple A etc., and the MERS program is such a mess, then it's up to the individual homeowners to fight in the courts that they should be absolved of the mortgage. For the homeowners that don't have money to pay lawyers, then they gets foreclosed upon.
