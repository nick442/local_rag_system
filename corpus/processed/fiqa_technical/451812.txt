"In the United States, copyrights are [automatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#Copyright_notices_in_the_United_States). If you are the first to publish your name and logo, they're yours. All done. If you want to be official you can use the little Â© and the year, but it is unnecessary. If you want better protection, you can register for a trademark with the [United States Patent and Trademark Office](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/). There are probably ""sites"" that will help you do this, but I would get a real attorney if it's that important to you."
