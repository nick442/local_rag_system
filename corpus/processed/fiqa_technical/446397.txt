"Do you not understand my example at all? You are better off having an $8M open position (by not selling) than $6.67M in cash (by selling). It's literally as simple as 8M > 6.67M. And before someone argues that ""you will eventually have to sell the 8M open position, at which point it'll be worth only ~5M after taxes"" - no, you don't necessarily ""have"" to sell it. You can keep it forever and live off the dividends, or by borrowing against it, or you can pass it onto heirs in a tax-free or at least more tax efficient way, etc."
