Oh please. Now the political effluvium of the PRC is news. The CPC is using an outdated measure of rural daily earnings to define poverty which is ridiculous in modern Chinese cities which are comparatively expensive. All you need to know is that inequality is soaring in Chinese cities. And the ability of the urban poor to afford basic necessities - despite having incomes that exceed the poverty minimum - has collapsed. You can't simultaneously have inflation and an inflexible poverty line and achieve a meaningful measure of poverty.
