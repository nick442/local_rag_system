> I wish I had sufficient funds to open a brokerage account at FB's IPO. I wanted to shortsell the stock with every fiber of my being once I saw that imaginary $38 price valuation. It would've been impossible anyways, no shares were available. It took me over a week to find some shares to short ( at $29.50 )
