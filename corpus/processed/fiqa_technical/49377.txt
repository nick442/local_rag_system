Hard for me to compare, never having taught anywhere else. I do think it has become a lot more structured over the past decade or so, but there is nothing like the horror stories I hear out the the states (e.g. pay/bonuses tied to performance reviews and/or test scores). All public system teachers are unionized here, so that helps a great deal.
