Did you read yellowoftops' comment? He is saying just bypass the visa investment entirely, take direct responsibility and invest directly in educating domestic workers. And why can't they take current subordinate workers in their company and train *them*? They don't *need* those workers now, because they're clearly getting along just fine *right now without them*. It's just something they *want*, i.e. instant gratification.
