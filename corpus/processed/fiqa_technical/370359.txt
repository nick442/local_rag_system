WTF? How the heck is the truth a strawman? Where I live Walmart is about the best low skill employer. And, what is wrong with a business about making money. No one will setup a business, take risks, put in the work to get it started, and make investments without making money as their main goal. Otherwise you are setting up a charity. The links were all relevant. Walmart is a better place to work than Target and pays better. If you look at some of my other comments I have a lot more sources. The high paying selective retailers such as Trader Joe's and Costco have a different cost structure due to having many less SKU's, and only being in areas with relatively high disposable income, among other things. Those are facts. Not strawmen. And, if you think Walmart makes too much per employee and needs to do redistribution (they do have profit sharing too), then shouldn't Costco pay their employees even more, as their profit per employee is much higher, or are you being a hypocrite?
