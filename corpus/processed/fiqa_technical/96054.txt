The article paints a picture that COSTO pays well above minimum wage. Making it sound as if they intentionally pay this wage to help the working man who needs a livable wage, which is a hot topic these days. When in fact, it has NOTHING to do with helping people and everything to do with just good smart business. More with less. It's a spin piece. That's all. Personally, I have nothing against COSTCO and appreciate the model of their store.
