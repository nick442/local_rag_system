They're surprisingly good. But I wouldn't go there for a regular hamburger, there's nothing particularly special about their beef. Their catch is they serve things like Buffalo, Wild Boar and Elk. Buffalo is actually delicious and less fattening than beef. That's what I go there for. This all being said it's still a fast food burger.
