This is spot on. For years Ireland has been taking flack from all around the world about their 12.5% tax rate but when you take into account all the deductibles and special arrangements other places have they're not too much higher than Ireland. Just Ireland is more transparent, it's the same tax rate for everyone and compliance work such as audit is cheaper.
