Start with Economics, macro and micro. You don't need to go deep enough to understand heavy math stuff like isoquants, but supply and demand curves and market theory in general is the foundation of business (at least capitalism). Plenty of online videos can provide overviews on this stuff. From there, management theories and practices will get the most bang for your buck since it can be applied to every aspect of business. Strategic Management tools like SWOT analysis or SMART criteria may not exactly be cutting edge management tools, but they provide a good overview of what is important to managers. On the financial side of things, look into financial management, however I kind of feel like the main important takeaway for non-finance people to know is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. IMO, these are the core theory stuff for business majors. After that, the specialization is up to you. Marketing, finance, accounting, operations, decision sciences, etc.
