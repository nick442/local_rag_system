I'm not a big fan of tax-advantaged retirement accounts. The rules on tax-advantages accounts can change at any time. It's already painful to get money out before retirement (earnings or possibly contributions taxed as current income, plus 10% penalty). The rules could get worse. There's also the assumption that your taxes will be lower when you retire. I think this is a poor assumption. If you get free money from your employer for contribution to a 401(k), contribute up to what will get you all of the free money you can. Otherwise, pay your taxes and keep control of your assets. So short answer: Keep as much as you can out of tax-advantaged accounts unless you're turning down free money to do so.
