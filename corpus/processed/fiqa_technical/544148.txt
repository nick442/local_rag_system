"Sounds like he might be a good resource. Even if school doesn't start soon, start learning. It's a competitive field because the people in it are driven, so you should be too. There's a ton of books out there, and the more you know the easier it will be to figure out the path you want to go down; or if it's even something you want to pursue. A few books on kindle are a hell of a lot cheaper than college is, and in my opinion college is a lot easier when you have a set goal instead of a ""maybe this could be for me"" attitude."
