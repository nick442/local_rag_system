"By issuing additional equity. In this case, the pie isn't ""fixed,"" it's getting bigger. Now, to avoid lawsuits and other potential issues (some of which may be unavoidable), the owner will likely need to subscribe for additional equity himself. Example: 100 shares outstanding. 51 to owner, 49 to 2 others. That 49 will have to equal 20%, as none of their shares are being sold (likely). This means total shares will need to be increased to 245. Subtract 49 from that number: 196 Marcus gets half of that at a determined price. 98 Owner must increase his stake from 51 to 98 shares. To do so, he'll need to contribute additional cash for the same price Marcus gets in on. That could be expensive."
