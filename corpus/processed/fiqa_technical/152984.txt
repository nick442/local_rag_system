How do you mean? If you have a list of targeted customers that your sales people are calling from then you would preferably use some kind dialer software (in my opinion a software that don't call for you). If you call customers that don't want to be called again then don't call them offering this offer. Many customers get approached by many sales people so they often forget who called and when if you haven't come so far that could give the customer a fair explanation of your offer. Whait a month or two and try again. Have I understood your question right?
