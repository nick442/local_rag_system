I know other people are chiming in on their opinion of best screens but here's mine: HTC One X/EVO 4G LTE/(Windows)8X. Best screen, hands down. To answer your question about how it's better than others, including Samsung, is the software. The engine that produces the color and also the type of screen. Samsung chose a different screen on the S3. It's a larger phone, so the costs may have been higher to go with a non-PenTile type screen and therefore the density of the pixels suffers. Then again, it's still a great screen, in my opinion. Makes me wonder what the next step is.
