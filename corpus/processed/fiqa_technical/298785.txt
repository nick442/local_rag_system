"I apologize for not investigating the skeezy world of finance more than I have to, but the major banks invented derivatives that allow them to essentially make a ""bet"" on whether a company will perform well or poorly. This then allows them to make a shitload of cash by manipulating the market in their favor unfairly and that is wrong. That is my argument, if you want to get caught up in the semantics of acronyms be my guest but my argument is very real and shared by many so the real question is why are you so blind to the chicanery of major financial institutions?"
