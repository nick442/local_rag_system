"I believe you are missing a complete aspect of figuring out price points. You completely disregarded how price affects ""perceived quality"". People generally assume that higher price means higher quality. Pricing too low will give many people the impression that at that price it couldn't be very good, and don't buy the product as a result. Crown Royal became Crown Royal after being a mediocre brand. They didn't change the way they made whiskey, instead they raised the price by 400%. Now it was viewed as a premium product, simply because of it's price. While I don't want to knock your view of Tycoon games, but it's just a game with one point of view. It's not the real world. It's just what a programmer thought would make the game interesting. I sure wouldn't consider it to be some source of great business wisdom. Look at what really happens taking video game consoles and games as an example. They start at a high price point. This makes it prestigious to own. When that price point becomes saturated, meaning everyone that is going to buy at the price already has, they lower the price a little and do the same. Then when everyone that can afford that price has bought one they lower it again. Eventually it gets to a point where almost anyone can afford. This style taps the market for every price point and is much better model than the one you suggest. There are many things that use this model, like car sales. The end of a model year is the time to buy because everyone that was willing to pay the full price already had and they need to move them off the lot to make room for new cars that will have a higher price point. So I don't buy into your theory at all. EDIT: Grammatical error."
