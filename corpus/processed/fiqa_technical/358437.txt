You are implicitly making that assumption. It doesn't matter if the rich are taking and increasingly large percentage of the pie, as long as the size of the pie is growing fast enough that the absolute wealth of the poor is rising at a reasonable rate over time. The correct and reasonable measure is to compare the wealth of the poor, today with the wealth of the poor in the past in terms of real buying power. I understand what you're saying and I disagree with your analysis. I disagree that relative proportions have any meaningful impact of human well being.
