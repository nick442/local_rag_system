"This guy said something like ""I won't hire AND I might lay people off AND I might close down shop if any taxes go up."" That is nonsense. There is a level of burden at which a given business will fold. There is no currently healthy business is at the point where one additional penny of taxes will cause them to close their doors. Either this guy is making future excuses for a problem he already has but hasn't announced, or he's being overly ridiculous to make a political point. Either move is shady. That being said, I agree with your assessment 100%. Burden impacts investment."
