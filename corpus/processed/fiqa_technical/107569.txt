">Chesnais declined to describe a lot of details about the console. But he said it is based on PC technology. He said Atari is still working on the design and will reveal it at a later date. As someone who owned a Alienware Alpha ""Steambox"", I will say if Atari manages to create a low cost, PC based ""game console"" so people can play PC games in a home theater environment, and make it so simple it's just like using a PS4 or XBOX, then I think they stand a good chance at having something."
