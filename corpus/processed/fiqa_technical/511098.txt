It benefits society to have many well educated young people. As a society we should be encouraging people to reproduce responsibly and then it is our responsibly as a collective society to aid families in their goal to produce productive members of society. Our goal should be to eliminate poverty since those who are poor end up costing society money. Preventing the conditions associated with poverty by providing at least subsistence care will save money in the long run and produce economic activity. We should not be encouraging the cycle of poverty by abandoning those currently impoverished.
