My Google Home does a good job of recognizing my voice and using guest mode for other people using it but you made a fair point about controlling connected home devices - I wouldn't use a voice authenticated door lock. But I don't see any evidence that my data over at Google or Amazon is vulnerable. Sure, there's some exposure and risk I have to accept but to argue that it's unsecured and that someone could get unauthorized access to it is extremely presumptuous.
