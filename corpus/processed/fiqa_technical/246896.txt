There is no central government signature database. (at least not in the US, and at least not yet) For debit and credit card transactions, the merchant may check the signature on your reciept against the signature on back of the card. This is intended to verify that you didn't steal the card. So, if you want to change the signature on the back of the card, all you need to do is get a new card and re-sign it. Your card has an expiration date. When that happens, you will get a new card to re-sign. If your card expires soon, you can just wait. If you are impatient, you can call your bank and ask for a new card. If they give you a lot of grief about issuing a new card (it is an unusual request), you can tell them you lost your card and need a new one. In that case they will typically disable the old card and issue a new one with a new account number. Note that if you want to change how you sign your name, there are some other places you should also update: Also, keep in mind that people's signatures naturally drift over time. This fact is generally understood and accepted by people who check signatures.
