"Why is this even on the table? It's effectively a **revenue neurtral** proposal! You still pay taxes on ""tax deferred"" retirement plans - In fact, I would dare say that in most cases, people end up paying **more** in taxes, because they pay it as regular income rather than LTCG. The poor will still eat cat food and live on SSI; the rich consider what $18k/year would get them as a laughable pittance (and I say that as someone who *doesn't* grudge them their wealth). This will *only* have the effect of fucking the middle class. There is absolutely no other possible interpretation."
