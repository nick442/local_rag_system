Actually, yes, I do think it's fair. It's a corporation, not a family. I think *individuals* should pay 50% of every dollar above $5m. That means every dollar; personal income, capital gains, interest, whatever. My **only** problem with taxes is how poorly I think they're spent right now. Giving more money to worthless corporate whores (congress) who've already proven they don't have the people's interests at heart is not a concept I relish. One thing at a time though.
