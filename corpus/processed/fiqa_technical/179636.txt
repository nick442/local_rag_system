"I was paraphrasing the latter from memory it's actually [""Jesus Christ Lawn Service & Landscaping""](http://i.imgur.com/GmVZh.jpg), my bad. I saw the ""His Lord Pest Removal"" on the side of a pickup truck, didn't get a photo, unfortunately. Google tells me the business exists, it's actually ""His Pest Removal"" and the religious part was implied in their logo, it's been a few years but I think it was some variation on a crucifix. Plenty of others like that around here, exploiting faith shamelessly for personal profit."
