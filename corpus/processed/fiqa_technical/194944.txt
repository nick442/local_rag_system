"From the card issuer's point of view, the purpose of balance transfers is very simple. A credit card company wants you to owe them more money, so they will make more profit getting more interest payments from you. To do that, they will offer an (apparently) good deal to transfer the debt that you owe to other companies onto their card. The deal may superficially look good to you, because it offers a low interest rate for a limited time period, etc. But never forget that its real purpose is to be a good deal for the card company, not for you. Of course, credit card companies target these deals at their ""typical"" customers. They have to tolerate a few ""smart"" customers who actually make them no money at all, by always paying off their card balance before any interest is due, never using their card to draw cash from an ATM (which has no interest-free loan period), never using their card for overseas transactions that incur fees and/or poor currency exchange rates, etc. Your financial objective should be to make yourself one of the customers the card company doesn't want - but ""only paying off the minimum balance every month"" is exactly the wrong way to do that!"
