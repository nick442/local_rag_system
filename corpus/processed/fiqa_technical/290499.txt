Here's a pretty comprehensive data source on immigration trends: http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2017_migr_outlook-2017-en#.WazX28aB2gA#page18 On page 18 there's a table when you can compare the net immigration flows to the EU and to the US. The EU net immigration annually is roughly double that of immigration to the US. For people of immigration origin the US has more; EU figure is 35M.

The structure of the US service economy cannot be explained with supply of work force.
