"I'm not a socialist. I'm someone who wants people to actually give a crap about each other, rather than trying to ""get as much as they can"" out of the other guy. I believe Capitalism has great strengths, and Socialism does as well. And they both have great weaknesses. And our current ""discourses"" refuse to recognize both the strengths and weaknesses at the same time, refuse to look for a better way, if it isn't the way they already decided was right, and are more than willing to anything they can to trash their competition. That isn't how you solve problems, and isn't how we can ""Make America Great Again."" It's ridiculous and infantile. The best I can do (right now) is reveal the falsehoods when I see them advertised, and hope people see. Maybe help people come up with better ideas, like smoothly sliding rather than tiered taxes, and recognizing big money needs to bear big loads, just like the strong need to lift heavy weights, the smart need to delve into the difficult problems, and the caring need to show people care when they need it. And they should also be rewarded for their efforts. Just not the way we do things right now, where money trumps all."
