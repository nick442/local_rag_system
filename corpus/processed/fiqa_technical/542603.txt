Wrigley may or may not be a big client. Losing that one customer is not gonna really affect TMobile. Lets get to the root issues. Lets pretend TMobile (or any company) actually did try to solve every problem. Thats gonna cost way to much money. Its not practical. We do not live in a marketplace that allows people to make excess profits to allow for great service unless someone is a sort-of monopoly like Apple or Microsoft or OPEC. Companies have no choice but to squeeze costs and at the end of the day if they lose an account like Wrigley who cares? TMobile will win an account that Verizon loses due to shitty service.
