I hate to say it but it sounds like Chase sent the money to the right account, but you entered the wrong number. I'm not terribly well versed in Chase's terms of service but I'd say you're probably on your own. With that said, the person who received the money has done nothing for it and legally should return it. Obviously it's difficult to trace a phone number to a name and/or address but if you were able to match the person I'd imagine a stern letter on a legal letter head would be enough to have the person return the money.
