Why not open an USD account or subaccount in Czechia and then transfer the money using an UAE bank that supports transfers in USD. If you don't want to open an USD account in Czechia, it'll get converted when received there into the currency of your account but at their conversion rate which probably isn't good. Alternatively, use Transferwise which might or might not be cheaper.
