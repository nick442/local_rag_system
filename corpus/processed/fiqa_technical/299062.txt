"why do markets sometimes appear in sync, but during other times, not so much By ""markets"" I'm assuming you mean equity indices such as the HSI. Financial products fluctuate with respect to the supply/demand of the traders. There's been a large increase in the number of hedge funds, prop desks who trade relative values between financial products, that partially explains why these products seem to pick up ""sync"" when they get out of line for a while."
