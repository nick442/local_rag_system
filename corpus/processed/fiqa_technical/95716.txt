I don't believe that I said climate change is a hoax in my comment and besides climate change has been occurring throughout the entire history of the earth. Also I never said that anyone who disagrees with Trump is anti-American but if they actually cared about helping the country they would stay on the board and continue to fight for what they believe not just run and pout when they don't get their way.
