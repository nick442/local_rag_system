> Not everyone has the ability to eat the refund losses that Amazon does. Why is this Amazon's problem? Those sellers are free to take their business to Ebay or anywhere else they can sell things. Amazon is trying to set a standard for their own marketplace, which seems perfectly reasonable (assuming they are not identified as a monopoly across the marketplace). Personally, I've avoided those sellers on Amazon because I know I don't get the same level of service I expect from Amazon (fantastic), so now they'll see more business from me.
