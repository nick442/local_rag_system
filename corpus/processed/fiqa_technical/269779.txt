my nine year old will pretty much have a tantrum if told he has to eat there (usually only at the airport for breakfast). He was iffy on the whole concept until one day when i got him a pancake sausage muffin breakfast thingy.. it sealed the deal. He wouldn't even go for the lego movie themed cups after that.
