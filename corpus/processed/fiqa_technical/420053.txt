"The business community is not investing, but the government is spending, said Peter Schiff, chief executive of investment firm Euro Pacific Capital Inc. ""When you break it down, the lion's share of the growth is coming from government spending."" Government spending increased 9.6% in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, the first such increase since 2010. The driver was federal defense spending, which was up 13%, the biggest jump since the second quarter of 2009. http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-gdp-economic-growth-20121027,0,1713240.story"
