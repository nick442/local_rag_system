"Since you have emphasized that you don't mind about variability, and that you have other funds you could liquidate, then I think a solution is to do with this money the same thing that you are already doing with those other funds. Then when you need the money, if the market has gone up sell the lots that were part of your original ""other funds"", which presumably have aged enough to qualify for long term gains rates, and let the newly purchased shares take their place."
