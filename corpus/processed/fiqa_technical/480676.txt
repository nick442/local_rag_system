A solution to this is the person charges their car at work. It's not a solution for every person that you described. Another option is for the person to charge their vehicle while shopping for groceries using the fast charge station. I imagine most city dwellers or folks living in the inner suburbs have short commutes, 5-10 miles (a guess), that's a max of 200 miles for the work week; easily covered by the Tesla and Bolt.
