First a couple of quick points. Many people have an IRA (of any type) and a 401K. Over your professional career, the retirement packages for every employer will be different. For this year you don't need to decide on the Roth or not until April 15th. You will be able to put 2014 money into the account as late as April 15th 2015. You will have a better understanding of your job situation at that time. It is possible that your post-graduation employer doesn't offer 401K matching, or has high expense funds only, or has no 401k. Don't worry about retirement funds and dividend season. Yes if you invest right before the mutual fund issues the end of year dividend the price per share will go down. But in the retirement account you should just allow it to repurchase shares. In a non-retirement account the dividend would be a taxable event, which means you will end up sending money to the IRS. The retirement account avoids this issue.
