Their policy is only one parent (regardless of where the other parent works) may take the full 16 weeks. And they look it up to make sure the mother is working if the father takes full parental leave. Same goes towards women, too. If the father works elsewhere, the mother can only take leave if the father doesn't regardless of the fathers work policy. It's bullshit.
