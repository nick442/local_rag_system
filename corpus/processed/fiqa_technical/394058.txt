Yes, I'm from NJ, and know people who attended Curtis as well as Julliard. Julliard students are elite, I get it. My point really was that I don't eliminate someone from consideration based on a degree, or even the school they attended (baseline being an accredited school in a recognized major). In fact, for a C-level position, I would be interested in them having business/legal chops *and* deep understanding of technologies critical to the line of business. Regarding UGA.. I'm a Georgia Tech guy and my daughter is a graduate, so in this case she would have to overcome the stigma of attending UGA.
