"I was involved with them a couple years back. It seemed like a utopia but I couldn't seem to get it off the ground. I just recently found some disturbing info on the top tier of leaders that kindve let me breath a sigh of relief that I am no longer involved. Although I wouldn't straight up tell you no. I would ask that you really use some due diligence and make a very informed decision. Look up Amthrax in Google and jist browse there. Quite a few people that were ""successful"" had defected and don't have very good things to say. So it's not shallow criticism they're dishing out. Quite a few of them were high enough up the ladder that I had even seen them do open meetings and seminars."
