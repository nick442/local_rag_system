I work for UPS, and I am one in the small minority of 70,000 who will be affected by this. I'm looking for any advice or comments about what I can do, how I might protect what I am owed? Not having a union to represent us has caused huge blow backs for admin/techs/specialist these past 8 to 10 years!
