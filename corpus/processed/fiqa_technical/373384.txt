stopit and I are very happy to vote for Romney. Its pathetic how the political narrative has gotten in this country and all the undue shit the job creators have received in this country. Judging by stopit's comment, its safe to say that he supports more tax breaks for the wealthy because they desperately need it. If there is less demand and less people aren't buying things because they are lazy fuck ups and couldn't keep their jobs or their home, or refuse to pay for medical insurance and go bankrupt as a result and keep having children they can't afford then the rich need all the help they can get because no one, NO RED BLOODED AMERICAN, wants to see their wealth get reduced or leave to another country. DON'T LET THEM GO GALT. Please vote Romney.
