>If businesses cannot turn a profit while paying for a healthy minimum wage, they are bad for the economy and deserve to die. Tell that to all the minimum wage workers that would lose their jobs and deny most of them the ability to get back on the jobs ladder at all. Also tell that to the taxpayers that now have to pay 100% of their social burden, instead of maybe 20% in the minimum wage job situation. The sentiment you express is absolute, unabashed economic violence against the poor and the taxpayer. Both lose in your proposal. You should be ashamed of yourself.
