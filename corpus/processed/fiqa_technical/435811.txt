Naturally none of them *suit* me. If I was in a situation like that, I'd probably calmly stand up for myself, maybe talk to HR. I would like to point out that (a) I make a point of getting explicit instructions, (b) I'm good about making sure people know well in advance when I'm going to be out (c) I'm salaried, I don't have a time sheet, and if the boss didn't mention the missing time, I would, and (d) there's only one other person there who knows anything about web programming, and she's my assistant. I can accept a certain amount of abuse *if* the pay is good enough and I have recourses. If not, lets just say that the recruitment company I was with took all of two weeks to find me this job after I was let go from the last one (and not because my previous bosses didn't like me either, but because they couldn't afford me any more. They kept me on as a contractor until I found this job)
