It will not hurt your score to pay off your debt. It will allow your score to start healing as you plug the holes in your report. What is CRUCIAL is how you pay off the debt. Make sure you get, in writing, that paying $X amount will fully satisfy the debt and will close the matter as in Pay-To-Delete. If you try to do a settlement, this is very important. Also, the moral brigade will not like my answer, but if you are close to seven years out on your debts, you might as well not pay them since they will fall off of your report after 7 years. If you pay any part of the debt however, it will often reset the clock on those 7 years, so tread carefully.
