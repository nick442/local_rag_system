Went to Chipotle last night purely because my wife wanted to try the queso - it's awful. It's incredibly grainy/floury, like a bad roux, kinda turned our stomachs. Missed the mark on flavor too, completely bland. Chipotle guacamole is delicious, the $2 queso isn't in the same realm. Also I really enjoyed their chorizo. :(
