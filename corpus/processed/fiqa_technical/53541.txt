18% top line growth, and a resulting 22% increase in their bottom line (on a GAAP basis). Annualized revenues come in at $13.6b - assuming no seasonality in the summer months and stagnant growth. This gives us an implied valuation multiple of ~5x estimated annual revenues, which, for a tech company blasting in popularity, isn't the worst we've seen in this environment. I don't have enough details of what volume stock comp, scaling/infrastructure costs, and professional fees are driving the loss. Maybe their cash flows from operations are solid, maybe not. Regardless, the top line growth and operating leverage are impressive. My two cents.
