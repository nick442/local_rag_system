Not all cars but just those < $25k (Skoda, Nissans, VW, Ford, Renault )!! Economic class vehicles, which basically are driven by the middle class. While elite automobiles (anything above this) and to pleasure of the oligarchs and politicians, will continue to pour in. So in the <$25k segment either Russian built or from non-sanctioned nations (S.Korea-? and China), the prices will obviously inflate dramatically with the decrease in supply. The poor and middle class are the only ones going to suffer with this. This fucking economics 101, if not common-sense ! Either they are too stupid to realize this or this is just some machiavelic plan !! edit: [В Госдуме сообщили о возможном запрете на ввоз авто дешевле 800 тысяч рублей](http://lenta.ru/news/2014/08/19/avto/) -- The State Duma has reported a possible ban on the import of cheaper car 800 thousand rubles
