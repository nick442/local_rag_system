"Given that they're going to be defended by VERY good lawyers, yes. You have to continually prove your need for a wiretap and make sure you don't get non-invasive information that doesn't pertain to the case. If they were caught recording people who are uninvolved having phone sex, they could lose some of their wiretaps, or possibly all of them depending on the frequency of non-related calls and how many they kept. In short, you have to guess as to who is involved and be RIGHT. Then, you can only record and keep conversations that are pertinant to the case. This is also how Blagoivich tried to plead when faced with his own calls. He said there were other calls and information that somehow turned ""They want me to just give away this fucking senate seat??!?"" into ""Well, the next call I said, 'America needs a good senator, I will make sure the candidate is well qualified and raised by people who will have enough influence and respect as well as IL interests at heart' I would never give it away just because someone gave me the most money"". Or that some of the calls he was ""just kidding"" or ""blowing off steam"". In most not-so-public cases this shit actually works if you have a good lawyer. You can legally say almost anything you want including ""I stole a million dollars"" and have it on tape without it immediately resulting in your ass being in jail. I think this stems from the fact communication with other humans generally sucks and that in some rare instances they didn't actually steal a million dollars, they just got lucky and it felt like stealing."
