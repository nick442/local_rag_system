"I agree with you the practical knowledge and experience is way more important than a piece of paper. Bill Gates did not need to finish college to do what he did. Check many many extremely successful people and how much college they had. But ""faking"" that you have a degree is not a good idea. Confronting HR that you deserve the position and promotion despite lack of diplomas is a better way."
