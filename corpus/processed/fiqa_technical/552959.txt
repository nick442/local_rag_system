Just to stand up for Microsoft a little bit, their Zune players were fantastic. I still use mine in my car. More durable than iPods, better looking design (not counting the 1st gen), and their music service was ahead of it's time. Unfortunately the device was a little late to the game. Zune launched when phones were taking over the music player space, and people didn't want dedicated devices for that. For their OS, the enterprise side is really what has been causing headaches for home users for a long time. The fact that many applications function on Windows 8.1 that were originally written for Windows 95/98/2000 says a lot about how committed Microsoft is to the enterprise world (the enterprise world has a hard time letting go of old software). Apple doesn't have this problem, they frequently release updates that render older applications inoperable and leave it up to the people who wrote the software to fix it. It makes their OS significantly less complicated, which reduces the issues that common users see. From an IT Professional standpoint, Apple has a ton of their own problems, especially with the enterprise, but most home users don't see that. I think your accusation of MS being complete dogshit is pretty harsh. While Windows has issues, especially at the hands of inexperienced users, it is very impressive software. Just for disclosure, I use a Macbook at work for network and datacenter related IT work, have a Windows 7 VM on that, and my home computer runs Windows 7 as well. Probably going to pass on 8, due to commonly known gripes.
