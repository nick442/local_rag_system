Yeah dumbfuck, as someone with a decade of education I think hard work and good decisions don't help with success. lol. This is where your kind just always goes off the fucking rails. You have to hyperbolize every goddamn thing to the point that you're only on the extremist edges. Ideologically based. Not data driven statistics. I think [this](https://www.mixcloud.com/rationallyspeaking/rationally-speaking-165-robert-frank-on-success-and-luck/) might get it across far better than I ever could. But seeing successful people as stubborn as you and bright hard working people struggle to get out of the gutter leaves a bad taste in ones mouth.
