If for some reason you need to replace a section of an aluminium balustrade, the material can be recycled to fabricate and fit a new panel quite easily. With aluminium balustrades you are not increasing your carbon footprint.Aluminium balustrades are ideally suited for residential buildings where the aesthetics greatly matter. In premises where safety is a concern steel balustrades are better equipped to address these issues. Swimming pool fencing, railings for staircases and balconies can be fabricated out of aluminium.
