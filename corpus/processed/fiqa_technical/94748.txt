If your tap water is terrible (very rare in the U.S.) it makes sense to buy the large water jugs. What I'm referring to is paying 1€ or more for a plastic bottle that costs .01€ to make filled with .000001€ of water. Nestle and Coco-Cola literally bottle municipal water in the United States. There is ZERO difference between most bottled water and common tap water. In fact, the water bottling plants often don't do enough maintenance on their filters and their water is actually worse than tap.. at least in the U.S.
