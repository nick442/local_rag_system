First, your references are only tangentially related to your claim. > If you have twice the generation capacity in renewables (wind/solar) and can store 20% of your yearly consumption, then you are fine. Right. If you do that, you're fine to run your hospital off-grid with no backup generators without significant risk of the life support systems going offline. The requirements for a grid-connected single family home are much lower. Generating 100% of your power needs and having one powerwall (for half a day of storage) will drastically reduce your electricity demand. Home solar doesn't need to completely replace grid power - a 70% reduction in demand would be sufficient to reduce generation requirements to only existing hydro / wind / nuclear plants.
