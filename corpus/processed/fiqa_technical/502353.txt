Yes. It's terrible with terrible advice such as insider trading. The insider trading is really the only advice that's not common knowledge such as buy assets not liabilities and pay yourself first. There is nothing in this book that would help anyone become wealthy. In fact is stated that education and savings will not make you rich. Which may be true but those two should never be discounted! This guy is a scam artist and made his millions from the book and nothing else.
