"Pretty hilarious the job you're describing sounds EXACLY like my job working in Margin Credit at a major bank. I do all the processing work, but after a few weeks of that, and saying that I was ""ready for more training"" to my supervisor, he took that as the sign to get me working on some of the smaller client accounts. Now I'm looking at accounts and issuing approvals for funds and trades (depending on how much margins hey have and other factors) Id say just approach your supervisor, tell him you're ready to move on, if they have anything for you hopefully they'll get you started. Stick with it, and don't stab yourself!"
