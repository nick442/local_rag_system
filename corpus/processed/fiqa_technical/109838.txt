Lol I'm not even talking about no government (although that's ideal) you're just retarded to think income tax is the ONLY way to fund a government. Like I said before a federal sales tax would more than suffice and in a lot of cases would work better but please by all means continue to live in ignorance. Just because things have been done a certain way for a long time doesn't mean it's the best or most efficient way.
