Forgive me if I was not clear enough. I'm saying it should never be forced on a non business entity via contract or any other means. However, it can be a valid tool between businesses, and there may be cases where it is preferable (advantageous in some way to the non business entity) to bring the case to arbitration. That is why I am hesitant to outright ban it (it be arbitration).
