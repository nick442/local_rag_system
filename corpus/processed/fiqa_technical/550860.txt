I think their problem is quality control. I'm a big fan of exactly _one_ BW3's. Because I like it so much, I try others, and am always disappointed. Dry burgers. Warmed-over wings with Wild sauce added atop whatever was there before. Brown lettuce in the salad. If the one location that I used to like to go to before moving away were the only BW3's I'd have ever visited, I'd be extolling the virtues of the chain. But God, so many of the other franchisees just can't run a restaurant.
