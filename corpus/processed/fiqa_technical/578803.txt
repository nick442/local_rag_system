That would be like requiring the IT department in you company to be self sufficient. You're IT department doesn't exist to earn a profit. It exists to enable the rest of the company to earn a profit. Your IT department runs a deficit, it sucks money from the bottom line of your company. Hopefully, it boosts other departments in your company like sales, or engineering, and enables them to make more money than IT consumes.
