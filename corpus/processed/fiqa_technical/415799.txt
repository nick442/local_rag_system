Yah, the MFE degrees can be a mixed bag. In general, these programs are improving and if you can get into a program like NYU, UCB or Carnegie Melon, then by all means I would recommend going. Your placement from an MFE program will be based on two things 1) Who your program director knows on Wall St. 2) Whether you are a foreign national. If you want to get a job in America as a MFE grad, you're facing an uphill battle compared to your American counterparts (unless you go to NYU, UCB, Carnegie Melon and maybe MIT or Chicago). If you decide to get a PhD it will be in: Physics, Math, Computer Science or Economics. Furthermore, you will pretty much be restricted to a research quant role for the duration of your career. Most of these guys end up doing experimental/cutting-edge risk analysis and derivatives pricing for the middle office. There's always exceptions to this rule; and the CS guys will largely be back-office trading system engineers. If you have interest in being a trader (the most lucrative Wall St. position outside of executives/managers) or a buy-side investment manager, then there's no need to go beyond an MSF/MSFE. At this point, it's more a matter of who you impress and who you know that will get you where you want to be. If you want to do sell-side, front office or M&A, then go get an MBA.
