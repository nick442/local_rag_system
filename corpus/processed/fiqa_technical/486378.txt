No, it's not. You need a BS and a masters to achieve a PhD. You need a bachelors to achieve a masters. When I was halfway through my bachelors, no one came and gave me an associates. When I graduated college, no one gave me a BS AND an associates. An associates' whole purpose is to show someone has achieved some college. You don't get two degrees for graduating college in its entirety. Further, if you achieve an associates and then come back some time later and finish and get your bachelors, you don't need to say you have both. It is horribly retarded.
