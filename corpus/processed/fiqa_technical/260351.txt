I will stretch out as far as I can and happily say that Justin Bieber is a singer/songwriter but one thing I will not call him is a 'Venture Capitalist'! He has an extremely smart business manager that feeds Bieber ideas. He acts on impulse because he likes something, and maybe that works out in a few cases but to be recognised as a Venture Capitalist, I think you have to have a real passion for business and investments, something I don't see in Bieber.
