Keep in mind that if you choose a loan for the boat, you may be required by the lender to maintain a minimum coverage of insurance during the term of the loan. Further, some states require you to carry some level of liability insurance on your boat, and some entities require liability insurance when using certain bodies of water within their jurisdiction. If neither apply to you, and if you could suffer the loss of the boat itself, could you similarly suffer the damages caused by your boat if you lose control? Let's say you hit a much larger, more expensive boat, or your boat breaks free from it's dock and damages the dock well beyond the cost of your boat. Are you also able to withstand these costs? If not, you may want to invest in minimum liability insurance. If, at this point, you are still convinced that you are not at financial risk due to the boat, I'd strongly suggest a plan of self insurance. Take the money you would normally spend on insurance, and invest it in low risk investments that can be liquidated in a matter of months. If you do have a problem with the boat, your risk is mitigated by the self-insurance. If you don't, then you have not only saved that money, but increased its value.
