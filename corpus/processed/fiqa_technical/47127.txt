My original point to this post was that this asset bubble is playing out in slow motion just like others have in the past. This facsimile of a recovery will bump along the bottom for years if history is a guide, eg 1934-1939. This is long term pain for the average middle class person. Underwater mortgages, stagnating wages, and here in DC, overpriced houses completely out of line with median incomes. It's been a recovery for the wealthiest in society but everyone else is sinking or treading water. Economic indicators are not a reflection of the average middle class persons struggle. Take a look at what Angela Merkel said last week to a group of Nobel winners. You are telling me that no one got a HELOC on the speculative value of their house between 2000-2007?
