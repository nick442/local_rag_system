I'm going out on a limb and calling bullshit. Here's a fact: Reddit has never turned a profit. And how will it? Unless you put up ads, or allow MANY more sponsored posts (a la Twitter), it's very difficult to see a monetization strategy for this site. Heck, most reddit users are offended at the very suggestion that reddit might be used - **gasp** to make *money.*
