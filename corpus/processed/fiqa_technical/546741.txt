The fact that you don't even know what's wrong with what you said is telling. Everything you've said screams of someone who has no understanding of the situations that I'm referencing. The advice you gave is great..for ~5% of the people in such a situation. For most people working for $8/hr, going to school, moving to a new city, missing work to go on job interviews just flat out is not an option. If you stepped out of your ivory tower once in a while, you might understand that.
