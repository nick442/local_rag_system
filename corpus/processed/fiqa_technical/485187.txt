"But you also can't use a comparison to a cell phone battery; they are not the same chemistry either despite both having ""lithium"" in the name, and EVs limit themselves to a far narrower range of charge than a cell phone does. My point was that Toyota, didn't base their longevity claims on nothing; they did a shitload of testing of their battery before putting it out, and the ""you'll need a new pack after five years"" crowd was ultimately proved wrong. GM has made similar claims about the longevity of their packs, based on similar shitloads of research and testing, and I see no reason why they won't ultimately enjoy the same vindication. As for Nissan, they are reaping the effects of cheaping out and omitting a liquid cooling system from their cars battery packs. Heat kills batteries of any chemistry!"
