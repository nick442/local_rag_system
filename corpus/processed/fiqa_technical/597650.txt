Yes. You are assuming that everything remains equal except for a decrease in revenue. More than likely what you will see happen and what is expected to happen, is a decrease in benefits along with a decrease in revenue. So rather than say, revenue of 1000 and payout of 1000, it would become something more like revenue of 750 and payout of 750, and then maybe further down the road revenue 600 and payout 600. But it is unlikely that we continue to see revenue of 750, and payout of 1000. This is a very, very simple explanation and I'm sure someone could use better numbers but I think it illustrates why we won't see social security go bankrupt
