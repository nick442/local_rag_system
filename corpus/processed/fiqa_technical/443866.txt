Batteries are very cheap.. if you have service stations to exchange them. Then, you can use much cheaper batteries that don't have such a long range. Also, with battery exchange service stations, you DO NOT pay for the batteries as part of the car. Do you realize that? You only pay for the electricity charged into the batteries.. very very cheap.
