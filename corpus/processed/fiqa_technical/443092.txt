(I'm a bot) ***** > If you have any kind of consumer loan, it&#039;s a fair bet that it&#039;s based on LIBOR. A 2009 study by the Cleveland Fed found that 60 percent of all mortgages in the U.S. were based on LIBOR. Buried somewhere in your home, you probably have a piece of paper that outlines the terms of your credit card, student loan, or auto loan, and if you peek in the fine print, you have a good chance of seeing that the rate you pay every month is based on LIBOR. Years ago, we found out that the world&#039;s biggest banks were manipulating LIBOR. That sucked. > As a few Wall Street analysts have quietly noted in the weeks since those comments, an &quot;Absence of underlying markets&quot; is a fancy way of saying that LIBOR has not been based on real trading activity, which is a fancy way of saying that LIBOR is bullshit. > So as LIBOR reflected reality less and less, it became more and more ubiquitous, burying itself, tick-like, into the core of the financial system. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6tasuo/years_ago_we_found_out_that_the_worlds_biggest/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~189474 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **LIBOR**^#1 **Bank**^#2 **market**^#3 **rate**^#4 **based**^#5"
