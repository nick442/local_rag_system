> I pay for Reddit gold because I'm on this stupid site every day so I feel I should support it. I never would have come to that decision without using the site for at least a year first. Yeah, I can relate--I feel an ethical obligation to support Reddit for the same reason, but I don't think Gold is the way to do it. Simply put, Reddit needs to fix its advertising. The targeting is shit, the performance is awful, and Reddit has been very slow to fix its ad products. Of course Reddit's audience is not particularly receptive to advertising, but it isn't unreceptive, that's for sure, especially if they do the campaign right. Reddit needs to get its real business potential figured out--if I buy them Reddit Gold before that, I feel like I'm enabling their incompetence. Maybe I'm just rationalizing my cheapness.
