You'd have to file to be incorporated (in Canada at least). It's mostly done for tax purposes. You can't just go and call yourself an corporation without filing legal papers (and be approved) with the tax agency of your country. In my experience, it'd be with the CRA. The rules at least here, there's a bunch of leeway that mostly any business can be classed as an corporation if you see fit. Hope it helps!
