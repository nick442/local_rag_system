>While I was reading the piece I thought it was the work of a sophomore, but it turns out this was written by a professor. I am not getting much from this remark. Sounds like a snarking remark slung at the author. So somophores can't write good articles? There are lots of mediocre articles out there written by accomplished individuals. It's one thing to critcize the content but it's another to criticize the author.
