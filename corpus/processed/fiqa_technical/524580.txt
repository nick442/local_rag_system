Just a note about cold callers: I own a phone which I use solely for software development purposes. It has a SIM card that I bought for Â£0.99 on eBay (needed to activate the phone). Nobody knows that there is any relationship between me and that phone or it's phone number. I have never paid any phone charges, and I cannot make phone calls with that phone. As I said, it is just used for software development purposes. I get phone calls from cold callers on that phone. Not only do they not know anything about my financial situation, they know nothing and cannot know anything about who I am. They tell me that I was recently involved in an accident and I am likely to get compensation. Yet they don't know my name, my address, anything. Lucky enough, my real business mobile phone is so far not on their radar. It is most likely that they know absolutely nothing about you, but have a lot of practice in being convincing if they get you to talk to them.
