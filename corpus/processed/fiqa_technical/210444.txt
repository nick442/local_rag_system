this article is wrong about money. govt creates money, not banks. all banks do is create ious. it's only when those ious are defaulted on then it becomes actual money. Also, fractional reserve banking is outdated and obsolete. When was the last time you hear Fed meetings that they were going to raise reserve requirements? All you hear is interest rates and QE bond buying.
