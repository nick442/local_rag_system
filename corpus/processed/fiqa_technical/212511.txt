At this point, completely useless. In the beginning it was useful to get my foot in the door. I still do the odd excel macro to automate some kind of analysis or valuation I do, but its like . twice a year. So not very useful at this point. But I'd say that university taught me how to *learn* so its not as much about what i learned, but the process of learning how to learn effectively. Without that I wouldnt have been able to do the CFA, or learn anything else that I had to in order to get here.
