"Look lets be honest here. You want certain things and you want to force other people to provide them for you against thier will. If what you want is so awesome and good how come people don't voluntarily do it? I'll tell you why, Because they are already being robbed for an ever increasing amount of their pay and effort. The slavery portion of thier cheque is consantly increasing. Stop stealing from people and forcing them to do things against their will and they may surprise you and do things for themselves and their neighbours without being forced to. Edit.Just because someone stole the money to pay for it for you does not make it free. The idea that anything is ""free"" is crazy leftwing bullshit."
