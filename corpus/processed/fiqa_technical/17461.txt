"As the other commenter pointed out, the language the NRA is using is pretty specific in who they're implying is the ""enemy"". Obama was AWESOME for gun companies. The NRA, which is a lobby started by gun companies, would say ""Quick! The boogyman is comin' fer yer Guns! Buy as much as you can NOW before it's too late!"" In business this is a scarcity tactic. It would drum up demand as well the price of current supplies. Ammo ""shortages"" work in the same way. There'd be a rumor posted somewhere that some demon-crat did something to cause a shortage in ammo. People would rush out and buy whatever they could (even if they didn't have an immediate need) and the price on ammo would go up. All the while these Yahoo's would always say ""gosh them Democrats for causing this"" even though Democrats have nothing to gain by this. All in all with Trump and the GOP at the helm, their boogyman has become more scarce and not as readily realized. So they're pushing the narrative that the existential ""liberal"" is out to get you! Honestly, we're not. If anything we just want you have free healthcare and a better education without making you go bankrupt."
