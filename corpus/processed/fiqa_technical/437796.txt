Cute conspiratorial story. A cabal of evil grocery store owners set up a sprawling and risky supply chain overseas so they can pay more for their products for the express purpose of paying their employees market wages for their labor? Grocery store workers are not underpaid. If they were, they could walk across the street and make more money at a competitor. So if the profit margins are fat on the supplier side, somehow competition would come in there either? You can't have it both ways. The vast majority of food products sold in grocery stores in North America are grown, manufactured and sold right here in North America. There's no way to explain it away - the grocery store market is viciously competitive and profit margins are slim.
