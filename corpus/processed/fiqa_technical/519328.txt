"I don't think the reason is ""to verify that it is truly me"". It should be possible for someone else (friend, relative..) to make a payment on your behalf, using their own card. It is common that ""gift cards"" are not per-authorized for ""Card Not Present"" (CNP) use like on the internet, or over the phone. In many cases, you can register your card, online or by speaking to a representative over the phone. After that, you should be able to use it to pay your phone company. Also, depending on where you got the card, you may be able to go to a teller at the issuing bank, and withdraw cash (or get a check), possibly without a fee."
