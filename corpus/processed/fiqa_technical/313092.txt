"Bitcoin will never come back down; it's a *limited commodity* that is tradable like a currency. Since it's a commodity, it will always have value and since it's a limited commodity, that value will always go up. Disclaimer: by ""come back down"" I meant back down to the $3 a coin it was at when it hit it's first spike *without* being obsoleted. Not the current $5000 shenanigans; this is just part of it's market cycle."
