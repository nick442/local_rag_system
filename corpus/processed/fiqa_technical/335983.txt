Well, it was a 3 wheeler and looked too funky for current tastes and without mandates or complete revolution in infrastructure and so forth it's sad to say it won't work here. And again, you can buy many cars that get 40+ MPG without being hybrid..when I look at the Volt I ask, why, if the avg. MPG is 42..build something more like an Accord or Civic that gets 40+ mpg.. I'm looking ahead when battery technology will make the breakthroughs for mass scale, much more durable, longer charge and life times such as this, in maybe 2017; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15735478 We just need to be patient, make heavy investment in R&D..and focus it on the areas that will make and break us.
