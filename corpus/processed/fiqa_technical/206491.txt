The market bubbled, surging after Trump's immediate election, because traders anticipated regulatory reductions (allowing companies to externalize their operating expenses) and business giveaways. Now, they're adjusting their expectations and positions, since Trump is simply not as efficient as doing the anticipated things as they would like. He's mired in scandals instead. Of course, this goes without saying, the significant growth you have referenced is not derived from Trump's actual policies. It's derived from market reactions to his take-over. It's fairly logical that an anticipated giveaway to the business sector would facilitate quick, unsustainable growth. I'm sorry you're having to reconcile that with your belief that Donald is some kind of economic wunderkind, but he's had less time to affect things than W. had before 911 and I bet you think that security failure was really attributable to Clinton.
