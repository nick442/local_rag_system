Well, that's the whole point of this issue, and why there's a debate. And concerning the Cotsco analogy, whether retail and manufacturing can be the same entity or not, and whether as a retailer you can push only your own brands, is also up for debate. It's called regulation, it's meant to prevent monopolies and cartels from forming, among other things. We've seen this happen elsewhere too (transportation, electricity, water, healthcare, etc..). Businesses *do not* have the right to do whatever they want. I also think what has not been mentionend is that internet provision is effectively a cartel in the US, with different ISPs holding monopolies in different parts of the country, which has been allowed to continue. Anyways, I'm not in the US, so I'm not affected by this (where I live has confirmed net neutrality and anti-monopoly legislation is important, and anyways there's ISP competition so this bullshit cannot be applied unless they work together) but I think if this goes through the US internet will end up even more like the US cable industry, to the detriment of users. I'm also worried about the knock on effects this will have with the rest of the World.
