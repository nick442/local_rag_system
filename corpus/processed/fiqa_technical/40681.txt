"So I've done some digging and have some new information. I looked up Beam in California's business search and found Beam Financial, registered in November of 2015 by Yinan Du, incorporated in Delaware. Searched Delaware's database and found a listing from 6/24/2014 with the agent ""National Registered Agents, Inc""--not much to go on from that. Some Google Sluething and it appears that Du was previously in charge of something called 24quan.com (not entirely sure what that business was). Still trying to figure out which bank will be covering them for FDIC and when they will launch."
