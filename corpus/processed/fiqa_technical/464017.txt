"I utopia, once issues are discovered, politicians put politics aside and work together to fix the issues as soon as possible. In reality, politicians would rather people and doctors suffer, only that their own way and only their way (party way) will be the way. So, sorry, but Trump need to ""motivate"" politicians to do something. And with a million percents certainty, this ""motivation"" method is not what Trump prefers. Actually, he said it himself: ""ObamaCare will fail on its own without me doing anything."" > ""repeal now, replace later"" This is not what Trump wants or said. But I think this is not a bad idea. If it get repealed (easy to do, in 5 minutes, if most vote for it) then it will motivate the politicians to work on a replacement, and work fast on that, with a pressure to prove that the new plan is better. > agenda which would have an immediate and dramatic impact on the well being of millions Those millions are chronically sick and are drain on the system. Many more millions have to pay much more than before, and more than it will cost them out-of-pocket. As an Israeli, and Israel as one of the best National Healthcare system in the world, I can tell you that with National Health Care, not everything is covered and some of chronically ill people do not get any and all the treatments they need. And I have no moral issues about it."
