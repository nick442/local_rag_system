I think usually the difference is between two cars that one is more expensive than the others not if some large difference. In combustion engines three options maybe a more expensive V8 or V6. So that you could be 6 I know that I'm getting a smaller motor and certain things come with that that may not be as superior to the V8. In my head, and let me stress this is just my opinion and everything else anyone else thinks it's fine, you buy a Tesla in the exact same battery assist in the more expensive model but it's wall by software It just strikes me as strange. But once again I will never own a Tesla but I'm very happy for Tesla enthusiasts and I wish Elan all the best and success. I'm just stating my opinion that I want a substantial difference in the mechanics and quality of a vehicle intangible terms and not get the same equipment walled off for Less
