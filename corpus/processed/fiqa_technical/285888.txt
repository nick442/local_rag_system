This diagram is very misleading. At first glance readers might think that the size of the bubble are the areas working class people cant afford to live in. In reality, its only cities that become too expensive for blue collars.which has always been the case. Outside of the Bay area and LA, MOST of Cali is actually cheap(er) to live in, and is comprised of many rural communities.
