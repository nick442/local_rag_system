I don't get the whole quants/hedge funds don't contribute anything to society thing. At the end of the day, they earn a return for the fund which is usually mostly pension fund or mutual fund money which funds peoples' pensions/insurance/retirement/etc. If there wasn't a demand or use for it it wouldn't be there. How much these fund charge and pay their employees is another matter..
