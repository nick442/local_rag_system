The two countries had similar [health care systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system) before Canada changed its system in the 1960s and 1970s. The United States spends much more money on health care than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP. In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US$3,678; in the U.S., US$6,714. The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on health care in that year; Canada spent 10.0%. In 2006, 70% of health care spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on health care was 23% higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government expenditure on health care was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private) though these statistics don't take into account population differences. >==== >[**Image from article**](https://i.imgur.com/TEekEH4.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_Health_Gross_Care_Expenditures_\(1960_to_2008\).png) --- ^Interesting: [^Single-payer ^health ^care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_health_care) ^| [^Patient ^Protection ^and ^Affordable ^Care ^Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act) ^| [^Health ^insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance) ^| [^Health ^care ^in ^Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Canada) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck3rrwd) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+ck3rrwd)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
