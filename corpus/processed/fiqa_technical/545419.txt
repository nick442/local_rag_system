"That's right. It is the far right that have fought Medicare and single payer health insurance from the 70s. Ronald Reagan famously recorded a LP deriding Medicare as the slippery slope to socialism. Health insurance is a tool large corporations use to #1 keep employees frightened of losing their job and #2 discouraging employees from leaving their ""organization"" and starting a small business that will compete with them. It is anything but a ""poorly"" thought out policy. If large corporations felt it was bad for business they would join the fight for single payer which would relieve them of one hell of an expense. They could save Billions! but they don't because they want it this way. It must be worth a lot of money to them."
