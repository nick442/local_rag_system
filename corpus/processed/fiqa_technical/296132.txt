"What's missing is the semiconductors part of the story. In the 80s, Motorola had a strong position as CPU manufacturer, supplying, among others, the Commodore 64's processors. Had things gone their way, they might have ended up in a position of being key supplier in the age of the desktop PC. Years later they pioneered Wireless USB technology, promising wireless data rates of 480 Mbps over distances of several meters. This also didn't take off, for various interesting reasons. After that, the semiconductors division was spun out from Motorola, and is now known as Freescale. They still make processors, being a leading supplier of ARM-based microcontrollers, a platform that is shaping up to compete with Intel's processor platforms. They also make other cool stuff, so not all is lost. It always bothers me when the semiconductors component is missing from a tech history story. Silicon Valley doesn't contain the word ""silicon"" because it was founded on software. Silicon started it all. Without hardware, software is nothing."
