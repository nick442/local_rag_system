">What? I can literally look at a list of individual salaries (I know they are self reported but nobody has a reason to lie about this) that is broken down on a year-by-year basis. The school literally gives you all of the information. How is it naive to believe its true? I'm sure this is the case at most state schools. **ALL** the information? My foot. Do you know what ""confirmation bias"" (or even more appropriately [""selection bias""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) and [""survivor bias""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)) implies? How about ""cherry picking"" of data? What about all of the graduates with X degree who are NOT working in that field? Unless you have a FULL listing of ALL previous graduates and what they ALL went on to do (and whether they succeeded or failed, an ""initial"" job is meaningless if they could not sustain a career in the field) -- or absent a full listing, at least an objective and independently derived *true* random representative sample (IOW, not just ""selection bias self-reports"") then you are getting a list of only the ""successes"".. and virtually ANY school can give you that. (Even the worst schools have an occasional graduate {or a few dozen} that go on to some significant success, even if just a few % of the alumni.)"
