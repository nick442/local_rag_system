"Nothing ""conspiratorial"" - just standard tax optimization scheme as shown by Google & Apple. > Grocery store workers are not underpaid. If they were, they could walk across the street and make more money at a competitor.

Still doesn't mean they are paying the living wage. >The vast majority of food products sold in grocery stores in North America are grown, manufactured and sold right here in North America 20% are imported. And they don't have to set up a ""supply chain"" - just the bare minimum to legally siphon funds into another company they own, be it via interest on credit, rent, intellectual property (i.e. franchise or trademark payments) or anything else."
