No. Few reasons. 1) You'll pay a penalty (tax) if you liquidate your 401k. 2) Instead of using your 401k, adjust your monthly budget and live frugal for some time. 3) Look for 0% balance transfer offers and transfer debt to that so you'll be able to reduce interest accumulation. 4) 401k is your savings, one of many I hope, keep that as is and don't touch it. 5) Sell things that you don't need and pay it towards the credit card 6) Do an analysis of your spending and figure out how you got to 21k.
