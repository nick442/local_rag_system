> many of our policies set up public schools to fail. Is that your impression? Maybe, I wonder if schools main function is not education, but babysitting. We are definitely succeeding at our function of babysitting. The two functions, babysitting and education are intertwined quite nicely, but it would be interesting to design an experiment where we test one and the other, and see parent's reactions. What would be the consequences of this experiment? Provide each student with a monitor so they can watch all their classes from their house, nothing else changes, students can still ask questions, like a conference call. This would keep the education, but take away the babysitting.
