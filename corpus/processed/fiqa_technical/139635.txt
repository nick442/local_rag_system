"Oh look, the cockroaches have crawled out of the gutter to wage financial war. Lets just refresh our memories, are you not the fucking assholes who were rating every piece of shit the banks produced AAA, along side the banks you were the core architects of the Global financial crisis and proved unable to rate even a dead cow, if memory serves. And when asked what the fuck you were smoking your answer was ""We did not know"" The fundamental reason for your existence was to know And inspite of that, the Junk Toxic shit the Fed bought was still rated AAA by you so the Fed paid Top Taxpayer dollar for worthless shit. Yet here you are . . passing sovereign ratings . .well ok The fastest growing debt for China is US treasuries . . .so that would mean US debt is bad and the Orange orangutan is going to, as predicted, Default. I think your time would be better served, evaluating the assets the Fed is going to unwind in October . . .That is US $ 4.5 Trillion of cow shit you help create, how about you get to work and tell us whats what before the only thing America's food stamps can buy is Radio active grass."
