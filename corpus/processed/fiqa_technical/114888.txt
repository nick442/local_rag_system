Thanks, I will try post more in the future. I actually said you can make money if you know what your doing the refurbished products not counterfeit. I don't deal in counterfeit goods at all. As an owner of several (extremely small) trademarks i think trademark infringement of goods is just not on and i wouldn't support it. Thanks
