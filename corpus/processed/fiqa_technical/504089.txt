-I understand. If the option expires and you paid a premium of let's say $20, then you loose it. I will still have to read more obviously. If there are other ways to play the commodities market in a safer way, I am more than willing to look into it. -I understand futures and options on futures are more risky than stocks. What I am getting at is it is less risky COMPARED to regular futures. Compared to the available choices, this seems like the safest. I understand I can loose all the money I invest/speculate with. But loosing $10 (or whatever the price of said commodity options are), is still better than loosing thousands. I agree though I should do my do diligence. -What I am getting at is obviously certain things are correlated with bull or bear markets (gold bear, growth stocks bull). If you can use a combination of assets, you can have some that are winners, while some will be down. I don't expect one asset to be a super asset. -But most the stocks are overvalued, and are overrated. I have found several stocks that I am invested in (MGM Macau, Lippo Mall, and Whiting Trust II). I am also in gold, silver, small Riyal position, and Norwegian Kroner.
