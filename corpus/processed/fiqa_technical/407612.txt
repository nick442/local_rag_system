Yes, all the upsides, none of the downsides. I always say if I released 200 million gallons of oil in the Gulf Of Mexico, by accident OR on purpose, I would have gone to jail for a long time. BP did this and didn't go to jail. None of the execs were locked up, they not stopped from participating in the economy (as I would have been on the account I would be in jail), nothing but a fine. A small fine at that, for the damage they did. They are more important than the citizens in this greedy country.
