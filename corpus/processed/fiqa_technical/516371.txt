You're missing out by not buying shirts online. I guess it depends on the type of shirt, but I'll never buy a men's dress shirt in a store again outside of an emergency. In store shirts are always crazy expensive, poor quality, and a terrible fit. Online I can get the precise size, fabric, and construction I want, for about a third cheaper than in store.
