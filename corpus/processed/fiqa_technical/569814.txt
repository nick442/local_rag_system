I found out about Louis from the internet, I previously had only watched his stand-up on the internet, and then I bought one show for 5$. I also used to watch Derrick comedy (online only) and would buy a similar download from Donald Glover if he offered one. This model is EXACTLY what people need, since it will lead to a hell of a lot more middle-class artists selling directly to small portions of the public with very little over-head.
