I sell electricity. When I send you a bill, my actual profit makes up a tiny portion of the bill - but I've already paid the four other groups (G, T, D, Gov) and my other costs are what they are. If I don't get paid, that's my problem - the generator got paid, the transmission and distribution companies get paid, and the government sure as hell gets paid. So I'm easily out $99 on a $100 bill.
