Sears had some pretty cool stuff back in the 1970s. I always looked forward to trips there. Radio Shack was awesome, too. Kinda sad that there are almost no physical stores I look forward to visiting these days. My favorite places are thrift stores, junkyards and the scrap metal yards. That's the only time I get excited seeing stuff. Well, that and Petsmart. I like seeing the cats, dogs and birds.
