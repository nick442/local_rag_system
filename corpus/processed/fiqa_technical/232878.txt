So ummm did you know there's a film coming out? Something about some religious cult in the future and an insurgency or something, they all fight with laser swords. I wonder how they get the news out about that? You are getting hit by ads, you just don't think they're ads. That's cool, I do too. Everyone does. You're on reddit as well, there's a shitload of advertising content on here.
