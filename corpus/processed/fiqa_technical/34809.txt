"I've had pretty good experience with fiction and non-fiction. I guess it's all about expectations. I actually dislike having physical media laying around the house (DVD's, books, etc.), and prefer having it stored with a service provider. I get that you give up some of the benefits of physical (sharing it, you ""own it"", etc.), but those weren't high on my list of values anyways."
