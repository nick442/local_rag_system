I grew up building gamers from scratch (~1992) and working IRQ, ports, managing conventional memory with those damn boot disks. Then the sound card fiascos. Now that I'm 34 and not into gaming so much, once my PC dies that's the end of my relationship with MS. It was a fun 22 years and boy did I learn a lot! But that era is long gone. My dad who was right there doing it all with me finally tapped out this year himself. He's a mac-convert at 65. /nerd-nostalgia
