"If the banks are not giving you a loan, there is probably a good reason for it. Banks are lending, they are only making safe loans. And this is not a bad thing. Remember that everybody is pissed off at the banks because they made too many risky loans and inflated a bubble until it popped and needed to be bailed out. It's stupid to be pissed at the fact that they stopped making risky loans. But of course, everybody says ""but I'm not risky, the other guy is the risky one""."
