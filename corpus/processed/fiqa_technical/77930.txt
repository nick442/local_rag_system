">Wait until you read about someone mentioning one of the main reasons main street took those losses was because of the municipalities, state, and federal pensions invested into those CDSs. Credit Default Swaps were the ""insurance"" scams, that's different. Municipalities purchased CDOs and not CDS'es. Someone correct me if I am wrong. The CDS's were also a problem, but of a different sort. CDS allowed people to take out insurance on a competing product. Imagine me taking out a fire insurance on your house. Things like that. CDO = Collaterized Debt Obligation (this is the paper which represents hundreds of mortgage slices mixed and matched by some bullshit software algorithm that promised to predict risk accurately) CDS = Credit Default Swap (this is an ""insurance"" paper which is not regulated like all the other normal and legitimate insurance, that insures the CDO garbage above.. so if your, or even your competitor's CDO goes into the shitter, you can collect on your CDS bullshit; so the CDS was supposed to be a hedge against the CDO failure)"
