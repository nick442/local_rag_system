You should not seek a kind of debt just for it's appearance on your credit report. If you don't need an auto loan don't get an auto loan. Getting a credit card for the purpose of building credit is a little bit of a different animal because you can use a credit card such that you never pay any interest or fees. With a loan, you will pay interest. Altering your score by paying interest doesn't provide you with a net benefit. With that said, depending on the auto loan rate you may want to accept the loan just to fee up your capital. Some promotional rates are so low you may even make money leaving the cash in a regular savings account. But don't let your credit score wag the dog.
