My understanding is they have X amount of seats per plane which are divided up into different fare buckets. So if you see $200 and there's only one seat left in that fare class and it sells out before you hit the buy button then you have to buy a seat in the next fare class. Not sure how this is bait and switch. Unlike Ticketmaster you don't have a lock on an actual seat. . Also why not call them in case it's a computer glitch. I'm sure they would honor the original price.
