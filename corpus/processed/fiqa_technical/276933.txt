I don't understand why businesses that supposedly offer a legitimate product decide to host 3rd party code. Is their actual product so worthless that they need the extra few cents from ad revenue? And there are open source analytic packages that tell you how many times people click on things on your web page and how they were referred. I don't see the reason behind relying on other packages unless you really need to compare yourselves to the competition-- which probably doesn't come up in boardroom meetings every day.
