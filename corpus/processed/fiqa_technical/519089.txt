Well if that looks like a pain in the neck, just look at the things we've engineered before (ocean floor drilling, mountaintop removal, the International Space Station, etc.) Even coal fired power plants are an engineering nightmare. These gravity batteries would be pieces of cake compared to what I just mentioned. Also, certain labs (I can't name them off the top of my head) are developing carbon fiber power lines that would have virtually no electrical resistance and wouldn't lose any power to heat. In light of that, do you think renewables would be feasible?
