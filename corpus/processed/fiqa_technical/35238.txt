> Bullshit. Entrepreneurs start businesses where it's easiest for start businesses, and if all of their networking contacts are here, the infrastructure they need to start their company is here, and the target market is here, they aren't going anywhere. Part of being an easier place to start a business includes low tax rates, minimal (smart) regulations, state of the art infrastructure, and a highly educated and healthy work force. Notice how Republicans champion the first 2 and ignore the second 2 while the Democrats are vice versa. I don't know why everyone focuses so much on the marginal rate of the rich, you can tax the rich 99% and you still won't have enough revenues to cover our budget deficit let alone make the investment we need in infrastructure, health, and education. Why don't we talk about how America can be competitive in a globalized market and what will have the highest return on investment. If we are raising taxes on the top 1% just to fund wars in iraq, then fuck that. If we are doing it to help fund our education system, then it only benefits them and everyone else even more because it will grow our economy. It's an investment, not a tax.
