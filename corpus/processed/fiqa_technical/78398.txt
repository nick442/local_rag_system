The middle class needs support, not eroding. Negative interest rates would work for starters in getting that corporate profit capital moving in society, not this avoidance of responsibility from above by passing the buck to the people. By the same token therefore, voting more is not going to solve things quicker. Why say 'politics will not fix this' and then declare 'vote someone in to change it fast' after throwing a few figures and catchphrases at us? A convoluted, nonsensical waste of time.
