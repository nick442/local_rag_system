Africa infuriates me. It's a most amazing place with probably more potential than any other continent on earth. And with insane levels of natural resources. Yet the natives can't get it together. They don't even have to innovate - just *copy* other countries. It's not colonialism. Ireland was probably colonised longer than any African country, yet it didn't collapse after independence. And that's with very limited resources. It will be interesting to see the path South Africa goes down. All the people I know who live there are extremely pessimistic. Look at the house owned by the president of the ANC's Youth League. https://www.enca.com/south-africa/ancyl-president-mum-on-purchase-r5-million-estate Such endemic corruption never ends well for anyone.
