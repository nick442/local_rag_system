Do not do investing with a bank. Do investing with a low cost investment company like Vanguard, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab. The lower the expenses of the fund the better. The additional money your account earns because of lower overhead expenses is so dramatic over the course of your investing it is mind boggling to me. The lower the expenses, the more of your money you keep, which feeds the power of compound interest. http://www.fool.com/investing/mutual-funds/2008/09/03/this-fund-charges-what.aspx
