To a point. There is also increasing prices to make their toys a premium product. Part of it is paying for many if not most of the sets to be tied to licenses, another part is more complicated sets as they became a premium brand. But as they became a premium brand, they began losing the lower end of the market. I buy lego, but at toys for tots time I donate megablocks.
