"In the US, the title company usually collects all money being paid by parties to the sale (including the buyer, seller, and mortgage companies) and then pays out money where its due to the respective parties (the seller, and possibly mortgage companies, housing inspectors, etc.) If you have equity, meaning that you sold your house for a price greater than what you owed on your mortgage, you'll typically get them money from the title company, but they are really passing through money that they got from the buyer (less whatever fees are going to the title company itself and other third parties involved). One misconception, however, is that if you paid off part of your mortgage over time that you automatically ""have equity."" That's really only true if you find a buyer willing to pay a price greater than what's left on your mortgage. When housing prices decline, it's possible that you as the seller may need to bring a check to closing and do not get any money back. (They buyer is presumably bringing a bigger check, but you would need to make up the difference between what the buyer pays and what you still owe on your mortgage.)"
