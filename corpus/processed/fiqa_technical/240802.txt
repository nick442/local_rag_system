This isn't a joke. Tons of people in sales and trading used it. Fuck Bloomberg chat. The joke for bchat was the bell. This is how Goldman got in trouble for calling people muppets. I nearly shit myself when that came out because I knew compliance would be looking through chats for the word and my group of friends called each muppets all the time. Weird convos with compliance happened shortly after when you had to have your buddy write an email to compliance saying it wasn't insulting to them.
