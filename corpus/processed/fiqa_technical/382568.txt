"You should check with your broker for details, but you can generally specify which ""lot"" you are selling. where I've seen it, that's done by concurrently sending a ""letter of instruction"" documenting your choice of lot concurrent with the sale, but different brokers may handle this differently. I would think this should work for the case that you describe. (In addition, the default rule used by your broker is ""probably"" first-in-first-out, which will do what you want here.) Note that this may come into play even in a margin account to the extent that you might want to specify a lot in order to obtain (or set yourself up for later benefit of) favorable tax treatment under the long-term capital gains rules"
