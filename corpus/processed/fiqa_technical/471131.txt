Usually backtests for (long-term) strategies are evaluated on a end-of-day basis where you only consider close prices. If your strategy performs well in these backtests, hopes are that if you use a market-on-close (MOC) order your performance will not diverge too much from the backtest. The fact that it won't diverge much is important if you keep backtesting the strategy along with the real trading to see regime changes or similar. If you used end-of-day prices for the backtests but some arbitrary intraday market order, you'd have some difficulties to explain deviations between the two. What it is: MOC orders can be submitted during the day, but they won't be executed until shortly before the market (or more precise the current session) closes.
