I'm really sorry to hear that mate. Probably the worst thing about public speaking is the anxiety before you go on stage. Once you're speaking, it tends to be fine and adrenaline takes over to a degree. If you're worried about making a mistake, just practice. Even then, if you do make a mistake, just remember that most people won't notice. If they do notice, they're probably won't care. The best public speakers in the world make mistakes all the time. Watch Obama's speeches when he was President, he would often say the wrong thing but would laugh it off. Just don't take it so seriously even if it is. The audience will be better able to relate and identify with you if you do. Maybe take some drama improvisation classes if you can. These will really help you think quick on your feet and come up with good responses fast.
