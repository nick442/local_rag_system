Under US law, if you clearly have more than half of a torn bill it is worth its full value; the smaller piece is worth nothing.. except that having both halves makes the banking system much happier, since it prevents some particularly stupid counterfeiting attempts. So this proposal wouldn't be cheat-proof unless the cut is close enough to the middle to make determining 51% difficult. And I'd like to see you try to explain to a bank how so many bills were cut in half.. (This is more normally an issue when money has been damaged unintentionally, of course.)
