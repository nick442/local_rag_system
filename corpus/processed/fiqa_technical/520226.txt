I suppose you think that considering women and Africans as chattel is an admirable trait, or thinking of Native Americans as only fit for slaughter. Maybe you likewise agree with most of our Founding Fathers that the only people fit to vote are male white property owners. They held plenty of opinions that we would consider beyond the pale of respectable discourse today; that does not diminish their accomplishments, but it does remind us that idolatry is not a useful way to view history.
