"As /u/Im_In_You replied, you need a lot more capital if you're going to make a difference in your personal finances. Remember to only invest the money that you can risk losing; don't put your emergency savings in the stock market. As for success, I replied with this to a snarky poster above: >I started investing with $15,000 in 2009, my first trade being to buy Ford around $2 before the other two got bailed out. That single trade put me in the six figures. I've followed that up with equally successful trades such as shorting Netflix when they announced their new pricing plan, buying Tesla when they first started selling the Model S, etc. So yeah, even benchmarked against the 2009 bottom of the S&P500, I've had ""success."" Although the professionals have access to far more information than I ever will, there is something to be said for being able to predict major trends. After all, the stock will either go up or down. Even with all the data in the world, your only options are to either go long or short. You have a 50-50 chance of beating the hedge fund crowd. Admittedly, very few people will have the same returns I've had over the past ~5 years."
