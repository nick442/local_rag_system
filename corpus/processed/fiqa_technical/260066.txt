> Empowering consumers by giving them fewer choices? We clearly disagree about whether this acquisition equates to fewer choices for the consumer! In a year or two, as a suburbanite, I expect this move to allow me access to Amazon's grocery delivery service, which is currently only available in the big cities. This gives me an extra option for getting groceries alongside my pre-existing options (Kroger, Wal Mart, etc.). Furthermore, while shopping at Kroger, I can compare their prices with Amazon's over my phone. The other options know they will have to step up their game to succeed. It's increased competition for them, and therefore good for me.
