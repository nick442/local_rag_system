I would **highly recommend** taking a couple of courses in Google Analytics (beginner and advanced) to learn how to track your site's traffic and audience. These courses will teach you how to create live analytic reports, track traffic by individual page, and view countless metrics like bounce rates, average time spent on a page, and which find out pages are typical landing pages. You can also find from where most of your traffic is sourced, and what channels access your site most. In addition, you can track your own ad campaigns and their effectiveness. For advertising, I would strongly recommend a course in Google AdWords. This course will teach you the top methods of producing effective online ads (in-app mobile, YouTube, graphic displays, text-based ads on search results, etc.). These courses are both **free** on the Google Analytics Academy, and a certification in them looks great on a resume. Cheers!
