One of my least favorite parts of mcdonalds is the way the kitchen looks. I hate that all of the machines just look so strange. So many odd looking stainless steel chutes and slides, and sick looking yellow trays that keep getting getting pulled out with meat and put back in. And the noise coming out of the kitchen is so bizarre. It sounds like a Friday night in the ICU. Machines blinking and alarms blaring out. What the hell is going on? It seems like going to the food factory instead of a restaurant. One thing I never see is a grill or any other normal kitchen appliance type thing, except for the fryer. That said I do have a burger and some nuggets once in a while but every time it seems a bit surreal. I wish they would make the kitchen at least seem appealing.
