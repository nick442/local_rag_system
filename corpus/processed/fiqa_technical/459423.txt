"I can just get the exact same mortgage in a 30-year version, and just pay it off within whatever year window I choose This is an assumption which often does not come true. The ""advantage"" of a 15 year mortgage is you hopefully never decide you want more toys or to go out to eat and suddenly your mortgage takes 30 years to pay off instead of 15. Plus, if I get a 30-year mortgage then I have a cushion in case I run into major financial hardship. That same cushion can turn into other luxuries. Maybe you want new furniture. ""I won't pay extra on the mortgage this year."" Suddenly it's year 22. This is not a 100% guarantee by any means, but it is something which is relatively likely. Yet everywhere I look I see people online going on about how unwise 30-year mortgages are I read a lot of online financial resources and almost never see this claim."
