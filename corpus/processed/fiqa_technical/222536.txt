i understand, in sample, out of sample. 1- now, in this specific example, how much should i pick for IS and for for OOS ? 2- if we few here at reddit, who are interested in coming up w/ strategies, wanted to create and criticize and construct it, how should we proceed ? this is a 2 fold question: a - what format and what information would you want to see to judge it ? b- do you think the criticism should come during the in sample tweaking, on the evaluation of the OOS or further down at implementation ?
