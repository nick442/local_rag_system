To me this is a tax structure that is working as it should. The tax code is providing strong incentives for Starbucks to expand. During the initial breakthrough period they are incurring significant expenses. These huge costs are being offset somewhat by the provisions in the tax code. The government in this case has provided a system by which Starbucks is encouraged to grow their volume of future taxable revenue. Simple :-) Edit: After further review of the article, it's not quite as simple as I made it out to be in my above comment. I think the point is still valid however.
