I'm a pretty big Yelp user. I have been frequenting a new local business and have come to understand how their reviews get filtered to help them. It's very simple to get the filtered reviews to come up on the main page. If you sign up and do one review it will be on the main page for a little while, a week or two, then drop off. They give the new user time to start doing reviews and to become part of the community. If there is no other activity, they become filtered. To get them back to the main page all the user has to do is friend a few people and do some more reviews. Not many even. They are a small sandwich shop and know their regulars. I shared with them this simple information and I have seen their page go from two reviews to seven. They just asked their customers to review other places and their reviews came back. The Yelp system is to stop the one review and done people. It works the same for bad reviews as well.
