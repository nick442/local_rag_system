Eh, you hear this argument all the time, but it doesn't actually work out that way in the real world, though, because corporate pay structure is extremely malleable over time. If a company makes $100M one year, it will pay the investors what they're expecting, the low-level employees what they're willing to tolerate (which is often the minimum wage), and then the upper management whatever is left (i.e. whatever the company can afford to attract the best management). By bumping up the minimum wage, the main effect is that it forces companies to change their pay structures (which are currently ridiculous - the U.S. CEO-to-avg-worker pay is around 200:1; Japan and Germany are around 15:1, IIRC). Feel free to dig deeper into the numbers and the studies if you want further evidence, but even a cursory glance at our history (or the current situation in Australia) shows that the effects of a high minimum wage on both inflation and unemployment are largely overstated.
