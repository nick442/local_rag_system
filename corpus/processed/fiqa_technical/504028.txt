"Gotcha, so for that job, I would try and get a basic understanding of how pulling queries and tables works. (ie What does that even mean? And if you have multiple tables how would you get the information you want? That's really going to be the important part. But a lot of times it really depends on the quality of the data, something possibly only IT knows.) Do you know any basic programming? A lot of it is just understanding what kind of questions you need to be asking, googling it, then understanding how to incorporate the google answer into your software. On a side note, the Hyperion, Oracle Essbase, and Access will all be a little different coding wise. Hyperion you may not really even need to do any ""coding."" I'd also probably look up what Hyperion Financial Planning is and get familiar with the interface. It's not hard, just weird if you've only ever used excel (and much more stringent)."
