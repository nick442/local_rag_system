"Human Development Index http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index --- 23 Spain 0.878 - ""Very high human development"" 161 Uganda 0.446 - ""Low human development"" --- What makes you think Spain is worse off than Uganda? Simply not the truth. Even in this crisis. Spain is a developed country with a high standard of living, highly developed infrastructure, a relatively well working state, and people don't starve in Spain. Even if the US or any Western European country experience a major economic crisis, they don't fall to low developed quality of living standards."
