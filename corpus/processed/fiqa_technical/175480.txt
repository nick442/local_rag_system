My point is that, unless Amazon stops or greatly slows growth of the Seattle campus, it would be very difficult for HQ2 to be truly equal in size. They're proposing $5bn and 50k employees over the next ~15 years just to catch up to where Seattle is *now*. Given the rate at which Amazon acquires office space already, this seems like a long shot. The only way I can see it happening is if there is a very big push to shift existing and new teams to HQ2. I am curious to see what they do. I'm not really sure what to make of the rest of your comment. Amazon does a little of everything. HQ can be anywhere sufficiently attractive to developers.
