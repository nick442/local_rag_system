The first 10-30k may have some issues. Nissan had frame / battery problems with the first 30k Leaf's.This is the reason that the first 10k T3 will be going to employees. Second 10k to loyal Model S / X owners and third 10k to buyers in CA near the factory. I have a friend that had one of the first Model X, it took almost a year to work out all of the issues, but everything is working now and they are happy!
