I've heard this story over and over. It's heartbreaking to hear of people (men and women) who slave to start a company, scrape together the wherewithal to take on 2 or 3 employees, back up the payroll from their own personal money when times are tough and then. just get stabbed fully in the back by women who milk every last minute out of their entitlement before not coming back. I know they aren't interested in the business and I accept that their first priority is the child. But that doesn't make it any easier on the business owner. Would you take on somebody if you seriously thought this was going to happen? Would any small enterprise ever hire anyone? Equality is a nice idea but it will stifle small and slow growing businesses to the point where the only way to get started will be to take a big loan. And that is not in the interests of the economy at large. There should be a second class of job, which you as a company have to fulfill certain requirements to offer. Low turnover (not profit) for example, maybe under 5 employees too. Basically, a company with little reserve with which to deal with an uncertain absence of a large percentage of its workforce. This second class job should carry with it either a waiver on the sexism discrimination policy (although this is completely insane and unfair to women who aren't interested in babies), a waiver on the ability to dismiss people for falling pregnant (which we kind of have in the UK given that in theory there's no unfair dismissal if it's in the first two years, although woe betide anyone who tries this out and immediately hires a man) or - and here's a wacky fucking idea - *some kind of increased government support in the case of pregnancy*. Stifling small companies by forcing them into penury just because someone wants to have a baby - arguably the most natural thing in the world - is in nobody's interests.
