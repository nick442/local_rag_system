Middle-Men have always existed, and will always exist, and every time we turn around we're getting rid of them. They crop up in new places on the edge of current business, live there for awhile and then get marginalized as economies of scale and technological progress happens. Then they need to find somewhere new. These people are not simply middle men, they're inserting themselves into deals where they do not belong. It is time for them to go.
