You cannot just cherry pick 1 quarter and say 'corporate profits are up' - I beleive they were up 16 billion in the quarter you referenced. Should I reference 4th quarter 09' when they were down [250.3 Billion] (http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2009/gdp109p.htm) >The cost of labor right now can't support consumption in our economy. That is the simplest of economics.** What you're doing is claiming that businesses will be able to hike up prices without repercussions from consumers.** I am saying exactly the opposite - there will be repercussions. Corporations would be forced to increase pricing - consumers would obviously take note - nullifying your perceived increase in demand bolstered by their increased wages. **** I think you are attaching a straw man that I think there is enough demand - there isn't I agree with you - I am stating your solution to that problem (companies reducing profit margin by maintaining selling prices and boosting wages) would not increase demand.
