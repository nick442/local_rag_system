Become? Lego has never been an inexpensive toy. The first set I received on Christmas 1980 was 6970, it sold for [$29.44](http://www.wishbookweb.com/FB/1980_JCPenney_Christmas_Catalog/#511/z). Adjusted for inflation that's $92.63 for a 254 piece set. EDIT: Browse around [Brickset](https://brickset.com/browse/sets) by year and you can see that PPP (price per piece) on average has remarkably stayed the same and has not risen with inflation. I think on average there are more sets with higher piece counts, but by piece Lego has gotten cheaper.
