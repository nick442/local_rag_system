Why? Grocery stores had minimum wage employees as well. You made no sense at all there. People not being able to pay slave wages and still maintain huge corporate profits, OMG the horror! Yeah it's those god damn waiters and cooks needing to pay rent and bills fault! Yeah same to ya. Oh and reading comprehension is a thing. I said I've run several businesses. One was a restaurant and bar too!
