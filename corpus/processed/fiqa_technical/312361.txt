I would suggest talking to your parents about potentially co-signing on the loan with you. Just make sure that you are the primary holder of the loan. Sure, there is some risk for your parents, but they know you better than anyone so let them make the decision if they want to help you or not. If for some reason they can't help you, such as they've declared bankruptcy, then following the other answers' advice is the way to go.
