I'm not splitting hairs at all, I'm pointing out that it's impossible to be a globalist in terms of business, and an anti-globalist in terms of government. A truly anti-globalist government would draw inward, and discourage (or stop) international trade/business, to focus on the domestic economy. That is not what is happening, and in fact, our president and his businesses clearly want to keep reaping the rewards of their international interests. Thus, our president is a globalist.
