I'm used to reddit being much more harsh. I fully welcome advice. I have been struggling with my experience and I thank you for taking the time. I just figured the company would say bad things about me if I jumped shipwhen it didn't work for me and they didn't have a backup. I suppose one could sue them if they say bad things? But this place was not even following OT laws or their own OT rules and it is 9 year old company. If they get audited they will literally lose millions, and yet they never have? Idk how this stuff works.
