"I think reinsurers also by insurance, from other reinsurers. The risk gets spread around, and these guys actually know what they are doing. I've heard insurers sometimes don't (using really rough thumb rules like ""buy 2% cats""), and end up with suboptimal reinsurance policies, but they always make sure they are covered. (The reinsurers have a better idea of what the risk is, and can outsmart the insurers when they sell the reinsurance policies). Expanding on the ""2% cat"" thing - insurers need to keep enough reserves + reinsurance to cover everything. The gist is, if they buy 2% catastrophe insurance, then the reinsurer will cover losses over 2% of the portfolio, so the insurers only need to cover the first 2% of their portfolio. (It might be a bit more complicated than this, of course). They might be better keeping higher reserves than 2%, self-insuring more (buying less re-insurance). Or they might be better keeping less than 2% reserves, and self-insuring less (buying more re-insurance). It depends on the price they negotiate with the re-insurer. Whatever the case, they have to make sure that they can cover any disaster (and the government will regulate this, or end up getting pressured to fund bail-outs as insurers go bankrupt and home owners are left with nothing)."
