I work in finance and have had a couple friends make the switch from engineering (or some other more technical field) to banking. People in finance like to glorify that what they do is special and takes a certain background/skill set, the truth is you learn things you need to on the job. Give yourself time and ask shitloads of questions. Your natural curiousity for markets and finance news is going to carry you forward - I've seen non finance people come into the sector and flail because they lack that.
