"I'm going to put this very, very simply. **The banking system does create money through leveraging and the money multiplier**, this is absolutely true. The current theory is that this is how the economy is expanded because of the basic premise that an economy can only grow with ample amounts of **Land, Labor, and Capital**, and it is assumed that the money multiplier allows the development and purchase of all of these things that have the **net effect of growing the economy beyond the level of debt built up as part of the process of wealth creation.** I have no problem with the above in principle, the problem comes when the cycle of debt is built up recklessly and irresponsibly with little, if any, regulation. That leads to a system in which debt and interest buildup faster than wealth is created. I also have issues with who ends up holding a ""piece of the pie"", as it is called, but that's a separate issue entirely. **The Fed's job is to stop the economy from collapsing overnight due to fluctuations in the price of money.** It would be no different if money was backed by gold, and in fact part of the reason why we abandoned that notion as laid out at Bretton Woods was because of how **Gold was being sold as a commodity thus affecting the price of money the way speculation on fiat currency occurred**, due in part to Charles De Gaul being an asshole. In today's world where **arbitrage** happens almost instantaneously and markets shift rapidly there is **danger** in not having a Central Bank that can regulate the price of currency to prevent disastrous inflation or economy shattering unemployment. Every nation in the world has one because they are necessary in the context of the current economy. **Banking regulation** is a multi-tiered problem that involves regulatory capture, Congressional payoffs, a closed circle in terms of who is qualified to even run such institutions, and numerous other problems, but **this is not unique to the banking industry, every regulatory body in existence suffers from the same problem.** At the moment **the Chairman of the Fed is an appointed position that exists so that key economic decisions will be isolated from the political pressure that elections result in, avoiding hastily thrown together and shoddy economic policy based solely upon politics.** The independence of Chairmen like Greenspan is questionable, but in theory it's supposed to prevent kneejerk decision making. **In short:** What I just explained is what everyone else here already knows.
