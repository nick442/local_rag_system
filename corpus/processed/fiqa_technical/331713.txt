Two of their children were adopted from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. My brother and his wife would rather have 4 kids raised with a high level of care in relative poverty than fewer kids raised in wealthier circumstances. I'm sure if she worked full-time and the kids attended school it would be better for them financially, but they consider homeschooling to be hugely beneficial. Staying out of poverty is a higher priority for my wife and I, which is why we work in offices and haven't had any children yet.
