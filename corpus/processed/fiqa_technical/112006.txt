"[JAPS Surrender](http://www.amren.com/ar/2009/05/15a-japs-surrender.jpg), also not an accurate headline since not all Japanese did surrender and there were some holdouts in remote locations for decades after the war. No headline can be accurate under strict enough criteria and there are limitations on headline space because it quickly turns into a paragraph to get everything right (it's head**line** not headparagraph with citations). Also headlines, so far as I know, are used to grab attention and the facts are in the story (which qualifies the headline). That's the way it's always been. And ""Stuff About CEO Pay"" doesn't have anywhere close to the same appeal."
