There is very little effect whatsoever of having a joint bank account--positive or negative. Positive effects: It would be very easy to send your mother money..she can just take it out of the account. If you passed away she could get the money without having to use the legal system (or vice versa). This latter effect is why I have a bunch of joint accounts with my wife..if either of us died I wouldn't want getting access to our money to be an additional hassle. Negative effects: She is able to access money in that account without your consen, which you have pointed out is not going to happen. The case I'm thinking of would be something like a tax lien against her. A government agency might choose to pull money out of that joint account. That would be a downside for you. If we were discussing credit cards, a loan, or a line of credit, there would be a number of legal and credit-rating effects from joint ownership. Not so much with checking accounts.
