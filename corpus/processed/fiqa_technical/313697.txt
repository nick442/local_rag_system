I honestly think that this is a problem that is already half way to being solved. Even with the current state of the technology I think the benefits of electric cars far outweigh the nominal detriments. I think that whining about taking 15-30 minutes more to top up the car is the last factual argument to be had against the inevitable and necessary technological development in transportation. Gasoline had it's time and now it's time to relegate gas power to the same corner that horses serve. Fun and expensive hobbies.
