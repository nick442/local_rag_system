You keep saying that like it explains everything away. Sorry. Not that simple. It's also about (among other things your tiny concept fails to ignore) where these jobs are located vs. where the high levels of unemployment are, and how its tougher for people to travel for job opportunities nowadays because everyone in general has less money, expecting high qualifications and non competitive pay, and so on. This is way more complex than just simply stating these people can't find employees because the american populous isn't educated enough. Again, you're grossly oversimplifying the issue.
