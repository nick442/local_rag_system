I do not like Home Depotâ€™s customer service. Their App can be as snappy as it wants - I have a good experience with Amazon. I trust it to arrive without dents or not to be the wrong model, and an easy method to solve it if that is the case. Dealing with Home Depot for anything requiring customer service has always been irritating in the past, and compared to other companies that have similar jobs (like Joyful Honda here in Japan) really show how a brick-n-mortar store can successfully compete against Costco and Amazon - by having a good staff in each department - not just the 1 guy everyone depends on.
