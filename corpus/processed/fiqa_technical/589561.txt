Also, I wouldn't go so far as to say that just because a government agency is performing the work, it is now, therefore, objective. Remember, in each and every instance, it is a *person* doing the actually work. That person is at least just as likely to be corruptible in a corporate setting as in a government setting. Rather, I would go so far as to say that they are more likely to be corruptible in a government job as there isn't a tremendous amount of upside. If you're making $75k a year and have the opportunity for a $100k payment on the side to look the other way, you're much more likely to take it than if you're making $500k per year. There's also the added complexity of each employees exit opportunities from government work. For example, if you work for the SEC -- your best employment option outside of the commission is to go work in compliance for the industry (hedge funds and investment banks, in particular). Kind of skews your incentives a bit, right?
