Recent MBA grad here. I would much rather work at a job that makes me happy than a job that pays more. With that said, I'm feeling pressure to earn a fairly high salary to pay off all the student loans. I will probably spend a few years trying to find a balance between happiness and salary and then completely forget about salary after my loans are paid off.
