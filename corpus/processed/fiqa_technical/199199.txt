My dark age only ended about a year ago. Once I had bought a few mixed bags and sorted them I called my parents to ask them where the old collection ended up. Apparently they gave it all to my younger sister for her kids. Those two little kids have no idea how lucky they are to start out with a collection that big! Spoiled little brats! (I love them though.)
