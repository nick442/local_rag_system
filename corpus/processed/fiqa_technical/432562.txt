My wife and I are both Canadian citizens living in the US with green card status. I still have a Canadian RRSP and bank account in Canada that are dormant for the most part. We use the Canadian debit card only when traveling (which is quite helpful). Neither of us file any paperwork in Canada anymore. But as others have mentioned, we do file the FBAR form.. this takes about 10 minutes and gets mailed somewhere in Michigan if I recall correctly. (Keep the balance less than $10k total among all foreign accounts and you relieve yourself of this too.) As far as taxes go, we make less interest in our Canadian account than in our US accounts, so the tax burden is less.
