Taxes do not translate into income for the poor maybe under certain circumstances, but that's not true at all in general. Transfer payments, healthcare, education.. those are areas where increased tax dollars correlate with increased income for the poor. It certainly wouldn't be effective if those tax dollars went to the military, but it would undeniably increase income if it were distributed as transfer payments.
