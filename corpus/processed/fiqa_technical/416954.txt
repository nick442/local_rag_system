">Nowa day workers seem more like they are suppose to be cult members who do back breaking labor (long hour, low/no pay) so their leader can ride around in a limousine and wave at them from time to time. Well, such ""cult"" members are easy to exploit. And it also has hints of feudalism, when people were expected to ""tip their hat"" to the local Squire, etc. IMO, we've been on a trend towards that ever since (a century ago) US embarked on its ""Imperial"" ways (from Teddy Roosevelt on..); but it is a trend that has been accelerating in recent decades (no doubt aided by the virtual ""self-indenturing"" of people into heavily burdensome consumer debt; something they didn't *have* to accept)."
