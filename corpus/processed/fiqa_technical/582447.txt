Wtf are you talking about, the article is not mud slinging, there's been evidence for a while now that Trump's cabinet is not entirely happy with him. Just because you're not happy with the facts doesn't mean that's mud slinging. That's not what that expression means. Trump has no understanding of international politics or the US domestic legislative process. Are you seriously shocked stories like the ones cited in the article are a fact?
