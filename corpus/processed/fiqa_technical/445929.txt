It's not the concept of patents that is a failure. It's the application of them. The Copyright Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that Congress may grant exclusive production rights to authors and inventors **for a limited time**.. in order to **promote science and art**. It was supposed to protect people who put a large investment of time and resources into developing something. It wasn't the *idea* that was supposed to be protected â€“ it was the *investment* in developing the idea. That is not how intellectual property is used today. Companies have instructed politicians to change the laws so that they can use intellectual property rights to maximize profits and monopolize industries. There was never any problem with the concept of patents. The problem lies with government. As long as businesses are allowed to legally bribe politicians, the laws will be altered to favor those businesses.
