I actually re-read the article. The shares are voting, but the CEO made his shares have 15 votes each. This is much worse than non-voting shares. Non-voting shares usually come with other benefits. Zynga has basically made the votes of the common shares useless without giving any benefits. Total scumbag company, which I'm sure won't be around in 10 years.
