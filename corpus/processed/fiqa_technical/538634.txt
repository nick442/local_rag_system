As for when it's due - I don't know of any indicators of the top of my head. I'm sure you can find out with a bit of googlefu As for when economics starts and finance ends it's hard to explain in simple terms. Think about everything in an economy as 'acticity done by people'. Economics tries to study these activities (by governments, individuals and firms). It sounds like you're interested in this side more than the finance side so I'd highly recommend looking up Kahn academy videos in micro and macro economics. Finance is sort of a study of the measure of economic activity (MEASURING the bonds the government's or firms issue etc). Lastly I like listening to podcasts so it might be something you're interested in as well. Maybe check out some of the Bloomberg podcasts and others on the economy
