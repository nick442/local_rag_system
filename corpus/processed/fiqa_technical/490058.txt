> Minimum wage was created to force employers to pay a wage that is not commensurate with services rendered Wages have very little to do with services rendered (except as a hard cap on what employers can pay), and far more to do with who has more negotiating power. Which is almost always employers, especially at the low end. Employment has very poor information and very high transaction costs. It's nowhere close to an efficient market.
