"4PM is the market close in NYC, so yes, time looks good. If ""out of the money,"" they expire worthless. If ""in the money,"" it depends on your broker's rules, they can exercise the option, and you'll need to have the money to cover on Monday or they can do an exercise/sell, in which case, you'd have two commissions but get your profit. The broker will need to tell you their exact procedure, I don't believe it's universal."
