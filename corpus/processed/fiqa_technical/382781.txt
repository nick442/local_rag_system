Some people would think that the government should mandate that Walmart pay their employees more. However, that won't stop other companies from pushing the cost of business unto taxpayers. It seems that Walmart is acting perfectly rational as a business would. I think the better solution would be to stop enabling these companies with a backdoor subsidy and stop giving out free money and handouts to people. When people realize they won't get free money from the government, they will demand better wages from companies or won't bother to work there. The best solution, which runs counter-intuitive to the previous solution, and the one I'm leaning towards, is http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_guarantee . It is completely transparent and eliminates the need for every other government program. Then people could work at Walmart for fun, or Walmart could offer a wage that was enticing.
