This guy sounds like he was more of a consultant than customer support. Consultants live and die on the ability to do ridiculous things like take a call at home on setting up windows at 2am. The relationships often get much more personal. I work with consultants a lot and the good ones are a treasure. They are the ones you fight for through budget cuts even though they are raising their prices. A really good consulting firm lets me leverage my knowledge into output 5 times what I'd get from an FTE on the payroll.
