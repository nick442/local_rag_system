If my experience playing tycoon games is any indication, there is usually a point when you can't help but hoard more money faster even if you do nothing. Also, giving money to employees could have unpredictable effects. It might boost morale in the short term, but in the mid-long term it could mess up with whatever HR or managers are trying to do in managing their team and culture. It will also make your brightest people leave faster to set up new competitors.
