While the rest of the answers seem to be focusing on the parenting strategies around giving children an allowance, I'd like to address how to accomplish that. I think the best most reasonable way to just to supply him with a checking and savings account at whichever bank you use. Most reasonable banks will have some form of no-fee account for minors/young people; others will waive fees if you have it paired with your account. Whatever way to can swing it, get the kid an account he can deposit/withdraw from and that is free of any additional services. He doesn't need to learn the pain of overdrafts or random fees yet. Then, just set up a recurring weekly/monthly transfer to the account, and let him determine his own allocation to savings and spending. If he can manage it online, even better, that's a far more useful skill than knowing how to fill out a deposit slip at the bank.
