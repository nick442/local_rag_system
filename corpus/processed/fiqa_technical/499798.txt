Without knowing the company itâ€™s hard to say 100%, but any regulated company in Europe or one floated on a major stock exchange will not renege on paying winnings/ban accounts for no reason. You will have either breached a term of service such as opening multiple accounts (or opening accounts while self excluded/on time out), or exhibited a behaviour that is heavily linked to fraud/other fraudulent accounts. If you are using any UK regulated site/Europe site floated in London, and you believe you are in the right and have not broken any terms and conditions, IBAS is the place to start, and to mention to the company that you are going to IBAS before you do start a case (this is often enough to turn a decision in your favour if it is a marginal case, as it is a large amount of hassle for an operator to become involved with them). If you are using an unregulated site you are out with the wolves and basically any behaviour from them is to be expected and there is very little you can do about it.
