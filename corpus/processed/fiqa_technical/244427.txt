I agree with you here. I've read quite a few Paul Krugman posts actually defending that the FED should be targeting an inflation rate closer to 3% or 4%. Unfortunately, a lot of people frame inflation as stealing from the poor. I think it's idiotic because inflation hits more people who have a lot of assets, and actually helps the people who have a lot of debt. That being said, wages would have to grow on pace with inflation, and things have not gone that way in the past couple of decades..
