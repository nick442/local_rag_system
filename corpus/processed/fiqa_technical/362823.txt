"Wow. You are fucking retarded.. UBI is bullshit and not going to happen (thankfully) and ""job theater"" is a tucking bullshit term that I've never heard before and never wish to hear again. You millennial are way too fucking innocent. The world owes you fucking zilch. You are entitled to nothing. A functioning society does not pay people money ""just because"". If you don't contribute to society then you deserve nothing. You've actually just shown why bigger government is fucking stupid. These people do nothing for society yet they would work in some ""job theater"" bullshit organization. Why not just cut out the middleman and give them money without making them ""work""? And of course there would be a *massive* government agency running this sham that would have a massive budget. You people are fucking retarded and need to learn some basic econ. Bernie is a lying cuck."
