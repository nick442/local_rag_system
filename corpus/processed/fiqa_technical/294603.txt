">Then you are using the word ""passive income"" wrong My point is that the problem goes beyond ""passive income"". Sure, utilising unethical tax and debt avoidance strategies isn't a passive method that requires no effort, but it's obviously not a good thing either. >50%+ of the population isn't intelligent enough to even do this. Stock market speculation is just one example. There are a lot of wealthy people who are much less intelligent and work much less than people who have only a fraction of their wealth. I certainly hope you're not suggesting that wealth is necessarily, or even usually an indicator of intelligence or work ethic. >I still don't know where you even got this idea. I've read the book and he doesn't even really talk about this. Are you joking? ""Poor Dad"" is portrayed as a pitiable piece of shit because he has integrity and works an honest job. ""Rich Dad"" is some kind of fucking superhero because instead of contributing to society in some way, his priority is to constantly generate wealth and continue to grow like cancer. ""Rich Dad"" detracts from society, and in a remotely fair system his wealth would reflect his contributions, not his willingness to manipulate others. >You're right, it isn't, which is why most people don't do it for a living. Oh, so becoming obscenely wealthy at the expense of others would be acceptable in your idea of a perfect society? Hell, If we're going to take such a Darwinian 'survival of the fittest' approach to society, why not just remove all welfare programs and let the wealthy among us continue to buy politicians until they pay no taxes and everyone else subsidises their lifestyle? Oh wait, we're already doing exactly that. I would rather things get worse than stay the same. It is clear that people need to hurt more before they wake up to see who is responsible for their rapidly declining quality of life."
