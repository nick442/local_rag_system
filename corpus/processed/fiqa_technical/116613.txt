True, I'm more concerned with the fingerprinting personally. If it ever became a way to identify people or target people. With social media and businesses logging everyones personal information. I'm willing to bet 99.9% of us have all of our info out there somewhere except perhaps ssn's (probably not as high but closer than we think)
