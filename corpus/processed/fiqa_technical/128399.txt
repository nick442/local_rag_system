"One thing recessions do is sort out market inefficiencies. Often that means re-directing people who are in jobs they can't do properly into other career fields. During the dot-com boom, tons of people with liberal arts degrees and no experience wound up as ""software engineers"". Not all of them sucked, but many did, and the dot-com crash sorted that out. As an engineer, I saw this first hand, and it wasn't a bad thing -- I had a lot of co-workers in 2000 who weren't pulling their weight. This is going to sound heartless, and maybe it is, but if someone has been unemployed 3 years, maybe it is time for a career change. Your tax credit idea is only going to penalize businesses for operating efficiently, penalize the productively employeed, and cost the government in revenue. Also, tax incentives rarely have the impact they're designed to have and there are always unitended consequences. Large businesses exploit them, small businesse get abused by them. If we want to see job growth, tax codes need to get simpler, not more complex."
