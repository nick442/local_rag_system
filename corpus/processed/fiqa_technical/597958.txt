I went into Sears the other week looking for a tap and die set in their tools section. It looked like a grocery store right before a huge storm was to hit. That is to say that the shelves were nearly entirely empty. I found a set for $100+ which I wasn't going to pay for a single tape and die that I needed. It's no wonder that they are closing stores left and right.
