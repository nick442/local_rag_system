>Oh definitely, you just need to be willing to work in Bismarck ND, or various parts of the rustbelt. And it's not that you're getting paid especially high, it's that everything is so insanely cheap (for the most part). That's not what I mean though, it's easy to find locations where cost of living is cheap, its difficult (but possible) to find locations where the average salary for your field isn't reflected in that lower cost of living. For example New Hampshire, the property costs are fairly low - you can find a great house for 250k-300k - but the average salary of a software developer is still high, and not just relatively, it would be considered high in New York as well. I've found houses in New Hampshire that stay on the market for $350k that would be nabbed up in a weekend for 1M easily in my current location, and the average salary is comparable so just imagine what that implies in terms of quality of life.
