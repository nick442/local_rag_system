I have been in a similar position as you for the past few years. I put a bunch of cash into a tax free savings account (canadian) instead of paying down debt. My rationale was that I wanted the exposure to the market and had to be in it in order to pay attention. I also put money into an rasp, but only because my employer matched it (100% gain, no brainer). Looking back, I think it would have been a better idea to get debt free sooner. Having that debt weighs on you and haunts everything you try to do. You can't afford rent where you want to be, where you should be. There's no keeping up with the Jones' if you're paying off debt. That being said, in Canada your student loans are secured and if you lose your job, the government makes payments for you. If your loans are structured like this, then you are better off hanging onto that money.
