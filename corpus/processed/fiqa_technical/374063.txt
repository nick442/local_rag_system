This is an organization with a strong Christian atmosphere that actively employs fellow believers and hosts a bible study every morning. If that isn't a church, then what *do* you consider a church? Also, it wasn't an analogy. It was an explanation of why certain organizations may choose to hire like-minded people. EDIT: No clue why this is getting downvotes. Equal opportunity employment is not without its practical limitations.
