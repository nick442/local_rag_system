Hi I am assuming you are doing this in the US? I run a social media / content marketing agency in the UK, Some of our very first clients were real estate agents, the idea we had was to market properties through Facebook using interior and exterior video shots to commercial music, This took off with some estate agents and not so much with others, My biggest piece of advice find a chain and start there that way you will get a hell of a lot of recognition by the smaller firms, You need to find a realistic price point for your clients that is measurable on the ROI and ultimately pays for your lifestyle. I started at Â£200 which is $257 dollars - arguably very underpriced but it gave me the opportunity to work with a cluster of people, I even went to the extreme of offering free work so I could get work for the portfolio! In terms of who to contact and how to find them. enter Linkedin.com your new best friend - connect with real estate developers, buyers, owners you name it then informally introduce yourself and ask when they are free for a coffee. Post an article about why video and drone footage is the next big thing for real estate, don't be afraid to ask for the business at the end of the day you are providing cold hard value. I've always tried to get retainer deals with clients in the real estate sector but to achieve this you have to talk to the big boys and not independent firms. I could be wrong though I haven't done business with a lot of people in the states so definitely something to keep in mind. A good lot of this business idea is trial and error but I agree with it 100% just go and do basically, Hope this helps - I am happy to show you some of my work if you want to shoot me over a private message!
