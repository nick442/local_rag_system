I think what you meant to say instead of morons is 'young people who drive mass market consumer trends'. Apple, Facebook, Beats- these companies didn't climb to the top of the heap by winning the affectations of tech-geeks, but I suppose looking at demographics and the market would be more appropriate for a subreddit like /r/business, but seeing as how we're in /r/mypersonalopinion I guess I'm the odd one out.
