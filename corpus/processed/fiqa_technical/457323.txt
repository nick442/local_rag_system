AC is kinda like this big mall but that allows gambling. Its fine for middle of the road and lower end patrons but high end patrons and more sophisticated people go to vegas, and new york for what? The food. I don't really know any really notable food places in AC. All the major cities have restaurants that it is worth spend a 100 bucks per person backed by top chefs, including Vegas. AC is just a big fucking mall, with chain restaurants. AC doesn't have Rossini burgers. You end up going to some diner in AC not because you want to, but just because that's how it is.
