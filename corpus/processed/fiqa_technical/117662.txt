"We have one of the most business friendly countries in the world, especially banking friendly, and it is not enough for him. It's just a Republican talking point when he says ""we have become one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet."" It's just another head of an insanely rich corporation wishing they didn't have anything in their way to doing everything they wanted to do to be even more rich. Cry me a river."
