I mean sure but there have [been underlying problems with Whole Foods business](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brycehoffman/2017/04/30/the-problem-with-whole-foods/#4ac1755019d6) for a while. I'm trying to understand why Amazon would specifically target Whole Foods vs another Grocery chain. Does the relative decline of Whole Foods market put it in a place where Amazon can acquire it for a discount? I'm guessing yes, but the source article is rather short on reasons.
