Audible has it. http://www.audible.com/pd/Business/How-to-Win-Friends-Influence-People-Audiobook/B002V5BV96/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1409496635&sr=1-1 No clue on torrents. If I had to pick three for someone just starting, grab the above and One up on Wall Street and Getting to Yes. That would put you on a great path. There is a lot of garbage in the category, but On Up was my beginning investment bible in high school and Getting to Yes is something anyone should read/listen to get a better understanding of basic negotiation.
