I understand where you are coming from, but you vote with your dollars. As long as you are willing to fork over for shitty service and shitty products, they will keep lowering the bar and keep treating the employees worse. When people stop buying, they either change their tune or go out of business. The financial reality is if you actually want improved working conditions for their employees, you need to have the fortitude to refuse to subsidise substandard behaviors.
