I'll agree with the other commenter. There is a ton more to sales than speaking the language and being a decent public speaker. Unless you know what you're getting into and feel confident you can get it done (or you believe that the company is willing to help you learn and grow as a salesperson and that's interesting to you from a career development perspective), I'd recommend avoiding a sales role and encouraging your boss to hire an actual sales person who meets his or her criteria.
