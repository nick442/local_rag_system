Did you become a homeowner in this case? Would you be paying property tax as a homeowner somehow? Were you the homeowner of your apartment? No. Are you a homeowner of your parent's home? No. I do not believe that living at your parent's house makes you a homeowner or someone counted as a homeowner for statistical purposes.
