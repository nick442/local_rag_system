"There are a few historical examples of anarcho-capitalist societies that were relatively stable, including early Ireland, Medieval Iceland, and Quaker Pennsylvania. In the past, people thought that democracy was a crazy/stupid idea for a political system. They argued that Rome was once a Democracy, and it collapsed. They pointed out that the 49% losers could just kill the 51% winners. They pointed out that the winners of an election didn't need to give up power at the end of their term. They pointed out that the masses are stupid, and they would elect stupid leaders. So the foundation for any system of governance rests on the opinion of the masses about what creates a ""legitimate"" government. As a libertarian anarchist, my goal is to convince people that the only legitimate form of governance is voluntary interaction. In a society where property and person are honored, we can be productive and safe without worrying about the side effects caused by monopolist governments.
