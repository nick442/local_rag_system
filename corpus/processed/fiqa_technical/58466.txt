My grace period is up in a few months, and I am not looking forward to it. I got the minimum federal aid possible for all 4 years, so I had to turn to private loans and whatever I could make over summers and what my parents could help me with. Ended up with $50k in debt, about 20k of it being with Sallie Mae. I can confirm they are bad on the collection side already. Just happened to miss a payment during school (paid off interest every month for the last 4 years), and they called me 3 times during class, sent an email, letter, and called my bilogical dad who cosigned for the loan. I can only imagine what they are like for people defaulting. All comes down to it though, have a plan when borrowing money for school. I knew my parents would only be able to help me out a little bit, and I got minimum federal aid (as in just loans) because my step father had assets that counted against me (and he told me I was on my own). So I had to figure out how to not be screwed from the beginning. I paid off my interest every month while working during school, and made sure to work hard to graduate with a good job. I can't imagine how some students feel when they graduate with nothing.
