Maybe, but having one increases the risk of gun accidents and is a real risk if someone in your home has mental health issues, and those are statistically far more likely than defending yourself for home invaders or protecting yourself from the breakdown of society. If you aren't someone who genuinely enjoys hunting or range shooting, it's kind of silly to own one.
