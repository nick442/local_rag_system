Sure! Obama did such a great job with ObamaCare because he understands better. So, no chance Trump can do better than him or come with better and more creative solution than Obama or Hillary. If you did not know, Trump will not design the new plan. Trump and executives do not create plans. Experts and others do the plans based on very general guidelines given to them. Trump and executives just review the plans and ask for any changes they may want. And this whole thing has to be approved by Senate and Congress. **BOTTOM LINE: after the experience with ACA, and new plan must be better based on lessons learned and real limitations. The whole nation is watching.**
