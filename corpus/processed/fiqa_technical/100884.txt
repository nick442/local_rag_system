"Hey Maison, Thanks for the reply. At this point we're not receiving any statements..I've tried multiple times to ask for papers but it always gets pushed aside and eventually forgotten about (I have a full-time day job as well). Does it make sense that the manager is collecting his full salary + extras, but we as the owners (at least my portion) are not getting anything? I think the manager is the one handling everything - including taxes, payroll, etc. I'm going to be putting in somebody that I trust, with more business acumen, to go and have a first hand look. Is there anything overly important you would suggest that needs to be focused on heavily and can easily shed some light on this issue? Like you said, this single point of failure may be what's killing me, and it makes no sense that the bar wouldn't be making any money since every time I've gone it always seems packed. The manager just kind of talks down to me when I try and ask him about the situation since he's the ""Expert"" and I'm relatively without experience, and always has a reason such as renovations, fixing of the roof, etc. all expenses that come out of the total earnings."
