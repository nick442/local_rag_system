I believe this will be looking at ways the business can measure it’s success, non financially. Business might look at things such as: Customer satisfaction, Whether customers make repeat purchases, Labour/Employee turnover- how many employees quit and are replaced. Hopefully that gives you the right idea and you can add on to it. Sorry just have to add as I just did business ALevel, when ever you write any answer in business, ask your self after every paragraph “is that in context”. You might talk about the most amazing things which really impress who ever is marking, but if it doesn’t relate to the business, you get a big 0 :(
