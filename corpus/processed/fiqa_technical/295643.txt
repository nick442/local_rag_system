The DoD wants to cut some of those bases, it's the people in Washington who don't want this to happen. These bases bring in money to the communities of which they are a part of, even if they're unnecessary and sometimes a hindrance when thinking in terms of military strategy. So the legislative branch blocks the closures that the DoD want because if these bases did close, it'll hurt the communities within their districts, thus hurting their chances of re-election.
