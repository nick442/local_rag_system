"It's not a pyramid scheme, pure pyramid schemes are illegal. ""Multi Level Marketing"" is technically legal, most stay within the legal boundaries but it's easy for a ""self-employed"" individual to step into the illegal realm by using deceptive sales tactics. When it's commission based renumeration Herbalife doesn't care who exactly makes the sale, just that someone did. That's no different than Google Adwords. Yes it is exploitative business practices and taking advantage of people who don't know better, but it doesn't appear illegal to me."
