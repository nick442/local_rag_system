"> Also, if accounting suddenlly decides to hire a bunch of new employees why should the cost for the computers come out of IT's budget? What does it even mean for something ""to come out of IT's budget?"" As far as I can tell, what it means is that you don't understand the difference between a planning tool and a t-account. > As long as IT's budget is subserviant to the whims of other departments you can't really call it a budget at all. Rather, it is just a pool of money that anyone can dip in to. Budgets aren't pools of money at all, they're planning tools. Actual pools of money are t-accounts. I am nearly 100% certain that your IT department doesn't not have its own t-account, though once the distinction between budgets and t-accounts are so thoroughly confused that you are commonly saying things ""come out of our budget,"" the next logical step can appear to be inter-departmental charge-backs. The reality is that business expenses are driven by growth and constrained by cash flow. Managers must learn how to produce budgets that anticipate growth, so that cash flow can be managed by the accountants, and so that executives can make decisions about priorities. Doing inter-department charge-backs is a way of doing this in an organization whose relationships are so fucked up that you can't do it by actually talking to each other. Have fun with that."
