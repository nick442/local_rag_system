"I am a huge Net Neutrality advocate and I too didn't have any issue with the ""Free Basics"" program itself. As a business Facebook should be free to market any product they choose that they feel will advance the business. However I disagree vehemently with their ability to market it as ""internet"" access. This was an attempt to build another AOL not offer free/low cost internet access to burgeoning markets."
