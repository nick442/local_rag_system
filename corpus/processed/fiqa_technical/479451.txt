"I am sorry, did you have a better example of a country that does not tax or taxes less but provides better services and protections? > But we think the rich aren't paying their ""fair share"". Let me tell you, no share is fair. The government didn't work for that paycheck, you did. Let me tell you, because I am one of those rich guys. I own a business that did millions in revenue last year. I am by far not one of those ""super rich"" that we read about, nor is my company one of those that paid nothing in taxes last year. My company is organized as an S-Corp, which means it is a pass-through when it comes to taxes. (I.e. I pay the taxes, not the company). I had an effective tax rate of over 33% last year, and paid into the six figures just in federal taxes. That being said, I am also one of those people that feels that our taxes are too low as a country. I would be happy to talk about why, and do it one topic at a time. If water is the topic you want to start with, I would be happy to."
