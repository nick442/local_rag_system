"Deuteronomy 14:28 - ""at the end of every third year you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce that year and shall deposit it in your town."" Deuteronomy 15:8 - ""but you shall freely open your hand to him, and shall generously lend him sufficient for his need in whatever he lacks."" Proverbs 19:17 - ""One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the LORD, and he will repay him for his good deed."" Matthew 5:42 - ""Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you."" Luke 18:22 - ""When Jesus heard this, He said to him, ""One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."" 1 Corinthians 16:1-3 - ""Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also. On the first day of every week each one of you ja to put aside and save as he may prosper so that no collections be made when I come. When I arrive, whom Weber you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem."" Boy the Bible seems to be pretty clear that charity is compulsory. And that money must be sent aside for the poor if you are to receive Gods light."
