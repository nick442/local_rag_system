This sounds like it has happened for other events so is it really that newsworthy? I was hoping to learn some scientific reason like eclipse sunlight will boil gasoline. Or maybe the CEO has a theory that eclipses affect gravity and he doesn't want his cars floating away. Nope.. Just oversold his supply.
