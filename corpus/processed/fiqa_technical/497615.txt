First measure the actual power draw for your devices, or you may waste effort through premature optimization. It might not be worth the trouble to unplug an idle device every night just to save a penny or two. I suggest you get your hands on something like the Kill-A-Watt, to begin with. Essentially, it's a pass-through device that measures power consumption for whatever you plug into it. Manufacturer says: [..] cut down on costs and find out what appliances are actually worth keeping plugged in. Simply connect these appliances to the Kill A WattÂ®, and it will assess how efficient they really are. Large LCD display will count consumption by the Kilowatt-hour, same as your local utility. You can calculate your electrical expenses by the day, week, month, even an entire year. [..] IMHO, something like this is worth the cost, and I've had one for a while. A nearby library may also have units on hand to lend out. While the Kill-A-Watt is easy to use, the primary drawback is that it doesn't handle everything in the house: i.e. anything hard-wired (no plug) or else running on 240V (electric range, clothes dryer) can't be measured. To handle those you'd perhaps want to look at solutions that can monitor from the panel, such as TED or something similar.
