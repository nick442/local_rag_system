So here's the way I rationalized my subscription to games pass..I probably only buy like 4-5ish new games each year, and I get my money's worth from those. I find that there are times during the year when I do have time to game but I don't because I don't have anything I want to play. As long as I can find at least one different game to spend a week(end) or longer playing in a given month, I think I'll continue to pay the $10/month.
