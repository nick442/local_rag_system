"Tell me about it. Although I have a Sony little 40"" and I have to say I am very happy with it. I got it as they were phasing out the previous year models, and while it doesn't have 3-d the picture quality on 2D is actually very good. I am told the speakers are not great, but I have surround sound anyway, and I think I have used the speakers 1 time, and that was only to check to see if they worked. I still know people who use MD players for professional recording. (althought the last I heard of that was a few years ago, so not sure about now)."
