Well of course, you can protect accute effects toward the environment, but the nature of private business is that you can't lead on a collective action problem like carbon emissions, you need a political solution. I think people overestimate how much business dominates politics. The politicians still have to answer to constituents who are basically screaming to be the most extreme. If business really dominated as much as everyone likes to say, immigration reform would have been done years ago.
