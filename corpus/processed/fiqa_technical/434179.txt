Don't try to catch a falling knife. The fact that the prices were falling for this long means that the professional traders in this market expect gas prices to keep going down. This may be for many reasons, which they know much better than you do. So it's likely that gas will keep falling for a while longer. Wait until gas starts to recover, and then go long on gas as base64 suggests.
