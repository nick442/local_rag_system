Eh.. do you not like sausages, beef pepperoni or bologna? It isn't like we didn't eat this shit before, we have for thousands of years, just most of the recipes that utilize it our not to our modern tastes so the turn it into more palatable products. You might not have ate straight up cow tongue, cow heart, cow asshole, ect straight up but you have ate it many many times without complaint if you ever eat sausage.
