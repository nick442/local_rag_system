I wouldn't be so sure. There are many, many articles and under cover investigations mentioning poor working conditions. That shows to me that it is institutional. As founder / CEO / chairperson, for better or for worse the responsibility is ultimately his. I wouldn't call him greedy but thrifty, sure. Doesn't he drive a 20 year old Volvo? Good on him - just don't become too thrifty to the point it negatively impacts your employees wellbeing (I'm not saying at all that it is amazons fault that some of their employees sleep in tents outside the factory, but It's the only business in the UK I've heard this happen at. Shows there is *something* going on).
