Wow, glad I found this. I take the 7 tomorrow morning at 9:15am. I started going section by section, then I got to Options and got a 40% so I swore at the computer and money and everything else within view, and then I sat down and walked through about a million scenarios until I had it down. Using Knopman (but Kaplan materials for the most part, including the Qbank site), and I've been scoring anywhere from 74 to 80. I'm taking my last practice exam now, and then after reading this, instead of cramming, I'll be heading home to hang with the wife and daughter and relax. We'll see.
