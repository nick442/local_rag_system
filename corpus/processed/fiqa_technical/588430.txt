"Using a ""vehicle"" is a common technique to isolate project-specific risk from the remainder of the company. There's not any problem with the vehicle making zero paper profits, it was only ever a paper company. The dodgy bit is when they start offering remuneration to participants based on the vehicle's profits - anyone with any sense goes on gross. Or when they are artificially shifting the profits around for tax reasons."
