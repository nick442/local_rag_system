I live in Oklahoma which most major jobs here do rely on the oil industry. What bugs me is this notion you are stating. For every non American with a job that is a American without period. Second most jobs do give two shits not in my state anyway about education they want to see how little they can pay you. I don't care if the stats say it is 4% I care about facts and the fact is most are under employeed or have stop looking for work. So you think I am stupid for not wanting use my education to work for slave wages. Why two months because all employers look at your last wages here and I was over qualified apparently because I am use to making way more like most Americans who are smart.
