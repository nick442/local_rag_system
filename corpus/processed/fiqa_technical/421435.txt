"1. Medicare Part-D is not Trump fault, for, at least, the last 8 years. Trump wants the national health care system to work, cheaper and better. **But, still, you have to be against Trump despite him yet to do anything about this and not able to do anything because of Democrats and some betraying Republicans.** 2. Global Warming, is the exact same thing. Not Trump fault. The Paris Accords are not fair to the USA, so that's the end of them. Trump is not against anything that reduce pollution and emissions. I see who I have to deal here with: you are true member and zealot of the Church of Climatology. And you just did the work yourself to prove what I just said. >>Do you have any idea what will happen in the world, 20-30 years from now, when we stop raising cows, pigs, goats and sheep? > That would be great but that won't be enough to stop global warming. It is also may never come to pass so it is a bad idea to do nothing today expecting technology to fix our problem tomorrow. So on one hand you say technology will not stop ""global warming"" and on the other hand you want to use technology to stop ""global warming"". Make up your mind! If global warming is man-made, then technology caused it and technology will solve it. > President Trump should be implementing a plan and taking steps to minimize the damage in the future. Instead he is ignoring the problem and rolling back what few preparations Obama made. You just made it up! Trump is against stopping pollution and emissions? Or, again, you just concentrate on the terrible Paris Accords rejected by Trump?"
