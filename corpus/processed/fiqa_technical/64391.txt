Yep - but plan when you approach your employer. Demonstrate to him/her that you are effective in what you do, tell them how much time this takes you in the working week and therefore how much capacity you have. Be very clear to them about what additional experience you would like (within what is feasible, of course) and suggest avenues through which you could be used more effectively. Don't approach your employer with a problem. Approach them with an opportunity. Book a 20min meeting with them. Given them a summary document at the meeting if you think it would help. Don't be scared to tell them, informally, that you are bored - but also hint that you need more intellectual stimulation.
