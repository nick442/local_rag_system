Yes, they have more opportunities because of their families. And I have seen people get promotions and into elite schools not because of their hard work, but simply because of who their fathers were. Look at Trump's and George W. Bush's acceptance into their Ivy League Schools, it was mainly about their father's connections rather than their actual grades in high school. That's why I am skeptical when a 29 year old is promoted to CFO of a billion dollar company.
