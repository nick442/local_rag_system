This will not happen anytime soon. Majority of businesses no matter how advanced automatization is will not be able to replace workforce. Automatization is ideal for major firms and big players who can cut costs and make more profit. For majority of population automatization is not a good thing. It's the best thing for those who can use this as a means to earn more profit. It will create even more inequality. Basic income will not be able to fix this problem because people will then become liability.
