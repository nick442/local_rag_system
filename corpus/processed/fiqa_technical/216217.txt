I like Nathan's answer some, but am horribly curious as to why you have not made payments on a $3500 student loan? If you are wealthy enough to afford a new car, this should be paid off next week. IMHO. Above all else your financial goals should dictate if you buy a new car. What are they for you? If the goal is to build wealthy quickly then Nathan's advice may be to unfrugal for you. If your goal is to impress people with the car you drive and accumulate very little real wealth then purchasing or leasing a car should be a top priority. So to answer your question correctly one must understand your goals. For 2016, the average car payment is $479 per month. If you invested that in a decent growth stock mutual fund in 40 years you'll have around 2.6 million. However, you do need something to drive now. If you can cut your car expense to $200 per month, and save the other $279 you will still end up with about 1.5 million in that same 40 years. Personally I attempt to shoot for $200 ownership cost per car per month. Its a bit difficult as I drive a lot. Also I would not purchase a new car until my net worth exceeded 2 million. At that point my investments could mitigate the steep depreciation costs of owning a new car.
