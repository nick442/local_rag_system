Set him up to take credit cards just as a convenience thing, and he can advertise that he accepts all major credit cards. I've been helping my mother set up farmers to do this at the Farmer's Market she manages. [Squareup](https://squareup.com/) is ridiculously easy to set up. You just need a smart phone (iphone or android based) and one of their little square reader thingies that fit into the audio jack, an email, and bank account routing info. Set up time is ten minutes the first day, 3 minutes once the confirmation info is accounted for. You can buy the readers at Walgreens..Best Buy..lots of random places, and Squareup reimburses you the $10 cost of the reader so it ends up being free. I made a test account and I was able to receive funds directly into my bank account within about 4 days.
