Well, they did a really *horrible* job of not looking bad. They dragged people from two different offices in different cities, bussed them to another city, and had a huge money-blowing event. Then a couple weeks later, they had another one. This wasn't even the 'mission statement' deal, either. That was separate, and a month or two later. Then every meeting people go to, the managers have to harp on them about saving money. It takes some real strong cognitive dissonance to be able to stomach this crap. Don't even get me started on the banners they keep hanging up all over that just annoy the crap out of most people. (those damn things are *real* expensive, too.)
