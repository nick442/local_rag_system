I agree the state should provide defense, legal system, police, and can even provide some welfare. Our current financial system is the most regulated entity in the world, and could never survive without government subsidies. I think we would be better off letting all the banks fail once, and then let entrepreneurs build a better safer financial system, possibly with cryptocurrencies rather than a Central Bank run sytem that has to be tightly regulated and regularly bailed out. Regarding businesses, it is a free choice for anyone to work somewhere. If I start a business and offer to hire you for a fixed rate you can agree, you can also start a different business and compete. Even the largest businesses can lose market share to tiny one-man businesses - just look at how some one-man craft breweries have started taking market share from the largest breweries in the world, and how the large newspapers are being overturned by Facebook - which started as just a few guys in a dorm. If you join a small business to work, you can choose to go in as a partner where you share in the profits and gain a say, but also make 0 money or even lose money if the business doesn't do well. Some are willing to take this risk, other's (like myself) prefer to get a fixed salary. If you want to start a company that is democratic and every worker has an equal say, you are also free to do this, supposedly you could then attract better workers for cheaper and all make more money. Problem is that for most people it is too risky to own part of the company they work in, as if the company goes bust, they lose their job and savings simultaneously, and thus people go for the option of having a job, and investing their savings in their property and some diversified investments..
