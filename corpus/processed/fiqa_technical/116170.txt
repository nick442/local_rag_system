> Darling, if you are not a fan of Hillary (and the current DNC?), than why are you against Trump, who is not even career GOP politician? I have already addressed this stupid idea that someone HAS to like one or the other. Literally the post you just replied to. Both can be (and are) terrible. If you go back and actually read the words I've said in this thread, I've cited numerous things that prove that Trump has no idea what he's doing. If you weren't so busy covering your ears and pretending that you haven't already been proven wrong in this very thread, maybe you wouldn't have missed it. Since you obviously have trouble with your reading comprehension, I won't repeat them again, as to not confuse you. Just scroll up.
