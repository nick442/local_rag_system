I know. It's crazy, if you step back and look at it. The issue is that startup media is really tabloid media. It focuses only on the big, unlikely wins, which appeals to our base instincts. We want to believe that we are Cinderella dressed up in Ruby on Rails. But the fact is, the more you read about extraordinary things, the more likely you are to think it will happen regularly, and happen to you. That's a basic cognitive bias, the availability heuristic. That, and the cooing of venture capitalists, is what leads people to believe that their hobbies or fun non-profit projects could and should make them rich.
