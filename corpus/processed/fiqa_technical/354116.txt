This article might help: https://www.law360.com/articles/733853/good-news-for-foreign-investors-in-us-defense-industry It appears it's the responsibility of the defence contractor to prove it's not under foreign influence or control if they want to keep their security clearance, the loss of which would likely put them out of business as a defence contractor. So if I understand correctly, there's nothing (aside from money) stopping me, a foreigner, from owning a huge chunk of a US defence contractor. They just won't listen if I try to tell them what to do. If I try and force them to do what I say, the US Department of Defence will get angry and I'll lose all the money I invested.
