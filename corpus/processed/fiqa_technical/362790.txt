"You're asking an intensely debatable question. You'll have some people believe that the short-term effects on tax cuts will be an increase in the deficit, but long-term provide more economic prosperity that then eventually translates into higher tax revenue (the Laffer Curve). You'll have others state that it'll simply increase government debt and make us even more indebted, and the benefits of tax cuts will be marginal at best. Large enough shocks, such as a war, cause market downturns due to heightened uncertainty. These are pretty unavoidable (we had a small shock with North Korea's nuke test). > I ask because the economic fundamentals of U.S/Western Europe are strong. Why do you think this? > B. What will be the geopolitical result? Does China back NK to prevent a immigration crisi/power vacuum or do they side with the UN/U.S and allow military destruction of NK in the event of a NK-started war? Also intensely debatable. Does China grow too tired of NK and simply acquire it itself? Does it keep it separate as a distraction to pin down U.S. attention? Does the U.S. pre-emptively strike NK leadership? Does it leave a vacuum there, close enough that China can keep an eye on it, or does it ""surge"" like Iraq? Would South Korea get it? These are extremely open-ended questions that could have debates rage around them for years."
