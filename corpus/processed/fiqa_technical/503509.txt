"Before you jump into Prosper, I highly recommend you to check out prospers.org (not affiliated with the site) to hear about actual experiences of lenders. Bear in mind that many of the borrowers on these social lending sites have already been passed on by the banks, and the ""credit score"" Prosper assigns to them is absolutely worthless. I've done some lending on Prosper a few years ago and stuck mostly to borrowers that Prosper rated A or AA, many of whom turned out to be complete deadbeats. Some never even made a single payment, and Prosper hardly did anything to attempt to collect from them. So beware."
