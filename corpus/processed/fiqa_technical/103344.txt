Any state sponsored media outlet is going to in some way serve the agenda of its sponsor. The BBC does make an effort to remain more impartial whereas the KCNA of North Korea obviously does not. Private media such as CNN are obviously still often employed to further national agendas, especially in areas such as war reporting, but will also be directly more critical of their government if there are conflicts between interests of the ruling party and the owners of the media. Naturally in undemocratic regimes like China and Russia, such dissent is not permitted as there are not rival political partys in any true sense.
