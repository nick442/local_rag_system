"You need to run awareness campaign on Facebook even something like $2/day can have a huge impact on letting people know you exist. Then post frequently, at least 1 daily picture of something for sale in the shop. Second collect emails at the counter a simple pen and paper list works surprisingly well. Get a free MailChimp email account and email coupons once a week. In the beginning you'll want strong offers as you are building the list don't waste peoples time with lame or no offers, come hard with a huge coupon or they will unsubscribe after the first email. This might cost you some money but don't think of it as selling something for a loss think of it as a marketing expense. Try Groupon, you are desperate this is where desperate local businesses go. Make a smart offer limit how they can spend it. I would suggest focusing it on the cold brew as that has enough margin. Partner with local bakeries/coffee roasters/cup cake shops pretty much any one who will have you and give them free shelf space and get them to market to their Facebook/IG/Twitter followers about your location and that they can buy stuff there also. This is huge and you can capitalize your local market. Finally get over the attitude of ""no one supports local"" people don't owe your mom their business just because she's local she has to compete on price, service, and selection just like anyone else even Amazon. So reevaluate your prices your profit margins and start talking to the customers to see what they want in the store."
