There's nothing stopping most of these people from renting or delaying moving out from their parents. If you're broke but keep shopping at expensive grocers instead of minimizing your consumption so that you're able to eat the next day in case you get fired then it's your fault as well for not planning for it financially. People over extended themselves and they need to start accepting part of the responsibility. Sometimes the only way to win the game is to not play. See I can use shitty analogies too when I feel like it.
