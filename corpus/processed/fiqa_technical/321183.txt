Gas tax doesn't go to trains, buses or other transportation. Gas tax doesn't even cover federal highways. It *should* go to these things, but the reality is that gas tax is lower than highway spending. All alternative transportation options are being paid for with income tax. So no, none of the gas tax goes to reduce emissions.
