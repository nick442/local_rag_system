I do understand that, i own a few small business, and have employees. Raising the minimum wage will allow you to have more customers. The reason you have none is because they make minimum wage, the only people who can shop at your deli are people with disposable incomes. Furthermore restaurants are one of the most volatile businesses out there. Its at 60% failure rate. Id get out of the food market all together because its just too much of a risk. Its more about getting a lucky nitch that makes people want to come back, and unless you had something to make you stand out it was extremely hard to keep that going. I know a few people who even had that and failed. Its just such a gamble when opening up an eatery of any kind.
