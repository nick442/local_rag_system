Title is misleading. This only applies to medical marijuana patients, people with conditions/disabilities, as it falls under disability discrimination to fire someone because of the medicine they are legally prescribed. However, if you aren't a lawful medical marijuana patient and fail a drug test in MASS, your employer can absolutely fire you with little recourse.
