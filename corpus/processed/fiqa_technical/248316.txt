heh well your aging faster than I, im not even 40 and this shit is making me feel old. the world is being blinded by bankers and elitists and all people can think about is cats. We have the opportunity to be in contact and perform great things, and some of us do, but then theres the front page of reddit in October of 2012 which is full of cats and meme's. I dont watch tv, im very selective in viewing. And i do understand the internet mentality, i have been a part of it since it began. From 0day to lolcats. I will laugh when some of these kids today dont get the jobs they want because they are online forever drunk, half naked, throwing up, giving the finger to people, lying in gutters, etc. The internet will be real funny in another ten years, when all the people today have internet hangover like it was a bad party that wont go away.
