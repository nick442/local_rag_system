There are software programs out there to do an inventory, but I haven't used them. My wife works for an insurance company, and they have forms and specific documentation for your valuable things. You certainly know what your big ticket items are. For myself, I simply use my video camera and walk around the house as if I was taking a walking tour. On the way I describe what is in each cupboard and chat about it. If I have any idea of what it cost I say so, otherwise I don't Then I upload the video to a website I own for safe keeping. (I have never looked at the videos a second time or told my insurance company about them.) I don't really have much in the way of expensive items. Mostly I take a video of my computers, electronics and my wife's jewelry box. The big point is to get an idea of what is in each room if my house burns down. The video is supposed to make it easy for me to review and remember should a tragedy happen and I need to justify costs to my insurance company. From my understanding, they will replace the value of the contents of my home up to a certainly value, regardless of what it is. So I just want a quick list.
