Yo, pede, are you triggered??!! It's obvious you're profoundly based but you greatly overstate my case .. historically/traditionally/economically, **ANY** president's economy over the first 6-9 mos is driven by the president before him. This has nothing to do with the god-emperor <laugh&facepalm> just historical economics. Certainly there are psychological factors in play, but it's not like flipping a light switch. There's an *enormous* financial mass operating here and it takes a good deal of time to move and turn. So, we good bro? (BTW, re: god-emperor, wasn't that the guy in the *Dune* book who took drugs so he could turn into a worm? Just sayin.)
