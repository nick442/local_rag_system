>Landlords vs slumlords - somehow I doubt if the author lives in a real slum with a landlord that provides substandard housing. Why call a landlord a derogatory name for providing you a place to live>? Because my apartment needed 5 repairs in the first four months of renting. Because my landlord claims to be a nonprofit university (MIT owns large portions of Cambridge) when it's time to pay property taxes but increased the rent 27% over the rent from 3 years ago when they rented the apartment to me. Because renting out housing stock as old as this by doing the minimal necessary repairs to get it back on the market every year is basically just economic rent-seeking on the value of living in this city.
