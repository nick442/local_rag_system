"Then what? I have no doubt Amazon can sustain this for a LONG TIME, but maybe not ""forever"". What happens after Walmart is gutted, and Amazon is on top? Do they just sit there with their high-quality products with low prices ad infinitum? Or do they start taking advantage of their position and ratchet it up? We don't even need to guess, we can just look at the rest of their business. Amazon is already ""turning on"" the profits for the retail side of the business having already gutted many brick and morter businesses."
