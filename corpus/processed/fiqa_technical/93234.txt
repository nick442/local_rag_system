The economy today is quite global, but it's not totally in sync. Unemployment is not dropping everywhere. It's getting worse in the Muslim worlds, South Africa, Venezuela, etc. Trust me: Trump can easily crash the USA economy, or, make it even better. Basically, if countries work on their economy, you can see the results.
