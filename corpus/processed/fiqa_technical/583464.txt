The same can be done in the USA depending on what city and how richly someone wants to live. I went to a fine public school in suburban US and I walked to school just a few blocks, free, as are all public schools. As for medical bills and your best friends mother, it is also not expensive to die of cancer in the USA! But, you did not tell me how big of an apartment can be had in Lisbon for a minimum wage worker spending less than 30% of his income, nor how big is a 2 bedroom apartment there.
