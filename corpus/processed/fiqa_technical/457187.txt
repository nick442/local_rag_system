"So? Godaddy opposes SOPA now but everyone is still rightfully pulling away from them. Corporations need to learn to stop pushing their customers. That'll never happen if you say ""okay"" once they back off. You're still paying that company and they will almost assuredly try sneakier shit in the future. Godaddy, Bank of America, and Verizon are all on my blacklist thanks to the shit they've pulled. I suggest you all add them to yours. Don't go easy on them."
