"Several things the book specifically recommends are either things no actual counterparty to a deal would agree to, or outright illegal. For instance, one of his sage-like pieces of advice is to put a clause in your contract saying ""subject to the approval of all business partners"". Then if you feel like backing out, you claim that your cat is your business partner and he didn't like the deal. I am not making this up. The book's central tenet of ""buy income producing assets"" is a good one. However other than a general recommendation of real estate, it does nothing to specifically help you achieve these goals."
