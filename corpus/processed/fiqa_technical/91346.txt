>sooo if their is an accident, just take him off the job in middle of helping people off the streets, got it. Shifts should overlap. New cops come in. They pass the relevant info and go home. In any case, maybe an exception can be made for an accident. But 200k is not an accident or two of overtime away from what the salary should be.
