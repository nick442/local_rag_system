It is unlikely that the plan is worth doing, given the numbers you have used. However, your thinking is correct that given enough of a rate differential, it could be worth doing. Consider that for each $100k of your mortgage [and I assume your limit for an unsecured personal loan is likely far less than 100k], you would save only $50/year by taking out a personal unsecured loan of 3% and paying off your 3.05% mortgage. Instead, such low unsecured rates may be a signal that it would be worthwhile for you to renegotiate your mortgage. You will likely need to pay a fee, but the savings could be significant. For each $100k of mortgage, a 1% rate change from your current rate saves you 1k per year. So if you can get a mortgage rate of 2% [which may be possible if an unsecured loan costs you 3%], compare the initial administrative fee against those savings, over the course of the term of the renegotiation. ie: $300k saves you 9k over 3 years, so would be well worth even an initial $3k admin fee.
