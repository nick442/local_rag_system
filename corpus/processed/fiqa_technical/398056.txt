You should be honest with smart and knowledgeable customers: you will win their trust and loyalty. But being honest with your vendors is not always a good idea. You can be dishonest with clueless customers, as long as you make sure you don't get into trouble (legal) with them. They may not be repeat customers, but not every business is about repeat customers.
