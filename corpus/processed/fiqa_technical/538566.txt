"He looks like a bitter old fucking Scrooge. Also his argument is complete bullshit. ""I'm going to be taxed on what I am earning so I will have no choice but to make it even worse on myself by choosing to reduce the size of my business so that I earn less."" - yeah sure. ""You see, I can no longer support a system that penalizes the productive and gives to the unproductive. My motivation to work and to provide jobs will be destroyed, and with it, so will your opportunities. If that happens, you can find me in the Caribbean sitting on the beach, under a palm tree, retired, and with no employees to worry about. "" Here's the part he doesn't seem to get : someone will be three seconds behind your ass and take all the business you walked away from - don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out."
