"Most people on Reddit don't seem to ""get"" any system they're talking about, and this is the perfect example. The patent was approved before the sale. It takes about 2 years to get a non-controversial patent in the US. Maybe they were in talks for this acquisition 2 1/2 years ago, but that's somewhat unlikely given the timelines for most acquisitions. It would be so far and away more valuable to Amazon to prevent a shopper at a competitor from seeing that they could get the same product for 30% less on Amazon than to ever prevent someone in their ""forthcoming brick and mortar empire"" from doing it. As far as a brick and mortar store goes groceries is also a very low margin one. Yes they picked the high end market that would be better than your average Safeway, Bi-Lo, or Walmart, but it's also a relatively small one compared to the alternatives and I think it's dumb to expect that to make a difference. Groceries are the ""final frontier"" for Amazon as far as making sure they can deliver anything, anywhere, today. It's basically having cold storage warehouses in every metro area without having to build them. Edit: yeah, there was a missed double negative there. Obviously it's in their interest to keep *other businesses* from preventing people in their stores from realizing they can get things cheaper on Amazon."
