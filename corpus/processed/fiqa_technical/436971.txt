Just to be clear, I've been in the industry, specifically in government and regulatory affairs, seven years. In the US, there is generation, transmission, distribution, merchant function/retail function, and government impositions (fees, taxes, environmental regulations, etc), *just like presented in the image.* In my experience, attributing approximately 50% to T&D and 50% to everything else is pretty accurate (in fact, T&D costs are often higher than all the others). I'm sure our overall rates are lower (depending on location -- Hawaii's rates are astronomical), but I don't think these percentages are that off.
