I'm actually in Aerospace and work as an engineer. Imagine the issues with having helicopters landing on peoples driveways. Here are some I can think of: Safety issues with the blades. The sound of helicopters constantly landing and taking off. Air traffic regulation. You can't have trees on your lawn. No birds allowed.
