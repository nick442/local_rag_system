Florida. Piece work. Gutters. Oh and the industry is in such demand you can company hop all day all over the country. It's not much just climbing a ladder all day in the sun in 110 heat index 100% humidity hardly able to move after work. Oh that's also if you don't mind basically working minimum wage for the first year until you get good. Yeah no medical but no one seems to care if you're a junkie or alcoholic. Or call out every day. Or show up late because you can't be fired because there is no one to replace you.
