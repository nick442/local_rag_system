"Hey Ly Sok, Do you do the standard practice of basically forcing people to go to several random stops, like a suit or jewelry shop, before taking people to their destination? If so, I highly recommend you just charge more and stop doing it. Tourists shouldn't have to spend several days of their vacation figuring out they didn't need to waste time. From my trips to that area the single biggest factor of using a ""tuk tuk"" service was if they made those annoying stops. I get it, the shops pay for fuel, but I'd rather pay you more (it's still very cheap by $USD standards) than to waste time by making what should have a 5min ride into a 45min ride. There's nothing more valuable to me using vacation or a business visit than my time. Especially if in running late to something, heck I'd rather overpay a taxi and arrive on time. So my advice, if you do those stops, make it very clear right when the passenger gets in. Don't try to trick them, people aren't stupid. Let them know they can pay less and spend time going to places you're basically marketing for, or pay more and get to their destination right directly."
