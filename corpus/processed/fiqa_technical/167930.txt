No, it is because Google purchased the software that Orbitz and others used, thereby creating a huge mess in courts that had to be worked out with a number of promises that Google made. Unfortunately, due to a number of reasons (some from the airlines themselves), Google was not able to make good on those promises. Orbitz and the like are angry at this and see it as anti-competitive practices.
