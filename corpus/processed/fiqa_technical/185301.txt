>one of the major backbones of domestic transit in the US is the highway system. No businessman wanted to touch that until the government decided to pitch in and do most of the work. Maybe that's because it wasn't a good idea? What were businessmen building with their money instead of roads? You completely ignore the cost. Governments have no real incentive to be efficient with money. In fact, they have a large incentive to be wasteful! An expensive, shitty road tends to get *more* money. Or look at a police force. Which one do you think gets more money, the one that has completely eliminated crime or the one that is ineffective at reducing crime? > Would it benefit all users equally and would they allow anyone (including competitors) to use the infrastructure they built? Does it benefit everyone equally when the government builds it? Does it benefit, say, people who don't even live anywhere near it? Does it benefit competitors? Does it benefit people who prefer catching trains?
