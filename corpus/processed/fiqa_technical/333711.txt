I wasn't suggesting that. As I said, there's still a place for normal taxis. Not to mention, I'm guessing the incidence of racism is going to be about the same among both ride sharing services and taxis. Plus, Uber drivers can't decide to charge more based on their passengers. This is a straw man argument.
