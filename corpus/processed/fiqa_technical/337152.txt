I am on my cellphone so it's a bit hard to flesh out, but the thought of these cities is that drawing Amazon will naturally draw other companies in, as opposed to being appealing to many companies but not appealing enough for a headquarter move (assuming favorable conditions are not infinite). So for example, If there is an Amazon HQ, there can soon be a Google or FB base nearby as well (think Bank of America and Wells Fargo in Charlotte) and the natural attraction these pose for peripheral/symbiotic firms. But if there is just a small Google and FB and Amazon office, you may not expect there to be as large of an appeal to other companies to move in (Starbucks, Car2Go, Lyft).
