An interesting look that ties in quite a few of my interests on the commonality of being data-driven gambling. You know it's funny because watching MoneyBall, my first reaction is that Peter Brand's (after Jonah Hill) data analysis was something many are already doing in fantasy. But fantasy sports is a hobby for most of us :P Though in bigger money leagues, this could be debatable haha. *As a side note, I'm particularly surprised that the NBA betting profits outpaced NFL profits in 2011 (48.8M vs. 44.2M), but I'm curious to see if that trend holds through the 2012 season.
