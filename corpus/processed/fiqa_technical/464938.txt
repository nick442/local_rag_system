Well, if no one on reddit understands business, asking a question would be kind of futile. It would be guaranteed to be answered by someone that doesn't know business, which isn't exactly practical. (Not saying I agree with /u/illustrationism.) On a more serious note, I think the biggest problem with asking questions on reddit is not that there's no one that can give a good answer, but that as someone who actually *needs* to ask questions (and therefore not an expert already), it's difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff when people respond. Good moderation or a userbase that is mostly experts can make it much easier.
