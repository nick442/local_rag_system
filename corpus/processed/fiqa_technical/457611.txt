Here in the Philippines, the electricity is owned by single company and they charged a lot of other fees like transmission fee, loss in transmission, etc. i dont understand my bill, all i can see are the add ons to the original amount (i.e. Number of kwh x based rate). The rest of the fees are extra fee. I don't know how they do it, but we cant do anything, we want electricity so we pay. Maybe that ls just how the world is.
