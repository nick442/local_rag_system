"The fact that you can't see how ""insider trading"" isn't an oxymoron, because it does not contradict itself, is absolutely astonishing. And then you have the balls to call someone else dumb, all while claiming you can beat the market with your superior intellect. Amazing. >How the fuck do you think these hedge funds and investment banks can offer almost 50% returns during these times in our economy? Why don't you show me an investment bank earning a ""50% return""? In fact, do you even know what investment banks do?"
