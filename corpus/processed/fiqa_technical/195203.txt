I'm not speaking about what's happening. I simply don't know enough about these crazy things. But I speak in general. Man.. no one likes the fruit punch lol. Just because it goes against our cookie cutter nationalism or democratic spirit. But I think if everyone listens to their rationality.. they'll find at least some of the things I mentioned to be spot on. And this realization can help us better use our political system. (Speaking to everyone broadly and not necessarily a reply to your comment..)
