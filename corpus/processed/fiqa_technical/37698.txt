"It's a front; a farce. It's nearly suicide for a corporation (which relies on voluntary customers) to say they're ""against"" climate change - interpret that statement how you will. So they say ""*oh yeah, environment, great stuff, we love it, pollution bad, green good - we'll reduce our CO2*"". So they find some stupid project, reduce their emissions by whatever-% - ya know, throw a couple spare bucks at it, greenwash the shit out of it. And probably get half those dollars back as a green tax credit anyway. Meanwhile, their bottom line and day-to-day operations are largely unaffected. And the costly stuff - MACT compliance, legislation, taxes - the things that make environmental responsibility *really* happen - they want no part of that. So they pay of their politicians to promote that as ""*job killing*"" and quietly let them haggle over details. Or better yet - stall indefinitely. So everybody wins. Kind of."
