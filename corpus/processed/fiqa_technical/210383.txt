My take on this is banks want to bring fear to homeowners to get them to go for fixed mortgage rates which are higher. Also (here in Canada at least) every journalist suddenly is a real estate expert and predicts crashes yet has never written on real estate before. There are also the people that want a crash to happen since they missed the boat on the real estate boom. And not to mention writing country wide predictions is just pointless. Did the real estate market in Manhattan crash in 2008? I actually don't know the answer, but I highly doubt it.
