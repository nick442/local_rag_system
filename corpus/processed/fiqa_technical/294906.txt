I used to work for Wells Fargo, and the part that is most incredible to me about all of this is everyone knew about it happening. I refused to do it myself, but most of the people there that I knew were doing it to get huge bonuses and win trips, TVs, game consoles, etc. Even the upper sales managers knew, they just didn't care because it made them look good and made them more money. I even lost out on promotions simply because I refused to do it.
