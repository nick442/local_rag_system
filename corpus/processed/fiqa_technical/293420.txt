"aww man . . that's really disappointing, I was expecting something a lot more imaginative and trendy . . . Shameless & Ignorant is a really good start . . .but Hitler? You see perception of Hitler is what they have created themselves and as such are in control it, and own it and are not affected by it because it is a reminder of their victory and rewrite of history according to their own narrative. You should try something more personal over which he has no control. Keep the ""Shameless & Ignorant"" then add stuff like Shameless & Ignorant + Bankrupt Charlatan . . .the bankrupt part is a sore point in his history and makes him wince . . being called a fake is his greatest fear Shameless & Ignorant + pussy grabber Shameless & Ignorant + daughter lover Shameless & Ignorant + Jew bitch Shameless & Ignorant + Orange Orangutan Shameless & Ignorant + Retarded idiot Shameless & Ignorant + PePe le Pew (The Skunk) Shameless & Ignorant + little handed man But if diplomacy is your main concern and you would like a retort with something with ""Man"" in it and still sound as if you are talking down to him just go with Shameless & Ignorant Orange man . . .being Orange is something that hurts him at his very core and address his deepest insecurities about his own persona Please, as world leaders it is your duty to put some effort into your insults and lets not degenerate into Your are an idiot . .you are a bigger one . .your are a bigger one times 2 . .your a bigger one million times . . Put your heart into it. and show us you deserve our respect and votes"
