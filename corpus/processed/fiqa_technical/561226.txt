The short answer is, no - if what you're doing is working well enough for you then you don't need to do anything more with your website. The long-ish answer is, you can use your website as the syndication platform for all your social media. Instead of posting all of your writing on each social account you may be better off putting your original content in a platform you control (your website) and then syndicating it out to social platforms. This has a number of advantages - you can customize the way you present it for the audience of each social platform in the introduction you give it; you can bring the interested traffic and clicks back to your website (where you can influence them to your CTAs), and not to be dismissed - if your business is highly dependent on 3rd party services like social media platforms then that is a risk. They may change their policies at any time and affect your business as a result.
