I drive a CNG E-250 van for work. Its sucks. There are 3 stations each about 20 miles apart. I get about 150 miles a tank so I have to fill up twice as much as normal vans and that nullifies any savings per gallon. Going up hills the van has no power. Except for being able to drive in the HOV lane the CNG is horrible.
