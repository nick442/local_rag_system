*ALL* phone calls are intrusive. When they are from someone I know, the intrusion is easily forgiven. When it is from a stranger, there is no reason to forgive the intrusion. When that stranger then tries to sell me something, anything, I am immediately cold to their entreaty. As to alternatives, the [request for proposal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal) is worth considering. When I am in need of something, I invite marketers like yourself to submit proposals. In this case, your phone call is much more welcome because I implicitly asked for it. > if I truly believe that the product I'm selling is going to improve your life, it would be incredibly fucking rude not to give you the opportunity to obtain it. Incorrect. You are putting yourself in the position of the evangelist, so consider the perspective of [atheists on Christian evangelism](http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismatheiststheism/a/ObjectEvangeliz.htm).
