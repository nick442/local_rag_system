"Everyone tells stories so that their side is the good guy and the other the bad guy. One way we do this is to cast good acts as a reaction to other bad acts. They acted first and we are just restoring balance and justice to the universe. >They're strategically aligning stimulus with tax changes benefitting the rich to make it appear as though the tax changes make the economy better, because they know it will make it worse. That is one way to frame the issue. We are preserving the ""norm"" and they are ""changing"" things for the worse. The problem is the truth of the matter is a long succession of back and forth moves. It is trivial to reframe the issue. Take the Affordable Care Act: >High-income taxpayers also help pay for Obamacare. The health law requires workers to pay a tax equal to 0.9% of their wages over $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly to finance Medicare’s hospital insurance. It also imposes a 3.8% surtax on various forms of investment income for taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income is over $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly. Those provisions will account for $346 billion in revenues by 2025, according to the CBO. –[Source.](http://time.com/money/collection-post/4537027/how-is-obamacare-paid-for/) Are they ""benefitting"" the rich or correcting a ""harm""? If you pass legislation which entails spending and your consistent solution is to burden one portion of the populace to provide benefits all around because the rest cannot afford how you attempt to solve the problem, then do you think those you burden might politically organize? Don't get me wrong. I lived in Japan for over a decade and very much appreciated living in a country with national health care. I just don't believe in good guys and bad guys in all this."
