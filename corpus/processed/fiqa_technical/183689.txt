Go buy adsense. you don't understand what you are doing. Where is the video where it is eating broomsticks and ipods? Where is the picture of you dangling a cute kitten over it? or showing how you can use it to make cole slaw? YOu need to *make content* to promote a product on a social network - linking to your sales page is like giving someone a box of nose hair for a present. It will get downvoted into nothingness before anyone with a wallet in Australia will see it. Again - this isn't a bulletin board at Starbucks. Go think harder.
