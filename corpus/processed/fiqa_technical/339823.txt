"Do you think that someone like GM does not create any *indirect* jobs? GM is basically just a final assembler of components made by others. Who do you think manufactures the tires, the light bulbs, the paint, the nuts, the bolts, the wire, the batteries, the leather in the seats, the thread to hold the seats together, the grease, the oil, the radios, the glass in the windshields, the bearings, the alternators, the fan belts, the radiator fluid, the freon, the hoses, etc. etc. Hint: It's *not GM*. Now let's look at the manufacturing floor. Who makes the screw guns, the overhead conveyors, the paint for the floors, the packaging for parts, the plastic parts bins, the safety gear, the tooling, the lathes, the milling machines, the paint robots, the automation equipment in general? Again: *not GM*. And now let's talk about distribution and sales. Guess what, all those employees at the auto dealerships are not counted as employees. All those truck drivers moving cars around in semis? Not GM employees. Contrast this with tech, where I can setup a shop and get going with a few cubicles and a coupla servers and a whole lotta engineers. I might also hire a secretary to answer the phones and a bookkeeper to handle the finances. Long and the short of it is that manufacturing probably generates 1000x the number of indirect jobs than tech does. There's a reason why everyone talks about the US economy becoming increasingly a ""service economy"" EDIT: Furthermore, the comment about worldwide employment misses the mark here. The west is outsourcing our manufacturing. Sure, China and India will end up with thriving middle classes because they're building their societies based on the US's economic structure for the 30 years following WWII. We, on the other hand, are doing the opposite. We're going to end up with no middle class. The only jobs available here will be for a small number of very highly specialized skills (like hedge fund managers) and the people who mow their lawns."
