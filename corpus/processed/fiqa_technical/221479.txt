I can tell you the reason the people who are calling you think you ought to use life insurance as an investment. What they will tell you: It is a way to avoid taxes. What they are thinking: It is a way for me to sell an investment with a huge commission. Whole life insurance as an investment really doesn't make sense for all but a very small minority of investors. If you have people that depend on your income to survive, buy term life insurance. It is much more practical and affordable.
