I’ve seen a bunch of government rfp’s. They almost all have requirements for cobol and mainframe. When the requirements aren’t filled due to skill shortage they close them. Then just open them again later hoping to not have to modernize. I wish entries had the gumption to just go through the pain. Yes it will hurt and be expensive. But you get to survive. Otherwise things will get old and break. Then there will be no one to fix it.
