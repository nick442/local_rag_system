Cultural aspects aside, there are a lot of American universities throughout Europe. Reinsertion into the US market would be my #1 concern but besides that it beats the tons of debt you get in the US while being able to expand your horizons. I just find it very weird more people don't at least consider it and rather make the mistake of paying 60k a year. Or at least go to community College..
