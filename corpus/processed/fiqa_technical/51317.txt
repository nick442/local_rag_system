"What are you talking about??? I think you got lost in the conversation. My shit IS done. The point that was being made is that not everyone has the freedom to quit their jobs when they would like and it can be for all kinds of reasons, many reasons. The suggestion that one could just save up their ""nut"" and quit are the words of someone young who has never had obligations beyond themselves. It's a naive suggestion. I was talking about a situation I was in two years ago. And I found another job, which had health insurance and left the crap place where I was working. Quit barking at me, Foolio."
