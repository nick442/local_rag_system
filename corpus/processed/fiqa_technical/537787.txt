"> Hearing Protection Act. Which is a great piece of legislation, btw. It really is kind of stupid that sound suppressors are so heavily regulated (read: expensive to obtain, not necessarily any harder to get). ""Silencers"" in real life dont work like they do in the movies.. they dont make guns silent, just not (literally) deafeningly loud. They dont make crimes easier or make it that much more difficult to locate a crazy active shooter.. its still easy to recognize gun shots and where they are coming from, they just dont blow out your ear drums as bad and piss off your neighbors when you decide to shoot. Unfortunately though your average person doesn't understand this, and will probably be against a law that actually helps your average shooter be safer."
