Enriched fragments are the few extra lines of text / graphics that include some search results. They are designed to give users a better idea of the content that contains the search result, as well as their relevance to your query. The schema tag, also known as enriched fragments or structured data, is a way to sort and identify important information on your site. Search engines favor additional HTML markup because it facilitates the identification of this key information.
