McDonalds has gone the automation route for the last 30 years, does your mouth water thinking about eating at Mcdonalds? Or would you rather have something at Panera, Chipotle or Five Guys? All of which use humans to make their food. McDonald's sales are flat, all the restaurants I've mentioned are expanding. People will vote with their wallets if they want to eat the food that a machine or a human makes for them.
