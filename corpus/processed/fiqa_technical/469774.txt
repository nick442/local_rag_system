Why should healthy people be required to subsidize the sick? A single, healthy, working young man or woman needs catastrophic coverage only. They don't need: pregnancy, mental health, substance abuse, child coverage, mammograms, and all the other bullshit that Obamacare policies mandate, which needlessly increase the cost. >That's Republicans for you. They obstruct and sabotage the system and then blame everyone else when the system doesn't work. Why are you pointing blame on Republicans? The death spiral started while Obama was in office.
