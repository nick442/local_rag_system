"* SEC. So I guess you're in favor of the little guys getting screwed while Insiders trade tips on stocks? If you bothered to do any sort of research you'd realize that for the scope of its mission, the SEC is not allocated near enough to do its job. The SEC is there to ensure that all play fair, but they are underfunded. *Govt Titty. I have no idea what you are going on about. Try to stay on topic. * Sales Tax. Off-topic again, but please re-examine your exremely demented Libertarian ideals. If you like roads, water, street lights, and not getting butt-raped b/c the police rescued you, then you like State Sales tax; you just don't know it yet. And of course it's their right. WTF. * Enron. Bad example. The SEC monitors trades, so they have the ability to know how many trades an Exchange has done. Of course, they have been underfunded so they don't have enough money to monitor all of them reliably, but more funding will fix that. * Market Death. Are you drunk? No, seriously. I make posts like this when I'm drunk. If not, then please explain how you relate a person dying to an Exchange being stable & trustworthy? * Stability by Change. OK, now I'm pretty sure you are drunk. Geez, it's the middle of the day. ""Stability by change""? Stability requires stability, not change. I'm embarrassed to even be responding to this right now."
