"I appreciate your taking the time to shoot some holes in this oft repeated statistic. However, I do disagree on some points. > Nor is there anything wrong with the person then ENDING that ""business"" and moving on.. to another (different name, different field) business.. or taking a job with some company There may not be anything shameful about doing that, but that scenario is, indeed, a business failure. People do not shutter a profitable (successful) business and then go to work for someone else. I believe a key contributor to the confusion is talking about the self-employed and business owners in the same breath. Someone who's self-employed basically owns a job. His income will always be directly proportional to the amount of time spent working and the company does not exist apart from himself. A business owner, on the other hand, has processes/equipment/staff/IP in place that generates income whether or not she gets out of bed in the morning. These are different people with different goals and cannot be lumped into the same demographic block."
