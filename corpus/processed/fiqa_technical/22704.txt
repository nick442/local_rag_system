> The European economy was not utterly doomed before the Euro, therefore the fall of the Euro does not doom their economy. I'm not sure how that's related at all. Just because at some random point in time, the European economy was doing OK, doesn't mean that it will definitely be ok again in the future after a jarring multi-national currency shift. There are tons of other factors in play. First of all, who's going to accept drachma again? What is it worth? What about pesata and lira? These currencies haven't been used in over a decade. Who is going to value them? Who is going to accept them? What happens when the Greeks default? When their pension checks start bouncing? This is what Germany is fearing. Who is going to buy their products when there is a major currency crisis going on?
