>If consumers don't abandon them after transgressions, then that is democracy. And that would be bad, because democracy in and of itself isn't always an absolute good. If the majority of consumers don't abandon X store for bad policies against Y minority, *Y minority still gets screwed.* That's why we have protected classes, a limited set of them based on biological factors and other criteria - so that businesses can't discriminate against people based on those factors. The libertarian fantasy of a perfect free market only works in an ideal world with completely rational and good people. None of those things are actually the case.
