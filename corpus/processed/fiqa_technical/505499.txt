I'm at our Localbee's for very specific reasons. Not the least of which is that it does monster business, the GM has been there for 20 years and has one of the best kitchen managers I've ever worked with. People keep saying the food sucks and is too expensive (burgers are $10-12 btw not $12-$15 and not counting $6.99 Burger Monday) but I still say the food's only as good as the people cooking it. And the good people are really hard to find.
