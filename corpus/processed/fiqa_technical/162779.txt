If enough businesses behave like Bigot Bobby, then even though everyone is acting without coercion, the natural rights of the Jews who must live as second class citizens have certainly been lost. The fact that private clubs are exempted from these rules makes perfect sense--these are not businesses normally open to the public. It's apples and oranges. And comparing an actual church to a church-run business like a hospital (the type of business affected by the Obama legislation you allude to) is also inappropriate for the same reason. It would certainly be nice to live in a world where everyone was free from coercion of any kind. But unless we abridge the rights of those with wealth and power to oppress others through economic means, the result will always be a large group of impoverished citizens that lack realistic opportunities for improvement. Being FORCED to live life as a second class citizen is FAR WORSE than being forced to do business with people you prefer to shun. Force of circumstance can limit your personal freedom every bit as much as force of law. If you have any ideas about how to ensure all citizens have a realistic opportunity for success without any government intervention in the economy I'm all ears. In my ten years as a Libertarian I never found a realistic answer to this question and that is why I had to move from ideology to pragmatism. Libertarianism sounds excellent in theory, but in practice it would only make things worse for everyone but the very rich.
