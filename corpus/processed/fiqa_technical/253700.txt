That's not what is happening here. The companies are focusing on retained earnings, which are on their books on a global basis. Robbing Peter to pay Paul would be true if the money was funneled from one company to another, to the complete exclusion of shareholders. That kind of behavior has been seen too and that too is unethical and deemed illegal in most jurisdictions. In those maneuvers, management transfers money from shareholders to their own pockets. Stock options issued by tech companies is a good example, though the behavior was far more rampant before they had to declare diluted earnings. The solution is to have a populace much more involved in its country's politics, far lower taxes and a strong streak of independence, libertarians like Ron Paul or Gary Johnson ;) In the current structure of apathy and ignorance, it is the cunning and the sociopaths who rise to the top.
