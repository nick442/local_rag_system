Lol..going on a real tangent here, but why not. 1st: Do we send them aid? If so is it food, currency, or something else? Food MIGHT make sense as long as we are making sure it goes to people who are literally starving (and it doesn't get withheld by the government), currency would most likely not make sense because it would just directly support the regime. In the long run though, respecting property rights wouldn't hurt them at all and could only help, but they have many other issues in that country that need to be fixed as well. The whole reason I brought up the example of Zimbabwe is because Mugabe confiscated the lands of all white ppl (this was a pretty populist policy), who tended to be farmers, gave it to his cronies, and then because the land wasn't being farmed a famine and hyperinflation ensued.
