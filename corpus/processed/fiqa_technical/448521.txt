If the country went to a sustainable minimum wage like 15 dollars an hour we would benefit more. Anyone who thinks the walmart strikes are stupid and they should be fired clearly doesnt understand how the economy should work. You can blame walmart for trying to make as much as possible and not caring about their workforce. Look at costco and how they start all employees off at 12 dollars an hour. The company does amazing still. Also there have been countless studies that show increasing minimum wage does not hurt local businesses but actually helps out the economy. Because those lower/middle class people have a higher purchasing power, do not need government assistance as much, and can work on starting other small businesses that help out. The big nay sayers believe that it will cripple local businesses or increase the price of goods. While goods will increase in price some it is never anywhere near the amount to correlate with the wage increase. Its sad as a country people believe slavery is fine. If you are pro for under 15 dollars an hour, you are pro slavery. Im on my phone so i cant pull up all the fun statistics, but feel free to do the searches yourself. Lots of stories on how it benefits an economy overall. The only people making these facts up are the ones who own the businesses because their wealth will go down and be spread among employees more.
