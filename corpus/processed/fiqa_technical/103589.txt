You need to contact the lender. Your copy of the title should show that your lender has a lien on the car. The potential buyer will want to be able to walk away with good title without risking their money. It will not be as simple as signing the back of the title. The lender doesn't drop their lien until they get their money. When trying to sell a car with a lien to a private buyer, you may have to both go to the lender to complete the transaction. Or the buyer might want to send the money directly to the lender, or may insist on an escrow service. The fact you don't own the car may scare most individuals from the process. You will have to do whatever makes them comfortable. A dealer will not be concerned about this type of transaction, but the fact that most individuals are, may give the dealer enough competitive advantage to lower their offer to you. Steps: Keep in mind that after only 7 months many car loans are upside down.
