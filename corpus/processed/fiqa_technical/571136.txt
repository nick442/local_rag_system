Truth is, doctors are paid too much. Why a doctor in India is paid $10000/year, relocates to USA, and magically becomes a wizard worth x20 more? Anyone can be a doctor, you don't need any special talents, creativity or out of the charts IQ. All you need is to memorize all the organs and all the drugs. Even this is questionable in the age of Google and Dr. Watson. But no politician will touch the subject with a 10-foot pole.
