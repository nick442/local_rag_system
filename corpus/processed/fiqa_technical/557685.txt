A fair number of micro-finance organisations have been listing recently and appear to be offering good yields. So you could simply buy their stock rather than investing directly. SKS is an Indian micro-financier that went public just a few weeks ago. The interest rates charged can be extremely high to match the low yield per lender. As has been mentioned, Kiva doesn't return interest to the lender. However, Kiva doesn't lend directly either. They on-lend to local microfinanciers who will lend at whatever interest rate the local market will bear. The range of interest rates applied to micro-credit loans can be chilling. 45% to 85% in Africa, 30% in India and a jaw-dropping 155% in Mexico. However, these high rates of return have attracted an absolute stampede of investors. In Mexico more than 300 micro-credit banks compete for business. Chuck Waterfield, the founder of MicroFinance Transparency, is concerned that there is an unsupportable bubble. Lenders are starting to take out more loans than they can afford and banks are doing little to curb that appetite for debt. Sound familiar? So, you may not want to lend directly, but definitely consider looking at listed microfinanciers in places like Brazil and India. As usual, though, study the company carefully.
