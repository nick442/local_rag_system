Especially since the 2007 UCS Falcon has been selling for over $1000 on ebay pretty much since it was discontinued. There's clearly a market and it's not like it's the only falcon in town, the 75105 is $150. I don't understand why people are getting bothered by the price tag of the largest commercially available lego set ever.
