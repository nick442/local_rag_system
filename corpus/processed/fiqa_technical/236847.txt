"I don't dispute that. The risk that your data may be stolen from any third party always exists. You accept that risk by using the third party. My point is that just because that risk exists it doesn't mean that ""the security is really bad"". Many IoT devices have shit security practices but Google and Amazon are doing it right. And I'll continue to argue that until someone at DefCon next year proves me wrong."
