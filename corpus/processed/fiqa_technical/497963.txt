You mean the moron prior to the last president? Zero interest-rate policy was enacted by Bush, Bernanke and Paulson. The Fed acted late by most accounts, Bernanke was pushing for swift action when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September of 2008, while most of the Fed did not see the need till the end of 08.
