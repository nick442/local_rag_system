>I believe most of the people you would consider a waste were shaped that way by bad parents, a poor educational system, an economic system that prides itself on giving people as little as possible, and a society that implements emotional policies and glorifies violence. I don't care why they are the way they are now. I just want to stop them from further making society worse >Whether it's for better schools and family services or jail cells and police forces, I think you are going to end up paying for these people one way or another. Sadly, it's currently both. They stay in school and make it harder for others to learn anything and we still end up paying them for family services or jail.
