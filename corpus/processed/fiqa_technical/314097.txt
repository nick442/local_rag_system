I agree with everything you're saying, except: >If your business model can't stand on its own and needs someone to ban another business model your business model is outdated or bad. It's not their business model. It's the uneven application of regulations. Uber is well known for skirting the laws. If they got all the inspections required, met all laws and regulations, etc. then likely pricing would be a lot closer between the two products.
