And I should have known better - a GOP-man just ignoring the facts and immediately swithching to the debaters low point - an ill-informed, ad hominem attack upon me. So I can count on you to ignore the record: 1)Unbroken private sector job growth since January 2010 - http://www.esa.doc.gov/Blog/2012/03/09/economic-indicator-nearly-4-million-jobs-created-past-24-months 2)Highest cutbacks in government jobs occurring in Republican states - http://www.thenation.com/article/167050/red-states-see-massive-public-sector-job-losses 3)GOP NO on Democrat Job bills - latest example, NO for tax credits for companies that bring back jobs to US - http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/19/politics/senate-bring-jobs-home-bill-blocked/index.html But hey --I can count on you either ignore this data or call it Kool Aid
