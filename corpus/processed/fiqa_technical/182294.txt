"Sigh when will someone teach zero hedge how to make a rigorous argument. None of those facts actually prove anything. Heck some don't have anything at all to do with NAFTA. Not a single ""fact"" listed actually makes a case for a causal link between ""xyz negative thing"" and NAFTA. I'm sure a few of them have actually have a causal relationship behind them (I didn't get to read all the links cause time) but they don't even hint at a the existence of an casual relationship."
