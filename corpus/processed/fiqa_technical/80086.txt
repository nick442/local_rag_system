How can this possibly be profitable for both parties if the theater is getting paid in full for each movie? At $10 a month they basically have cut even on a single movie so every movie someone watched after that would be a loss. Unless there's something I'm missing. A movie is $10 where I'm at, if I pay this company $10 and watch 4 movies (1 a per week), how can everyone make a profit? The margins aren't that great for them to be giving super discounted bulk rates either, and most theaters make money off of concessions anyways, so it would end up being the movie productions that gets stiffed.
