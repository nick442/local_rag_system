"It's not possible for them to be comingled. From the IRS FAQ: Does my employer need to establish a new account under its 401(k), 403(b) or governmental 457(b) plan to receive my designated Roth contributions? Yes, your employer must establish a new separate account for each participant making designated Roth contributions and must keep the designated Roth contributions completely separate from your previous and current traditional, pre-tax elective contributions. It doesn't have to be a separate ""account"" necessarily, but the amounts must be tracked separately as if they were in separate accounts: Does separate account refer to the actual funding vehicle or does it refer to separate accounting within the plan's trust? Under IRC Section 402A, the separate account requirement can be satisfied by any means by which an employer can separately and accurately track a participantâ€™s designated Roth contributions, along with corresponding gains and losses."
