It depends. It sounds like they already have the product idea and supply, so it's not a blank slate. When you mention that they are supplying capital, is that capital also going towards your salary? If so, the 15-20% they are offering on top of that could be generous. Compare what you are asking for to them spending money hiring someone to build out an additional product line, which does not involve giving that hire a huge share of the business.
