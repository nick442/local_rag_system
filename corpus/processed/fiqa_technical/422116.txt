Thanks for clarifying. Also, I know Goodwill, and most likely the others, aren't technically one entity, but rather many entities under the same operating name, so there are many CEOs that work for Goodwill. Maybe there is one that heads the whole thing, but I wonder how much is going to all the C-levels?
