This is actually good news. Hospitality/Tourism is a weird industry, where specialized & local knowledge can become very valuable. Sure, it's easy to just go be a waiter for a few months and then bail. It's also possible to learn how to be a full-time restaurant manager, cook/chef, catering manager, etc. There are lots of nooks and crannies, and since every city needs different things then the value of people with local market knowledge is higher than in other, more homogeneous industries.
