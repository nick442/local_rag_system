"Boston here. Cabs here are incredibly overpriced and hard to find outside out a few areas which always have cabs in them. Dispatchers are slow, rude and cabs dont always turn up. Uber has been a breath of fresh air in this neighborhood from a consumer POV. That being said - this stuff with Lyft is some underhanded bullshit. Uber has positive PR already from consumers, which is why they're able to be a business as well as an advocacy group for breaking down taxi monopolies. This kind of shit would put them on the wrong side of consumers, who atleast in the Boston area more or less view them as the ""good guys""."
