Not sure about the book the previous poster recommended. The five questions in the article seem good, a bit shallow maybe, although it is just an article. I sold for about five years with modest success before moving into marketing. Many of my peers saw Solution Selling by Michael Bosworth at the best foundation for consultative selling. I personally also like Helping Clients Succeed by Mahan Khalsa. According to Khalsa, it starts with wanting to help people solve problems and working with the client as a partner, rather than selling to them. No one likes to be sold, but everyone loves to buy. (Sorry for lack of links, on my phone right now.) I'd be interested to hear what books or resources other salespeople find useful.
