"the term ""civic duty"" is meaningless. same with ""patriotic"". Both of those terms are little more than different ways to say ""doing what the government wants you to do"". paying taxes is not some noble, moral act, any more than paying the mafia the protection money they demand from you is a moral act. and I don't believe in a 'libertarian paradise'. Only Marxists/leftists/socialists believe they can create a paradise utopia society."
