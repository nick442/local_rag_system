Suspension is fairly easy to swap out. It takes some time but it's doable. If it's anything like most cars you should be able to swap out strut towers and shocks in less than an hour and even the air suspension components (Which seem to be integrated into the strut towers) should be fairly quick to swap. The complicated part is going to be swapping ball joints, tie rod ends and other steering components. Additionally it will be interesting to see how vibration dampening rubber mounts and other under car components hold up over many years of wear and winter weather.
