I think it looks pretty good. Something about the reverse white typography seems a bit harsh to me what with everything else being in warm browns but that's a quibble. I remember being told in some business course ages ago that one needed to be able to withstand 3 years of few sales when starting a new biz. That was pre-internet. There are probably new rules but I think one should still be prepared for a long wait. People have to find the site. How will they do that?
