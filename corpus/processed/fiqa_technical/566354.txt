The health specs is actually our cooking techniques and cleaning procedures of the restaurant. I'm not 100% certain, but I think they tracked that the E.

And GMO is not bad at all, I never said that, just that the non-GMO ingredients are obviously different, so they're gonna taste different than GMO produce and food.
