I dont think they have much of a choice if they want to deleverage. If they do that, short and long term rates are going up whether the economy is ready for it or not. If they wait until the next recession, they'll have to buy even more bonds. They could just be moving the target up to accommodate for what they (a pro deleveraged fed) considers inevitable rate increases sure to come anyway.
