Haven't read this but will, thanks. I would agree with you that there are certain aspects and forms of private equity that could be considered reprehensible. First, carried interest probably isn't the fairest thing in the world. But that's not going to last much longer. I think you could also argue that SOME hostile takeovers approach the reprehensible. An example off the top of my head would be Carl Icahn and TWA. I would argue on the whole, however, that most hostile takeovers are accretive in the sense that you're taking out management that is either being tremendously negligent, or destroying value all together. In both of those instances you can make succinct and well thought out arguments. But this isn't what's happening with Bain. On the whole I would disagree and argue that PE backed restructurings are accretive to the economy as a whole.
