Would bond holders differentiate in their EV/EBITDA calcs when compared to equity holders when valuing a private company? For e.g. when it comes to a company that has built a power plant, generally equity holders would take an additional haircut/discount for the lack of marketability. Would debt holders do the same? Would there be a higher valuation otherwise?
