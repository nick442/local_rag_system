Skills are not going to cut it. Environment matters. Social network matters. Government matters. So an entrepreneur at aged 7 who wants to stack the decks of becoming a billionaire should start preparing for Harvard. At teens, he (yes HE) should be friends with similar guys (yes GUYS) who's dads are multimillionaires or well connected in politics. Obviously, that assumes the person is already American. (Being in Canada or Switzerland is already going to prevent one from being a Billionaire) If he's not even in America, he's already behind. Non-US billionaires become that way heavily because of being in bed with the government. Figuratively speaking or literally.
