"Great, I wonder how I the customer will be paying for this. I don't know exactly when it happened or the specifics but BOA lost 500 million in some bad loan or something a while back and a month later started taking on fees to what used to be free services. They started charging 5 dollars for a replacement debit card and other stuff like that. Their explantation for it was ""we have the right to make a profit"" when really it just seems they were covering their asses. Instead of cutting costs internally like an ethical/responsible company would, they make their customers pay for it. As soon as my credit card account goes up for renewal I am done with that bank."
