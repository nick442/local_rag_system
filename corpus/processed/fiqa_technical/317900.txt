Your list seems fairly complete. Try tracking a few months of actual expenses. You could do this with an Excel Spreadsheet. Personally, I pay for most things electronically and/or with a credit card (which I pay off in full every month). I use Mint.com to catalogue my transactions and get an instant snapshot of where I've been spending my money.
