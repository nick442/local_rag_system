"What Apple and Microsoft understands, but Sony doesn't, is that hardware is bullshit. Sony is, perhaps irrevocably, stuck in thinking they're a consumer electronics company, not giving a shit about their real job as a content discovery service. Microsoft knocked it out of the park with the XBox experience, while Sony somehow manages to make each iteration *worse.* It's depressing to see so much potential go to waste -- Sony could have an *amazing* experience-driven platform, were they not so tear-inducingly inept at understanding how their market works. They have enough movies, games and music to completely crush their competition, and yet they let it rot on the underdeveloped, user-hostile PS3 platform. Have you ever gone ""just browsing"" on the Playstation Store, or, even worse, tried to quickly find that game you *know* is on there? You'll tear your hair out. At some point, such horrible mismanagement of intellectual property has to be punished."
