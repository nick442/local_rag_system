The CIA employs people to monitor tweets, not to delete them if it doesn't fit with the views of the Democratic Party, huge difference. I would be surprised if they didn't monitor tweets, its a huge amount of free and open information. However, lots of sites, like youtube, have monitors like this to try to prevent copyright infringement, a much more disturbing parallel.
