Volunteer. Find out who needs help and where they need it, as well as what you could do and the things you can offer. I have infiltrated every organization I am connected with through this manner. Start at the bottom, take whatever you can get and then get to know the players. They are not hard to recognize. Once you have access to the organization form quality relationships with IT Staff, Janitors, Secretaries, and Security Guards. From that point on people are going to be wondering exactly who you are but think of yourself as the lowest totem on the totem pole and volunteer for everything. I won't lie, a lot of it will be shit work but what you learn starts to make you an asset and that is exactly what you need to become. If you need clarification on anything just ask.
