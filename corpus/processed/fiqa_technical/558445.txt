"Short answer: bad idea. Most investment advice suggests ""diversify your investments"" and sharing a mutual fund with family members would be like putting all their eggs in one basket. If you admire your father's investment strategy and want to emulate it, get an account with a discount broker and buy some for yourself. Or better yet, buy a similarly-managed mutual fund, and compare results a year later."
