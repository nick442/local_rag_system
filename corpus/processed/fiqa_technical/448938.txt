"The 3-letter tickers are from a different era.. Nowadays the usage of tickers is more of a ""legacy"" tradition rather than a current necessity. As such they're no longer limited to 3 characters. And the characters don't have to be related to the actual name. For example a company named Alphabet is trading on NASDAQ under the ticker ""GOOGL"". It has 5 characters, not 3, and (almost) none of them appear in the name of the company (used to, but not anymore)."
