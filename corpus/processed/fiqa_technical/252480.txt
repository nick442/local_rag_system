To put on essential oils the safest place is the bottom of the feet. So, you must buy doterra essential oils. Why? It is because almost everyone can put essential oils there with no adverse reaction and the skin on the soles of the feet is less sensitive. While a few, like thyme, lemongrass and oregano can feel hot and must usually be diluted, most essential oils are gentle on the skin.
