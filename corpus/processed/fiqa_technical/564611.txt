The point of short-selling as a separate instrument is that you can you do it when you can't sell the underlying asset.. usually because you don't actually own any of it and in fact believe that it will go down. Shorting allows you to profit from a falling price. Another (non-speculative) possibility is that you don't have the underlying asset right now (and thus can't sell it) but will get it at a certain point in the future, e.g. because it's bonds that you've used to guarantee a loan.. or grain that's still growing on your fields.
