Obama never helped with the debt overhand on households as he promised. All the overleveraged household debt due to homes with first and/or second mortgages that exceeded the value of the home was more or less unrelieved by his HAARP program, and other programs that were supposed to relieve overleveraged households. So the debt overhand was never addressed and is still being worked through as millions of homeowners pay down mortgages. It's going to continue for a few more years, until people start building up equity again. This all affects the economy, as consumers have less money to buy things with or maintain solvency, as trillions are still being funnelled to finance companies and investors in real estate derivatives. For example, a large part of the student loan bubble is due to this debt, since many homeowners who would have, in the past, taken out tax deductible equity loans to finance their kids's education, can no longer do so. Instead, a portion of student debt is being carried by the kids themselves, whoo graduate under debt and can't buy their own homes or spend their paychecks, for years or decades. There has been widespread non-compliance among banks with Obama's HAARP program and other measures intended to provide homeowners from the housing bubble debt overhang, but the Administration never followed through or engaged in enforcement actions that encouraged compliance. Those programs were therefore ineffective and/or were always intended just to be window-dressing, or faux achievements. The banks are still raking in trillions of undue profits from overpriced mortgages created during the housing bubble their practices helped create. Those trillions are coming out of the rest of the economy, where the dollars would be better spent.
