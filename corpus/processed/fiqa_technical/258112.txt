"As usual, you're again wrong :""http://askville.amazon.com/opt-out-Social-Security-system/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=1338366"" and [here](http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/columnist/krantz/2011-04-27-opting-out-of-social-security_n.htm) and [here](http://dailyreckoning.com/opt-out-of-social-security/) and [here](http://www.crown.org/library/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=690) and.. well, about everywhere shows you to be wrong again. Google finds this quite easily. So although there are a few classes of people who can opt out, the average person, and the vast majority of Americans, *cannot opt out* since they do not meet the criteria. Most people *cannot* opt out of SS since they *are required by law* to pay FICA by the IRS, as stated in the wall of text you copied without understanding. > **Seriously, you need to learn how to use google asshole. Stop looking like an idiot and posting blatent lies.** How's that ignorance feel now? :)"
