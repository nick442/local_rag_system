The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was not repealed, it was approved. I think you mean that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, among other things, repealed what was left of the Galss-Steagal Act of 1933 (there was another by the same name on 1932). The issue is that soem regulations are enacted and some are repealed. The result during each of the last decades and by a big margin has been an increase of the regulations. And as I said by a big big margin. The rethoric of de-regulation is just political rethoric, it has not happened. Just check the government data. Now, it can happen that some regulations dont matter much and some others matter a lot, so checking the number or size of the regulations, while it describes a tendency, can also be deceiving. But again, since the debate over de-regulation is political they only focus on slogans and not on real analisys. So going back to the particular regulation you mention, the removal of Glass-Steagal Act was positive. If it had not been removed the crisis would have been far worse. If you are interested we can discuss why (I already wrote enough for one comment).
