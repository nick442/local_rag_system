I think you're misunderstanding amazon's business practices. they are not concerned with profits and losses on a short term basis like most companies. typically they re-invest profits back into themselves for growth, which sometimes means they don't show a profit even though they are a profitable company. (however recently they have been profitable, in no small part due to the growth of AWS) this is fundamentally different than operating at a loss to avoid taxes. in the case of the whole foods price slashing, they are just doing it to hurt the competition and gain market share. they also don't need the margins to be as large as whole foods did since they are so much bigger.
