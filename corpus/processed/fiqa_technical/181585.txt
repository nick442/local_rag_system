That doesn't explains the decade in between, the revenue sharing agreement and lawsuit, the competition before the IPO etc. They didn't have the lawsuit and final split because one branch wanted an IPO, they had it because of the revenue sharing agreement pissing off the consulting partners. Accenture does compete with the Big 4 in the consulting space, especially Deloitte and EY. Why do you think otherwise?
