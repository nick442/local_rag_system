>Title is click bait and false. This is only for their own products. Amazon is not the only player in the world not even close. The shear amount of packages Fed ex alone ships is insane not to mention their network. I think what /u/Delkomatic may have meant was anything Amazon is shipping, regardless of who the actual seller is. If Amazon starts shipping all of its listed products using its own shipping company, that's probably a big boost to their bottom line through vertical integration. And, Amazon is uniquely positioned to mandate that all items listed be shipped by Amazon shipping. It remains to be seen whether they'll actually ship anyone else's products and, if they don't, they aren't really competing with UPS and FedEx.
