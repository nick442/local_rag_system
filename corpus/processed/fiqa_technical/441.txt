"Ya it definitely helps, however it's not a must. Being a good leader is more about getting the right team together than being a visionary in technology or something of that sort. I think understanding technology is on the ""wants"" side of the equation, not the ""needs"" for when it comes to a great CEO, that's why the team aspect is what matters most in my mind. A great CEO will build a strong team around him or her and fill in for any missing skillsets he or she is lacking."
