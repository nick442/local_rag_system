Banks make far more money on bad ~~creditors~~ debtors. The interest rates and penalties for getting behind on payments are pretty absurd. There was a law passed in 2005 that made it extremely difficult for people to continue to file for personal bankruptcy, so the banks thought they were safe. This could've been extremely lucrative for them had there not been an snowball effect of the rates doubling thus forcing many to search for last resorts plus the fact that so many houses were now underwater due to dropping housing prices at the same time. If they default then the bank just keeps the house.. win for the bank unless the housing market sucks so they can't unload it and they have to take a huge lose even if they could.
