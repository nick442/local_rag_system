">I'm glad we could have a reasonable discussion without descending into insults and intransigence ಠ_ಠ ""Descending""? You started out intransigent and insulting, so nothing really changed, did it? >I don't know what ""problem got a LOT worse"" during Prohibition. Add it to the stack of a lot of other things you are rather obviously ignorant of then. >Use went down while quality and violence worsened. It was a net social negative, but it did what its proponents intended. Wow. The ignorance there is just.. palpable. >Here's one way of understanding the ""developed"" world: there aren't large areas which are completely lawless. Yeah, so you DID go there, didn't you. Sorry, junior.. no matter what BS you come up with, Mexico IS part of the ""developed"" world. >I guess I'm just one of those sheeple who is concerned about hard drug abuse, and I don't equate them alcohol or even marijuana. You're just a drone like all the rest of the drones.. you unthinkingly accept & regurgitate whatever the current ""politically correct"" memes are."
