"Entire books have been written on how to get to the end of the month before you get to the end of the money. It's a very broad problem. But in your case, let me point out that your salary never ""suddenly disappears"" (unless you're paid in cash and it blew away or was stolen while you were sleeping.) You spent it. For a month, monitor your spending. One approach is to write everything down in a small notebook. Come up with categories like ""Rent"", ""Food"", ""Transportation"" and look at the totals. Over time, you can estimate what you spend in a normal week or month on these things. When you spend much more, you can ask yourself why. It might be because you just splurged money you didn't have on something you didn't need. It might be because something broke, and you hadn't been saving a small reserve month after month to pay for those repairs when they would be needed. It might be because some bills only come once a year or every 6 months, and you hadn't been saving a small reserve to pay that bill when it came in. Once you understand where your money is going and why it sometimes runs out, you can work out what to do about that. It might involve spending less. But that's not the first step. The first step is not to be surprised by ""sudden disappearances"" that are anything but."
