I’m working on trying to find an internship right now! Hopefully I find one in due time. DePaul has a great school for networking, so that’s something! Okay, I’m going to do more research on IB. If IB isn’t for me I decide, what other career should I be looking at that has high income? I’ll definitely get started on everything else you said. My future thanks you.
