Clark Howard talked about a Consumer Reports' test on the subject. Here is his summary: Consumer Reports has taken a close look at the store brand vs. name brand question in the magazine's October 2010 issue. The verdict? Store brands offered taste that was better than or equal to name brands in many food and non-food categories. In general, store brands tend to save you about 30 percent on average over their national brand counterparts. In comparing Heinz tomato ketchup to Target's Market Pantry private label, Consumer Reports preferred the latter. In another example, Wal-Mart's Great Value potato chips got the edge over Lay's, according to the publication. However, Consumer Reports suggests that you skip the store brand and go for the national brand when it comes to mayonnaise, french fries, butter, tuna and peas. Clark's rule when it comes to store brands is to give them a try just once. If you like it, you save up to 30 percent each time you go shopping going forward. If you don't like it, you only lose money once. Many stores even offer a money-back guarantee for their products. So remember, the potential savings can be so great that there's always a compelling reason to sample the store brand. And here is the full article from Consumer Reports.
