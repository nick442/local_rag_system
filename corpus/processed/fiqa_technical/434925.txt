"If markets are efficient they will be unpredictable. If all past information is already priced into a stock then movement will only occur when new information is introduced. Since no one can predict future events stocks will move in an unpredictable way. If markets are inefficient in the short term, people should be able to figure out the long-term price movements. This doesn't seem to be the case. This is why the authoritative book on market efficiency is called ""A **Random** Walk Down Wall Street""."
