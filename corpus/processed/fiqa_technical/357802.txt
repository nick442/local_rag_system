Well they do have incentive, the more volume you trade the more they make in commission. The shop is mostly daytrading oriented but you can do whatever you want. From what I gather, alot of their revenue comes in the form of training programs (although they offer one for free when you sign up, mostly in equities) which are completely optional. Also, they're willing to sponsor me for my 7, which is good. I mean this is a super risky career move but you roll the dice when you enter prop trading, in more ways than one.
