Lets say person A has no problems and has roughly a 100 point IQ. Because their life is fine they less likely to strive for better. Then there is person B with issues, so they have to fight to be 'normal' or smart enough to work in normal situations. Because of this their intelligence is much higher. From that a personality trait is built which encourages them to continue learning and increasing their intelligence. They end up being smarter than the average person on specific pointed subjects. IQ is a bit annoying as it implies well rounded knowledge, but this skill isn't that. It is pointed knowledge in specific areas. I've always speculated that when someone is gifted they excel in most everything and tend to be rather well rounded, but genius is someone who is so interested in something specific that they excel beyond gifted. A genius is someone who can skip steps in these subjects. Because of these things I've always speculated that most geniuses is more likely to be autistic at a young age than not, but details are hard to come by.
