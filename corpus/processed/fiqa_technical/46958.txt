I don't know about that particular program, but more often than training foreign doctors are US medical schools are simply hiring doctors trained in foreign medical schools. Unlike most disciplines, the AMA controls the number of medical students admitted each year to medical colleges. This keeps the supply of doctors down, unlike, say, paw school or MBA programs, where there could be more supply than demand. The lack of demand keeps the wages high for doctors, but the alleged reason for restricting student numbers is higher quality. As far as giving the limited seats to immigrants, it doesn't affect supply. Hiring foreign trained doctors who pass the USMLE does affect supply; that is an example of using immigrant labor to increase worker supply and drive down wages.
