>The internet tells you so much about a person these days. The internet will tell you that I'm a brilliant OS/X programmer, and have been very successful in that endeavor. I'm sure I could score a job based on that alone. Except that's *not me*. That's some other guy with my name. I'm a developer, too, but I'm not *that* developer - I've fooled around with OS/X a *tiny* bit, but not at the professional level. I'm not really *on* the internet under my real name, because I don't feel like splattering every trivial detail of my life all over the 'net. So I'll stick to the resume, thanks.
