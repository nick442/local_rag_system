This is not me but something that I follow quite closely. From a finance/business perspective it will be very interesting to see how online video games will continue to develop into a spectator sport with leagues, sponsors, advertisers, and agents. The prize pool for the [2014 International] (http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/) was over $10M raised by fans of the video game, greater than golf's [2014 Masters] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament#cite_note-immelman-47) which paid out $9M. The video game streaming service [Twitch was bought out by Amazon] (http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/26/amazons-twitch-acquisition-is-about-beating-google-and-apple/) just a few days ago for around $1B. We're definitely in the wild west when it comes to video games.
