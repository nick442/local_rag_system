I guess they are overpriced but usually their stuff has what no one else has or is more advanced then anyone does. Atleast in some way. Like look at psp Their phones are well priced and many vaios are too like check out the vaio s series. Say the vaio z is alot? Yet its still cheaper then a macbook pro. the z is a world class laptop fitting so much into such a thin and light package. Yet a $1000-1100 vaio s packs a wholeeee lot of punch for that price. Their products usually have at least a few features others dont. Such as their point and shoots have had the night vision mod since. Forever. Their sony nex mirrorless camera? state of the art technology. Who is going to pay for all that reasearch andd development? Look at many other companies, they barely ever have new industry leading or future leading features. They have made mistakes in the past such as the proprietary memmory cards.. But what else? Ps3 controllers use mini usb Most of their laptops have both vga and hdmi I think people love to hate sony but they have arguably done more for technology then almost any other company. I would sure as hell pay a bit more for that then pay 2x more for apples new product that is more shiny then the last...
