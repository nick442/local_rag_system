"At this level it's not so much about ""handling money"" in the way we think of it in the first world. It's more like you have no possible way to get enough capital to get out of a desperately bad situation. But if you do get that capital, you can start digging your way out. For example, in one case I read about, someone used part of that $1000 to buy a cow. Then she started selling milk and saving money."
