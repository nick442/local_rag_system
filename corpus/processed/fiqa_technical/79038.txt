I used a large portion of my 401k to pay off my credit card. My intentions were to then use my extra cash flow to build up the 401k again. Unfortunately I didn't learn my lesson and now I'm back to where I started, minus my 401k savings. If I could do it again, I would have cut up the card, kept the 401k and pay it down slowly. Good luck to you. I hope you do better than I did.
