I am a trader for a large financial services firm. Years ago, I got my CFA charter because I didn't have a finance background (I studied computer science). I learned a bit about all aspects of finance and my trading profits definitely improved. I also like principles and ethics associated with being a charter holder. However, I already had a very good job and didn't *need* the credential. I would recommend you stick with it! It is a testament to yourself when you successfully complete tough tasks.
