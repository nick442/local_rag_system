Oh, no, it doesn't. > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_in_Germany > 1st pillar: mandatory State Pension Insurance (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung). This part of the basic social security system. All employees and employers pay a percentage of salaries into this system. So, basically, company has to spend $X on employee's compensation, but employee gets $X-$Y in hands, where $Y goes into taxes, pension funding and so on. It DOES NOT MATTER for a corporation whether that $Y goes into a private pension fund or is paid to government, it only cares about amount $X.
