"You need a right hand. Call him or her the COO or VP of operations or Chief Dog Catcher. It doesn't matter. Your business depends on you outputting your core competency. You need someone you can trust to run the operational aspects of your business. It's impossible to fill both roles and scale to any level. Ninja edit: the other option is to offload some of the core competency to other employees, freeing you up to do what I affectionally call, ""CEO shit."" This is what I chose to do in my business and it has been very effective."
