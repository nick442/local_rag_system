> I rarely go back to the USA but will still have to pay 35% tax.. Only if you have a really terrible accountant! Seriously, the top tax rate that people like to rattle off in these kinds of stories is meaningless. Who pays the top tax rate? No one. Look at the effective tax rate, which is what is actually paid. I think it's something like 12%, which is actually quite competitive. Now, it certainly takes wrangling to get there for a company and it would make a lot of sense to just make the rate 12% and get rid of all loopholes.. but we can at least all stop pretending like corporations are paying 35%
