> the answer is compulsory higher education. And just how are you going to do that? With the huge amount of people who barely can finish highschool, and to be honest, do not deserve even a highschool diploma. And did you think about this: if everyone is so highly educated, will highly educated people get high salaries? Already a Bachelor degree is worthless to get a job or a good paying job. Actually, in North Carolina, a job opening to be a cashier at Mcdonald required a Bachelor degree. As for high wage countries, they have enough of their own idiots who can barely finish high-school and they are janitors, cashiers, etc. When it comes to physically demanding low-skill jobs, they are almost all done by immigrants on a temporary visa.
