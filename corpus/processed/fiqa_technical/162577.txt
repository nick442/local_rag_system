What I want to know is; How much does all this 'competition', advertising, marketing, etc etc actually increase how much people give as a total yearly sum of their earning? If 40 cents on the dollar is spend advertising and 'collecting' more money. Sure it works on the scale of a single successful charity. What is the cost to charities as a whole though? If someone gives away 2,000 a year to charity, and 19 charities all spend $100 chasing that $2000 dollars, they on average can prove they are 'making money' by spending to get that $100 'more'. But in reality, now instead of being able to give $2000 to the needy the person was actually only able to give $100. That is my fear when we start having charities operate as big business.
