"Perhaps just an ambiguity rather than a contradiction - You said, ""at the end of the day, fiat currencies are based on trust and accountability of the government"". You then later said ""I'm not conflating trust of the issuer with trust of the ""bank"". I don't trust either."" The problem there is that, on the Bitcoin side of the fence, there's no one there *to* trust. **You** can be the bank. You can also be the issuer, with enough computing horsepower. Do you, then, not trust *yourself*? Or, did I take that entirely wrong and you meant that directed toward the fiat side of things, and don't trust that Trump won't get us into a currency war with China (or his successor finally authorize that trillion dollar platinum coin to circumvent the debt ceiling - I don't mean that to be at all partisan)?"
