Of course you do. You can sell it, wreck it, do whatever you want with it. Of course, some things may void warranty, or whatever, but since you do in fact own the vehicle, it is technically yours to do with as you please. Did you know that you can bore the engine of a car to increase performance? Not saying you should, there are lots of pros and cons there, and it requires an individual with specialized knowledge to do it, who you will have to pay for his service, but it is doable. Should you be upset that this wasn't already done by the manufacturer? Did you know that lots of vehicles are equipped with gps functionality? If your car can display a compass, there is a decent chance that you already have the basics of what you need to set up gps in the vehicle. Should you be upset that your vehicle doesn't have gps? But you can't boil it down that far. Well, I suppose you can, but it makes everything cost more for everyone. When you buy a Tesla, you aren't just buying a car. You are buying into the company. They make updates, fix programming issues, etc. and this requires access. They chose to market their vehicles differently, and so they sell them differently. Alternatively, they could have 2 separate assembly lines, one for the 60 (discontinued) and one for the 75. Now this will equate to both cars costing significantly more than they currently do, but hey, at least you have the right battery, right?
