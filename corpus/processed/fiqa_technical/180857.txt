If I read your comment correctly, you seem irritated at OPâ€™s suggestion and feel like there is already educational reform happening in pursuit of these goals from the left and a handful of those on the right. You also claim a lack of political power by the left prevents the reforms from taking hold. Is this summary correct? If so, can you tell me more about these reforms so I can read and educate myself? If not, would you mind correcting my summary?
