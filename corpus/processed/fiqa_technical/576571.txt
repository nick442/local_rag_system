You're missing the strategy for the tactics. The *whole point* of capitalism is the improved efficiency possible through the price system of value. The price system of value only delivers this efficiency when free markets exist. When markets are *not* free, then capitalism becomes very inefficient, and you get unemployment, inequality and other poor outcomes. In response to this, people demand socialist policies, and if they don't get them, eventually you get proletarian uprisings against the rich, communism, etc. As far as your attempts to defend David Siegel's ethics, I just don't see where you're coming from. What if he doesn't feel inclined to take my offer? Is he also responsible for my death? But more importantly, *why* are you defending bottom-feeding pond scum like Siegel?
