"Ya it's not really young ""modern"" people buying these houses. I personally believe it's immigrant students, who use their parents money (as a sort of bypass), or just younger people who have rich parents, or get help from their parents. A lot of older people are still buying houses as well. It's quite a stupid landscape, from an economic perspective it's very inefficient, but that's not an issue that directly effects me, or that can easily be fixed. The cheapest you can find a ""decent"" house that I know, is about 2-3 hours north of the city, for around 500k. It's just a different lifestyle; you wouldn't be commuting downtown anyway, but it depends on the person and the job"
