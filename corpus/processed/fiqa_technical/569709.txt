I've lived in a few shared houses in my time. One house had one unemployed guy, two students, and two of us earning very little. We had individual rental agreements with the landlord, so if one of us missed a few payments they'd be liable for eviction without affecting the others. To be honest I've not heard of this arrangement elsewhere. Every other rental agreement I had we signed a joint contract. I've had to pay housemates bills a couple of times to avoid a judgement against us and it was a pain getting my money back and strained our friendship. I'm still owed a few hundred that I'll never see again. In general if you can't trust your housemates to pay their bills you're probably better off looking for somewhere else to live.
