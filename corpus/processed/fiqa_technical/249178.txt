Every time I’ve had to call AMZN customer service, they’ve been amazing. I bought a chair a few years ago that developed a leak in the gas cylinder, causing the chair to sink slowly. I called Amazon to see if I could get a part number for the chair (it was an Amazon Basics chair) and even though it was 2 years out of warranty and I wasn’t asking for more than a part number, they gave me a 50% credit for the chair, were super apologetic and even followed up by email when they couldn’t find the number for me. 150 dollar Amazon credit that I didn’t even ask for. Good shit man, customer for life.
