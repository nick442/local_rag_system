I wasn't going to come out and say that, but you're right. We all know if he does come out with something it will be that we need to make it cheaper to hire people. Now we'll have a bunch of people who have jobs, but are still below the poverty line. He's replacing one problem (unemployment) with another (even more rampant poverty). Not only that, it's unlikely that it will even have an overreaching impact. The unemployment rate in India is 10% and they have very little rules and regulations regarding workers. Borrowing at low rates and investing in infrastructure worked out really well in the past. Both Democrats and Republicans have done it, and it always works out well. I don't know why it's completely off the table right now for them.
