The number of people around the world born into poverty and extreme poverty is decreasing, both in relative and absolute terms, has been for over a hundred years. This is a systematic improvement in the poverty problem we face as humanity as a whole. If you are a middle class american, which based on your comments I assume you are, I assume you make more than $50/day per person in your household. That income level puts you above 93% of the world population. Looking at your usage of 25/50/25 percentile breakdowns, this puts you well into the upper class, and yet you claim to be impoverished. I don’t say this to imply that life is not difficult or that the system is not rigged, but to put things in context. I think there is a valid argument to be made here, but you can’t make it by choosing to redefine words that have real world meaning to fit a narrative you want to tell yourself. As soon as you redefine words for convenience or choose to repeatedly ignore data, you are no longer having a discussion and you are only talking to yourself. If you continue to do this, I will leave you to talk at yourself by yourself.
