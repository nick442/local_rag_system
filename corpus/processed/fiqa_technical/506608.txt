I like the graph! You can see both of the major recessions in the 1970's and the recovery in the 1980's. If you match that graph against the baby boomer population curve and you will see that while early baby boomers bought lots of houses, quite a few pushed into 1980's. Also check out housing costs and you can see the soaring costs due to increasing demand.
