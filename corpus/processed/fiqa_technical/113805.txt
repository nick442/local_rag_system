"More like sales ""guidelines"". The company asks employees to hit certain upsell goals, i.e. selling as many machines with AppleCare (extended warranty) as possible. No specific dollar amounts per employee, however each store as a whole is ranked against all other stores. They don't really get rid of people. If you are repeatedly late, you're gone. If you're a no show, you're gone. If you are like me and revealing corporate secrets, you're gone. But they don't really can you for not being a sales beast."
