"The rent vs. buy ""debate"" or strategy has been a really interesting (and surprising) one to me. I can see both sides. For instance, where I live one of the points on the local politician's platform is that he keeps property taxes low. There are also significant tax deductions in the current tax code that favor the ""early stages"" of a primary residence home loan amortization, where the payments are mostly interest. So such a place might be a more ""effective"" place to live, to retain the most income for some period of time early in the loan term. Often places with cheap rent aren't places someone would want to live..you make important points about problems related to that. Places that someone (with enough income to make this strategy significant) *needs* to live aren't always going to be cheap to rent or cheap to own. For some people in their ""prime earning (& investing)"" years, this is a significant calculation to consider."
