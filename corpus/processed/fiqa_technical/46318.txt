I love Netflix, but mostly for the documentaries. I miss the old History Channel and then later H2 when they were full of documentaries and actually educational and interesting programming. Now they're just reality television like the rest of the crap on cable. While I don't mind the occasional Disney film or other movie on Netflix, I usually still like to own physical copies of movies(like Star Wars) and if I don't care enough to own it, I usually don't care enough to watch it. This doesn't really affect my streaming decisions at all. I still have Amazon Prime(which I've had for over 10 years now because of the 2 day shipping, don't watch much on their streaming service but I have it on my Roku). TBH I can see where Disney may lose money, because I for one have to really want to see something to buy a copy, and I don't care enough about most of their stuff to pay for a streaming sub specifically for their content. In closing, this wont make me pay for their stuff or pirate it, I simply wont watch it(besides seeing Star Wars films in the theater and/or buying the Blu-ray). I suppose I should catch up on what I'd like to see of theirs on Netflix before they remove it all in a year or two.
