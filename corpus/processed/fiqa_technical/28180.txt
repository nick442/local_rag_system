That's right. I wouldn't say that she directly caused Yahoo's downfall since that was put into motion long before she started. However, she did nothing that succeeded in changing Yahoo's trajectory after she took over. Yahoo could have done essentially nothing and it would have ended roughly the same. People are just upset that she got compensated quite well without achieving anything of significance.
