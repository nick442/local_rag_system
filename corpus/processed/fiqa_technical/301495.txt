yeah, yours looks great, Microsoft! Can't wait to get one! Can I order one?.. oh.. it's not avaliable yet? Ok, cool I can wait. When will they start to ship so I can put an order in? You don't know? Oh well - it's cool! I guess..er.. I'll just wait it out. How much will the base model retail for? You don't know that either..um..ok. And you say there's one running ARM and one running Intel. Er.. which one should I get? What's the difference? You can't really demo that yet? Umm.. ok, sure, whatever. It looks cool anyway. Did that just crash? Sure you'll get the bugs worked out before they ship. Umm.. yeah.
