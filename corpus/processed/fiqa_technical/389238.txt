"This ""article"" just regurgitates Redditor comments. And not in a good way. This is the new world, all the technology that everyone blindly accepts as progress leads to and results in this kind of thing. Going forward you will be tracked everywhere you go by cameras using face-recognition software. Every piece of data you create will be saved, and either readily analyzed or available for analysis. Is there a way to stop it? I don't believe so. I don't like it, but I don't see how any law could stop it. And we're too late for social-based solutions. It will only be stopped by a major catastrophic event at this point. Avoid what you can while you can, but as much as I dislike it, might as well enjoy the ride."
