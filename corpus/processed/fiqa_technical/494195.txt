What makes you think anything would change? If they allowed Match money to be distributed tax free, they are missing out on a future tax revenue opportunity. I think the more likely way they would stick it to us is to sunset the Roth 401(k) all together and make plans go back to the old school pre-tax and after-tax only, where even the earnings on after-tax are taxed at distribution.
