Hello, My names Michael and I'm a 19 year old college student. I have recently decided to begin a music production career from scratch. Music is my favorite and only outlet that lets me unwind and truly feel at peace. I dont do drugs or alcohol and my favorite pass times are listening to music and creating beats on my laptop. I come from a relatively lower middle-class family so my parent's arent financially able to help me acquire some of the tools i need to advance myself musically. The funds that i receive if any will be used towards a mini player and better music production software whatever it may be and also some speakers. I would honestly be forever grateful to anyone that decides to donate and help me out. ANY amount would be deeply appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my story and i hope you have a blessed day. All Love.
