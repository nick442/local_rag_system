Comes to about the same? The avg cost per year of studying in most european countries is between 1 and 3k. Some are free. You have to navigate to find the perfect match. Is it easy? No. Is it worth it? Maybe. But it's a joke to even say it costs the same.. aren't you on your own for food and rent in the US as well? If anything, it's a lot cheaper in Europe. People just make it sound like the debt trap in the US is inevitable when it isn't.
