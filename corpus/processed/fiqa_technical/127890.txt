You're licensed to sell investments. You could get a job at a broker or RIA. You can sell stocks bonds funds annuities and work for a fee based ria in sales. You're technically licensed to give advice on investments but without at least some academic expertise in finance I would avoid it. Helpful? edit: you don't need securities licenses to work in a bank. you'll be selling loans which is regulated differently.
