"> How unprofessional. That's Walmart though, right? If they were professional, the hourly employees might be working somewhere else. --- My local Walmart is a real circus. I was there last night and the ""greeter"" allowed a lady to walk in with her Rottweiler. She didn't even have the pretend ""service animal"" thing on it. Just walked right in. Not only that, I walked down the aisle a ways and I heard barking - but not a Rottweiler bark, a Dachshund was barking *at* the Rottweiler from a shopping cart. I long for the day people have to carry paperwork to prove their nasty, obese pets are not true service animals. All the while, for the past 5-6 months (at least) the PA has a buzzing sound in it. It buzzes for ~3 minutes, it's off for 30 seconds (long enough for you to notice it's off) then it starts again. Morning, afternoon, night - it doesn't matter. I've brought the issue up to different managers on many occasions and they say ""Oh, that's just the speaker system."" No, morons. It's not *just* the speaker system. I can't believe the store manages survive any regional manager visit. I live in a tourist area so when it's not completely overrun with out-of-towners, it shows how ramshackle it is. (Oh, and I've tried to call 1-800-WALMART to report the issues, but it's met with a very Sourthern-accented lady saying in some convoluted way how all customer service agents are busy and I should call back.)"
