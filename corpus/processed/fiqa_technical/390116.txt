That was my thought. Looking at it, I'm thinking he's really got two big expenses that he's seeking the money for: New equipment/space to expand production capability with, and advertising funds to get his name out there. He walked in and owned the room. He put his product in front of people, displayed to the sharks that customization was the name of the game, and was all over exactly that core idea with examples right out of the gate. Yeah, he was doing a pretty good job reaching his immediate investor audience, but let's be perfectly frank here: He turned the first few minutes of the show into a commercial for his product that he's not paying for, and it was a goddamned good commercial. Then he turned around and sold himself as part of that business to anyone who was watching. If he'd been turned down across the board after that demo and then his dogged determination to keep himself at the helm while displaying that it really was best, and they'd aired that episode..he'd have had his investors. I don't question that a bit. He wasn't selling his idea to sharks, he was running a goddamned infomercial with them as his props. Even if nobody bought in, he'd given himself a huge advertising boost, allowing him to sink more into production. He was a winner walking out of this no matter what. EDIT: The royalties also made since from H's perspective. If I'd been in his shoes and had seen this guy in action, I'd have been willing to make that offer just to keep him in my pocket. This dude's already proven he has the personal resources to get a venture started at the basic level, and he's on the ball and a sharp salesman. Even if this hadn't panned out, I'd lay good money that that guy was going to go places, and I'd want a piece of the action when he finally had his break.
