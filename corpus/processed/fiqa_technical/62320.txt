If you're selling a product of actual value, and willing to do the recruiting hustle then a Network Marketing Scheme might work out for you. If you can't make money just selling the product, or it's not a product you'd support I would stay far away. In the US, it is my understanding that MLM is legal if your earnings can surpass your sponsor's. Disclaimer: I did Quixtar (Amway online) in college. But I didn't succeed because I didn't nag all my family and friends to join nor hustle the products. I have met folks who have actually done well with it, and I think without really screwing anyone else over.
