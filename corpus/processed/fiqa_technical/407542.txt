"Why are they calling it freelance? It used to be called self-employed. Freelance used to mean low wage or no wage gigs and was all about the experience and connections you made which would help propel you into what you wanted. Now people are talking about it as though its the way of the future? As an accountant, I understand the long term value of labor subcontractors. Pretty much. . . if you think your job can be done at home, it can be subcontracted out to somebody else who does not have to be a full time employee. Kinda like the, ""Can a robot take my job,"" sorta thing? In summary, genuinely good/original talent is wasted on ""freelance,"" because the creator isn't given the tools to make his/her best work when that work is finding them. . . and lining up one after the other."
