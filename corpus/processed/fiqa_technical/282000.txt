Again lots of negatives but no offer of how to bring back jobs. talking down everything and not thinking of ways to activate the job mkt or how to active a new basis for economic stability, what with all the put down everyone else, dont come with feasable answes or any answers at all and quote politicians, geez its politicians who got us into this mess in the first place. i see you are one of the keep the people poor and we can stay rich bunch.bussines were doing fine with US and Euro workers, sure they were not record profits by using slave workers in 3rd world countries, they were not making the highest profits in the history, but they had a mkt, that worked, workers had jobs and could feed a family, buy a house and cars, now they need 2-3 jobs just to survive, retail has crashed and the companies are giving massive bonus'to execs even though this is not sustainable. the persuit of ever greater investor profits has killed the job mkts at home, the retail mkts are now showing the trickle down problems and millions of unemployed and their families are living in poverty in both the US and Europe, WHY? because of the relentless search for higher profits.
