I feel I should respond to you, if not only for our yin/yang similarity in names. I'm also in finance, or rather, a recent grad, and I can't help but picture you as someone who feels investment banking is the end-all career and doesn't really enjoy the industry that much in the first place. As many people mentioned before, attitude goes a long way, but I think you need to reassess whether you actually like finance or if you're in it just for the money. In either case, the motivation should already be there for you to achieve, so what's stopping you?
