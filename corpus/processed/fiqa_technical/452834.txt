The only reason this happened is that they believed they could get away with it. Take that belief away, things work out. Bail them out and crucify the managers and make the shareholders bear as much of the loss as possible - and bankrupt the bigger ones. Really be nasty about it, make them serve as an example. Don't mess the smaller guys. Those are small fry, they were fooled along with the others.
