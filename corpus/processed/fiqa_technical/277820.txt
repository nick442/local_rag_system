What city are you in? > I got a call for contract work and it only lasted two weeks. This can happen. Sometimes contracts don't work out. > With that contract I was finally getting paid what I was getting paid at my last permanent position, but again I did not receive the same benefits as a full time employee. That contract let me go after 18 months due to policy that they couldn't string contractors along. This is very common. Unfortunately due to a court case involving Microsoft contractors 25-30 years ago, many firms limit contracts to a hard stop at 18 months - 2 years. Not all firms have this policy. I am interested what city you are in. My career has taken me throughout flyover country, and finding 6 figure contracts has always been reasonably achievable. Most cities appeared to have a shortage of workers with 5+ years experience in most specializations. Fellow IT contractors have felt that IT unemployment insurance is $45 per hour jobs where you compete with H1B body shops, since those almost never get filled. It sounds like you are in an economically depressed area.
