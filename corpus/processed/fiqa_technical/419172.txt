"Yes and no. Yes, because realism dictates that all humans ARE naturally ""independent"" (and pragmatically whatever works, works, ergo most ""rules"" are *going to be* broken, ergo the fewer the better); But at the same time, No.. because in many ways social creatures (among whom humans -- especially ""civilized"" {aka technology using} humans -- are certainly one, if not THE most ""socially"" interactive and interdependent) -- and all societies have social ""rules"" (which while they are going to be broken, will be largely obeyed to the benefit of the majority). But NEITHER the the libertarian/anarchistic dogma (like all other ""utopian"" ideals, including the socialistic/communistic/egalitarian dogma) are realistic nor pragmatic -- they simply don't work. Now, that doesn't mean you might not see an occasional post from me in some ""Libertarian"" thread; but it probably won't be of the type that you are used to seeing (like [this one for example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/v1zn7/thought_experiment_libertarian_justification_of/)), because I am capable of comprehending and looking at things from multiple perspectives (including the ""Libertarian"" mindset, as well as the ""socialist"" ones, etc). --- EDIT: BTW, I noticed a couple of your posts in this little sequence had been downvoted to zero -- not only was that NOT me, I have upvoted you (hopefully taking them back to +1) -- because this is a nice, civil conversation, and I am enjoying the back and forth, regardless of whether we continue to disagree."
