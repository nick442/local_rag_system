"Indeed, the correlation has been across all stocks and even branching out to other asset classes on a lot of days. As a sort of ""hedge"" I like to use high yielding dividend stocks as my trading vehicles. If all stocks are going to trade in tandem I may as well have downside protection built in. Dividends do that. I gain from a churning market and if I get the macro wrong then I can double or even triple down for the div yield. I like it..so far no holes in the plan have formed up. Been working well for a couple of years. As far as the macro I think the correlation to the euro will break if Italy gets past its late January '12 auction. My whole thesis falls apart if that auction does not snap the capital markets like a twig. I'd have to get more bullish overall. If they also get past the big Febuary auction then I think the euro will be convincingly out of the woods."
