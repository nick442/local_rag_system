"> So.. If everybody took your advice, how would you ever be able to hire other people? I never said every single person needs to open a business. I said we need more entrepreneurs. Your example is implausible, unrealistic, over-simplified, and not at all what I suggested. I just find it hysterical that I get down-voted to hell for suggesting that we teach kids that there are other options besides ""get a job"", and that anyone can start their own business and actually *provide* jobs, improving their local economy. But, fuck that I guess. Go upvote the guy who says the government should just be giving out free money to everyone. Yea, that makes much more sense in the long term growth of our economy. *facepalm* This ignorance in this subreddit is astounding."
