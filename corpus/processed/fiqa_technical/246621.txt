They forgot some important steps. 1) Send white guys who speak fluent Mandarin. Have them pretend they only speak english. The Chinese will chatter away in Mandarin right in front of you, talking about how they are going to cut corners and screw you over. Have your guys report back and make the appropriate corrections. 2)Pay a white guy to sit at the factory while your run is being done. He should spend most of his time at QC. When they build an electronics test rig and 1 out of 10 tests passes, that is not a pass. According to China, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail, pass means it is good. 3)Hire a trade agent! There are people who do this for a living with smaller runs when you can't afford to send a babysitter. China is a tangled web of tiny scams and they are working for you, not the factory. Local contacts go a long way. 4) Overbuy. You need 45,000 products? Order 60,000 or more. The defect rate is higher than you think it is. Plus you are paying for the sea can one way or another. It's easier if it's full.
