"Would the net effect *really* be worse, though? If everyone stopped paying back loans, and banks stopped lending, people would have to live within their means. Prices would fall, and nobody would be in debt slavery for the rest of their lives. As for allocating capital to new businesses, there would still be the option of a Kickstarter-like model, plus both private and public equity (and the rules could be changed so there could be more than 500 investors without being forced public). A lot of options currently on the table would disappear, sure, but on balance, would it actually be worse? As both government and Wall Street say it's bad, that seems to automatically suggest the opposite. There has been a push to make it a crime to walk away from a mortgage, even though banks get the house back! The fact that they desperately tried to paint it as ""morally wrong"" to walk away from a mortgage is a big red flag. In any case, this is all going to be reshuffled in the near future, because of automation. There won't be a need to borrow when your material needs are automatically met; and there won't be much of a point to promising your labor when machines are doing the jobs already. The transition to a post-scarcity economy over the next 20 years is going to be interesting."
