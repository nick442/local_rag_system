I don't understand why they don't just carry it (on a key chain or something). For example, the thing about car keys is that if someone else gets it, they have full access to your car. That is the downside. But the downside of implantables is lack of privacy when you want it (everyone wants it at some time. Has nothing to do with criminality), the possibility of infection, you still have to have it taken out when you change jobs, and also the possibility of someone else impersonating you. The latter can be done by copying the chip data using a chip reader without your knowledge. Also, since it is embedded, it would be up to you to prove the impersonator wasn't you. If that person committed a crime using your chip data, you would be in big trouble. Also makes stalking you easier. This is a really bad idea. Edit: typo. Changed wearables to implantables.
