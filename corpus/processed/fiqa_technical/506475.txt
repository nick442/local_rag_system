Investors already can trade their assets - simply tokenizing a bond is unlikely to make it more liquid. The key to liquidity is having a willing counterparty who wants to buy/sell what you are looking to sell/buy. Because debt can be structured in a myriad of ways, markets for some bonds will be extremely thin, with limited buyers and sellers. I don't see how tokenization will solve that problem.
