Yeah, the 12% assumption is divorced from reality. That is a full 5% higher than the real return on the S&P for the last sixty years. But buying a used car rather than borrowing for a new one is solid-gold advice. It may take more iterations to get to the nice car because of things like taxes, transaction costs, repairs, etc., but staying out of debt (or saving up as much as possible to get a reliable car) is excellent advice.
