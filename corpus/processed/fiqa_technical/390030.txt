But they don't fill the same roles oi society. You can't run into an Amazon that is 5 minutes away and grab a few things you need right away but you can with Walmart. Amazon filled the hole of easy online shopping with a focus on consumers. I understand that they can and could very well take out Walmart at some point but that also assumes Walmart will not adapt at all to the changes they certainly see coming. Assuming it happens soon implies Amazon nailing 1-2 hour delivery really soon. They will also need to have those virtual stores hammered down as well I think, though perhaps not. My point is that it's not nearly as cut and dry as you make it out to be and it's not imminent by any means.
