The correct, legal way to handle this would be to file an amended return for that year (probably best to talk to a CPA). If you don't have the 1099, the IRS has a process to handle that here. It sounds like they would just try to contact the employer themselves, but it doesn't say exactly what would happen if the employer is out of business.
