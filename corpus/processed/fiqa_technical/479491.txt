This is such an ignorant comment I do not even know where to start with it. Democracy, even with all its flaws, has unquestionably provided the greatest opportunity to the greatest number. While equally, demonstrating the best system of self-governance ever known, conceived, or attempted. Conversely, Socialism in every form and iteration across history has only ever produced tyranny, homogeny, oppression, suffering, wanting, regression, and death. Socialism has never worked. Socialism will never work. Socialism is a lie perpetrated on the ignorant and most ill-informed among us. Socialism is simply a critique of democracy that comes nowhere close to offering tangible or realistic solutions.
