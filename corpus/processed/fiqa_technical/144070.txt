"Do you have any idea what a product manager does? It's a pretty accurate description of the job. The PM is responsible for strategy, direction, product/market fit, features, roadmap, and pretty much everything associated with that product. You own the P&L. The buck stops with you when it comes to the product. The ""CEO of your product"" description is the classical description of what a PM is, because you're running an entire line of business that can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars."
