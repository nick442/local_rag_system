"As someone who founded and owns a bakery and employs about 20 people this is my advice: 1. Clean the toilets. Show that you're willing to do whatever it is you're asking your people to do. 2. Solicit negative feedback often and then take steps to act on it. If you don't act on it explain your reasons. Make sure they're good reasons. 3. Deflect credit at every opportunity. 4. Hold people accountable. Being nice to an employee who's not doing their work or doing it poorly is simultaneously being an asshole to the employees who are. The compassionate thing is to make a quick, decisive break with incompetent or lazy people. -Also, being wishy washy is incredibly expensive. My largest mistake early on was not being able to say ""you're incompetent at this job and you're fired."" Instead I gave a wishy washy ""we don't really need you anymore"" and they filed unemployment falsely. It ended up increasing my unemployment insurance and thereby raised my payroll by 3% indefinitely."
