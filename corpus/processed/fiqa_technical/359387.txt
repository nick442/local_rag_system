"> USPS is a private company entirely. That's a bit of a myth as I understand it. It's an ""independent establishment"" unlike any other part of the of the government, but it still operates under the federal umbrella. Congress controls what products and services it can offer, postal workers are federal employees, and it's not subjected to antitrust laws ([per SCOTUS decision](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/540/736/) that's based on it still being a government organization)."
