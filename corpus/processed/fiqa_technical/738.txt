Physical addiction also exists, which exists for pot. I'm sure some car accidents and other accidents have happened, so the drug may not kill you, but the effects can when used in high amounts. > The reality here is that people like yourself think you know things that you don't know. Pot is safe and very commonly used by lots of different people in a responsible and safe manner. Like the high driver? LOL. I don't know a smoker that thinks its not ok to drive while being high. > If you really think pot should be illegal, you should be lobbying for alcohol prohibition too in order to be consistent. At least with alcohol they have rules of when and where it can be used. Pot smokers will smoke anywhere in your face. They get high and drive, etc.. Before you say it doesn't impair you, it does in larger amounts. there is now a large body of evidence to support the persistence of neurocognitive impairment lasting from hours to weeks. It is important to note that in repeated studies, subjects who reported a marijuana “high” were most likely or most profoundly affected by the drug. This supports the link between THC concentration and neurocognitive dysfunction. Residual effects, however, continued in subjects who no longer felt the drug's effect. Thus, subjective return to baseline mental status may not ensure full return of neurocognitive function.58 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12427880 Considerable research into the functional psychomotor and judgment effects of marijuana smoking has been conducted in the context of transportation safety. Research demonstrates that acute cannabis consumption is associated with an increased risk of a motor vehicle crash, and especially for fatal collisions.59 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323502
