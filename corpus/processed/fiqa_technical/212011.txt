> If you can't grasp why bankruptcy has different implications, and thus is handled differently, for incorporated businesses, then (facepalm) you don't get it. Care to explain? AA screwed over their creditors by filing Chapter 11 - and will likely screw them over with more bankruptcy filings. A homeowner walking away from an upside-down mortgage screws over his creditor - the bank. Why is one action more moral than the other? On a side note, house price collapses hurt individuals a lot in this country given that the home represents the majority of most people's wealth. If your house falls 50%, you are hurt for life. You might have thought after you paid it off you could live it in the rest of your life with the aid of a reverse mortgage. Not as easy with such a pricing collapse.
