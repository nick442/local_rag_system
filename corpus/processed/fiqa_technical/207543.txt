My point is that the reason for the increase in income inequality is at least partly related to an increase in regulation which began growing around the same time as the divergence in your graph. My graph doesn't refute yours, nor was it intended to. It was intended to illustrate a reasonable alternative explanation for the observations shown in your graph. Your data is valid, but I disagree with the analysis you drew from it.
