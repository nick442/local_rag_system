You're getting downvoted for telling the truth. Fuck that. Hillary lost. Trump did not bring millions of voters out of the woodwork. He won with only 2,000,000 more in the popular vote than Romney lost with. The DNC missed a golden opportunity with Sanders, and it's as much their fault Trump is President as it is unthinking populist voters. If the Dems had halfway supported Sanders and then pushed young voters to actually get out and vote for him, you'd have a different person in the Oval Office right now. I'm no Democrat or socialist, but I'd much rather have Bernie than the Cheeto.
