"You've got it nailed down mostly and you found some really good insightful articles to help you understand the context here. Dont misunderstand this.. This issue is extremely complicated. The one thing you are I think misunderstanding is that ""closing loopholes"" is a turn key solution and it really isn't. Loopholes are an extremely ambiguous term there's no list of loopholes out there to chase down and regulate for. And even if there was once they were killed more would sprout up. Most of the commenters here want to instead disincentivize loophole chasing by making the corp tax rate equal to those of other countries and removing repatriation tax so money made abroad can be brought back to the US."
