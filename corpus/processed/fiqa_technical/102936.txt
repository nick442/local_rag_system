"> [â€“]RenoNineJuanJuan -22 points 1 month ago Jeez. I'm gonna get downvoted like hell for this but fuck it. I watched the video, and the kid obviously had a multi tool knife that was FOLDED (follow up research even told me that), and he was obviously going through a mental breakdown. People in a mental breakdown don't know what to do, so rather than say ""Suicide by Cop"", I'd say he was so dissociated from the real world he wanted to play out this adrenaline-fueled engagement to see where it would take him. Still sad though. Also, the top comment is bullshit. My brother was a marine for several years and he was taught to shoot at the head and drop 'em. Hmm really activates the almonds."
