(I'm a bot) ***** > The plan would eliminate the deductibility of state and local income taxes for federal tax purposes. > Like the mortgage-interest deduction, which the Trump plan unfortunately keeps, the deduction for state and local taxes was intended to be a benefit to the middle class, i.e., the salt-of-the-earth voters who simultaneously are strongly in favor of an active welfare state and strongly disinclined to pay for it. > Offsetting state income taxes encourages states to jack up their levies: Because some costs are passed on to the federal treasury, Sacramento can get $1 in state income-tax revenue at a real cost to California taxpayers of less than $1. That&#039;s back-door tax-code welfare for big-spending Democrats. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/73pca8/a_conservative_tax_hike/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~220318 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **state**^#1 **taxes**^#2 **federal**^#3 **tax**^#4 **income**^#5"
