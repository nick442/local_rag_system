"India's a very interesting case study. They're economy's exploded and grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade. It's a free market but the Reserve Bank of India's get's weird sometimes. For instance a lot of these crappy and defaulting loans are because the government (Reserve Bank of India) said to fuel growth you have to make sure a certain percentage of your loan book is made out industries we want to develop. So huge loans were made to construction firms, not because they fit the risk profile of the bank or were good investments, but cause the government mandated it. Ton's of horribly run companies got money they shouldn't have. Also, public banks pay a lot less than their private counterparts, so you don't have the best and brightest handing out these loans. India's a fucking mess of laws. Like there's no codified way to declare bankruptcy like there is in the West. So if a company goes belly up, they have to go through this maze of different government offices with contradictory rules so creditors (in many cases, the banks that lent them money) can get some of their money back, IMF said it takes 4.5 years on average for a company to go through bankruptcy proceedings. That's insane! And because it's India, there's a ton of shady shit going on behind the scenes. Up until 2-3 years ago, loans that the banking industry considers non performing (interest payments haven't been made in 90 days) were lumped in another category and hidden in the balance sheet, so the rest of the world looked at this said, ""well, their NPL ratio is only 3-4% which is fine for developing country"" and continued to rate them highly. It wasn't until recently that we figured out the ENTIRE banking sector wasn't reporting their bad loans properly."
