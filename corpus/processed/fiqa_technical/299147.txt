I really like your mindset about this. One strategy I'm going to implement with my job site, without giving too much away, is treating a job Seeker profile and a job provider very similarly and creating a hub for both. It also treats job postings like more of a commodity, and just focuses on other things that I'll get into in the company develops more.
