Disclaimer - I am going to refer you to Fairmark's web page. I have no relationship with this company, but the page is great to show you your marginal rate. Updated for 2011 and you can go back to prior years. I would first ask you what tax bracket you are in. And then, I'd likely suggest you withdraw only enough to 'top off' that bracket and pay the mortgage down. Doing it all at once can create a bad situation, where you pay far more in taxes than you might otherwise. I'd also ask- are your property taxes high enough to put you into itemized deduction land? If so, you have a bit of math to do. That 6% may be costing you 4.5% or less, and long term, you are better off not paying early, although I admit, I prefer to be mortgage free by retirement.
