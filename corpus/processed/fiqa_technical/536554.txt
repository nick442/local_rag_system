If upper and Bollinger bands either converge .. or diverge .., does that mean the market is TRENDING? No - Bollinger bands measure volatility, which is an measure of how much variation there is in the price of the instrument. It does not indicate a trend which means that the instrument tends to move in a consistent direction. When Bollinger bands are close together, that means volatility is relatively low, and vice-versa. They can be interpreted as signals that a stock might move in one direction or the other, but they are not a measure of directional movement.
