>The laws of physics are absolute. The laws of man can be bent and twisted. Come on, you know that. And it seems that Donald Trump follows the laws of man. I'm sure if they are changed, he will follow the new ones. Should he be following a different set of rules that aren't on the books? Where does someone find these rules? >Don't be naive about Trump. He'll fuck you in the ass and leave you for dead in the blink of an eye. Trump is a con man front to back. When did I say I would ever partner with him? His string of failures is enough to show that being a partner with him is certainly a high risk affair, with a very high hurdle rate needed to overcome his track record.
