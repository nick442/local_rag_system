"Are you asking ""what does everybody else do/spend""? I think any amount less that 90% is ""safe"", but if depends on your goals. Saving a ""dime of every dollar"" is a good rule of thumb for retirement, so 90% is left to spend. But I believe that is the wrong way to think about it. You have expenses; some are optional and some are not. The percentages aren't the important thing. What is important is that you meet your obligations and meet your goals. Everybody is different, so I don't think you can reasonably your percent of expenses to somebody else. In setting up your budget, go the simple route. You can always get super detailed later if you want. INCOME As you have extra funds, be sure you have an emergency fund (~6 months of expenses) and a fully funded retirement. Pay off any outstanding debts. If you are so fortunate to have some left over, then revisit the savings amount or become an investor like many people here; or have fun and go on vacations; or buy a nicer car. The point being you will know you can afford it. If you put detailed categories under those main categories, that will give you a picture of where you spend you money and you can fix that if desire. If it bothers you that you spend 15% of your income on imported classical music, you can adjust that with a habit change."
