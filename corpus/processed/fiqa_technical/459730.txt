Americans have this blind faith in American car companies. When I started dating my gf (6yrs ago) her parents were hard-core American car buyers. Her mom had a brand new top of the line impala. That car had so many problems that the cost of ownership had to be outrageous. The one thing that was a constant problem is it had factory 18in alloy rims and the tires kept going bald on the inside like way before they should have. Her mom kept taking it to the dealership to get the problem fixed because you shouldn't have to get new tires every 15k miles. They said all sorts of crap like the camber kit was wrong and god knows what else. I think that was they last straw for them because she got rid of it and got a Kia Cadenza which has had no problems. The one brand I would absolutely never buy is a Chevy. That company has continually produced shit vehicles that cost a fortune to own for the last 30 years. They wonder why they almost went out of business. Well when you can buy a Honda and get 200k miles from your investment without having the car in the dealership twice a year with major repairs and terrible warranties that don't cover shit, people will end up buying soemthing that lasts.
