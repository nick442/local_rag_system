"I agree. This article doesn't even consider the fact that we may be adding different types of jobs, and ones in different industries than those that were lost during the recession. Instead, it seems to assume that all jobs are uniform and that when the economy adds jobs after a recession that they are replacing the old jobs that we lost. That is simply not so. Nothing is that simple. There aren't just ""jobs"" and ""CEO jobs."" The economy is more complex than that. We lost a lot of high-paying jobs in the recession that just won't ever come back--especially jobs at financial institutions that were dependent on mortgage backed securities, a part of that industry that has since shrunk permanently. Losing those jobs were necessary and good for the economy. The fact that the jobs we are adding now happen to be at a lower wage are basically happenstance as I see it. I'm just happy that we're adding jobs. The inequality thing will always be an issue and I hope it gets better, but this article is pretty elementary when it comes to economic truth."
