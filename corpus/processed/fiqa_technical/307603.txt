Invasiveness is a huge portion of why AIM is still around. No real barrier to entry, you can have multiple accounts easily -- so if I want to spin up an AIM account to talk to people I don't really know without risking exposing myself (and my social circle) to others, it's the work of a couple minutes to do so. Plus, it doesn't really track me. A lot of other services make it a lot harder to be anonymous. FB most especially. Most of the rest are either bloated or just missing pretty basic features. I'd switch to Discord for my social circles, but lack of local logging and the fact that it's just kinda wonky (and anything but streamlined in terms of GUI) keep me from it.
