">> Darling, if you are not a fan of Hillary (and the current DNC?), than why are you against Trump, who is not even career GOP politician? > I have already addressed this stupid idea that someone HAS to like one or the other. Are you serious? Why would you vote for someone you don't like? I would never vote for someone I don't like! I can't believe I have to explain that to you. Further, why would you even vote for a Party you don't like? Another question: **I assume you did not vote for Trump. Is it because you did not like Trump?** Do you get why I am asked this question? > Trump has no idea what he's doing. Absolutely not true and total fake news. Let's start with Hillary, who has been in politics for 30 years and even secretary of state: does she know how to handle e-mail(s)? Does she know how to handle Russia? Does she know how to handle Benghazi? Can you tell me of one ""accomplishment"" by Hillary in her long service? Back to Trump: he's very smart, which is mostly to choose the right people to do the work for him. He's correct with his agenda: against TPP, against illegal aliens, against terrorist supporting countries, investing in infrastructure, creating jobs, bringing jobs back to America, replacing the horrendous ObamaCare (AKA ""affordable"" Care Act), etc. **What action by Trump so far show that he's not smart?** Give me one example, please."
