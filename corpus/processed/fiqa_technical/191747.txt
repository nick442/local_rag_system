Decades of research has shown that smoking has no beneficial effects and has many detrimental ones, some quite serious. So why does anyone still smoke? Decades of research has shown that wearing a seatbelt greatly reduces your likelihood of dying in a car accident. So why do some people still not wear them? Many individuals have learned over time that scratching a persistent itch (like poison oak) will provide only temporary relief, ultimately making the itch worse and perhaps even causing bleeding or further damage. So why do people still scratch these itches? The answer to these is the same as the answer to your question: people are fallible. People are often foolish, weak-willed, or simply unaware of relevant information that would help them make the best choice, even if they knew what it was. People do not always do what is best for them.
