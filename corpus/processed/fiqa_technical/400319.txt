Especially because rather than fix true trade deficits (like the US has with China) Trump and his cronies are lying to the public about NAFTA. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said publically that the he has to fix the draft deficit with Canada yesterday (or was ~~tit~~ it the day before?). The US has a trade SURPLUS with Canada. So he's either lying or he's an idiot. Not sure which is worse.
