"Have you lived in Northwest Arkansas? The strangest thing is the forced social separation between Walmart employees and vendor employees (ie. the *entire* rest of the neighborhood). Walmart employees will literally bring their own rolls and hot dogs to a cook-out so there isn't controversy that the regional guy on Ball Park Franks isn't ""bribing"" Walmart buyers. I get where it comes from, but it seems like you have to go out of your way on even your day to day living. Weird culture."
