One small note: If you have an employer sponsored account and get let go you might have an issue. You would lose any funds in the account as of the day of your unemployment if you don't have enough expenses to use it all up! So if you put in a lot every month because you have a large planned expense like root canal or operation then you could lose it all. This happened to me.
