It's a major problem in Chicago and it's not going away. Part of the issue is that any meaningful change would be wildly unpopular for one side. Many people & families desperately rely on their pension payments. There's no easy fix to such a huge gap in funding/structure. Plus why have a hard conversation when you can talk about who's standing or kneeling during the national anthem?
