I used to like Applebee's when I was in Undergrad and Grad school.. it was open late, it was relatively cheap (late night specials), and the food was better than your average college fair. I recently went back with my SO for some nostalgia at like 8:30 p.m. and I realized very quickly that: * Late night specials start at 10:00 p.m. - who the fuck stays out that late to eat on a weeknight? * Food was awful, definitely went downhill from what I remember * And it was super overpriced - like 9.99 for wings as an appetizer GTFO here Applebee's
