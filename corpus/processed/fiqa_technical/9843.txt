I believe the following statement by JAGAnalyst is incorrect: In your wife's case, if you have an HSA and she has traditional health benefits with an FSA, this is not considered a problem since she can only use the FSA money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan. Unless your FSA funds can only be used for your spouse's expenses and not yours (very few employer FSA plan documents state this), then the IRS will assume that the FSA funds are available to all family members, thus making you ineligible to contribute to an HSA. According to the link cited above above by JAGAnalyst regarding Eligible Expenses: You can use your account funds for numerous health care-related products and services â€” for yourself, your spouse, and your qualifying child or relative.
