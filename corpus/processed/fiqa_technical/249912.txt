"~~Don't know any specifics of GE or what they did, but they very would could have elected a carryback instead of a carryforward and received a refund.~~ Edit: Ok, I actually went and looked at the income statements for GE. They did *not* get a refund. They did *not* get a check from the government for the refund. This all took place between the balance sheet and the income statement. It goes down like this: GE has on their books ""Deferred Tax Asset"" for XX billion dollars. This came from a year when they had an operating loss. They are carrying this loss forward as a deduction on their taxes (that's what makes it an asset, it's an asset to the company as it decreases their taxes). For years, they've been reducing that Deferred Tax Asset account, and adding that amount to their ""Income After Tax"" amount. At the end of 2009, the amount they reduced that Deferred Tax Asset account by just so happened to be larger than the amount they decreased their income by due to taxable income that year. No one wrote them a check for the difference."
