The CFA Curriculum is very comprehensive while Schweser focuses on the main major areas. It's essentially reading thousand of detailed pages vs hundreds of condensed pages. If you have 6-9+ months to study and you're trying to save money, go with the CFA materials. If you have less time, I would recommend going for Schweser. Many people I know go with Schweser anyways due to the sheer efficiency. Edit: I forgot that you mentioned you didn't take a finance related degree. My opinion is to study Schweser and if you get stuck on a topic, read it from the CFA materials. The only drawback is Schweser costs money (but it does save you time).
