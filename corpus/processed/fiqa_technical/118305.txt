"My problem with your argument is that you don't have one. I'm sorry you cannot grasp the difference between mortgage backed securities and company stock or the difference between a short sale and buying a credit default swap. You keep spouting unrelated ""facts"" as if the mean something. Did big banks short sale FB? Who knows? Did they buy FB CDOs? No they didn't. There is no such thing. Did they buy credit default swaps? No."
