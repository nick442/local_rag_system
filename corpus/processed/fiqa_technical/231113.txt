He gets a lot of praise, but I'm unsure if it's more due to his own skill or Ballmer's incompetence. Seriously weird decisions happened during his time as a CEO. Even at the time, the Nokia thing didn't make much sense and was very controversial. Nadella is also directly responsible for breaking new ground as forming the first [ad supported operating system](http://www.google.se/search?q=windows+10+ads), a move not going into the history books for the right reasons. But yeah, besides this, he seems to be the right person for the company. During his time, we've also got things like the high quality Microsoft Surface lineup, and the Ubuntu subsystem on Windows. Hell, maybe ads is even what Windows 10 needs, I have no idea. I guess it depends on how the general public takes it, how much people care, versus how much they give Microsoft. Personally it's helped me realize how little I actually depend on Windows nowadays. It's new times now, with so much and so many services web based. The strings that have tied me are getting weaker and some have already broken. Photo post-processing and library management via Adobe Lightroom has been a strong one, but Raw Therapee is becoming very good indeed.
