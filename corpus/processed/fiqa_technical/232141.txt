seriously? local papers are the worst for advertising now. it is a buyers market, i expect many local papers to disappear in years to come. at least with nationals they can get a wider circulation and reasonable ad rates from national retailers, auto groups etc IIRC the NYT did have a local paper group (which was grouped with their boston globe assets?) and sold it off - probably for a big loss.
