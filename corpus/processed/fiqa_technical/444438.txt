"I didn't intend to say that everything the government does is unproductive, but a lot of it is. The government may build a bridge or a road that everyone will get use from, but there will be a lot of unnecessary expense from that. I worked at a government agency for some time, and that's a work that I'd like to forget. Like the day when I got a call from someone who would be doing a ""physical audit"" at the office where I worked. I proposed to send him a file with all our equipment listed, but he said he should do it in person. Two guys came to my office, with clipboards and red pens. They went through the office, taking notes of every part number and serial number they could find. At the end of the day, they had found that the fax machine serial number was wrong, two digits were transposed in the list I had. Do you think it's really worthwhile to pay two people a day of work to find that a serial number in a fax machine is wrong? That's how the public sector works.."
