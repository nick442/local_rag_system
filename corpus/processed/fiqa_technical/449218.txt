Don't misunderstand man, I'm all about alternative energy. I bought a Japanese Delica because they have the room I need and they're stupidly good on diesel. (sadly, I blew the head at Christmas, now I need to get a new one, and until then I'm in an 07 Caravan). I'd like to add solar panels to the farmhouse once all the other expenses are taken care of, and over the winter we only burn wood for heat in a high-efficiency triple-burn woodstove.
