Actually, Amazon is a market place where even you can open a store and sell things faster, easier, and cheaper than opening a brick and mortar store. .. until last week when they made a new rule that independent stores must have the same standards as sales by amazon. Which means returns for anything, full credit for returns, etc. So like the story with eBay which became hostile towards the small entrepreneur. So amazon had a bigger competitor once, eBay, and eBay managed to lose the competition.
