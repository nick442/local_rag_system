"I am doubtfull of this claim. I had a HORRIBLE experience with a dog trainer and I wanted to lambaste her on Yelp. I signed up, and posted my negative review. I also gave 5 stars to two other dog trainers. What I did looked like classic competitor manipulation --critisize the real competition while praising the non-threatening businesses. And yet, my negative post instantly became #1 and is still #1. I thought Yelp had to be teasing me, so I checked on multiple computers and devices without logging in -- my review was #1. Here's how I figured it: I wrote good reviews. Each one took me at least 20-30 minutes, and the negative one several days! I didn't just ""leave a comment"" but explained my reasons and gave useful insight for others when dealing with that person. My favorite dog trainer also has a ""filtered reviews"" problem. She advertises her Yelp page while pointing out to not miss the ""filtered reviews"" section. I took a look at those reviews.. and.. I totally understood why they were filtered. Not one gave value whatsoever. It was just several renditions of, ""She's awesome! My dog loves her!"" Yelp's algorithm has no evidence the review could possibly be real, so it filters it out. I've also read that there has been extensive research on fake-paid-for reviews and they have found telling signals that the writer never experienced the service. I am sure Yelp is also taking advantage of that research."
