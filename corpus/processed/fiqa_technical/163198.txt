Hollywood doesn't care about the message that the films produce, they don't care about the social change. All they care about is the money that they will lose if the industry system falls apart. They are worried that what happened/is happening to the RIAA will happen to the MPAA, and that is what they are trying to protect against. Why would James Cameron go to Fox to distribute his movie, if he could just distribute it himself and keep more of the profits. That's their biggest fear. If they can't control the distribution methods on the internet, then they can't control their inevitable deterioration into obsoleteness.
