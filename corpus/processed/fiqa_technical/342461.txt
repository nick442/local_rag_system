Would if I had the capital it is an intensive and low margin area, it requires serious creativity and drive to do it and often needs at least one person per store that is seriously locally invested. Not sure where anger comes from, just stating my opnion as a 20 year professional consultant who has worked at the executive level for BB, Target and GSK and a lifetime of being a customer. Sorry my opnion is both appreny offensive and entirely incorrect. I honestly don't read much of the retail distribution industry trade publications. I just work here. EDIT: It's important to note that big box reailers and how they treated customers was already on the downslide and had been for nearly a decade prior to Amazon showing up. As such honestly very hard for one to make a direct comparision as the retailers had alredy given up much of thier competitive advantge prior to Amazon coming on the scene.
