"There's a big difference between paying for a properly prepared first rate meal, and paying for a microwave jockey to nuke up your bowl of mediocre bulk pre-made bagged soup, your microwaved baked potato, a chain-restaurant cut of flat-top seared steak, and some precooked bread that was probably delivered a few days ago. The reason places like applebees and bww are failing is because the food quality is atrocious. The food isn't an afterthought, it's the main reason you're there. If it's terrible, there's no reason to go back, and most people have already realized that. Applebees is quickly reaching ""tainted brand"" status because of this."
