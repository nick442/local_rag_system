DFW [reports](http://wdfw.wa.gov/ais/salmo_salar/) show 94% of the fish caught have empty stomachs. While there have been juvenile sightings in rivers, no 'wild' adult Atlantic Salmon have been detected from previous escapes (one was double this escape). As late as 1981, there were efforts to establish Atlantic Salmon colonies in the Pacific. Those efforts failed. So, most likely, it's a temporary thing.
