Probably start by looking up other stores in your field nationwide and seeing how they did. There were three Etsy sourced stores in SF. They all closed faster than stores usually do here. Not trying to be a dick, but if I can get it on Etsy, why would I pay the markup to cover your store's rent and salaries to get it from you?
