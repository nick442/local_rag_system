This is how its done I am a certain french bank, aka sg I have some PIIGS debt, I can use this as collateral at face value (100), with the ECB in order to secure cash.. Lets say I use 1mn of BTPS (italian debt), this has an MTM (clean) of 88. I use that 88 to get me 100 (1mn) of cash, from which I buy another BTPS, for (88), of which I use as collateral pledged to the ECB to get this, get another BTPS. So now I am long 3 BTPS, all pledged to the ECB and I have 36 in cash and I owe the ECB 300+r in 3 years. remember the yield on my shitty btps is a lot higher than the interest on the deposits. Secondly, I have three years, so I don't need to give a fuck about the mark to market on the notes (I could even buy a 2 year and n month note maturing just before). So I can make some free yield at the ECB's expense. Also this frees up 36 in cash, of which I can use to meet short term funding instead of tapping the bond market, this trade can be made infinitely, although the ECB might catch on. You can view it as getting a mortgage on your house to buy another house, then mortgaging house #2 to buy house #3, and so on.
