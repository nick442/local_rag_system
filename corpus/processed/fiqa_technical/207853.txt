You can become an activist share holder with as little as one share depending on your strategy an example of this was Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall (excellent name) vs Tesco (a huge supermarket, think walmart). He purchased one share which gave him the right to table a resolution at the AGM, then used the media to beat Tesco into submission over his particular issue however very few of the institution share holders (think large banks, pension funds, insurance companies) voted in favor so he failed miserably, but Tesco later caved slightly through fear of bad press. Also Carl Icahn is pretty well noted for doing things like this. Regarding the amount of money, you would need to raise a hell of a lot to buy enough shares to have anything like enough of a block to influence the company directly, but to attend the AGM, ask questions and generally be a pain in the ass you only need modest amount of shares, in some cases just one share.
