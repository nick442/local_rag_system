Things like this are going to happen way more if a $15/hr mini wage ever passed. You think McDonald's is going to hire an cashier for 31k/yr when they can spend the same to buy a ordering kiosk that will be faster, not mess up orders, never be late or sick, not have an attitude, won't quit, doesn't need Healthcare, doesn't need unemployment tax, and will maybe need a repair every now and then? Same with using outsourced labor or illegal immigrants. Why pay some 17hr old $15/hr to compile some Excel list when someone in India will do it for $5/hr?
