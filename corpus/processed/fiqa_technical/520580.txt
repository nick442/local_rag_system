No one can afford homes anymore. That's the real issue. Purchasing power. The next generations cant afford to buy a home because they don't make enough money and the boomers have everything already. Until the boomer generation goes away, these problems will continue to get worse. Most people can't afford $450k new construction and have money left to live on.
