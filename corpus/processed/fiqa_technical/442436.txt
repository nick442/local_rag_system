We haven't even got a show with spaceships and other worldly exploration. I miss Stargate Universe. TV is failing because all the programming sucks look at history channel when was the last time it showed a documentary with Robert Mudd narrating heck they don't even show documentaries anymore that is why I canceled our TV my mother in law has a DISH but I have watched it only a couple of times because news hits reddit 3 days before any major station and they are all so biased its sickening. Maybe we need more logging swamping and reality tv. I won't pay for the crap they show these days and I don't there are other things in life I have discovered are way better than TV. My wife and I don't miss it one bit.
