"Can you give me a rundown of what I'm seeing? Is this basically a super zoomed in tracker of a current stock or something? Where a stock fluctuates a few cents up/down on the day, and you just trade before it goes down, then trade as it goes up or what? EDIT: Is this really live? Can you say, ""Yes this is live narwalls"""
