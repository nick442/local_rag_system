Obviously, I am very hesitant. Is there any possible way that this act of kindness could come back to bite the kind person who sends the money? Or does this sound perfectly safe to do? There is some amount of risk. If you know the person very well .. i.e. vouch for his/her integrity and there is a legitimate reason why they can't send it with their name, then yes. The red flags are; So if someone is a casual acquaintance it is not a good idea. You may want to consider this only if you know the person extremely well and there is some genuine reason why he is asking you to do something like this.
