"This is an advanced fee scam you do not have any money in a foreign account nor will paying any taxes or fees get that money. A clue is that the Constitution of the United Kingdom has no mention of taxes and is also not organized into sections in a manner like ""4.11"". If you really want to confirm this. You should be able to contact the UK branch of Investec Bank. They would be able to confirm the means that they would use to contact individuals with account issues."
