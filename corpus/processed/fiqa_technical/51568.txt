Hi, Few basic things: Identify needs and process paths e.g., - customer queries - payments, returns , complains - orders Identify and setup routes : email, phone, chat, etc. Setup escalation paths , e.g. phone triage -> sales department ->sales manager Set SLA(service level agreement) and other measurement KPIs, also set up roles responsible for achieving them. Train your stuff and keep them on constant learning path. Use automation software, there is a number of ready or easily configurable products available (don't want to recommend any of them publicly). You can easily integrate and set up systems like email-to-case, web-to-case, chat, etc.
