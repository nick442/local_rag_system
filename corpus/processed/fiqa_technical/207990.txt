Yeah, I read that sentence a few times and still don't get what he was trying to say. I don't think he intended to say that autonomous vehicles aren't safer. Even the mainstream press is aware that they're expected to be much safer, and articles about autonomous cars usually mention improved safety as an expected benefit.
