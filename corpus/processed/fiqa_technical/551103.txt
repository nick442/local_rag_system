Thank you for this point. I've worked on the front end of union shops as an engineer at several different places. Union workers can be incredibly short sighted, lazy, incompetent and act like asshole. Union leadership can often act as a incendiary agent that inserts itself in-between workers and management. Unions will often act in resistance to the implementation of necessary business practices and block forward progress. This is because management lets them. Managers will often complain about how they wish their plants weren't unionized yet won't even stand up for their own rights that have been negotiated into the management side of the contract. At the first sign of resistance they will fold and refuse to fight for what is necessary for the business. They don't engage the workers and leaders on the floor by just implementing policies with no input from the floor. Any stupid fucking rule or unsustainable compensation that a union has negotiated has a management signature approving it. Running a union shop can be difficult, but it is no excuse for allowing it to harm the bottom line. Any time a plant needs to relocate to a right-to-work state represents just as much of a failure on management as it does labor.
