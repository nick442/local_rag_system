Apply anyway, they can always ask. That doesn't mean they'll get anyone with quantum computing experience to work for $20/hr helping the older staff find their mouse cursor. Think of the job ads like Craigslist sale item postings. A lot of people, even at companies, have no sense of the market and what they can reasonably ask for. So they'll put up ads selling heavily used IKEA particle board furniture for $500 and other ridiculous demands. All they know is the labor market is down, so they interpret it as a free for all. Then bitch when they can't fill a position that couldn't be filled even if these fictional candidates did exist due to poor compensation or the organization being a bad place to work at. When the labor market does improve a lot of these companies that don't have a grip on reality with regards to labor relations are going to be out competed by their more sensible competitors.
