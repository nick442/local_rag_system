Recruiters in HR generally know nothing about in-depth about the role. Trust me. I wouldn't really worry about it. Feel free to talk with them about your interest in financial markets, etc. However, if you're taking to an analyst within the firm then I'd be careful. Don't come across as a know-it-all. The best method to bypass this is to ask genuine questions you have about the field. If you want to go buyside, then do you want to go into equities or fixed income? For instance, if you strike up a conversation with someone in fixed income you can ask them why they ended up in fixed income over equities. How do they think the fixed income landscape will play out given today's low yield environment? How are they dealing with the current macropolitical uncertainty?
