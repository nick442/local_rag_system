Reminds me when people complain about not being able to retire but they never invested in any indexes or have a 401K. Like no shit you have no money you didn't plan well, why should I be taxed higher bc I did. I use dividends to reinvests back into stocks or indexes. Capital income isnt the problem its financial education. Dont be upset I know how to handle my money; people should be educated better on financial planning. Teach that in public schools and embrace people investing money, not make out the rich as some kind of criminal. I can agree inherited wealth is bullshit but being self made and investing well shouldn't be looked down upon because people struggle with the realism that its their fault they dont have money to retire. Life is a bunch of opportunities and choices and yes some people get spoon fed opportunities but it's still a choice to be financially responsible. Stop blaming the rich and educate the working poor and below poverty level how to financially plan their future.
