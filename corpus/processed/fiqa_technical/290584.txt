There may be specific answers that can be determined based on the interest rates, amounts, tax provisions, etc. But I'm here to tell you.. It is much easier (i.e., less stressful) to own a home when you have less debt. Pay off any and every debt you can before purchasing a home because there will always be something requiring you to spend money once you own one.
