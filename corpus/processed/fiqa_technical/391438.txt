My initial point was simply that giving a discount on something a person must buy is almost the same as giving them more money. My secondary point was that the difference between the two approaches is that a discount creates an incentive for consumption, whereas a straight payout does not. I don't think cheaper energy will solve income inequality, just like cheaper consumer goods didn't. I don't think anyone is seriously working on a solution to income inequality, because what they're _actually_ working on are incentives for greater consumption. That's because without powerful incentives us common peasants are a pain in the ass who get uppity ideas about fixing inequality. Basically, I'm agreeing with you politically while quibbling over a minor point that is of little consequence. My initial point was needless semantics, and I should have just not bothered.
