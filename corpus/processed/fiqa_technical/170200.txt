take what you can get man. first off if you're offered a good job then take it. I dont know what kind of school you went to and i dont know pay scales in reno area. i am super close to nyc and if a good company gave me 40-50k i would take it in a heartbeat and my cost of living, i would assume is higher than Reno's. You would be really selling yourself short if you turned down a job because they offered you less than what you expected. 40k seems reasonable for now but whats more valuable is experience which will lead to a job that pays you what you really want.
