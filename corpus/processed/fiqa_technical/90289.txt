>I was referring to earlier whose large legal department said we were legally safe to hire only christian salesmen and board members. Safe until someone decides to challenge them with a lawsuit. Which they may or may not win. But Title VII is pretty thin legal protection for an insurance company given that they, as you noted, primarily sell insurance. I would think much of the safety comes from economic incentives, or the lack there of for a non-christian salesman. Assuming they are operating in their own interest, no salesman who earns off of commission would want a handicap right out of the gate when dealing with christian customers.
