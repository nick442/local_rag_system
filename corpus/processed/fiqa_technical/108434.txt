> So, why are you against Trump? I've answered almost all your questions up until this point. How about you answer my two? 1) [Did President Trump say he thought Medicare Part-D should use its market share to negotiate drug prices, enter a room with executives from the pharmaceutical industry, and then come out saying he now opposed Medicare doing so](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-trump-drug-costs-20170202-story.html)? Yes or no? 2) Has President Trump created, championed, or even backed any policy that would require the United States to take active steps to prepare for the upcoming problems caused by global warming? Yes or no?
