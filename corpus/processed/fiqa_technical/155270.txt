I'm happy you brought this up. 1. Deficits have proven to be far higher during Republican administrations (Reagan/BushI tripled it, Bush II doubled it, etc.). 2. The deficit has been large under Obama, but most of this has been [proven](http://crooksandliars.com/jon-perr/republican-debt-orgy-pictures) to be a result of policies enacted by Bush and the Great Recession. 3. The deficit has shrunk from over $1.6t to a projected $500b during Obama's tenure.
