CFD's are highly speculative so they should represent a very small proportion of your asset allocation(4% or less). If you need the 100 for food or rent then definitely not. However if you have some money spare that you could afford to lose(you will definitely need more than 100) and you are prepared to put the time and effort it to learn and manage your risks carefully then there is no reason why you shouldn't try it. I would advise against trading on a demo account for learning. Most of what you need to learn is how to stick to your plan while under emotional pressure. I also wouldn't call it gambling but managing risk. The best traders only win half of their trades so they might have a losing streak of 5, 10 or 20 trades. If they are trading 5% of their capital with each trade then poof they're out. Their winning trades might make 10-100 times the amount risked so they know that it is more profitable to always only risk around 1%. Sticking to that requires discipline.
