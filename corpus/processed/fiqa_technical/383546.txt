It's a genuine dilemma of politics that valid criticisms often do sound derogatory. I've known people like this- I had a cousin who was struggling with getting a career started, but who dismissed any attempts to help him as arrogant. And if he engaged in destructive behavior, well, it was always everyone elses' fault for not being nice enough laying out alternatives for him. Sometimes adulthood means swallowing pride and doing the right thing, but it's a step many can't take. *That's* the mental box a lot of people put themselves in- to take conversations premised on perfectly relevant points, such as the historically unprecedented incompetence of a candidate, and short-circuit them so that they are about hurt feelings and tribal identity instead of that candidate's qualifications.
