That's an interesting statistic, that 3% of users generate nearly all revenue. Their S-1 filing shows that in the quarter ending Sep 2011, they had 150M monthly unique users, and generated $292M in revenue (excludes advertising). If 3% of users pay for that revenue, that's $64.88 per quarter, or $21.63 per month. I think it's going to be a real test trying to double the number of customers willing to pay that every month. I'm sure that some money will come from brick and mortar. However, brick and mortar retailers may have a difficult time convincing customers that Zynga gold is a valuable addition to a purchase, since 97% of people choose not to purchase Zynga gold.
