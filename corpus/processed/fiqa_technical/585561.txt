"Really not a great time to do this. It's like Magic Johnson admitting in court that he had sex with around 2000 women when he was being sued for giving a woman HIV. Now is not the time to say that Irving, simply saying ""a good number of women"" instead of letting on that it was in the quadruple digits may have won you that case. Not really an analogous case but just two cases of dudes that don't know when to lay low."
