"For starters, if you're not making any money doing something, it's a hobby. It sounds like you want to work for the current owners making THEM money as a hobby. If that floats your boat, go crazy. Show enough motivation and they may offer to ""sell"" you the business for $1, or some other surprisingly low dollar figure. This will seem like a gift worth dropping out of school for, but be extremely careful before getting excited. Odds are when you take over the business, you end up assuming their debts too. Mortgages, rent payments, back payroll, equipment loans/leases, and possibly any back/late payments from before your takeover. Use your first few weeks as an academic study ""for a school project"". Get a copy of their books, find out where the consistent money is and see how to grow that. They may be selling games at a loss because their crowd consistently buys enough beer to cover expenses. Or maybe the money from that stupid crane game covers the electric bill for the whole place because Bill has a problem. Learn, study, and ask more for information as payment than cash. The only way it make real money is to actually take over ownership of the place, so take the long view and build toward that instead of a salaried manager gig or something."
