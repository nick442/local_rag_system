We are about to have a 1.4 million headcount shortfall in software development by 2020, many of those jobs earn over twice the average household income. So while you may claim software wealth peaked in the 90s, that's false. The problem is it takes decades for companies to churn out tons of millionaires, there really are no overnight successes and most people in the industry are mediocre. So for an accurate comparison you need to look at facebook, twitter and other social sites from the 00's and uber, airbnb and slack 10 years from now. The gaps are the result of the crashes in 01 and 08. Also most people struggle with basic computer operation without a GUI, programming is not for everyone.
