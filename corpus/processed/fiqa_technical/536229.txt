A cash management account from an investment firm like Fidelity or Schwab will do that: you can access funds by check or ATM and get a bit of interest. The interest rates are very low. Or you could put it in a money market account and access it by check with a slightly less worse interest rate. You can pursue higher returns by investing part of the money, but with increasing risk as you seek higher returns. Options include putting some of the money into a short term bond fund, for example.
