"> If we agree that there are no state bailouts in ""pure"" capitalism, then please never again in your life disregard this argument when you hear it from a socialist. The difference is the US does not claim to possess nor claim to be pursuing a purely capitalistic economy. Elementary schools in the US correctly teach that the US has a ""mixed"" economy. On the other hand, Communist\socialist nations DID claim they were in possession or pursuit of communist\socialist economies."
