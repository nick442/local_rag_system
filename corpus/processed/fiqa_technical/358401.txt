In places like the midwest city where I live, this is false, the cost of living is low. I pay 340 a month, have a yard, kitchen, own bathroom, jam room, bedroom, own shower, great neighborhood downtown etc. When I started out, I made minimum wage and lived with roommates in the same nice neighborhood. This is just false.
