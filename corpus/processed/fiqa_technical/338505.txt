I got my degree in chemistry because I didn't know wha I wanted to do but I wanted to challenge myself. It didn't end up being an advantage. I encourage you to consider your major an investment in your future career rather than as a way to challenge yourself. Look at the jobs out there and pick a few paths for yourself, then see which major best fits into ALL the paths you're interested in. You can always do a math minor (which you may reconsider when you hit the crossroads of linear algebra and differential equations). Take advantage of internships, network. A degree is nice piece of paper but most of what you learn in college just doesn't apply to working a real job. Keep that in perspective! But also enjoy yourself.
