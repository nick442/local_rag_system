"Well, they can. Up to six years in many countries. There can be consequences. If you went to the dentist three years ago, were happy with the bill and returned every six months, and the dentist informs you that your six $200 bills should have each been $1,200 then it is obvious that you would have looked for another dentist if the first bill had been correct; in that case you have a very good reason to refuse to pay the difference on the other five bills. (That's if you were not aware that the bill was wrong. If every time he fixed your teeth and the bill says ""examining your teeth"" which you would expect to be a lot cheaper, then maybe you should have known that the bill was wrong. Just an example)."
