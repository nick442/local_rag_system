I would think a depressed housing market might be the BEST time to buy, is this not correct? There are foreclosures where banks are letting houses go for half of their standard value, and are offering some of the lowest interest rates ever. In a strong economy you could be looking at around 10% APR, I see this as a situation where it's a buy low sort of time.
