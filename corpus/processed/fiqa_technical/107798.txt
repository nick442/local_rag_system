'Free trade' has been, in my view, a complete disaster. We keep being told about all the benefits- cheap garbage products- but a guy without a job doesn't really care how cheap goods are. And rising wages over-seas? Whenever a country attempts to raise wages the jobs shift to whatever country happens to have the cheapest labor. It has always been a race to the bottom- a means for those with a lot to get more.
