This is more anecdata in support of an interesting point: most of the wealthy are no smarter than rhe average dumbass, and just as susceptible to hysterical demagoguery. If Obama had raised taxes on the wealthy - Congress made that inpossible - the rates would have gone up to where they were under Clinton, or during the mid-Reagan years, both times during which the wealthy did very well indeed. Also, it could be that most jewelry store customers were nouveau riche barely hanging on anyway, or just inept wealth funded by home-equity loans and Ponzi debt. Many of those poseurs were hitting the day of reckoning around 2008-2009, due to the evaporation of bubble housing wealth; Obama would have made a nice scapegoat for their own financial ineptitude.
