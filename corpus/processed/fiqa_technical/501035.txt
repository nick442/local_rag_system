"Only a Cuck would take the words of /u/AlwaysThoughtful over the claims of NeoNazi leadership. They even said ""we were not specifically condemned. That's good"". When professional racists endorse Donald Trump, support Donald Trump, and want to work with Donald Trump.. and he does nothing to condemn them (and walks back what little condemnation he publicly made on Twitter as ""they made me read a statement."").. yeah. Definitely no connection there. Trumptards really are the bots from Westworld. They can't see anything dear leader didn't program them to see."
