"> Follow the money and youll find the bullshit right there. Are you trying to tell me that they aren't a bigger risk at the workplace when working with machines and other things? Are you trying to tell me it doesn't impair them at all when they are high? Are you trying to tell me the insurance company doesn't factor in risk at all? You're argument just fell apart. Sorry kid. If you were trying to argue that those industries don't want it legal, that's one thing, but we are talking about a workplace and them being a bigger risk at the workplace so your argument doesn't apply here. > To be fair as well, where does a ""drug addicted looser"" go to get help in the United States Are you kidding me? There are tons of places in every city that will provide help. Whether you're talking about government programs or rehabs, there are tons of places. You're just coming up with bullshit and excuses. You must be high yourself right now. The truth of the matter is MOST don't want help at all. How many weed smokers do you know that think its an issue even if they smoke daily? They'll lie to your face and say its the greatest thing in the world, there are ZERO side effects or risks, and its ""organic."" These people are losers. > What risks as a community do we then inherit by ignoring such situations? Tons of risks. Driving under the influence, being lazy and unproductive. Just read the damn article and it shows that these people aren't very hire-able. Why do you think so many live at home still when they are older? They lack motivation and are losers. That's why the damn illegal can do a better job even though he can't count to 10 in his own language and doesn't speak english. These losers are an issue for the country and economy. They even put strain on our health care system."
