No, I did not get upset or went overboard. Sorry if you got that impression. I am discussing this topic with you. To summarize: the future is exchangeable battery because no battery today and in the near future can be used for a very long drive. You will pay only for the electricity you consumed from the battery. You will pay more per KW than you pay for KW consumed at home because you have to pay for additional costs and profits by Tesla. You will not pay for the battery because you don't own the battery. It's exchanged every time. If you want, and you mostly do short drives, you can buy a car with a fixed set of batteries, costing a lot of money, but you will not have to pay the fees for KW you charge into it at your home.
