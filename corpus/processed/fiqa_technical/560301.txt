">Our rating >In a Journal Sentinel op-ed, Trump said: ""In 1986, President Ronald Reagan"" cut the business tax rate to 34 percent and ""it worked -- our economy boomed, the middle class thrived and median family income increased."" >Some economists say the corporate rate reduction, from 46 percent, did help lead to economic growth and higher income. But it wasn’t necessarily any more important than a cut -- from 50 percent to 28 percent -- in the top individual income tax rate that was part of the same 1986 package that included other tax changes, as well. >More importantly, many other factors beyond tax cuts -- demographics, immigration, trade policy and more -- bear on the economy. >Trump’s statement contains only an element of truth -- our definition of Mostly False. In case you still believed anything this toilet bowl of a website publishes."
