Thanks for the heads up- it definitely wasn't me who posted that. Still, I find it pretty flattering that people are enjoying the post years after I wrote it. This isn't really anything new, every so often someone basically copy-pastes either this or another essay I wrote around the same time. Even a few big publications have done it. This time it's a bit more blatant than before though.
