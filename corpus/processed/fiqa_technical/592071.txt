=;-) i do see your point. however may i direct your attention to how much smarmy spam shows up in this sub? not criticizing you, or the mods, or the sub itself. but people blatantly spam this place, and so ham-handedly its insulting to the intelligence of the reader on the front page of this sub right now are: https://redd.it/6m0yq6 https://redd.it/6lzxg6 both are submitted by users with the same handle as the domains they point to so Tuk Tuk is a breath of fresh air, to my perception i was going to recommend he post to /r/holiday_in_cambodia/ but, yikes, its set to private. Private Holiday In Cambodia, yeah i wonder whats up with that =:-(
