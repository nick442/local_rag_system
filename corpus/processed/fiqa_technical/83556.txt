This kind of thinking is a typical example of 19th century outdated economic theory. This might have been true for the factory workers back then but those kinds of jobs aren't even in western countries anymore (outside maybe some low level positions in the service industry). In the vast majority of modern western jobs firing and hiring someone else does not result in someone of the same effectiveness anywhere close to immediately.
