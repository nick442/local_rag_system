Time to look at a tax table. A retired couple hits the top of the 15% bracket with an income of $96,700. (I include just the standard deduction and exemptions.) The tax on this gross sum is $10,452.50 for an 'average' rate of 10.8%. This is what 2 answers here seem to miss, and the 3rd touches, but doesn't keep going. The tax, paid or avoided, upon deposit, is one's marginal rate. But, at retirement, the withdrawals first go through the zero bracket (i.e. the STD deduction and exemptions), then 10%, then 15%. The Roth benefit is maximized In the end, to choose between Traditional or Roth, one would have to have far more details regarding the person's financial situation. The right choice is rarely 100% known except in hindsight.
