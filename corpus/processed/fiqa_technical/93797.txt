>You really shouldn't talk about things when you clearly don't put yourself in a position to be informed on the topic. You're just espousing unhelpful ignorance. Irony. >Oh, and also thanks for the downvote, which you broke the rules of this subreddit giving, since my comment clearly contributes to a discussion (that you decided to join). Although, I don't really care about upvotes or downvotes, so feel free to give me another. Or two. Or three. IDC you little twerp. Its always the people that complain about being downvoted that care about their upvote count.
