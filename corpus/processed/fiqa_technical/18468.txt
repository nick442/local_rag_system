What value? It's bits and bytes. It's a mechanism for exchange, but so were beaver pelts. There's literally zero value because it's backed by absolutely nothing other than the full faith and credit of.. what, the internet? It's a huge joke. People are putting their stock in it, but there was a front page story just yesterday about another crypto currency that went from $300 to $0.10 with a single transaction. Go ahead, put your life savings in it if you love it so much, but it's insignificant, and it's a joke. Someone's making money off of selling the shit.. if that's not you, you're the fool.
