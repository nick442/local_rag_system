someone is paid a certain sum each month, and wants to spend only a certain amount each month, can he spend more and then take it out of next month's payment? Using the example 100 month 1, 60 first month. Save 40 Second Month, 100 salary, spend 70. Save 30. Overall Savings 70 Third month, 100 salary, spend 50. Save 50. Overall Savings 120 So in short term or once a while doing this is fine. However if [and this depends on individuals] it goes beyond control, i.e. you keep spending say 90 every month, you would have to save for quite a few months to get back to normal. A better way would be to reverse this. Using the example 100 month 1, 60 first month. Save 40 Second Month, 100 salary, spend 50. Save 50. Overall Savings 90 Third month, 100 salary, spend 70. Save 30. Overall Savings 120 i.e. save more first and then spend, rather than spending now and saying you will save in future. Generally this is the trap quite a few fall into specially when saving for retirement, they keep putting it to future and very soon realize that they can't get back to the goal.
