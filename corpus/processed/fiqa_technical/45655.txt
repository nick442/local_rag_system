I am a Systems Engineering major. I currently work at a prop trading firm trading fixed income. I would emphasize your math skills, analytical thinking learned in engineering school, and express how much you are interested/experience in finance. It seems like you are on top of all that and if the job market wasn't so rough, I would say you sound like an ideal candidate and I feel like most finance jobs like people with engineering/math backgrounds as long as they are knowledgeable in finance.
