Yeah 50 peaople in one slim industry that is mostly exempted. Thats a real study right? The reality is there is less jobs. You can't raise the price of labour and still be competitive with technology. Every extra dollar up just goes to taxes any way. All those people who used to get returns will now be getting a nice bill to welcome them to their new tax bracket. But keep lying to yourself as you edge towards the Venezuela model of starvation.
