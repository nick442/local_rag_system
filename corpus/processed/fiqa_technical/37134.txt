The doing of it, the actual floral design part, is a small part of what that business is going to need. The needs of a small business are huge and varied. For instance, somebody will need to do the Quickbooks, handle the register and cash, handle clients and follow-up. Do payroll even if it is just the two of you. Handle insurance. Place orders for inventory, develop relationships with suppliers to keep costs down. Do marketing. Calculate profitability and use that to determine pricing, specials, and discounting on bulk orders. Clean the shop and enable your flower arranger to work effeciently. Need employees? Then get ready for applications, interviews, onboarding, reviews, coaching, and firing. Create checklists and best practices. The Small Business Association is your friend. It's a government program that is already paid for by you, and the employees are generally successful entrepreneurs that just don't feel like doing the 80 hours a week anymore. They will be so happy to mentor you and can really assist if you are looking for a loan to start up. Small business isn't for everybody. I think most people would rather work 40 hours a week for somebody else. If none of this scares you off, you might have what it takes. Starting and running a business is incredibly rewarding for me emotionally and financially and I wouldn't trade it for any job on the planet.
