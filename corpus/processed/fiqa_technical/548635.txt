Thank for the response, honestly I appreciate the well thought out reply but I don't see how this necessarily can be attributed to our discussion. Biases or ignorance held by a successful race doesn't mean they aren't successful, and the fact he hasn't or at least you aren't aware that he or others have studied the same in other races and/or third world nations would just add to the point that it doesn't contradict that one race can be (although certainly flawed) superior than another.
