Here's the thing, in all of your examples you are pointing out how technology allowed humans to be more efficient at their jobs. But that increase in efficiency was offset by explosive population growth resulting in greater demand. Widespread adoption of automation, particularly in large industries, has the possibility to outstrip population growth and demand growth resulting in net job losses and economic destabilization. Historical examples fail because birth rates were higher then and we are rapidly approaching unsustainable levels of population growth, both in this country and abroad. When growth slows, and demand dies, the automation gap is magnified.
