I'm 50ish: still play video games and just recently started needed power naps. Getting stuff done, automation and other work is really the only thing that provides satisfaction. I volunteer to teach kids coding and help neighborhood kids with mechanical stuff. Never was big on going out. Taking a vacation to a white sandy beach would drive me nuts after about six hours. My vacations seem to look a lot like work too :)
