">Yes, they are. Ridesharing is just a term for Unmarked taxi booked through app. No. Ride sharing is when you share a lift with someone, traditionally it's when someone is going somewhere and they offer space to others too (And that's quite popular where it exists). Uber is a minicab company in that you book a vehicle and it take you somewhere, in the UK at least, it's regulated and licensed in the same way (as opposed to black cabs which are licensed and regulated differently and can be flagged down). >I have no issue with that, since ""Government regulated taxi"" is so awful in almost every city on earth, that ridesharing has improved safety and convenience. That may be true in parts of the US and some other places, but it's really not the case in 'almost every city on earth'. I've lived in quite a few and visited many others and frankly Uber is at best on a par with taxi services, especially given that having an app to book is no longer unusual, where it does better is in places where regulation is essentially a protectionist mess (which is more an exception than the norm)."
