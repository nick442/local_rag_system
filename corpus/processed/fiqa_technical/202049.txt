"Sorry but, I have to disagree. The USDA has very strict guidelines around what can and cannot be labeled ""Organic"". There is certainly an obligation to understand what the various labels mean but, I would be very surprised if Walmart or other major organiztions were not compliant. Where a mom & pop grocery store may be able to get away with mislabeling simply because the USDA/FDA may not get around to checking I think we can be pretty certain that Walmart and other Major chains get checked often. For information about what ""Organic"" labels entail look here: http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=ORGANIC_CERTIFICATIO"
