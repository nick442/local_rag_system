Drugs, and medicine in general, are most certainly not inelastic. There is competition from less expensive analogs, and, unfortunately, nothing. There is always an optimum price as long as there is a marketplace. If we want cheaper drugs then we ought to reform patents (in a real sense) and lower barriers to competition. Medical companies are obviously lowering their ethical safeguards for selling drugs cheap when they don't have to so that can't be relied upon anymore.
