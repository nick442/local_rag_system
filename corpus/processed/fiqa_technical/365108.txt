I've heard that B&N also OWNS the property of the bookstore itself, so there are other benefits beyond selling books. Most other book stores simply rented the property, which means they HAD to make quote for sales. I love browsing book stores, but it's SO much more convenient, faster and cheaper to buy online, half.com or amazon are my gotos for when I know what book I want.
