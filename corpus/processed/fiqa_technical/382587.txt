Income inequality is a baseless emotional argument used to upset the ignorant. The truth is that throughout history, where the greatest income inequalities exist (between the bottom 10% and top 10%, discounting dictatorships where only a tiny amount of people control the wealth), the standard of living of the poor is highest. In a capitalist economy (read: free economy) the way to get rich is to provide others with service or product they value, and will give you money for. Therefore the wealthier you are, the more you have improved the lot of the common man. It is only through government corruption that you can get ridiculously rich without that fair trade. If you want to complain about the unfairness of society, complain about the government which holds the power to remove your free choice, and give money to those who do not deserve it by their products.
