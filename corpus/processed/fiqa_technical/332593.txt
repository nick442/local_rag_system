"I fully understand that its getting harder to get cheaper food while still keeping it ""Good"" but when the food actually tastes good and the service is at least decent most people won't mind paying a little extra. It gets harder for me to feel bad when its a big chain like BWW. Also what restaurants do you own, if yoy don't mind me asking?"
