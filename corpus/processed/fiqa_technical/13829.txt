Citizens Advice can tell you whether it would be possible / worth taking it to Small Claims Court or not, and how to phrase your claim if so. If you do go to Small Claims Court, you don't need legal representation. I would think of Citizens Advice as a kind of triage as to whether you need to seek legal advice or not.
