"Wealth trickles up, they tend to concentrate only on a few entities. This is the nature of competition and the free market, there will be 90% losers and 10% winners who produce 90% of the world's demand. It's human nature, we tend to only buy from ""the few trusted-by-many"" producers, the ""superstar"" so-to-speak, or the ""unicorns"" as wall-street investors would like to call them. Taxing the rich to give to the poor, those money go back to the rich! It will not do much after the initial euphoria of ""Oh hey, I have more money! Now I can buy more stuffs"" from the poor. Might give politicians some vote, but after a while, we'll be right back where we were ""should we tax the rich more ?"""
