"Who would have thought.. + Lies after lies. Greatest american propaganda machine, telling their audience what they wanted to hear + Defending trump's inexcusable words/actions + Obsessing over Hillary, who is more irrelevant now than ever. Bringing her up everytime Trump does something stupid.. ""BUT HILLARY.."" + Turning the NFL protest against police brutality into a controversy about not supporting the troops. Which apparently is less controversial than what trump said about McCain not being a war hero for being captured..? Or what he said about the muslim father/mother who lost their son that was a soldier? Or what he said to the families of the soldiers that died (False promises of $25k or the comment about ""he knew what he signed up for"")? + Trying to demonize Mueller for doing his cop duties. Saying Manafort is innocent and its all just a leftist plot to stop trump from doing his job. + Never mind defending trump when he said both sides are to blame in the whole Nazi protest, where a white supremacist killed Americans. + Praised trump for tackling the opoid crisis (which by the way he is doing nothing even remotely significant about) + Saying they are the party of christ, all the while saying bad things about the new pope for being ""liberal"" (even though Jesus himself was as liberal as it gets). + Going full force against hollywood's ""leftest"" rapist while hypocritically defending their own rapists within their own organization. + Overtly defending climate change deniers because of oil/gas lobbyists. + Defending criminals in their own party and saying both parties are the same when in reality.. https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/79b4z2/robert_muellers_office_will_serve_first/dp0khrf/ ..would have all ended up pushing their advertisers away."
