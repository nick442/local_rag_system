Also, you can definitely stay at the same institution. It is perhaps looked down upon by some who say you need to get out there and explore the academic world a little more, but I wouldn't worry too much about them if you're happy. That said, I had the choice of staying at the same institution or going elsewhere and I did choose to go to a new school. Nine years in one place is a long time.
