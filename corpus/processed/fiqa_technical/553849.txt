What I'm most amused by is how people let themselves be so purposefully fleeced by jacked up gun and ammo prices. Of course, these are probably the same people that decide that when gas drops to $2.50/gal is the best time to run out and buy a fucking Canyonero as if gas will never go up in price again.
