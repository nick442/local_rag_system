It's an infosec rule at my 200 person software company that really doesn't have much of a security risk (i.e. no one would gain much by getting into our records). If it wasn't a rule at equifax, at least on paper, I'll eat my hat or a dictionary or something. To be clear, I'm not claiming I know this, I'm just basing it on experience working in smaller tech companies. And let's put it this way.. the failings of big companies are very rarely a *lack* of rules and bureaucracy.
