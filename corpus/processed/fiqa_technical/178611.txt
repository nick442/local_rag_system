"Theres a difference between being ""materially better"" and having deep knowledge of company politics as part of your job. A manager should be much more aware of how each person contributes to the whole, what their stengths are, who to talk to about what, and how, and why. Thats why non-managerial level people are called ""individual contributors"" -- they're focused on doing their part. Where-as managers are focused on how all of the individual contributors work together. Its not about being ""materially better"" it's about delegation of task types and workflows."
