TaxTips.ca's Federal Tax Rates page has basic information about income tax in Canada, and it states: Canadian federal income tax is calculated based on taxable income, then non-refundable tax credits are deducted to determine the net amount payable. For 2009, every taxpayer can earn taxable income of $10,320 ($9,600 in 2008) before paying any federal tax. [..] (emphasis mine) Of course there are also provincial taxes to consider, but generally each province has a basic personal exemption amount. TaxTips.ca's page for Ontario rates lists $8,881 as the basic personal exemption in Ontario, for 2009. Find other provinces here.
