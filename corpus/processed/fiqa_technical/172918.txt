True. Someone already thought about this business, and they constantly checking the astronomical calendar and make sure they supply, market and advertise the glasses just before the next solar eclipse, wherever and whenever it happens next. So I checked it for you, and you are wrong: the next full solar eclipse will be July 2nd, 2019, in South America. As for me, I live in the USA, originally from Israel, but with German accent as my parents are German.
