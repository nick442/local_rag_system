Although it seems almost no one here understands that you're advocating for personal liberty rather than discrimination, I just want to say that you're not alone in feeling the way you do. I personally would choose not to patronize a business that carried out its affairs in such a way, but I would also fight to protect their right to be able to operate their private property (lol like that exists anymore) in the way they choose and see fit. I disagree with the civil rights act protections applying to private businesses and property.
