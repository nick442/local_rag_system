>Nail holes. If they were the small picture hanging nail holes and there were only a couple of them then it would be normal wear and tear. If they used regular nails to hand them then no, that's a misuse. If there were a lot of nail holes (think a collage of 15 pictures all together on one wall) then it is not normal wear and tear. >The stains were small discolorations, not big purple splotches of wine. Stains are never considered normal wear and tear. Stains are excessive. >The carpet was old when they got there also Was it in good shape or poor shape? If it was fraying and had worn paths in it when they arrived then I would make an argument stating that the carpet was is disrepair to begin with.
