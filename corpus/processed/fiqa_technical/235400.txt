a true free market wouldnt have these issues. the wealthy are protected, the curtency inflated, national debt in the trillions. there is no flexibility for these systems to auto correct. so they will get shittier and shittier till they crash, badly. only a free society un urdened by top down structures can build sustainable societies, its how nature works, our bodies, life.
