I've looked into the Russia ties stuff enough to say that if you are involved in government projects or IP related work you should steer clear of them. No there isn't anything concrete but either someone really wants someone like me to think they have interesting and complex ties to the Russian Gov or that they do have interesting and complex ties to the Russian Gov. Either way, fine for home use or Small to Medium business use that doesn't tie around IP, Gov or otherwise projects of 'interest' to external Governments.
