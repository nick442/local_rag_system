"If the free market can fix a particular problem it's this one. For years the baby boomers have been extolling the virtues of the free market to solve any problem. After all the free market is the most efficient way of meeting infinite demand with scarce resources..or so I'm told - supply and demand..etc. The problem the C suite is now realizing is this: Once the baby boomers leave, that ""shortage"" will drive up prices/wages for those with the necessary skills. It always happens when there is a labor shortage (revisit the .com boom of the late 90's). Mahogany row will try like hell to avoid this, but it will happen. Look for the business executives to pressure government to increase H-1B visas claiming that there are no workers with the necessary skills to be found here, so we must import workers. Educating and training people takes time, and when your timeline based in quarterly earnings reports, you simply don't have time to educate and retrain. So long as unemployment is high we should not be importing workers for ANY reason. If executives see their talent pool retiring they need to open their wallets and pay market price for their replacements."
