No, I think that it's okay to not provide service for any reason *except based on status in a protected class."" This really isn't a difficult concept. And yes, I think that orientation should be a protected class anywhere that it isn't yet. Dude, this is the same as employment law and other discrimination areas like apartment rental. You can fire someone for any reason or no reason, but not for a reason of membership in a protected class. You can refuse to rent to someone for any reason except membership in a protected class. Do you see the pattern yet? >How can you not see the similar aspects of the two Because there are no similar aspects between non-choice biological factors and by-choice rhetoric. >You are agreeing with a company choosing to do business with whom they want to, but then you are doubling down on having another business doing the same thing Rephrased, this says, ""You're saying that sometimes X but then trying to say that sometimes Y!"" Yes. Exactly. There are different circumstances. ""You're agreeing that a company can do business with whomever they want except but another company can't because they're refusing based on protected classes."" Libertarian fantasy land logic doesn't work in the real world."
