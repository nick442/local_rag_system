I would just ask him plain and simple for a shadow opportunity. Just as you said, he has an open door policy and what better way to show it to his employees. And to really hold him to the policy. As for what questions to ask it depends on what you want out of life. This person is at a very high level so they obviously know a good bit, or at least how to achieve that level. One thing I'd say to do is to not make all of your questions about business. Mix it up and ask him some personal things like his hobbies, but nothing to personal. Try to build a relationship with him in what time you have and maybe this will lead to further opportunities.
