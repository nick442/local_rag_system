I dunno what the replacement rate is for cars, but there were 230M cars registered in the US in 2015. There were 17.5M cars sold in 2015. If you assume that full production capacity for cars is about 20M then (assuming 100% of production is switched to EV) it will take 11.5 years at full tilt to just replace the ones on the road. But of course there will be a ramp and a tail meaning cars will be sold in 2024 that are not electric only and they will be on the road for 15 years. Also the market will grow to say 25M but instead of adding 5M capacity, we would really have to add 25M capacity b.c EV is currently 0. Thats all assuming there isnt a recession/depression and ignores trucks and ships and all the other uses for oil. I thought this article was posted to /r/badeconomics
