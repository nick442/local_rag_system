Yep. My dad lost his (really high paying) job in 2009 and it took him 9 months to find it. They had to sell off a lot of stock to get through it, at a time when the stocks were half of what they were a year earlier. Now he's 64 and not even considering retiring before 70 or death, whichever comes first. I definitely believe that the death of the pension is going to be the worst thing for boomers. My generation never grew up with them - for us they're like a fairy tale. But many boomers grew up where nobody ever saved for retirement and always kicked the can down the road. SS is really only enough to keep seniors from starving to death, and not much more.
