Dude. This is so true. My husband works out of town so I'm basically a single mom. I wake up, get myself ready, our three kids ready, drop them off at daycare and school, rush to work, rush from work, pick them up from after school care (2 different places). By the time I get home it's already 6pm. Then I have to feed/bath/do homework with my munchkins Oh did I mention I'm also a Junior college student taking 18 hours?! So the second I get them handled I have to work on my class work, sometimes until 3am. Then on Saturdays I photograph weddings! Sunday morning we visit my grandmother in law. So on Sunday evenings and on Saturdays I don't have to work a wedding, I am doing housework, grocery shopping, etc. Any convenience I can afford I will use! Anything that helps me get a moment to breathe or play with my kids I'm grateful for. I'm not going to use this Amazon feature bc it freaks me out but I am not that far from being that desperate lol.
