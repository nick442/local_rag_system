I'll point out that you don't actually have to pay your income taxes on time, just make sure to file on time. You will be charged interest (currently 5% ann., compounded daily). This is no big deal, I know plenty of people who do this. Note that if they pay you interest you have to report it on your taxes, but if you pay them it's not deductible.
