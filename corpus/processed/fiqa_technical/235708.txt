"Yeah the biggest problem with this is that it far more heavily taxes the poor than the rich. Poor people spend *all of their income.* Month-to-month, living paycheck-to-paycheck, poor people have no choice but to spend their entire incomes on basic necessities, utilities, etc. Rich people on the other hand spend very little of their incomes. Most of it gets stashed in hedgefunds and overseas holdings and doesn't really ""change hands"" in a way that allows it to be taxed under this style of tax structure. So your tax continuously hits 100% of the wealth of the bottom 75%(ish) of households while largely bypassing the rich folks who have more money than they can *spend*. In short, this kind of tax structure is really bad for anyone who doesn't make $300k+ a year and store most of their wealth in stocks and so forth. If you want to help the general public (households making less than $300k/year), you need to generate more tax revenue from *investments* and *capital gains*. A 2% tax, say, on stock trades valued over $10,000 obviously wouldn't hurt poor people at all, and also wouldn't really hurt the rich. Cuz if you've got 10 grand (or a hundred, or thousand, or whatever) to stash in shares of Amazon or whatever, you're really not gonna miss the $200 that comes off the top of your trade. But this *would* generate huge tax revenue, as there are thousands of such transfers a day."
