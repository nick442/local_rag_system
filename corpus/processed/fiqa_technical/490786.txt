"You are talking about a one time giving vs a continuous giving. When US give money to Pakistan, it's a continuous giving. that's why Pakistan don't say shit when US bombs the hell of out them. but when the money stops coming, I will bet you Pakistan will be the loudest on the street bitching about the US. The bailout the Euros are asking for is a one time giving. What happens as soon as they take the money from China? ""Fuck the Chinese. Political power? What political power? HUMAN RIGHTZ VIOLATIONZ!"""
