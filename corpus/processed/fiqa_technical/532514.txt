Security companies employing the same people who are currently police or military. Your property is your castle, and you'd only go to other properties that have rules that you consent to follow. Roads, naturally, would have the most lenient rules since their shareholders want as many normal people to use them as possible. The difference from today is that the government sets up a monopoly of law that everyone must follow, even though populations differ. Rather than everyone fight to control the monopoly who sets up the rules, we each have our own rules and competing security companies who may charge different prices based on what level of rule precision they must enforce (such as a basic tier of policing violence, theft.. higher tier for policing the sort of things that HOAs enforce today). Basically, if you want extra rules that aren't necessary and not very popular, you pay for that. In this way, most people would be ok with not policing people who do victimless behaviors such as casual nudity or possession of dried plant life (drugs). In this system, trust and history matter. A company who changed its name suddenly becomes brand new, and therefore untested and with no history. It must start at the bottom of the trust ladder. Brands are valuable precisely because they exhibit a history of the company. You know Kellogg's cereal, or Toyota cars, or Apple computers are quality. People regulate the market, that's the point. The government is a monopoly, so we customers don't have control.. 1 vote every few years is much less than having 10 votes every day (free market voting with our money).
