>Term limits would help, or at least change the current dynamic, as would barring former representatives and senators from lobbying for five years. Finally, making Congress subject to the laws it passes would also help. But the parties will never agree to modify the current system; both parties benefit too much from it. Not going to happen! Lets get over it folks, the only thing that is going to fix this country is to throw the current ((government)) out and install a fresh set of faces and no ((traitors))!!
