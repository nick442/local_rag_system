I'm worried that as their production increases, the federal and state rebates will run out and add about $10k to the price of each car. The cap is 200,000 vehicles before the rebate phases out. At the current production rate(don't forget the Leafs, Volts and other offerings), all the Teslas, especially the entry level Model E, will get a substancial price hike.
