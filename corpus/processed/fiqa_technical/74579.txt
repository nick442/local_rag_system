Its really not that hard to get. Takes a month or two to study to pass it. Realize though that if you are going to get the series, you are pegging yourself as a sell side roll. If you are attempting to go buy-side, then you may want to look at different certifications (being a CFA level 1 candidate). If you have time to burn though, get it, its a good education and a good intro to the world of finance and its not that hard to get. Hope this helps. Edit: also realize that if you do get it, and a company sponsors you, if you leave the firm, you have 2 years before the series expires, which means you gotta use it, or lose it. As I recall, I may be wrong..but I have heard you can 'park' your series at a firm which will pay the FINRA / SEC fees for you. But I believe they outlawed this practice.
