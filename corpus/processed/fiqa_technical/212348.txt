It’s not misleading at all. People making the highest incomes already pay the vast majority of income taxes. Something like 40% of Americans pay zero net federal income tax. These people have ZERO skin in the game and yet they think they should have a seat at the table demanding more! The entitlement is sickening. The current tax regime already soaks the rich. You can play all the mental gymnastics you want, but you can’t change the facts.
