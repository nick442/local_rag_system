It might mean Equal Weighted based on Market cap, rather than Price? For instance, All of MSCIs indexes are based on security's market cap, but then a factor is applied to give them equal weights once a quarter. From then on, weights will fluctuate based on market cap performance. Edit. Not sure why down voted, but you can check here http://www.msci.com/eqb/methodology/meth_docs/MSCI_Equal_Weighted_Indices_Methodology_May11.pdf So each quarter weights are set to be equal, but then between quarters the weights fluctuate due to performance
