yes. And the rentals facilitating terrorism is such a ludicrous claim at least compared to what hotels themselves do, namely rent rooms to anyone showing up with a credit card or in the lower tiers even cash. That is even easier than ABnB where at least you have to spend a few minutes to create an account. The real terrorism risk around hospitality is hospitality being targeted or used for laundering money which is also a lot easier in a large hotel than doing it one ABnB rental unit at a time.
