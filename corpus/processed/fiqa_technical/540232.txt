>That's why the CEO pay is so enormous, because the board can make that decision and none of the common shareholders have enough power to override it. As with any business, when you own less than 50% you have a say but are at the mercy of all the other shareholders. That's kinda the way things work. Don't like it? Don't buy a piece of the company. Want majority ownership of Intel corporation? Buy up 2.5bn shares and take controlling ownership. I still don't get what you're bitching about - that minority shareholders should have a majority say? That's the way owning a piece of any company works; a corporation or an LLC. The same bullshit you're spewing off about is the same bullshit that people bitch about in a democracy; they want their voice to count for more. You're vote is worth in a company based on the portion you own.
