Literally not a single word of your comment is true. 1) They just posted 26.9% gross margins, up 1.4% since last quarter, with zero ZEV revenue. 2) Your 11,000 number is completely made up, particularly given that they had zero ZEV revenue. 3) What competition? Name a car. There's nothing. Nothing out and nothing on the horizon. 4) Again, literally on that very same call, they said they've shaved hundreds of pounds off of the Model S since it started production due to improvements in battery technology. Batteries improve 8-10% every year. Everyone knows this.
