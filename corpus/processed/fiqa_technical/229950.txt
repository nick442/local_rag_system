"The story with most companies, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, old GM, etc is that innovation was done by gray individuals or smaller companies and they buy their ideas or simply take those ideas without giving credit to the innovator. Apples is a good example: the Apple II is Steve Wozniak's idea and creation, and even the iPod and iPhone were ideas and design of few people you never heard of. Steve Jobs was a total failure at anything ""designed by Apple"": the Lisa, Newton, Macintosh, Next and a long list of products of poor design. Microsoft too: DOS was not written by them, Windows was developed by Xerox, the PC is by 2 people at IBM, Internet Explorer is a copy of Netscape, Excel is a copy of Lotus 123, etc."
