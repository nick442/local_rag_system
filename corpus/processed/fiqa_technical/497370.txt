"For me, the main benefit of using duplicate checks is that the copy is created automatically. If I had to take an extra step, whether taking a photo or writing on a stub, I would probably not always remember to do it. There is also the issue that you might need to write a check when you don't have your smartphone with you, or it is broken or has a dead battery, etc. There are various pros and cons of having an electronic record versus a paper record. A paper copy of a check is more vulnerable to physical loss or intrusion, but an electronic record is more vulnerable to hacking. You also have to keep the images organized somehow, and take care of data security and backups for the images. You'll have to evaluate which is the greater concern for you. A minor side point is that check duplicates often omit the account number and obscure your signature. A photo of the original check would include both of these. As far as ""evidence"", it seems to me they're both equally good evidence that you wrote the check - but that's not really that useful. In most sorts of disputes, what you would need to prove is that you actually delivered the check to the intended recipient, and neither the photo nor the paper copy is evidence of that. You could have written the check, taken your photo / copy, and then torn it up."
