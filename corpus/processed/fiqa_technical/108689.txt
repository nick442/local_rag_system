I mean, I was a bartender for years in college, and on most Saturdays I'd work from 12PM-4AM in a giant crowd of sweaty, drunk and sticky 18-24 year olds. Friends of mine worked in warehouses, factories, construction, retail, you name it; the thing is, our presence and physical effort was a business necessity. I think the disconnect between our viewpoints is that you see the remote work option as a service solely benefiting the employee, which the employer has to bear at some hardship. My thought is that the option is mutually beneficial, and requiring 100% personal presence in the absence of a business case is an outdated ideology. Consider this: fewer on-site employees means fewer sites -- this translates to millions saved in rent, utilities, insurance, maintenance/administrative staff and IT infrastructure, etc. It also, as the article mentions, *vastly* expands the pool of available talent by removing geographical requirements. Not only that, the option to work from home is in and of itself a feature which lubes the ol' recruiting pipe, as I alluded to earlier. The overarching logic is that there should be a quantifiable advantage attached to a decision like this, and this advantage was, again, as the article mentions, discovered by IBM's own internal research efforts which supported remote work. It doesn't make a lot of sense strategically, but I haven't worked for IBM for years, so I couldn't tell you what internal issues they might be struggling with.
