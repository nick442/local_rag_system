If a high mileage car has been thoroughly maintained with a credible service history, there is no reason to discard the vehicle because of a hypothetical future expense. Considering the low value of the vehicle, it would be prudent to also lower the cost of the repairs. U.S. car dealerships have a well-known reputation for charging significantly higher repair rates than independent repair shops. Lower the cost of the repairs: brakes can be done at independent shops for half what the dealer quoted. Sears can install a set of 4 tires on an '04 Accord for $331 out the door. It makes no financial sense to purchase costly repairs for a low-cost automobile when economical alternatives are available.
