So who exactly is a slave in America? Who doesn't have a choice to live the life that they wish? Eat the foods they wish? Not have their children work in the fields until their hands, feet and back around sore, and not be able to take a break at anytime until their slave master say so? What women are being raped nightly by their slave master, and forced to carry their children to terms and then have said children enslaved? Who is getting a whipping (with and actual whip) for talking back to their master, or looking at a women who is not of their race or wanting to learn to read and right? Who in America is currently a slave?
