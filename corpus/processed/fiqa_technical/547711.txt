"I mean, the claim was ""Trump cuts debt"", but since he didn't actually meaningfully influence the number it's false. If I said that I made cookies, but in fact someone else brought them in and just placed them near my desk, my statement would be false, right? If, on the other hand, the claim was ""Trump didn't do anything and the debt fell as a result of other factors"" that might be true. That is, unless you think he's trying to take credit for not passing any of the legislation he said he would enact in his first 100 days? (""I tried to set the house on fire, but people stopped me, so I saved the house from burning!"") Not a very interesting story either way."
