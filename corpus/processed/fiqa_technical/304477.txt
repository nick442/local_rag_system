I think credit unions and microfinance are a much more viable lending model - the problem with direct person to person lending is that it is subject to a high level of idiosyncratic risk. Direct P2P lending makes sense if you know the borrower well personally, but on an institutional level diversifying risk over a large number of borrowers makes a world of sense.
