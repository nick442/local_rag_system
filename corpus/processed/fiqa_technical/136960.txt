"> is it worth the risk to give up ""guaranteed"" money welding to take the risk and run another location I think not. you're acting smarter now than 90%+ of college kids who are clueless and are going to end up flipping MBA burgers welding is a very in-demand professional skill. I read recently some earn up to $180,000 per year for mission critical welding like planes, space ships, some military applications, precision equipment etc plus, there's no reason to commit to anything now. you have to wait for the man in control to pass along, a new location to be selected and built and nearly open for business for you to think about it stay the course. you're doing great"
