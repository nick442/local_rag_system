Here's a great Canadian college/university cost calculator I used; found at Canadian Business - they say: Our tool is divided into three easy steps. First, calculate the tuition cost for the university and faculty you wish to attend. Then, calculate any additional fees for residence (on campus student housing), meal plans, athletics, health and student services. This will give you the total cost a student will pay at a Canadian university in 2006/7. Once you know the total annual cost, take the third step to calculate the total cost for the duration of the course of study. Of course, this only calculates what it will cost you NOW, not eighteen years from now, but it's a good start :)
