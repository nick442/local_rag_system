This is good advice. Your GPA and awards signal that you're not an idiot. A huge piece of what they're looking for is how well you fit in with the company culture, how you think on your feet, and how well you communicate. A well crafted response in the form of a story that illustrates your positive traits does all of these things without the recruiter being forced to tease out the information they're looking for. Also, be friendly to everyone you meet the second you're within a few blocks of the building. You should probably be doing that generally in life, but gossip, especially the negative kind and most especially about new hires, spreads like wildfire through the workplace. People love to talk, so only give them positive stuff to say.
