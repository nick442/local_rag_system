"I totally agree with you that kids and students need social interaction, working together, guidance, mentors, etc. I definitely want my son to have a human teacher. However, unfortunately, teaching is provided by the government mostly, they pay terrible salaries for teachers and the government would like to cut costs. So my guess is that there will be a push for less teachers, or ""on-line"" teacher conference-call, and other crap, but they will definitely teach for technology to replace teachers. Forget about teachers: doctors will be replaced even more quickly with ""technology""."
