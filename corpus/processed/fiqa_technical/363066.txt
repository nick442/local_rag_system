You are very much correct, as I think about it more I definitely misspoke. It's more someone's cultural heritage than their race. If you grow up eating and watching your parents prepare a particular type of food you are more likely to cook that type of food better than someone who did not have a much experience with that type of food growing up. There are exceptions of course, But I think you get the idea. My grandmother is a white person, who is also Mexican. We eat Mexican food at Thanksgiving. So color is not always a good. indicator.
