"Of course I do. The surveys are from graduates of the last year (or two or three depending on which one you look at). Nobody is implying that all the people have successful established careers because inherently that's not what the surveys are about. The surveys are about you finding a job when you graduate, the career part is up to you not the school. They are self reported, but nobody has a reason to lie or not report their salaries correctly. What I'm getting at here is that there is no conspiracy by the school to skew the way information is presented. Any college applicant with half a brain knows what they are looking at when they see the numbers. They are not misrepresented, thus there is no ""lying""."
