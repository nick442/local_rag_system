Amazon isn't even remotely near what Microsoft had. Microsoft had a 95% plus share of the Operating System market. Amazon doesn't even have 1% of total retail sales. This is a preposterous assertion. Total US retail sales were $5 trillion last year. You're seriously claiming Amazon is attempting to monopolize that industry? Amazon had $150 billion in sales last year. This is the dumbest claim I have literally ever seen in my life.
