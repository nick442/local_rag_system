"Love, Love, Love this. In America we need to be more focussed on the quality and humanity of what we eat. Food bourne pathogens and resistance to anitbiotics are very real problems. All it will take is for the majority of Americans to ""vote with thier dollars"" when it comes to this issue and the supply will rise to meet demand. It is incredibly encouraging to see names like Walmart on the list of companies offering organic, free range ingredients in thier stores. Like the company or not (I do not) they control distribution of a HUGE percentage of the food supply in this country. With a focus on small sustainable agriculture we can eat better, be healthier, and even be more economically stable due to an increase in the number of small farms needed for this kind of thing."
