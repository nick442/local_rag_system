"> Taxing wealth is an easy idea, but I don't think it can ever work. Wealth is too easily hidden, transformed, or revalued. You should Google the effective corporate tax rates. It's much much easier to hide corporate profits or find loopholes than to tax individual income. Also, your allegory about Kleenex makes zero sense whatsoever. These aren't things the ""owners"" would normally consume, of course not. However, that's a super weird way to define a business. I trust a sole proprietor that stocks vending machines wouldn't ""consume"" all these beverage products on their own, but a business works that way. A corporation isn't its own entity, it is actively managed by people hired by the shareholders. It doesn't make its own decisions, it isn't a self-perpetuating machine. Why do we tax it as if it does? Tax income for people. Making the argument people will find loopholes is just as ludicrous. Corporations find tax loopholes anyway, but I find it pretty ridiculous to think ""we can't make that a law because people will break it"". Then make it so people can't break it. As it stands, it's easier to find loopholes and write-offs as a corporation than an individual anyway, and the consequences as a corporation are insignificant to shareholders if they do get caught Taxing individual wealth isn't the easy idea. Double-taxing an arbitrary intermediary is."
