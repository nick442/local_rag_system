There is a reason most cities regulate taxi and limo services, practices like this are some of them. Fee gouging and refusing to pick up customers are others. Then the lack of screening (remember the story where a driver without a proper license kidnapped his passenger to outrun NJ officials?) I expect all major cities to pass legislation affecting services like Uber and AirBNB etc, and in the end they will be forced to compete on a level playing field with existing taxi services. Fees will go up, and then they will crash and burn.
