Not sure you read my post based on your word choice but.. CFP is more of a marketing ploy from a consumer behavior perspective. You don't need a CFP to have the technology or knowledge to utilize what is taught in the modules and plenty of CFPs will still give shit advice. When choosing an advisor it comes down to ethics, work ethic, knowledge, experience, and fee structure in that order. Not saying to never hire a CFP, but just because somebody has a CFP doesn't mean they'll actually be any better than any other advisor.
