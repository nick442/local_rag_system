That might be a generational difference. For us, as long as we know where to find the equations, what's the point in knowing a formula if you're not using it on a regular basis. It's much more prudent to know where to find the formulas you might need in the future or where to find the methods to derive them, and have the ability to do this as opposed to remembering the steps or the formulas by rote. The information is usually seconds away, the skills are not.
