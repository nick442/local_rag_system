There's a K-Mart across the street from where I work. I *never* go there, and the only reason I would go in is to pick over the carcass if the store was closed. The store looks like it probably did thirty years ago, the merchandise is junk, the selection is piss-poor, they can't compete on price and the people working there don't give a crap.
