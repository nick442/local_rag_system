The most common usage of interest rate swaps is by corporates who issue bonds. Most US investors (e.g. insurance companies & pensions) want fixed-rate bonds, so that they know what their interest income will be for the life of the investment. Many financial issuers prefer to have their liabilities be floating rate, so that they will benefit if the Fed keep interest rates at zero for a long time. So the financial issuer issues the fixed rate bond, the insurance company buys it, and the issuer converts the obligation to floating with an interest rate swap.
