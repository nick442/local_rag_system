The cycle has been continuously going for a couple generations now and seems to be getting worse. I don't have the answers but it seems obvious that doing what they've always done doesn't work. I'm always entertained by people thinking that life should be fair. No where in nature is life fair. Some people are born with an advantage and still screw it up and others are born disadvantaged and succeed. I think it's obvious that people make choices that make one or the other outcomes more likely but nothing is guaranteed for them.
