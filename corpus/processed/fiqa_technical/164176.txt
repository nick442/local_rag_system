"I fear this question may be impossible to answer, beyond the options you already seem to know about. It depends too much on the details of your situation, some of which you say you don't know. If you don't even know how much debt you have, I think you're going to need some kind of professional advice to assess your situation. One place to start is the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. This organization can provide free or low-cost advice about your situation, including bankruptcy options. That said, the main missing piece I see in your question is your expenses. The first thing you should ask yourself is: what am I spending money on, and can I stop spending on money on that in order to save and/or pay off debt instead? You say that you can ""live comfortably paycheck to paycheck"" and ""routinely"" put money into savings. Can you start living uncomfortably and thus put a lot more into savings, or towards debt repayment? Whether this will work or not depends on how much debt you have, but it definitely needs to be part of your thought process. Likewise, if you continually are wiped out by unbudgeted expenses, start budgeting for them."
