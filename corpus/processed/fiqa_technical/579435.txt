They are far from the only business that does this though. Computer Chips for GPUs and CPUs are often made with the best top of the line chip in mind and then lower SKUs are created by bining worse chips and disabling features by hardware or software means. It sucks but its just cheaper to produce one top of the line chip than to make many SKUs. Edit: Corrected my stupidity - thanks wdeezy!
