I would recommend that you take out a loan large enough to cover both your Capex requirements AND give yourself a cash buffer. Depending on the simulation and how aggressive you want/need to be (are you competing against other teams?), you may just want to leverage as much as you can and use high amounts of cash for all expenses and projects.
