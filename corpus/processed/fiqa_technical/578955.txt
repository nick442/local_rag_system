> IMO, the nuts and bolts of valuations aren't the hardest part of finance. No one going into the operational managing roles at a PE firm is there because of their experience in valuations. There are a multitude of roles and improvement decisions are usually backed by a team of ex-consultants rather than ex-IBD guys (team doing the valuations and relevant decisions based on valuations).
