Everyone likes to hate on AT&T, but really, all the major four brands are the same. I get the same amount of dropped calls on both Verizion and AT&T to be honest. I feel like Sprint charges a bit more, but they don't have a cap on their data plans, so if you do multiple GB per month they are the best choice. Otherwise, just go with whichever carrier is the best in your area. It varries from state to state, but generally AT&T is great is most mid-sized cities, and Verizon is great in the suburbs or country. I can't speak about T-mobile since I don't know anyone with it
