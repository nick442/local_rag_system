Hard to imagine people going to casinos in the first place. That aside, Atlantic City was never going to be a good place for casinos. Now that there are so many casinos to choose from at so many locations all around the country it only stands to reason that more and more casinos will go out of business (not enough people who do not understand basic arithmetic to go around) . Also to factor in is that going to a casino is not the brightest thing to be doing with your money. And if it should turn out that there is so much money to burn out there, then taxes are definitely not high enough! Imagine going into a building and playing games, for money, where the odds are stacked against you. The longer you play the worse your chances are! Madness!
