If you do not presently have an HSA-compatible insurance plan, you cannot legally add money to your HSA. You can still withdraw, but you can't add. So basically your choice are to let the money sit there and be nibbled away by the monthly fees, to withdraw it anyway and pay the tax penalty, or to spend it on whatever medical expenses you do have. I have no idea what your expenses are, how good your present insurance is and how often you and any dependents see a doctor or get prescriptions. If you used it for ALL uncovered expenses, how long would it take to use it up?
