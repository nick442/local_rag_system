">That would be great .. if there were an objective and impartial standard for ""worth to society"". There's no rigid, objective metric, but there are things I think most can agree do or don't help society as a whole. An example would be a highly addictive product that causes cancer. Yes, yes, personal liberty, people should be allowed to smoke if they know the risks and take responsibility, yada, yada, but the bottom line is cigarettes are dangerous and addictive. Couldn't it be said, within reason, that cigarettes harm society?"
