It would seem to be in your best interest to file, and that probably means that you should do all you can to get your documents back. If you are in fact owed a refund then there is apparently no penalty to filing late. If you instead owe taxes, you better file in any case since the fees stack up pretty fast: 5% per month after the due date up to 25% of the taxes owed.
