"> My uncle ran a horrible pizza shop downtown. The trick was the heroin business on the side. I have often wondered about stuff like that. Especially when I see strip malls out in the middle of suburban/rural areas with stores like ""Candles, etc"" or ""GitUrWallpaperHere"" -- I mean I can understand that in some large metropolitan shopping mall they *might* generate enough walk-in traffic to support a specialty candle or wallpaper store.. But in a rural town with a total population of maybe 5,000 people (and possibly 10,000 if you include every home in the townships around it) well I just can't see the numbers working out.. especially since you never see anyone else IN the store, and the clerk always seems so totally uninterested in even trying to sell anything that it's kind of creepy. On the other hand if you posit it as a ""cash"" based retail money laundering front, for some drug business.. well then it suddenly makes sense. EDIT: and with a pizza shop.. well, they can even have a delivery service.. right out in the open."
