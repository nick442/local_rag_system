*Reuters was able to confirm at least 50 people were let go in the past three weeks* ..so when a few bankers get sacked they make the news just like [10000 nokia employees](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/technology/nokia-to-cut-10000-jobs-and-close-3-facilities.html?pagewanted=all) right? /me being deliberately provocative, I guess the real focus of the article was on the negative trend of the economy forcing banks as well as companies to rething their organization.. but still, am I the only one seeing a huge bias in information here?
