"You know there is a heading in big bold text that says ""My budding product empire"" that conveniently links to actual products that make money for said author. I think you have a problem with the whole way the author markets herself, but I obviously it works. edit: Also I don't feel like it's bragging, it's more like sharing the wealth. You get examples of how to make and sell your own products from someone who makes and sells her own products successfully. What is so bad about that?"
