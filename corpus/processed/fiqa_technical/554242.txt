If you are going by who lost the most wealth, that hardly seems fair - because most people in their 20s dont have any wealth to lose. I won't buy the premise that Gen X has it worse than Y/Millenials. People who are graduating and can't find jobs end up with terrible prospects. They may never be able to climb the professional ladder ever [as long as entry level positions all require experience]. Whereas someone in Gen X that loses a job, atleast they have years of experience to help them get another job.
