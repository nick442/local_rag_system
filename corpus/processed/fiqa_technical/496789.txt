"sigh. michael lewis what have you done. he's created an army of people spouting non-sense yet have no idea **wtf** they're talking about. HFT is not really ""skimming"" money from you, they're providing liquidity and making markets more efficient. Would you rather pineapples cost 20$, or would you rather they cost 5.50$, and someone is willing to take on 50 cents worth of risk in exchange for a chance at some profit. The description below about ""beating you to the punch"" is just unbelievably wrong as well. http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/03/31/michael-lewis-is-entirely-wrong-about-high-frequency-trading-hitting-the-little-guy/ http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-01/what-michael-lewis-gets-wrong-about-high-frequency-trading http://www.slate.com/articles/business/books/2014/04/michael_lewis_s_flash_boys_about_high_frequency_trading_reviewed.html"
