Quite the opposite. Horton's will now have access to markets they previously never operated in and while the boards will be managed separately for the moment there is much speculation that Burger King/Tim Horton's will become a Canadian company in the near term because of the tax advantages. If that happens, and I think it will, you can almost look at it like Tim Horton's just bought Burger King.
