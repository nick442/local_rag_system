"Overall LCR is good for the financial system and makes for healthier, more liquid banks. But some of the assumptions are heavy-handed. For instance, if a Non-Bank FI has a revolver used for backstop (subscription facilities), LCR assumes they will draw 100% of the revolver in a 30-day stress case. 100 percent! So the bank has to hold $1 of liquid assets for every $1 of revolver commitment (not even actual lending). ""Outflow rates"" are similarly conservative for other borrowers - 30% for corporate CP backstop facilities, which are only available to the most creditworthy companies. Another issue is that some High Quality Liquid Assets actually attract Basel 3 capital. So LCR is forcing banks to hold these assets which increase their B3A/B3S capital requirement. It's double jeopardy. And of course there's the additional cost and operational risk of implementing and monitoring any new regulation. Banks must hire or train people to calculate LCR, and those people can make mistakes, leading to penalties. However most large banks have been calculating LCR well ahead of the phase-in date."
