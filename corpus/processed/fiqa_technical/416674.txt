I call bullshit. $7 an hour, both parents working 40 hours a week. Assume they pay no federal income tax (is this a govt hand out?) so they take home say.. $500 a week, combined, to be generous. That's $2000 a month. Daycare for two young kids, you did say a family right? That's $1000 a month. Now, shelter and heat. Are you working in a city where you can ride the bus, and pay $1000 a month for a small apartment, or in the country where you can get a house for $650 a month, but then have to own two cars and pay for gas? Do I need to go much further?
