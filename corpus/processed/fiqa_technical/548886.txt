You overestimate the ease with which userbases will change over. This isn't MySpace, which had a bunch of uppity tweens and bands running around on it. Facebook has a billion users, and many of those users rely heavily on it to maintain contact with their friends and family. Short of a massive pissoff of their userbase, I don't see this site dying anytime in the next couple of decades.
