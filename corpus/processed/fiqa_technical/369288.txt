There's a difference here. When amazon refunds an order, they pass as much as they can back onto the seller. They aren't really taking much, if any, of a hit and are expected to make up for any negatives in future usage. Now compare the cost of a $200 single item to billing them for every valuable item in your house when you're robbed during the middle of the day. The crooks already know you aren't home; that's the point of the key. if you are home, they just apologize and leave and come back later.
