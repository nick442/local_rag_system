"My hard work in school gave me the qualifications. My hard work networking got me the internship. My hard work networking after my internship got me the job. My classmates who didn't have as much ""luck"" basically finished school, sent out resumes and then called it a day and moved home to mommy. My professors, supervisors and coworkers who wrote me 15-25 letters of recommendation did so because I absolutely blew them away by pulling a 3.89 GPA with a triple full time class load and four part-time jobs. Yeah, I was real lucky."
