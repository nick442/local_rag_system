"I think I'm just old enough to not be referred to as one of them, but I know that I almost deliberately don't buy anything sold in ads, and I do weird shit like click no when sites ask me if an ad is relevant, especially when it is. I don't use Twitter a lot, but when I do, I pick every single ad and kill it. What's the option? Is it ""I don't like this ad"" or something like that? I know I've thrown off the persona tracking when I'm getting ads for things the exact opposite of what I would buy or use."
