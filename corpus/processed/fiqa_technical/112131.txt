"Shrekli was rightfully caught illegally funneling money from one company to pay back investors in a failing fund. That's separate from the so-called ""AIDs drug"" he supposedly price-gouged pple with. First off, the drug is not an AIDs Rx. It treats a parasite-caused disease called toxoplasmosis that pple w/ a weakened immune system (i.e. like AIDs patients) are at risk for. The drug is only needed until the parasite is gotten rid of & it was also a drug that caused adverse drug reactions..something that the biomedical industry is trying to lower w/ pharmacogenomics/pharmacogenetics data. You may not like capitalism, but personally, I think it's a good thing that there are pple like Shkreli who want to take old drugs and develop better, less toxic medications. And from my understanding, the pts who did not have insurance or could not pay for this drug were given it for free."
