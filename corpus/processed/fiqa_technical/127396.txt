When corporations have as much impact and power over our lives as a government should we really just let them walk over our civil rights? If I can't get a credit card because of my political ideology how am I supposed to function? How am I supposed to build credit, get a lot an, or buy a house? At what point do I have to give up my life, liberty, and pursuit of happyness because a private corporation has effectively banished me from society? Governments shouldn't be able to oppress and neither should corporations.
