No, remittances are a current account. Capital/financial accounts are “investments”. Current account is transactional. So if I take out a loan from a Spanish bank in Latin America, the principal of the loan is recorded as a capital flow but the interest income is a current account flow. If I make a dollar here and send it to a family member in Mexico, that’s considered a current account flow. The BPM6 manual from the IMF has the updated information on BOP accounting. It was updated in like 2013, I believe. It’s quite technical and dull but if you’re really curious it’s a 300+ page guide on the intricate details.
