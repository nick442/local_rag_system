I like this part: >Because insurance companies are required to take all applicants, healthy people (especially the young) would be wise to pay the penalty rather than buy the insurance. This makes the pool of insured individuals sicker and more costly, on average, and their premiums will higher. With higher premiums, more people will choose to pay the penalty, and a downward spiral will unfold. Which is the exact opposite of reality. If you have more people in an insurance pool, premium costs go down, which is the whole point of the individual mandate. It's like they're trying to scare people to not buy health insurance and waste it on a fine instead. Real nice.
