otherwiseyep linked to a good explaination, but is downvoted due to it having an inflammatory title (Why S.&P.’s Ratings Are Substandard and Porous). Basically, S&P ratings correlate with a corruption perceptions index: > Other factors that S.&P. looks at, which can be determined through regression analysis, include a country’s G.D.P., its inflation rate, its recent deficits and its long-term debt. But the subjective Corruption Perceptions Index is more closely related to the S.&P. ratings than any of these economic fundamentals. As an analogy, S&P looks at whether you wear a suit and tie to the job interview. It probably works OK during a boom - countries with low corruption have a lower risk of default due to non-financial problems (revolutions, crazy governments).
