Non-cooperative game theory is where none of the participants work together. That, and the exploration of non-cooperative outcomes. I am a computer programmer, and one of my first projects was based on Game Theory (aside from the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma, which everyone has to do), and using basic rules to get AI to learn to accomplish goals. The Game Theory aspect was in the logic for how the AI chooses what to learn and what to discard. What about non-cooperative game theory do you wish to educate me on?
