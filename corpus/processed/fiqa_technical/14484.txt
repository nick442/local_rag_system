"Not necessarily. Shorting XOM is saying that EM (china + india) are going to have a ""slowdown"" (not neg growth but slower) and that US is going to pick up a lot slower. Selling JNJ means the manager is overall bearish but doesn't have that much conviction (otherwise he would sell XOM or SPY), but still wants that negative exposure. Personally, both are just plays on SPY with increased risk (XOM) or decreased risk (JNJ)."
