Virtually all of Facebook's users also use Windows (either at home or at work). Microsoft charges money for Windows licenses, lots of money. You can make the same analogy for Microsoft's Business division (Office products). Facebook's valuation is getting comparable to Microsoft (ex-cash stockpile). It is absolutely ridiculous. Google is the dominant online advertiser, and Google's profits is not even close to what Microsoft makes. Only a small fraction. Even if Facebook meets all future expectations and becomes the dominant online advertiser, making the same amount of money as Google, it still doesn't deserve that $100B valuation today, as it will take years before it gets up there. Facebook may be an amazing product, but collecting hundreds of dollars per license renewal is simply a better business than an ad-supported model. In order for advertisers to pay Facebook $100/user (the type of money Microsoft makes), the users must be buying thousands of dollars more stuff because of Facebook ads. That's not possible, especially with other methods of advertising all competing.
