They previously had a 42-year-old guy as CFO so evidently they think this '29 years old kiddo' could do this job. It's mostly cost cutting anyway. Since the deal closed in 2015 KraftHeinz has eliminated 10,000 jobs or 25% of its workforce. older workers were the ones who were more affected. 3G also promoted a 33-year-old 'kiddo' to become CEO of Burger King three years ago. Promotion based nepotism may be more common in family owned companies like News Corp (which doesn't have to care too much what minority shareholders say). But 3G is a private equity and their sole job is to maximize IRR. If the KraftHeinz investment is going badly Im sure the LPs will force 3G to replace the management.
