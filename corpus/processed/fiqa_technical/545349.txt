Heh, Argentina's inflation numbers these past few years are [basically lies](http://en.mercopress.com/2012/02/02/imf-warn-argentina-on-lack-of-progress-in-addressing-inflation-data). The IMF data is based off of this data, so it doesn't prove what you think it proves. Not to say they haven't done okay, but when they've done well it's been purely because of China's demand for natural resources.
