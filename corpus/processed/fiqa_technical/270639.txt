The fact that something is a choice doesn't mean that it is insane and terrible for someone to choose the less healthy option. Processed foods are easier to find and cheaper to purchase. Some people have jobs that force them into patterns of behavior that are unhealthy. Judging every single person who makes a poor choice to be an entitled piece of shit, as you did in another post, is not reasonable or fair.
