"Again, there is nothing in the world that is ""totally safe"". Drink enough water and you will die. So let's not set the bar so high that it cannot be met by any standard. Yes, I am aware of what confirmation bias is. I find that most research-denial and data-denial comes from the anti-Monsanto crowd who continually disregard decades of mounting evidence that there is no link between glyphosate and cancer. ""After extensive reviews, most regulatory agencies—the US Environmental Protection Agency, the European Food Safety Authority, and those of many other nations—have come to the conclusion that it does not cause cancer."" EDIT: more ""One of the largest and most highly regarded studies to examine effects of pesticide use in real life is the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective investigation of about 89,000 agricultural workers, farmers and their families in Iowa and North Carolina. Since the early 1990s, it has gathered and analysed detailed information on the health of participants and their families, and their use of pesticides, including glyphosate. AHS researchers have published numerous studies from their data. One paper looking at glyphosate and possible links with cancers was published in 2005. It concluded that “glyphosate exposure was not associated with cancer incidence overall.” Since then, more data has been collected, adding statistical power to subsequent AHS analyses."" http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/glyphosate-cancer-data/"
