I think it's a little too early to be attributing job losses/hour losses/*potential* job or hour losses to the wage hikes thus far. For one thing, there are other factors at work in the economy than just the hourly wage hikes. For another, these hikes JUST happened over the past 2-3 years. Wait until 2021 for the minimum wage to hit its target, and even then wait a couple years to gather data while it's at $15. Even in the article it looks like Berkeley and UW can't agree on their models and data. It sounds like it's all just mixed messages right now.
