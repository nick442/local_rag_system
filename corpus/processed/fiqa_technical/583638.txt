Two hours? Phew, that's long. A few things that come to mind: Read job interview articles before you go.. They always helped get my mind thinking in that direction. There are plenty online. A two hour interview is, my guess, an attempt to learn about your personality and whether you wi fit in. I wouldn't try to fake this, just be yourself. Expect them to ask about who you are outside a 3.9 gpa - and be ready to answer. What do you have an appetite for? Is it outdoors, sushi, sports? Doesn't really matter, just be passionate about something. Don't oversell yourself. It's okay to be nervous but don't turn that into being some kid that talks too much and is awkward. Managers interview all the time, they just want a normal human being to sit across the table.
