Article is right about Boeing hypocrisy and the fall out. What the author got wrong is that this is not necessarily about overall sales or competition against the 320/737 line but the fact that Boeing walked away from the size category and has nothing to compete in a segment that is growing. Edit: I'd like to add, what's so unusual is Boeing dosen't even sell a plane in the CS niche so they can't argue it's robbing sales.
