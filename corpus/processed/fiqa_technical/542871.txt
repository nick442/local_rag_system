It's odd to me that they manage their own pensions closely enough to divest of anything and that they'd have been invested in private prisons enough to have anything to get rid of. I'm also not sure that I'd feel better as a NYC pensioner knowing that my retirement fund is becoming politicized. In this case it's probably a good thing, but in the future who knows.
