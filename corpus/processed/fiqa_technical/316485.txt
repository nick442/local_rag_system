One more thing to consider is that $1M today is not the same as $1M 30 years from now because of inflation. Consider that just 30 years ago (1980) the average house price in the US was only about $69K and a new car cost around $7K on average. When you retire, it isn't much of a stretch to assume that you could be paying $1.5M for a typical house, $100K for mid-grade car, by the time you retire in 30 years. Of course, over the rest of your working life your salary will likely increase due to inflation too, so that will help. In 1980 the average US income was around $19K/year. So even though that number seems huge, it is because it is denominated in currency that has been devalued significantly.
