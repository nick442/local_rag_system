I'll give it a shot, though I know nearly nothing about airlines. 1% is a lot when your revenue is very high. Lets say a plane can have 200 people on it. Plane tickets are a lot, so each person is charged $700 in this example. That's 140K in gross revenue per trip. 1% of that is $1400. You have several trips a day per plane. Lets say 5 trips a day per plane. Each plane is netting $7000 a day. Or around $2.5 million in profit a year. Lets say a commercial plane that has a capacity of 200, costs around $50 million. That's a 20 year ROI. Up your margins to 2%, now you're at 10 year ROI. Plus depreciation. You get to depreciate that $50 million over the course of X years. Basically making all of the profits the airline gets, tax free due to their insane amount of depreciation. Pair this income with cheap oil, and a smart CEO that can cut costs, and you have a cash cow on your hands. And given the fact that a lot of airlines have a ton of planes already depreciated to $0 that aren't on their books any more, you may be able to buy the airline for a fraction of their net assets. Margins are important, but it's all relative. Edit: Changed numbers to prove my point, and because I am not a smart man
