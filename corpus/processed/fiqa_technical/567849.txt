"If by ""loss on the sale"" you mean ""an expense"", then yes that is fine. Say you sell a $20 game on Steam (30% is very common on markets like Steam, Google Play Store, iTunes Store, etc..), then you would report: Side note: 30% is actually not that bad. For a product I helped bring into a few retail store chains, they are effectively taking closer to 40%, though retail can vary depending on several factors."
