History.. No company has maintained such a high market cap over an extended amount of time. Not only that, but is Apple worth a trillion dollars? In a generation will their products be as popular? They're worth significantly more than Exxon Mobil at this point.. If Apple's market cap does go to a trillion dollars its an upside of 60 percent or so. Or I can invest in a company like Lenovo whose market cap is 11 billion and is expanding like crazy. If their valuation goes up even to the 50 billion mark, that's an upside of nearly 400 percent. Plus there's the whole supply/demand dynamic for a stock that is already widely owned, how much more money can new investors put into it? When will all the funds who hold massive quantities sell? Etc.. There are many reasons why no company has maintained a trillion dollar valuation.. Honestly it shocks me that people who frequent a finance message board don't understand these things.
