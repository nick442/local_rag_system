Thank God. I mean, I like having some kind of spending power.. But not at the expense of my taxes being used to bombs kids in countries who's leaders try to reject the dollar. Unfortunately, the international banking cartels are invested in Yen and Rubbles, so they win and we all lose no matter what. If only the people of all three nations were able to see past nationalism and devise a system that doesn't rely on competition for currency dominance..
