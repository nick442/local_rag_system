"You guys come out like mosquitos whenever there is a question against Monsanto shennanigans. Playing the ""oh but it's not factual proven and there is no scientific evidence"" card when a general look from the outside suggests there is in fact some possible correlation. It's like tobacco companies and cancer, deny even when suppressed internal studies suggest differently."
