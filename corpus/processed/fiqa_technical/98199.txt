This only applies to owners that bought the S60 models. To save money, Tesla installed the same size battery pack in both the S60 and S75 and limited the range on the S60 through software. The S60 is cheaper than the S75 for that reason. At anytime, you can pay the difference to unlock your S60 to the range of an S75.
