LOL!! Israel as a country exists since 1200BC, before there were almost any countries in the whole world, huge contributions to the whole world ever since, and today it's a model for how to run a free, democratic, succesful country in the whole region. Huge loss to the world if anything happens to Israel. North Korea.. well, nobody will miss it if it is wiped off the face of the earth, including its own people who live in a hell called N Korea. Much better world without N Korea.
