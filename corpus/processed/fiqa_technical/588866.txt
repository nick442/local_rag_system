Union Electricians make an average of $60-$80k depending on your area. Some can make less, but typically that would be non union workers. Some states are right to work, and by definition they will pay less than unions. Union Floor Layers/Carpenters/Painters all make way more than you can believe. Again, non union will take a small hit, but all clear $25/$30 and hour without second thought. There can be ups and downs in the market, work can get scarce, but if you save - there is not a problem. No college is required for the trades. Hard work is necessary, getting dirty as fuck is necessary, early start times/long days are a must, and the most obvious is working around many dipshit motherfuckers who shit in glue and paint buckets.
