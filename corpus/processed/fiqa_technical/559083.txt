"You're just outright wrong. I'm sure if you post an ask reddit asking about people who smoke and what they do for a living you will be outright amazed at the cross section you find. I make 6 figures, work my but off, and run a consulting business on the side and I'm a regular smoker. I have co-workers who are regular smokers who also make 6 figures, in fact of the people I work with that smoke, the lowest paid makes somewhere in the 70k range. Now, that anecdotal evidence is not super compelling as there are confounding factors. But it's far more compelling than ""This is how it is because this is how I feel it is"", which seems to be the gist of your responses."
