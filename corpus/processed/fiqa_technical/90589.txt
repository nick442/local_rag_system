If the fact that currency is based on fiat, something that has been the case with currency somewhere on Earth since the Tang Dynasty of China discovered paper money a long, long time ago, leaves you up in arms, then I shudder to think what an explanation of how the price of money can be derived from plotting IS and LM together and extending it's meeting point into the money market to determine the price of currency would do to your notion of control by powerful offices in government. My good sir, have you ever considered that YOU might be the smug moron? That YOU might be the one who just found out what everyone in the room already learned years ago and lack the foundation the rest of us have to understand that information in context? That it might be YOU who are uninformed? I'll quote you right here: >people who have no clue what the fuck they are talking about go off and lecture other people, bringing up facts that have no thought behind them, and are merely definitions posing as an argument. Making a statement, then getting corrected, then coming back and simply lengthening the original answer is not an argument. >I'll say it again: our currency is fiat. It is backed by nothing You don't seem to understand just what it is backed by. It is backed by trust, steady demand, and the assurance of powerful national and international bodies. As is the price of everything, including gold and literally every other commodity on the planet. Your utter shock and outrage upon discovering this minute fact does not indicate a revolutionary zeitgeist or that you are some kind of free spirit, it indicates that you are uneducated on the context of basic and well understood facts that the rest of the educated world is already caught up on.
