That's a pretty big jump going from private equity and Toys R Us to Trump voters. To me, this will go down exactly as it should: anyone who borrowed money to the private equity firm for the Toys R Us deal will lose a lot of money. The only larger connection I see is that retail is a terrible business to be in right now.
