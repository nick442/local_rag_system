https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/76kfob/comment/dogaxph?st=J8UIVZS9&sh=dc05f8f9 Read the entire argument with me and that guy, he really thinks prices won’t increase if tipping is eliminated. He even says “it is impossible to guess” that prices would increase. There are a ton of people in this thread who are oblivious to the obvious increase in price that would happen if tipping stopped, and most of those comments are heavily upvoted.
