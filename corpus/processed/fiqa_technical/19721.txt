I agree with you for the most part, but banks need *some* way of comparing the relative risk of various loan applicants; forcing them to use TweedleDee over TweedleDum is really failing to see the forest for the trees. Equifax is *not* the problem here. The fact that that entire *industry* is allowed to exist without our explicit permission, *is* the problem.
