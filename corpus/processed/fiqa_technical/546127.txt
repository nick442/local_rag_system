I've always had a job in Healthcare IT, past 11 years, but never went to school for computers. All of my skills came from on the job training or company paid certifications. Instead of taking on debt, take a position at a company that will help with your tuition. In the long run, a company willing to pay for you to get smarter is one you'd want to stay with. In my opinion.
