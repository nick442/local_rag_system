"You obviously pay your taxes in Switzerland and are employed (judging from your comments on your maximum possible contribution to the 3. S채ule). Under these circumstances, your best best may well be to pay into the occupational pension system (""Einkauf in die 2. S채ule""). Essentially, you can add funds to your pension plan to match non-existent employer contributions from times you spent studying etc. The 2. S채ule is usually defensively invested in bonds, so it's not a completely secure investment. In addition, it's a pretty fixed investment, since you can only get your money out if you buy a house or leave Switzerland for good. However, your entire payment into the 2. S채ule is tax deductible, so the tax effect in itself should be a very attractive bit of ""interest"". Your pension plan can inform you about the maximum possible Einkauf."
