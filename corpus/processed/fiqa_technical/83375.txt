A lot of modern pharmaceuticals are derived from coal tar. There are lots of ways to make aspirin as you can see [here](http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Aspirin.html) , but it was originally produced from a coal tar derivative which you can read about [here](https://skeptoid.com/blog/2014/05/22/the-mythology-of-asprin/) . For a more scholarly scholarly source regarding aspirin and coal tar I would suggest [this](https://www.amazon.com/German-Genius-Renaissance-Scientific-Revolution/dp/0060760230) fascinating book. Aspirin does not come from willow bark, although a similar and less effective drug is found there.
