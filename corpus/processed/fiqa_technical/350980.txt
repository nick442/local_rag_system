If it were me, I'd be debt free today, Monday, at latest. 100K-(53K+31.2K) = 15.8K would be my bank balance by this afternoon. I am not sure why you would count 6K of your daughter's money as yours to use. Either it is her money, or yours, not both. If you still want debt, which I think is silly, you might try to refi your home with a home equity loan. That loan would be in first position, at a fixed rate, and for a fixed term. Regions bank did some thing like this for a person with excellent credit and plenty of equity. They got a 7 year loan at 2.6% when the prevailing interest rate on a 15 year was about a point higher.
