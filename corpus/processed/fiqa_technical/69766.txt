I have maintained that traditional TV will be obsolete for years now.. it seems a certain inevitability, since the invention of the internet. Even assuming it is certain, there are some things to consider: 1) Time Frame: It is taking way longer than I had expected for people to switch away from traditional subscriptions/packaging. Many people refuse to adopt/adapt to new technology and like the comfortable familiarity of TV. It is hard to say exactly when 'the big shift' will happen. 2) The companies making billions of dollars are likely monitoring their revenues/market very closely, and will probably know better than you when their current business model is about to fail. They may develop a plan to switch to internet based distribution, production of shows, or any number of other alternatives, which might not cause their share price to drop as drastically as one might predict. Profiting from this idea (as with any strategy) relies on you to identify the stocks that will be affected, and time your short position on them better than the rest of the market. Doing it now, or at an arbitrary date, means you will incur the opportunity cost of holding the instrument over a period when another investment would yield better returns (potentially even a long position on these same companies).
