Winter is coming.. and Ukraine's gas bill is due. Don't expect the IMF backed plan to win over the currently sympathetic Ukrainians.. when they are freezing to death and are being asked to take Greece like austerity measures. Don't expect EU voters to subsidize Ukraines gas bill. By march of next year.. expect a full blown grand exodus of support for a western plan, especially in Ukraine.
