The big issue I have is that people seem so hellbent on using short term, unrelated, indicators to make their political decisions. Not only is the President not King of Gas Prices, but daily/weekly/monthly fluctuations in a commodity price should be pretty unrelated to how you assess a platform, plan, vision, or leader, IMO.
