A market downturn is a great opportunity to pick up valuable stocks at low prices but do note that this is quite a risky proposition and requires abundant research. But again, as is mentioned in previous answers, the start of the downturn is evident only in hindsight, and it is always advisable to have a balanced/diversified portfolio, risking only what you can afford to lose. In any case, indices like Dow Jones, NASDAQ, S&P500 are calculated on the basis of only a few companies that broadly represent their individual sectors.
