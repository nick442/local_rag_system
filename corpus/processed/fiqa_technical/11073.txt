I can't believe no one has mentioned Detroit yet! Amazon already pulls a huge percentage of their MBA hires from 40 miles away at the University of Michigan. The state is filled with good schools pumping out smart, qualified STEM, engineering, and computer science majors. We're also surrounded by great schools in Chicago and Pennsylvania. Detroit has an exploding urban core but also lots of space for new development right downtown. It has a quickly diversifying economy, though the auto industry is still a significant player which is assisting with Detroit's thriving tech sector and driving autonomous vehicle research and development. Detroit is 20 minutes away from Canada (across a bridge or through a tunnel - and a second bridge is in the process of being built). Depending on how the US emigration policy continues, having access to an international workforce via Canada at a US HQ could be a game changer. There is a lot that Detroit can offer that is unique to this city.
