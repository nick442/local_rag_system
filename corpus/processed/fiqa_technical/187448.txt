"The HSA tax deduction comes when you contribute money to the HSA, not when you take money out. So you can contribute up to the max and take your maximum deduction each year, regardless of what medical expenses you have. If you have medical expenses, but no money left in your HSA, you will just have to pay for them out-of-pocket. However, in the future when your HSA has money in it again, you can reimburse yourself for medical expenses you have now. As long as you have an HSA in place (even if there is no money in it currently), there is no time limit to reimburse yourself for those medical expenses. Reimburse yourself for what you can, and keep track of whatever expenses you are unable to reimburse at this time. Hopefully, in a future year your health will improve (or your medical coverage will improve), and you can ""catch up"" reimbursing yourself for these old expenses. Regarding your question about tax benefit: The HSA acts similar to a traditional IRA when invested, growing tax-deferred. So if you contribute, and choose not to withdraw but instead invest, there are tax advantages, similar to an IRA. However, if you are already investing a sufficient amount in retirement accounts, there is nothing wrong with reimbursing yourself now for the expenses if you need the money. You get the primary tax deduction either way."
