A wealthy starving man, what a contradiction in terms. You have to invent rare, impossible creatures just to get your false moralistic fantasies to make the slightest bit of sense. Yes, in fact it makes him LESS willing to pay, as in this case his plight makes him willing to pay for smaller quantities of poorer quality eggs. Diminishing marginal utility doesn't apply here dude, these guys are on completely different indifferece curves due to their respective budgetary restrictions. Then again, you'd know that if you knew one one hundredth of 1% of what you were talking about. Again, you are not thinking in concrete terms, you're thinking about the world as it should be. This poor starving man should have money so he can eat! The reality in observable terms is that the fed man will pay more money for eggs than the starving man. Thus we say he is more willing to pay.
