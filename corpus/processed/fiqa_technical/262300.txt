"Yea Trump is just shutting down everything, right? So. less than a handful of instances where the WH doesnt allow certain press is now a threat to our free speech? They treat Trump like complete garbage, its only right he plays their game sometimes. These media outlets main priority there isnt to report on the president. Instead they beg for a moment where they can create a nice short little segment and say ""ah ha, gotcha!"". The legacy media is on its way out. Alternatives such as youtube allow people to create videos to really disect information with much less political bias."
