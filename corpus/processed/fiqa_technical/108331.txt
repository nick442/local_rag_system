"I am but one man but here's my ""use-case"": I setup my Alexa Dot in the kitchen/living room area and use it most for: - Asking it to play whatever I feel like listening to without fumbling over my phone with chicken hands - Asking it to set a variety of timers for whatever might be baking/cooking etc. - Keeping track of my grocery list as I inevitably run out of something mid-meal prep. - I often ask it do do simple math I can't be bothered with, or unit conversions Of course, there are most certainly other solutions to this but it just seemed like a simple one to some of my ""problems"". It's a nicety, of course not a necessity.. I just like it. *Disclaimer* I'm extremely lazy and MOST of the time if I have to pause what I'm doing/drop what I'm holding, to reach for my cellphone or a paper list, I just wont. But like you said, to each their own!"
