A common response to poor labour conditions is: if you don't like your job, leave and get a better one. However, in Idaho the state is trying to deregulate aspects of the labour market. It's making it easier for companies to enforce non compete agreements. Meaning you literally cannot leave for a competitor if you don't like your employer. That's a natural consequence of deregulating labour markets: it lets the companies with enormous budgets push around workers, who are at the same time having their ability to organise into unions and bargain collectively undermined by companies who use said economic power to lobby against regulations that protect workers. So, free market away but don't convince yourself that a lack of regulation will somehow magically lead to a utopian allocation of resources where everyone gets what they need. In a totally unregulated market, the wealth only trickles one way and it's not down.
