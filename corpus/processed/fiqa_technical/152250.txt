"If you are opposed to getting ""something for nothing"" because it created a subculture where there is no desire to earn a living simply because they have it pretty good without. How do you feel about increasing the Estate Tax in the USA. Many ""conservatives"" want to eliminate it. As to community service for welfare, I assume your position is the wider the safety net, the more people will take unfair advantage of that and not work. How do you explain the many nations that have wider safety nets than the USA and yet they have lower unemployment? I agree with you on cuts in our military spending, simplifying the tax code, and banning the corporate involvement in campaign funding."
