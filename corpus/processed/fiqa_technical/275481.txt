I would probably try to find a job back home or around school in a company doing wealth management or something financial. After your second year, leverage your first summer and aim for smaller groups in big cities that might not recruit heavily and aren't bulge or a high name boutique but still do serious finance and learn a lot. Third year, shoot for the big names and talk about your experience, that will set you a part from everyone else who likely has little finance experience.
