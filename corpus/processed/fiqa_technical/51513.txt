They've proven their incompetence to the core of their business, and worse they continue to flail with ham fisted fixes (WordPress, failed security certificate configs, random results from the 'have I been impacted' system, failure to address the freeze PINs being timestamps after a year+ of notice, etc). I can't think of any redeeming action they could take, and as they have a pretty much guaranteed customer base, they have no incentive to correct or behave any better. While it may not be their core business, data security should have been a core competency and they don't even have a CISO with an IT education or any real measure of IT competency much less DataSec.
