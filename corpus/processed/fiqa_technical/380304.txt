> Yeah but they don't go to work high. > Exactly. Meant to say that they DO go to work high. Plenty of them. > I actually have several medical conditions that justify it, but that's beside the point that marijuana should simply be legal. Alcohol is legal even though it is a far more dangerous substance than pot. The difference between alcohol and pot is that there are restrictions on alcohol. You can't drink in the street, you can't be publicly intoxicated, you can't drive while high (most pot smokers do if not all) > You don't have to be a daily smoker to test positive. People who only smoke once a week are likely to fail a drug test. There's no reason to think that those people are unhappy, unsuccessful, can't unwind without drugs, or any other negative generalization you might want to impose. I was talking about daily smokers. Many are. > I don't dispute those statistics, but they're about Millennials, not pot smokers. Sure, its probably even higher for pot smokers. > Millennials' economic difficulties are more likely to be caused by the economy than they are by any widespread drug abuse, which allegation I have no reason to think is supported. And even if Millennials do use crazy amounts of drugs, so did the Baby Boomers, whose economic prosperity does not seem to have been impaired in the slightest. Economy is ok, its the dumb decisions they made. Plenty are uneducated, then you have them fighting for high minimum wage and letting illegals stay. Both reduce the number of jobs or destroy them. The pot these days is MUCH stronger. Then you have all kinds of other shit like edibles, oils, etc.
