Are you raising that cat simply to eat? And sure, if the the dog or cat or bear for that matter, is raised simply to be eaten or used for body parts later, I could care less if they are abused. They are used for a purpose. A means to an end. I really think there are things in this world that we could better spend our time worrying about, rather than this turkey, who will make a delicious sandwich in a few months.
