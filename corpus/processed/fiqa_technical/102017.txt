Micromax is a very interesting company. Their made to order chinese phones are shit, but cheap. At the most they are value for money. Which makes them a huge player in India. Combined with good marketing, somewhat acceptable after sales and some android magic, this company is raking in billions. They should really invest some of this money into R&D, imho. Manufacture something at least.
