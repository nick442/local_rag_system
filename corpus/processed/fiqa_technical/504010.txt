"It's important because I don't believe that luck is just something that happens to someone. ""Luck"" is a series of choices that someone makes, be they conscious or unconscious that helps them arrive at their destination. When you meet someone at a dinner that happens further your career or becomes someone you do business with, etc, a series of choices that you made, be they good or bad, helped you arrive at that place in time. Once again, how is that luck? It comes down to intuition and understanding which is the best road to take. The same applies to a scenario that includes Rupert Murdoch, etc. Something tells me that if I met either of those guys that you mentioned, something would probably rub me the wrong way, which in turn would influence my choice to follow or walk away."
