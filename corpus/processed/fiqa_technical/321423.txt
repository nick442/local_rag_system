Nothing holds you in place, but your own head. If you want to do something that pays better, try setting goals. Read books on your dream job, learn the processes, and do whatever it takes to get there. I'll tell you this, I am not impressed with people who slack off and want better pay. Skill and knowledge jobs pay more. The trades are a great way to earn a living, if you aren't a smart person, but work hard. You want a desk job paying 100k, get your ass in gear. No time for drinking and getting high, dreaming about the job someone else has. Earn it.
