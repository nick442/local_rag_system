Terrible analogy. It's a gross oversimplification and any attempt to respond within it's parameters won't make sense. Boeing wants to reduce costs in order to remain competitive and because it's a public company. Boeing's union workers are overcompensated. They want to move states in order to reduce labor costs. Washington State paid out to keep them around.
