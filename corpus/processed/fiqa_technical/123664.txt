"Yeah most employers will say that their employment is ""at will"" and they can fire for anything but that's usually not true. If someone gets fired there has to be a reason. Those agreements that people are often required to sign when they start a job are not legally binding in any courtroom at all. Employers will usually lie about it because they are breaking the law and they know it. The only situation where they could get away with not having a reason to terminate someone is if they do not replace that person, which is a lay off. Basically any other circumstance they had a reason and they are responsible for that reason."
