Here is the raw truth that you are missing. The people displaced by Amazon eliminating these lower end jobs will not be able to find work. EVER!! They are now structurally unemployed. The are not able to learn the skills necessary to find work because they lack the initiative and/or intelligence. Remember that the average I.Q. is 100 meaning that around half of the workforce is below 100. If we eliminate all jobs these folks can perform what are they going to do? Idle hands etc.
