Because the Netherlands is smaller than almost every state in the US. It is ~237 times smaller than the US. Logistics in the US are a nightmare. I looked at the size comparison compared to my state, I drive half the width of your country to work every morning. So round trip I drive the entire width of your country in one day just to get to work.
