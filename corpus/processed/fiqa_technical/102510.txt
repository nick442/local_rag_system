You do know the ACA was modeled after both a Republican-introduced plan from the 90s as well as Mitt Romney's insurance reform plan for Massachusetts? If Democrats had their way, a public option (Medicaid or Medicare buy-in) would be available to those 10 mil who are feeling the squeeze. And the state insuring health care for its citizens hardly seems like bread and circus. A healthier populace is more efficient and less costly in the long run.
