Price range compared to the Model 3? Here in Germany we always get the same yada yada about batteries not sufficient, grid not evolved enough, Tesla going down soon. But Benz is actually preparing, also gigafactorywise. You are right. The bigger question is when they will realize that they can't maintain just selling cars to the end user. Owning a car at some point will be a thing of the past. You will pay a monthly fee and always have a car in front of your house when you need it.
