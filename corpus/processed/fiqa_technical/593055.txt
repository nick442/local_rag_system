There are things called food deserts, where fresh produce is simply not available, I'm talking about areas where you are *miles* away from the closest store with fresh produce, mostly in poor areas. Add that into the minimal time afforded to actually get and prepare meals you can see that those people who most need the nutrition are least able to get it.
