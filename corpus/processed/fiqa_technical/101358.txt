The scammer is definitely up to something fishy. He (it's certain that the she is a he) may deposit some money into your father's account to gain his trust. After which, he will propose to come meet your dad. That's where the scamming begins. He will come up with a story about flight, VISA issues, or a problem he has to solve before coming over. Another is that he can use your dad's empty account to receive monies he scammed off people. That way there's no direct link with him and his other victim.
