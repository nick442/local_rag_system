Couple quick ?s to help understand your situation a bit better. Are you currently in school and if so grad or undergrad? Undergrad opens up a whole different world of formal recruiting than you would get otherwise. It sounds like you already graduated, if so, how many years out are you? Further out, the much harder it's going to be without going back to get an MBA or MSF. Your other option is being in the top 1-5% of your career, but like has been said, you still can't get into financial consulting. IT do companies like PWC, BoozAllen, Capgemini, Cognizant and Accenture would be better. If you're more than 5 years out of undergrad without an MBA, it is going to be EXTREMELY difficult I break in, no less with the firms you mentioned. McKinsey is a lot like Goldman, in some cases the acceptance rate from recruiting can be more difficult than Harvard. You're going up against extremely intelligent, hard working individuals who are trained in strategy consulting through degrees. Be prepared for this and no matter what you're doing, networking is going to be key to getting in so start now. People you meet at these companies can help you more with that. Also, what in particular excites you about consulting? Also, what kind of consulting (ie biz dev, strategy, financial, IT, due diligence, govt, etc.). You need to understand that before doing a search. There are major differences between each of them. Not trying to he a debbie downer, just a realist. If say, for example, I did a basic programming course and really enjoyed it, I wouldn't immediately apply to Google, and Google would expect me to be formally trained by more than just reading programming books. It's not much different with very high end consulting and easily just as competitive as getting into a Google. I hope this helps. Hopefully with a reply I can help a little more! Not saying it can't be done, just difficult depending on where you are in your career path.
