Reddit has always had a thing for nuclear. There was a period of time when there were more reddit posts about thorium reactors than there are posts about Tesla Motors now.. The main point that is ignored is that nuclear is more expensive than natural gas after considering the building cost. On an aside the post you made sort of proves his point. There *is* an arguably unwarranted weird stigma attached to supporting nuclear.
