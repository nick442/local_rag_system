Not quite. The lottery takes almost no effort or investment to play. It's low risk, negative return, but a small chance for high return. MLM requires a lot of time, effort, and usually $5K-$10K of debt before people bail out. It's a high risk, negative return, with a small chance for a positive return and no chance for a high return. They are similar in being bad investments, but lotteries do so at a much smaller scale for individuals.
