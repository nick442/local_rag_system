I don't think size is the issue, it's quality. Most places have patties that taste like cardboard with absolutely no seasoning. There's a local burger place where I live that bakes their own buns seasons their patties perfectly and has toppings like balsamic onion gastrique. The result is fantastic, filling and under 400 calories (under 300 for the Bison meat option).
