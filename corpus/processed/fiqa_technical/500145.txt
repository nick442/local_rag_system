"Sounds like you live in a fantasy land where everyone has infinite do-over lives and market forces are magic panacea. Clean air and water is a public good that shouldn't be left up to multiple parties upstream or in the region to hash out in a legal system how to remedy problems on a case-by-case basis while individuals have to deal with resulting cancer, brain damage, etc. We shouldn't leave issues like this to crop up from short-sightedness and cognitive biases of private parties left to their own devices. There should be regulation of industries that minimize the risk/impact of pollution without being counterproductive by halting the economy altogether. If the US had been run the way you want, we'd have had prevalence of leaded gasoline, paint, and lead in drinking water for decades more. And we'd have higher crime rates due to the brain damage caused by lead. Making all roads private and for-profit creates a profit motive in acquiring lands that are strategically important in transportation, opening up opportunities for monopolies and collusion. Your proposal will replace a government ""monopoly"" on roads answerable to voters with a private monopolies or cartels that answer to no one because there is no competition. And this will kill the benefit we have in network effect of public roads. Law and law enforcement is a matter of trust. We need to have trust and reasonable expectation of fairness/uniformity in the law enforcement and justice system for individuals and companies to conduct their lives/business. I am not convinced that a nation with disparate systems with their own private laws and security forces and with no hierarchy somehow achieves that goal."
