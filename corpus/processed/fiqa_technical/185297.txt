Is this modified title necessary? I work at a turntable company and the vast majority of our customers are not hipsters in any sense of the word. Sony getting back in the game is great news for anyone who enjoys the format, especially those of us who have been burned by inflated record prices recently. Most vinyl lovers are not making a fashion statement with their choice of format.
