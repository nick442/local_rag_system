Quite possible, although I doubt those will play a significant role in the near future. Aside from robbing students of the whole 'college experience', 'virtual' classrooms can't really re-create one of the most important factors of college/university education: networking. The reason rich people send their kids to expensive schools is not that the education there is necessarily better, but because they are sure to meet other rich people's kids there, which creates business opportunities. A similar thing, albeit at another level, happens at every college in every town in every country. If there is no campus, there is no (or, at best, very little) networking.
