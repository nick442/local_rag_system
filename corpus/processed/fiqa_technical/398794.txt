Meh, it was probably a little of both the story and others I've seen call it a meeting that included a photo op with the president. But I can see the logic there. Not sure what principles you are referring to here. But again, to each their own. Everyone has their own set of principles. They very rarely match up exactly with others especially across ideological lines. I never said he should. I said I was not surprised he didn't. The real question is why should we care if he did or didnt.
