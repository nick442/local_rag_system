Thank you for a great answer! Yes, I was thinking the government could spend money on building projects and such. Is it possible for a third party to invest in a building project in Greece to help the economy? Ie, if someone financed building a great roman theater. This would create jobs and through the multiplier effect, increase the collective demand for goods and services. Also, that kind of project could give Greece new tourism.
