"I don't really get why this is in r/business either, except that it seems it did not accumulate sufficient karma in more fitting subreddits the OP also submitted it to. That being said, if you search GoogleNews with ""china organ harvesting"", you'll get dozens of recent results on Chinese organ harvesting articles/investigations. While this author appears to have done an in depth investigation on his own in this particular case, there is no shortage of similar stories. Set the search time frame back a year or two, and you'll find loads of articles [about other groups in China being robbed of their organs, and/or killed, or ""lost""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilgour-Matas_report) by state-sanctioned entities. Unethical organ harvesting in China is by no means a new story, nor is it a big secret that life is fairly cheap in China. Outside of the more obvious examples, there were also a lot of [investigations into things like the circumstances under which bodies from China were acquired that were later used in educational anatomical exhibits that traveled North America for several years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodies:_The_Exhibition#Uncertainty_about_provenance_of_the_bodies). There are also, of course, [many, many other cases of the Chinese government abusing human rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China), but that's not new news either, nor is it business-related."
