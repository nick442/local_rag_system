So? If the executives have mismanaged the company (and let's not pretend that's what's happening here -- Sears has been being systematically butchered for years at this point, so it's _worse_ than ineptitude), _why the fuck are the executives getting paid instead of existing obligations being at least partially funded_? If I go to work at a car wash and do such a shit job that I run half a dozen vehicles through the wash with all the windows rolled down, I'm probably not only getting fired, but I'm likely going to be on the hook for damages. Executives pretty much get away with anything that isn't literally criminal in a lot of these cases, and the fact that Sears has been getting parted out for _years_ makes it obvious that they knew full well that it'd be coming to this.
