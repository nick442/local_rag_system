Every Austrian student is required to do a bachelor thesis. The research is very basic, nothing like a master's thesis where you do proper research on a topic. As I said, my goal is to be done by the end of September if I can start with research in July. A master's thesis would certainly take significantly longer and more preparation. For me it's whether or not I can tie it into my place of employment.
