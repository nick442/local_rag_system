Nobody is suggesting that China hasn't had massive amounts of growth. However, even a relatively small discrepancy (for instance, 6.9% against 6.5%, similar to what appears in the article) can compound in to a huge difference over years. If that relatively minute 0.4% spread were misreported since the 90s, that produces output gap of about USD $2 trillion (roughly 10% of the GDP). It's hard to guess the magnitude of the inaccuracies, though some estimates exist, but I'd be willing to bet that the government never *under* reports growth. Why do inflated assets matter? Because they lead to unrealizable capital gains on the balance sheet that gets counted in GDP, potentially producing reporting inaccuracies. I agree with you that infrastructure projects drive a lot of China's growth, but again, the other drivers notwithstanding, there is a material difference between 6.5% and 6.9%.
