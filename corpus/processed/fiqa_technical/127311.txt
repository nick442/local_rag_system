The overall % decrease in imports won't be enormous but that ignores the nature of food as a tradeable good. Food behaves as a fungible good in the short term (1-2 years). There is a minimum time needed for maturation of crops and livestock. There's also very little slack in the supply chain, adding significant ramp-up/construction time. Russia's partners can't just snap their fingers and produce 10-20% more food, they'll likely export a larger amount of their domestic production and make up the gap with the excess supply from the EU and US markets. If Putin can keep things together through this interim period of scarcity and inflation then he'll be fine but it won't be smooth sailing.
