Eh. It's what Walmart will do. The real question is, will they do it quietly or make a splash about it? Because the last thing anyone wants is Walmart butting heads with its employees in an election year, but those crazy bastards running the show in Bentonville aren't above being confrontational when everyone thinks/believes/prays they'll just back down and wait for a saner time to drop rocks on people's heads. That's what the source of entertainment is going to be here; how will Walmart handle this and will the politicians stick their noses in it too? And is this a union-organised thing or an informal affiliation of employees that covertly agreed to do this? Also, will it spread? That's about the sum-total of stuff we have to think about, since they don't actually change any unemployment numbers around by firing experienced employees and hiring people they have to train up and deploy again. Hell, they do it so often it probably doesn't really cost them any extra either.
