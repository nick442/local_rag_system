10-15% of the bat you want to keep liquid in a savings account with interest at 1.5% that best at the moment. In case of a real emergency. Look in to dividend stocks they can bring in 10-15% on your investment and fairly liquid as well. There's also rental properties but 40k isn't much room to move around with in that area.
