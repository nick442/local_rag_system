If you get an INR 1000 discount for paying up front versus paying over six months, you can consider that INR 1000 interest. Your annualized rate comes out to about 14.76%. If you can earn better than 14.76% on that money by using it elsewhere in the mean time, then you should pay over six months. If not, you should pay the whole price up front. You may also elect to pay the interest if you do not have the full amount now, but the use of the phone for the next six months will earn you more than the INR 1000 premium that you pay to defer the full purchase price.
