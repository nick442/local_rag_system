No I am a technology consultant. I have a serious beef with Facebook. It's a closed system, meaning you have to sign up for an account to view content on it, and every time a business uses Facebook what they're really doing is advertising facebook for free. Which is not how it should be done. I always tell people that social media should be used to funnel visitors to their business and not the other way around.
