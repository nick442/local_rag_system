"The dot.com companies were purveyors of the Internet, then a ""new"" technology around 2000. Everyone ""knows"" that such a new technology will change the economy and society. What people didn't know at the time was WHICH companies would be the leaders/beneficiaries of such change. So investors pushed up the stock prices of ALMOST ALL companies in the ""space."" Any ONE (or two or three) companies can benefit from such a new technology. But not ALL of them can: It's something called the ""fallacy of composition."" That is, there can be one or two Googles (or Microsoft of a previous era), but not 100 of them. Most of the other 98 will go bust. Those were victims of the bubble that affected all, including the successful ones. It's a bit like the California gold rush. Maybe one of 10 miners got ""rich"" (or at least moderately wealthy). The other 90% died heartbroken, trying."
