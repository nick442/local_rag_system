"People borrow money all the time to buy a house. Banks will lend money on one (up to 80%, sometimes more), because they consider it an ""investment."" If you own a large company and want to expand, a bank or bond issuer will first look at what you plan to do with the money, like build new factories, or whatever. Based on their experience, they may judge that you will earn enough money to pay them back. If you don't, they may ""repossess"" your factories and sell them to someone who can pay. As protection, you may be asked to ""mortgage"" your existing company to protect the lenders of the new money. If you don't pay back the money, the lenders get not only your new ""factories"" but also your existing company."
