Mines 3 years old, aside from 1 memory hungry game where it still mostly plays well but sometimes stutters on, it's all a-okay. Updates and all. Probably will keep it 1 more year as a game isn't worth upgrading a phone over. Might switch if the competition is good, I do hate lightning jack with a passion though.
