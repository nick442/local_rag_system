I'm not sure it's even that - I'm upper middle class where I live, and I've never heard of those terms he mentioned. It sounds like a vaguely Italian / Spanish fusion with French bread? It could have been sticker shock, but it could be that she just balked at ordering a sandwich that might have unpalatable ingredients in it, like liver pate. It'd be like ordering randomly off a Chinese menu and getting served a live octopus. As example, I know plenty of people who don't know what chorizo is, but order it at Chipotle's - and who wouldn't order it if they knew what was in it. (I know what it is and rather enjoy it, but that's my tastes.) I find the idea that a restaurant would use pretentious language as a sort of.. signaling device for class structure.. the idea that 'you can only eat here if you can understand our language' to be bizarre. And a little bit offensive. A restaurant like that would get laughed out of business where I live. It makes me wonder, is this kind of restaurant normal in other parts of the country?
