"Your graph does no such thing. 1. They're displaying percentages of income spent, so even with the minor decreases in percentage of money spent they're still spending more than low income families. 2. The percentage ""saved for retirement"" increases in higher income percentiles. How exactly does that occur? Do they send their money to magic fairy land where it's tended by nymphs who return a percentage return? No, it's invested in stocks, bonds, ownerships of businesses, venture capital and other forms of INVESTMENT which means that wealth is not sitting in a mattress, it's being used by others to generate more wealth."
