Very appropriate use of the quotations. this isn't a solution. this is akin to a doctor to negligent to do their job to save a patient and putting them on life support hoping to keep them going as long as possible to hide their incompetence before the shit hits the fan. Only a fool would think they could keep the patient alive forever.
