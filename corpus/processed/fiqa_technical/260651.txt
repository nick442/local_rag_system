I am not a tax accountant and the caveats about taking tax advice from random people on the internet stand. I have, however, had partial payment as in specie benefit in the past so have a good idea of how this is taxed. The chickens are taxed as in specie benefits (supposing you classify the chickens as beneficial) at the same rate as any other payment. That the chickens died soon after has no effect unless it was for a reason that meant that their value was lower at the time that you received them than was accounted for for tax reasons. If their value at that time was less than reported you can write down the value and receive a tax rebate for the amount of tax on that write down.
