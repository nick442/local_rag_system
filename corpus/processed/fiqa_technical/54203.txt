Based on experience with friends that lost some money to one of these recently despite being warned: My friends joined some venture where they were getting 'paid' into an account and thought they were making lots of money. They signed their friends and family up (each with a hefty sign up fee) thinking it was a sure thing. Turns out the company was under investigation and the accounts were frozen. The money they put in was lost as well as these so called 'earnings'. All of a sudden people realized they had never actually seen an actual physical penny the whole time.
