Well no because the auto dealers aren't on the hook are they, they've offloaded the loans onto some investment vehicle somewhere out in the ether. Let's be clear this all nets a massive loss. The car has already depreciated by 50% of the retail value, plus you have the costs of recovery and the margin of the guy who's going to re-sell it. And what did you gain? You squeezed a fraction of the price of the car out of the lender who was making minimum repayments before he defaulted. The upshot is that *someone* just bought a lot of cars that are now worth less than what they paid for them. Who's going to take the hit, Wells and Fargo?
