Well it depends what you are trying to do. You first job, almost by definition, will be entry level. Your coding is particularly valuable. The basics probability distributions should take you like a day or two tops with your background. So, no, I don't think some sort of job in risk management or a small role in a quantitative finance group (likely just coding) it out of the question. Only one way to find out. And you'll pick up the rest from there. Edit: Just read you have a graduate degree in Physics/Math/Engineering. Of course you could get a job with your skill set. Likely a good one. One of the upsides to finance is they like to hire smart people and are okay with them developing skill sets as they go.
