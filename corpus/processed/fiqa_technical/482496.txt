The flooding of uneducated unskilled migrants into this country hurts the African American community the most. It also makes it harder for the poor in general to compete in a jobs market where illegals will work for half the minimum wage as opposed to hiring legal Americans. Abolish the minimum wage and place more restrictions on who can enter the country and we will start seeing gradual growth in the middle class and shrinkage of poverty.
