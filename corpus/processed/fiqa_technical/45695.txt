Amazon makes enormous profits, they just re-invest nearly all of it. Their 2016 operating income was $20B (assume they spent $0 on R&D), but they did spend $16B on R&D. Which is more than what Apple spends. Facebook is more valuable than Cisco for many reasons. First off, similar net incomes on their statements doesn't mean those net incomes are as safe in the future. Facebook might have a very safe revenue stream from ads regardless if they keep updating their interfaces. Perhaps Facebook's market saturation means they don't need much infrastructure expansion in the future which would project reduced costs and higher margins. Cisco on the other hand might perpetually be in a more dangerous spot given their market position. They have competition and they might have to be in a constant battle to stay caught up. Their margins are also much less than Facebook's. Perhaps Cisco's profits are also more at risk due to changes in public policy while Facebook is more insulted? Valuation on the market goes far beyond just the profit # on the last income statement.
