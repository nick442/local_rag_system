if I want to go to downtown paris it's faster to take then high speed train from amsterdam for me, or drive down. Is it worth it, up to you. There's a lot of culture there, history, nice touristy things, you can say you've been there.. On the other hand it's also a busy and somewhat dirty city. Been there twice, once on a company staff weekend and once with friends going to an exhibition we wanted to see at the louvre, and went to see the city for a couple of days. Fun to have been there, but not in my top-5 favorite cities list. If you can work it in sure, go and see it. Do some touristy stuff if you have the time, or just tour the city a bit, maybe have a wine and dinner by the Seine river, see the louvre or the opera, whatever. Would it make a fun weekend? Sure. Would I make it the centerpiece of my holiday, probably not.
