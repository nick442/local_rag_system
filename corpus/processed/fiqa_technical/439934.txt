No. Firstly I think that free market economic theories of healthcare are ungrounded because there is no such thing as consumer who can make properly informed customer. And secondly, an economist can never understand the risks associated with healthcare because they will never have a patient die as a result of their decision making. Being an economist is a trivial job when compared to being a doctor. Losing money is not remotely the same as inadvertently causing a patient's death. So they will never really understand the forces that motivate the healthcare economy.
