Most of the stuff that is making them money and putting them in the spotlight were started before Satya took the CEO chair. Azure, O365 and VSO all started under Balmer and are probably the best things going for them right now but again they are not market leaders in those spaces (maybe O365 but that is forced conversion). Their OS and licensing schemes are just awful. They will not be a relevant player if they keep performing so poorly with these.
