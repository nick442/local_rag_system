>What does Trump has to do with OBAMA(!!)care? Constantly ranting on twitter destabilized the individual insurance market. Trump is a shit negotiator, he can't get anything done other than signing useless executive actions. Insurance industry doesn't want to take any chance so they take cut their losses and leave. Don't worry, Trump is creating a lot of jobs in criminal defense legal service. Make Attorneys Get Attorneys!
