I'm going to throw this in. You seem to want to graduate in 4 years but this would be a insane combo. CS/Math/Accounting/Finance quad major. Probably take 6 years but the first 2 and latter 2 overlap. You would have awesome skills and a good paying job for the rest of your life. I don't like really hard math or programming so I'm sticking with going for an Economics degree with minors in finance and history.
