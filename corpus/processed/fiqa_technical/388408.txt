Million dollar taxi medallions are why I'm glad the whole industry is going bankrupt. They lobbied to keep the supply artificially low, increased barriers to entry, enjoyed their crony capitalist monopoly, accordingly treated customers like shit, and now they're all going kaput off their greed. No loss whatsoever.
