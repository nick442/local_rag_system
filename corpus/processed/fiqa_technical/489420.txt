>Correct. So you feel the proper response is to pepperspray people? Perhaps you can watch the long version of what happened in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhPdH3wE0_Y&feature=colike). Feel free to skip around if you want. The point is, the police made arrests, the children were blocking them and the children were warned. They were warned so many times it's their own stupidity that got them pepper sprayed. Empty threats are empty. Beats a night stick to the head. I am worried about the bloodbath that might occur when we have to fight off the black bloc idiots that want more free stuff. >what prevents a race to the bottom with wages and benefits if people don't collectively bargain What prevents public sector employees from outpacing wages and benefits of the private sector due to collective coercion? They're already doing it. We cannot pay our debts by creating government jobs. We cannot continue to afford COLAs in a down economy, let alone the lifetime benefits some of them get. What happens when they collapse the system out of their own stupid greed? That seems to be the goal of many on the left. edit: Not sure if OSHA is actually getting cuts, but EEOC is expanding and NLRB is really screwing things up.
