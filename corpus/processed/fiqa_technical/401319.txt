I've been threatened numerous times for pushing to pay with a card rather than cash by taxis. This was before Uber blew up. It was clear they wanted to skim from their company. I've literally had to jump out a car and run because of 5 minute arguments to take a card. The card machines each time looked to function and the sticker on the window says it's accepted. Fuck them wrong way driving, wannabe Nascar, pedophile taxi cab drivers.
