I didn't mean as a legal maximum, but rather how many hours they choose to work & get scheduled for. Some youth are lucky, and their parents pay their bills. I didn't have as expensive bills as you. Only cell phone, and my bus pass in high school. But I did have to pay for all of my graduation costs myself and post-secondary application fees. So keeping a savings amount really helps. (I also had 4 jobs simultaneously in high school. )
