">Large multinationals are necessarily divided into semi-autonomous operating units. This was a local ad for a small market. ""Burger King"" as some monolithic corporate person likely knew next to nothing about this campaign until after it was published. Not a great excuse. I've worked in a local unit of a larger corporation. Although it was a different field entirely, I know something about how autonomy works - or ought to. You should know enough to know *when* you need to contact other people higher up the chain for an OK or clarification, and running a sexual campaign for a family restaurant it clearly one of those times. You're potentially toying with the image of the entire brand, and if you don't know to get an OK for that, you do not deserve your job. >You can get in an argument about whether innuendo is representation, i.e., whether all this ad represents is someone about to eat a sandwich. That's why I said she had a case, and not ""They would clearly be found in the wrong if she brought a case forward."" (Although I think the vast majority of people would agree there is significant sexual innuendo here.)"
