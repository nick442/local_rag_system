"The uncertainty as I see it is around **personal** income tax rates and the **employee** portion of the SS tax. This has nothing to do with the operating costs of large businesses, right? Small businesses often have their taxes done essentially on the owner's personal return, so in those cases the personal income tax rate affects them. This article talks about large businesses who are fussing about the ""uncertainty"". Why is this uncertainty about things like taxes treated like something new? Historically tax rates have bounced around, and in the past taxes have been higher. The SS tax cut is a very recent thing, but now that's it in place suddenly people can't imagine hiring if it goes back to what it was for many years. Also, the SS tax cut is on the employee portion, so even if it goes back the employer contribution doesn't change? WTF are they talking about? This sounds more like silly people being confused by partisan talking points."
