"You should NEVER have to pay a fee to find out what has happened to a transaction in progress. You might sometimes have to pay for duplicate copies of a statement or similar, but not just to find out what is going on. It sounds like you are being scammed - your ""friend"" tells you they have transferred you money (but they have not done anything in reality), then they give you a ""customer care number"" to call and try to get you to pay them money in order to find out what has happened to the (non-existent) transaction. If you think this is plausibly what is happening - for example, if you google the company who is supposedly doing the transfer and find that they do not exist, or that the number you have been given is not really their customer care line - then you should cease all contact with your ""friend"" and pass all communications to your local law enforcement."
