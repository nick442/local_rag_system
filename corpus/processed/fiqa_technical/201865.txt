"It's a good counter point, albeit a bit simplified. I have a couple of objections to the inflamatory way you phrased that: Do you believe in equal first amendment rights of public utilities? Because they **can't** deny access (IANAL, of course). That's not a rhetorical question, it's to try to put your comment in context so that I understand what you mean. To me corporations are not people, so your phrasing is needlessly extreme. (citizens united went too far) I would not ""take away PayPal's first amendment rights"" in those words, no. They can give any statement they want. Is ""deny service"" protected speech? Not for everyone and everything (e.g. public utilities). Would you protect a private hospital's right to let someone die based on their political views, or attractiveness? If we are going purely by first amendment, and define ""right to inaction by companies"" as speech (which surely you can't mean. Surely there's a line?), then there are so many ways that's legalised out right murder. What about WikiLeaks first amendment right to participate in political discourse? ""Sure, but they de facto can't use money""?"
