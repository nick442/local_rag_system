">Dick's warned analysts and investors about an ""irrational"" pricing environment in the sporting goods space. False, it's perfectly rational. When given a choice between a retail store like Dick's, which cannot dynamically change their costs or their prices very quickly, and Amazon, which can, people are choosing Amazon since that's the better option for consumers. The pricing environment is rational too, they just can't compete."
