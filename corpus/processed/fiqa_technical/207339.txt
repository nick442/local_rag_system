Yep. One good thing about Airbnb's though is the flexible check in times. In fact, the last time I did an Airbnb now that I think about it was in Bogotoa Colombia. My plane arrived at like 6am and the airbnb host was willing to let me in at 8:30, which of course a hotel would never do (or at least not without a fee, assuming they even have an empty room).
