"as a used dealer in subprime sales, finance has to be higher than cash because every finance deal has a lender that takes a percentage ""discount"" on every deal financed. if you notice a dealer is hesitant to give a price before knowing if cash or finance, because every bit of a cash deal's profit will be taken by a finance company in order to finance the deal and then there's no deal. you might be approved but if you're not willing to pay more for a finance deal, the deal isn't happening if I have $5000 in a car, you want to buy it for $6000 and the finance lender wants to take $1200 as a ""buy-fee"" leaving me $4800 in the end."
