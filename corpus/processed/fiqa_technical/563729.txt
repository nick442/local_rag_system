Oh my, i remember going through the Series 66.. when i was at Morgan Stanley they provided learning material from Securities Training Corporation, or STC. I personally thought the STC material was okay in terms of preparing me for the Series 66..However, i heard a lot of good reviews/feedback around the office for Pass Perfect. https://www.passperfect.com/Series/66/Product/38 Hope this helps and good luck on the 66!! ;)
