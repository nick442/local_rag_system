I'm sad those programs excist, because 10-20 years ago when I used to fly, there would *always* be a chance for anyone to be randomly upgraded to First Class when you are at the gate. They would always fill any leftover premium seats with people from Economy that were chosen at random. No matter what airline or where you were flying, you had a decent chance at being selected every so often. Now they just give all their free upgrades to people who are in their elite preferred member clubs and regular everyday folk never get them. I mean, I can obviously see the buisiness sense in this plan and I can't blame the logic of it, but it's just kinda sad. People who are in those Executive Premium clubs *already* get to experiance First Class through their buisiness trips or through frequent flier upgrades. Meanwhile all the plebs who only fly once a year after saving up to take their family on vacation never get to indulge in First Class. They only had the chance before through the random upgrades, but those aren't a thing anymore since the buisness frequent fliers with the Executive Clubs are hogging all the upgrades : (
