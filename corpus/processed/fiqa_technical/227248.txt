Man who are these retarded inventors and how can I get them to fund my site that makes no money? Seriously how many millions has Reddit raised over the years, I thought the point of investing was to make a return, but apparently reddit is so successful they can't make money themselves and need investors every other month. And they're for sure going to make their money back?
