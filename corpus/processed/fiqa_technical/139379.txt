>I want a guy who has spent 20 years in such a blue-collar job to be able to earn as much as a computer programmer who only graduated a couple of years ago. So you want low skill jobs to pay more than high skill jobs based solely on seniority. Do some research into the Italian or Spanish economy. That's pretty much what you advocate. It's a terrible idea that would probably destroy the US economy.
