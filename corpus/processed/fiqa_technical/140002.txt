See an advisor but with a healthy level of skepticism. Question why they make the recommendations they do. If you have debt, no the interest rate. If CAGR > interest, invest instead of immediately paying off debt. In reality, invest the most you can. You're young and try to live your life like you would've without the inheritance. The longer you let that money grow in an investment untouched (and honestly that amount of money is a huge gift/surprise at your age) the more you'll thank yourself in the end. Max out a Roth IRA - your advisor can explain that to you. Also, you can afford to invest super aggressively since you're so young. You could also find a variable life insurance contract to act like a Roth and grow a death benefit to continue leaving a legacy in your family line. Sorry for the advisory vomit. I'm sorry for the loss that led to this inheritance, but that's a great opportunity and there are a ton of options and none of them are wrong. Best of luck!
