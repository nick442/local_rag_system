"Yeah, this isn't much better than the decline of retail drivel, arguably it's a more repeated storyline that completely misses the roots. Failing to ""innovate"" with ""high touch"" tactics didn't kill Toys R Us. That's irrelevant. They had a culture going back years that wasn't customer-first driven, they wanted to completely own the toy market and made several terrible decisions when they didn't get their way. They partnered with Amazon to be their exclusive toy supplier, ToysRUs becomes the world's largest toy site, all good. Then, Amazon true to its mission allowed any toy supplier to sell on Amazon Marketplace. Instead of embracing collaboration, Toys R Us threw a hissy fit. They wouldn't accept Amazon's generous to make any new products that they launched still exclusive, not allowing anyone else to offer it. Toys R Us sales are going up during this time, mind you because of larger selection brings more customers and everyone benefits. Toys R Us' executives continue to whine and throw a suit. After 5 years, Amazon just settles and gives them a pay-off. Toys R Us raises funding and goes their own way with their own site. But obviously in a competitive space as retail where customer first matters, Toys R Us' decision to destroy their Amazon partnership killed Toys R Us."
