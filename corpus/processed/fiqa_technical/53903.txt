That article disproves itself: >An entrepreneur can have the most brilliant idea in the world and plenty of funding to develop and sell it, but if customers can't afford to buy the company's products, the entrepreneur and his or her investors won't create a single permanent job. They are forgetting that it's the ENTREPRENEUR's job to make a product that fits ALL the criteria (including being affordable), not just some. DUH. So Steve Jobs DID create jobs (albeit a lot of Chinese jobs). Anyone who believes that the iphone didn't create jobs and an entire new market has a hole in their head. And that's coming from a guy who absolutely cannot stand iPhone, Apple, and Steve Jobs.
