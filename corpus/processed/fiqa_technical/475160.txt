In November '14, I wrote TurboTax 2014 Marketing Mistake Shortly after writing it, a TurboTax agent wrote (on Amazon) to counter the complaints by saying that Deluxe has these forms but did not offer Interview help for them. As Ben notes in his comment on LittleAdv's answer. TurboTax issued an apology letter, which, in my opinion, didn't really set things straight, factually. The forms are there, the interview and data import for stock transactions is gone.
