">Much of the evidence in support of a skills gap could be explained by employers who are no longer willing to train their employees or raise salaries, and instead want to be able to hire people with exactly the right skillsâ€“and on the cheap. I saw this play out at my previous job. Literally no one got COLA raises, executive management got 10's of thousands of dollars in retention bonuses each year. They would only hire staff that fit the exact roles they were looking for, for the least amount of money through temp agencies.. then bitch about the workers behind their backs because they weren't miracle workers doing 200% of what was asked of them. It created a very negative environment that got downright perverse when my boss would claim we're a ""family""."
