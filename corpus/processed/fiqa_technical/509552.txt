You make some very valid points. However, does the state spend the money because they are incompetent; or, because that is how the state is structured to be? If the latter; then, by whom? Why do you think we start wars that a five year old could even understand is a sham? Why do we have overcrowded prisons? Follow the money.. Remember, the rich stay rich not because of their morals, ethics, or good behavior.
