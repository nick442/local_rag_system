There are cases in which some Lease agreements will allow you to exit them without charge, but you cannot simply vacate a location without paying. Cases that would allow you to leave the lease, if they are stated within the lease, are usually for reasons like: If you can prove that you have a job that is over a certain distance from the place you are currently residing in, there may be a clause that would allow you to break you lease, or simply the landlord may be more willing to allow you to go. If situations have changed, and conditions are now such that you cannot safely live in the place, you may be able to break the lease. If you have a copy of your lease, look for these clauses or others near the end, that's where they appear in mine. There are also other situations where if you give sufficient notice, and have been a long time tenant, breaking a lease may be only a small fee, certainly worth looking into rather than facing any legal recourse.
