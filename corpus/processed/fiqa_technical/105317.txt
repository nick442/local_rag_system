"So it's added somewhere between $2.4-and-$5.2 trillion, according to the article. Also according to the article, Trump got the figure from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. He didn't make it up. [The article with the Wilbur Ross quote](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/19/wilbur-ross-trump-has-driven-the-stock-market-to-4-trillion-in-gains.html) has these stats: Since the election, the Dow Jones industrial average has surged more than 16 percent, the S&P 500 has gained more than 13 percent, and the Nasdaq composite has risen 18 percent as of Friday's close. So this is kind of a non-story with a disingenuously hard-hitting title. A beautiful stucco home of an article, if you will. edit: I know this is an economics forum and I understand we don't want to get political, but let me just say: I am very far left. Extremely, incredibly far left. But I despise so-called ""news"" outlets and ""economics"" rags pushing such blatant bullshit. I feel that this sort of garbage fuels and even somewhat justifies all of the ""fake news"" accusations. These idiot economics bloggers are doing no favor to the left by engaging in anti-scientific demagoguery."
