"Kinda related, but when I first started going to Best Buy in the late 90's/early 2000's they were the first company I experienced ""receipt checkers"". I know it's pretty common now in electronic stores, but I remember clearly that Best Buy was the first company that made me feel like a criminal after purchasing their goods. I've never forgotten that."
