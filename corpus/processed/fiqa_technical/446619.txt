Crazy as it is, I've always thought Poland Spring was by far the best-tasting bottled water compared to Deer Park (also Nestl√©, I believe, so it's weird that there's a difference in taste), Dasani, Aquafina, and the rest. I'm pretty confident that I could tell Poland Spring apart from those in a blind taste test.
