Right now I'm listening to a record on a Sony turntable that was made in the late 1970s. The beauty of this turntable and the sound it produces is stunning. Its drive system was at the height of technology at the time and in my opinion was never surpassed. The base is made of a custom-designed sound-deadening material. Vertical tracking angle and anti-skate can be adjusted while a record plays. This is a feature that even some very expensive tonearms do not include. If you flip the mat over, you'll find a very easy to use cartridge alignment protractor--an absolutely necessary accessory that nobody else included for free. Sony doesn't execute quality design like this anymore. I got it for next to nothing because Sony has made such a joke of their name that most people assume it's a piece of garbage. Keep it up, guys--these deals are amazing.
