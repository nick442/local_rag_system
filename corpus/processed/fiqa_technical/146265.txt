Firstly, it should be noted that the period of the investment is all of the years 2007 to 2017 inclusive. This totals (temporarily removing one shoe and sock to extend counting range) 11 years! Not the 9 of the OP and the accepted answer.. Secondly, there are various definitions of average rate of return. One would be : What constant annual rate of return, compounded annually, will yield the same result as the given investment? Unfortunately, this results in an equation that cannot be solved by ordinary algebraic methods. If r is the desired annual rate, then the equation is: (1+r)^11 * 10000 = 14567 Using logarithms: log(1 + r) = log(1.4567)/11 r = 3.4789%
