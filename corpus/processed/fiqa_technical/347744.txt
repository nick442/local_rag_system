Well where is government supposed to get the food from? Either they force the farmers to work for free, or they force other people to work for free so they can use the money to pay the farmer. Should people have no responsibility? Just have as many children as you like and we'll force others to work for free so they can have all the food they require? That will certainly give more votes in a democracy to those who have as many children without worrying about how to feed them. I'm not sure if that's the type of society I would freely choose to live in.
