">""Those measures all reflect a new way of measuring VaR though, one that switches the model from a four-year look to just one year, removing the rocky years of 2008 and 2009 from the current measure"" VAR is a measure of how much money can be lost in a given time period within certain constraints. For most banks it is the maximum that can be lost within day in a 99% confidence interval. So in layman terms on average only 1 in 100 days will more money be lost than the VAR. VAR is calculated using historical data. It uses the historical data to build up a profile of scenarios and probability of occurrence. Armed with the knowledge of how much is lost in each of these scenarios and the probability of it occurring a VAR can be estimated. MS have essentially stopped including the last 4 years since they are far more volatile and are only including the last year since it has been relatively calm. It is essentially cheating. It is choosing the data to fit your needs and is statistical heresy."
