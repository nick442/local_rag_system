>when he's already admitted that he has all the money he'll ever need Sounds like he should sell or close the company. >and what he's doing now is fear mongering his own employees so that he doesn't have to pay slightly higher taxes See I can already shoot down your explanation, because it's not just higher taxes, its increased business tax liability, increased business insurance liability. All of which deincentivize not incentivize. If you started out making 80% of a billion dollar gross profit, then 70% , then 60%, then 50%, then 40% and with proposed changes to liability you're now looking at 30% of a billion. How long would you continue? The guy is 70+ years. He probably continues because it is his passion. But at what point is the stress and return on his time and input not worth it? That's the topic. Not greed. Is it greedy that whether he made 80% or even only 10% of a billion? You may say yes, but as a decision maker he must constantly weigh whether or not it is worth it. >He didn't get successful in a vacuum, he got successful in a system which helped fund his success because 42 years ago the people who were where he is today were taxed more so he could get where he is today. But his opinions aren't what I'm mad about, I'm mad because he is greedy and a bully and a liar and a hypocrite of almost incomprehensible proportions. Obama said he didnt build it, but he'll damn well close or sell the company if he wants. Rhetoric is cute until thousands of employees are out of jobs because the owner didn't feel it was worth it to continue the business.
