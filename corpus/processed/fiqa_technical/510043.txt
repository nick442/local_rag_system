If the work is unnecessary, the jobs were made obsolete. The only thing that's changed is we're paying less to create the same product. The worker's former compensation doesn't disappear into the ether, it's re-allocated to the new players (electric company, robotics manufacturer, mechanic, etc.); a person being fired is only half the story. Blaming Amazon for becoming more efficient by being an early adopter of new technology and business practices seems like misplaced aggression
