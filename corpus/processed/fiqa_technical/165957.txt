It's about time that we start antitrust against a number of massive corps. Enough is enough. A mere mention by Amazon that they might be going into a new industry decimates the stocks of all companies in that industry. It's not that Amazon has a secret sauce other than firing all employees and driving them to welfare but their sheer size. It brings back memories of the robber barons, the massive oil conglomerates and AT&T that were broken up to the benefit of society.
