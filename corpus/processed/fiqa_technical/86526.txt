i haven't done the precise math to update with the latest call, so you might be right about that. I will do it some week next time. As to the other questions: 1. Every major car company is doing research. There is going to be massive competition. 2. Your last sentence confirms my view that you don't understand the issues. In the real world there is specialization. Some companies design cars, others design batteries. So of course the car companies don't have the good battery tech, because they are not battery companies. The rest of the industry isn't stupid. Battery companies don't try to make cars, and car companies don't make batteries. Musk has jumped into an industry he is not a specialist at. It just so happens I know something about batteries. The simple fact that Musk is talking about Lithium Ion batteries proves that his tech is no good. the ACTUAL BATTERY COMPANIES declined to spend massive capital for a plant to supply TSLA cars. That is why he has to make his own. Committing huge amounts of capital on old technology is a frightful idea. THE ACTUAL BATTERY COMPANIES wouldn't do it. But you think Musk knows more about batteries than the actual battery companies.
