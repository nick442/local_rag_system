"To anyone else with this mindset: -Remember that your recruiters and potential employers don't care about the health of the national job market. They care about their own company. They want to maximize EmployeeValue/EmployeeCost. They know what they want and what they can afford. So of course they are going to fish for a lunker. Why wouldn't they? -Every damn thing is negotiable. Don't like that starting salary offer? Counter it. Know direct competitor starting salaries. -""I don't have direct experience with X, but I do have experience with Y"". Use this. Since I ruffled a few feathers here I'd be happy to look at any entry-level SW engineering resumes for feedback. PM me."
