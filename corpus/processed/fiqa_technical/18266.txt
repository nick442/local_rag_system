> We were talking about net taxation, not some ratio of gross income on a per family basis. I was rebutting your claim that the top 1% pay 50% of all taxes. > The bottom 40% of American are net beneficiaries of taxes anyway. I disagree. Welfare programs in the US total a little over $200B, just above 5% of the federal budget. Meanwhile military spending is about 25% if you count the VA. Military spending is much more valuable to the rich since they can earn the contracts and have much more to defend.
