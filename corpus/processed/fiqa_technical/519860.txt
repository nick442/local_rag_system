It is not legal to receive large amounts of money that you cannot explain. If you receive more than 10,000â‚¬ (or even with smaller amounts regularly) there may be an investigation for money laundering or other tax evasion schemes. If you have a reasonable explanation backed with records of where the money came from, there shouldn't be any problem to explain the money and pay taxes appropriately, but in the case of an anonymous gift, there is no reason for authorities to believe that it was a gift. Your best option if you do receive such an anonymous gift is to report it and allow authorities to investigate its source.
