"Not going to happen anytime soon. These old fatties won't go down without a bitter fight that will make us really hate them for a while longer. New media (e.g. Netflix, youtube, Hulu..) still requires an internet connection. As it stands, the avenue to get connected to these services still goes through cable companies (e.g. Time Warner, Comcast, Cox..) or through telecom companies (e.g. ATT and Verizon). The first step these antiquated orgs. will pull is putting caps on our internet usage. This will take the floor right from under online video services, which have worked off an ""all you can eat"" broadband model. Right now caps are at something like 100-250GB, which seems like a lot. But imagine you replace your entire cable consumption with online consumption. Plus add in any other internet activity like games and downloads, 250GB may be a bit closer than you think. Moreover, ISPs are moving to lower the caps on internet usage, probably around 50GB, which limits us even further on online media consumption. So because they *cannot* compete with these services, they aim to stop us entirely from using them. Bully tactics, not good business through adaption and innovation. They think by doing this, they will drive consumers back to their traditional services. Time will tell if the masses will play into their hand or actually shape demand for a non-restrictive, non-cable sourced ISP. Should such a service arise, cable companies are pretty much dead in the next 5-10 years. As it stands, we still require cable companies to deliver our content. The battle between Old Media and New Media will be hard fought and we, the consumers, stand to get the brunt of this battle for a while longer."
