While this is a totally personal decision, I still think it would be a good idea to have some life insurance simply because you have someone that is currently dependent on your income. Yes you have about 22 years in retirement, but if you consider taxes and market risk, there's still some uncertainty there. Also, while your wife may be willing and able to work now, will she want to do that for years just to earn living expenses? I would look at the costs on 10-year term life insurance and see if it's worth the extra peace of mind to you and your wife. If your wife is fine with using your retirement as life insurance, then you can probably be OK without it. So to answer the question, it may be acceptable, but it's generally a very cheap way to get a lot of peace. I would not worry too much about the opinions of your parents - unless they are going to pay for the insurance, it's your decision.
