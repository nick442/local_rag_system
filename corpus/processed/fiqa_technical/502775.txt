If you look at academia as a business where you are the customer it makes sense that universities want to enroll as many people as possible. They know they'll get paid regardless since debts are guaranteed. From the students perspective, buyer beware would certainly seem to apply. A Ferrari worth of student loans for a degree that doesn't have a high probability of profitability leads to poor economic outcomes. This is true for all students. Debt will continue to climb until an equilibrium is met. The rules guaranteeing loans may have to change as well. There seem to be many perverse incentives to the current structure with anomalies such as having significantly more administrators than professors and a rapidly climbing total cost of degree.
