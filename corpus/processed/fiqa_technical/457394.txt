"As you may know, the interstate system could have been easily built where every car/truck is charged to use it. What about the space program? Absolutely no income from this and absolutely no benefit on earth.. except additional jobs.. As for giving tax break to corporations, this is not the case! This is a case of investment so a corporation will employ people in the USA instead of another country. As for not ""living up to promises"": if a contract is written, and they don't live up to promises, then you know what will happen next."
