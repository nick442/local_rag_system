You mention you have an LDD. If your income is below a certain threshold (as of today, 19 255 € a year for a single person; quite likely if you're just a student), then you can open a Livret d'épargne populaire (in short, LEP). It works almost exactly the same as a Livret A / LDD, except that: Just like a Livret A / LDD: You should fill it up first before putting money in your LDD (assuming your Livret Jeune is maxed out, they have typically a higher rate than the LEP). If your bank is anything like mine, the very existence of the LEP is not very well-advertised, and I found that not many people are even aware that they exist. PS: The French administration's website has a whole section dedicated to financial matters. It's usually very clear and detailed. I advise you to check it out.
