"I have all of those. My lawyer is reviewing the engagement letters with the capital advisors, and has spun up the CPA/tax lawyer. We are engaging the right people at the right times. However, I'm curious to see what a loan proposal looks like at the $100 million level. I'm not looking for Redditors to represent me with the banks, I'm looking to see if anyone on Reddit happens to have a copy of (or know where to find one) a loan proposal from a large corporation for a similar amount of money. For example, when we sold a division of the company, I evaluated the pitch decks that our consultants made against the pitch decks made/released by tech firms. While the metrics are all largely different, it was a useful exercise to be able to see if we were at least in the ""ballpark"" of a deck that was considered successful."
