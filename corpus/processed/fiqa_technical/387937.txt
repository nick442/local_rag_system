">Opportunities are not equal But the OP and most of the ""it's all about luck"" folks here *are* saying opportunities are equal - if it's only about luck, then *anyone* can find that lucky penny. Remember - that's the assertion here - that there are tons of people who could be billionaires; the ones who are only got there because *they* were the ones that someone whispered ""plastics"" to at a party. Total egalitarianism; no meritocracy or plutocracy whatsoever. It's all about the spin of the wheel, man. Anyone can win the lottery."
