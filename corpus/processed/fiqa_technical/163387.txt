The weird about counting stocks as a form of wealth for their trading value is that he literally can't use that money without losing his company and his source of wealth. That and Bill Gates transfer of wealth from his publicly owned company into his own privately held entity means there's no way to see how rich Bill G is anymore. He could be making massive amounts of money from that NPO and the only people who would know is the government.
