I'm old. When I was young, the schools were preparing us all for the Metric System. But the change never happened, due, I believe, to simple arrogance. Let the world cope with out 45/17th nuts and bolts. Now of course, we're not so powerful and I do assume that American Toyota factories use metric parts. I write this from a metric coffee house in Amsterdam. I am coping quite well with their products offered metrically. Have a good day!
