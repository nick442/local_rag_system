Well, you still have to pay to ship & store paper, ink, binding materials, and book-binding printers & parts. If only there was some kind of electronic “infinite page” device that would offer truly zero marginal distribution cost. Maybe they could give it a snazzy name like *Kimble* or something. :P Of course I’m kidding, if someone wants a printed book that’s what they want.
