Sorry, but that's a load of sh*t. The economy tanked in March of 2000 when the tech bubble burst. Projecting the insane bubble economy outwards showed the debt could be paid off, but it was already over when Bush came into office. (Tax receipts are backwards looking, the stock market is forward looking. The world knew in early 2000 that the party was over.)
