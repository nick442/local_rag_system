"Came here for this, sort of. Punters were great, but after the punter era, there was a feature called ""warn"". Each user had a warning percentage. As your warning level increased, you were increasingly rate limited. If you received a message from someone, and warned them, IIRC their warning level would rise by 10%, and you could warn at 10% up to 3 times (presuming you got at least 3 messages from that user). Thing was, even if the target never sent you a message, you could warn a user. I guess if their profile offended you, was the use, and it would still raise your warning level by 5%. So at that time all you needed was 20 user names and you could effectively sign any other user offline by rate limiting them to oblivion. I was going to say rate limiting them to AOHell, but that would have been confusing, because AOHell was a punter!"
