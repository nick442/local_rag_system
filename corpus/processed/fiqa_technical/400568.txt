And it all depends what you are advertising. We target business owners and startups. I have yet to see a millennial as a client of ours. Our CFO also pointed out some research found on LinkedIn pitying millenials unable to afford housing. Their age and choice living with parents is much larger by contrast, compared with previous generations. Many millenials wont pay rent, not because they can't, but they blow that money elsewhere for example on entertainment, electronic, or food they like as opposed to cooking, etc. so of course they can't. They learn their financial advice from each other. In some cases their word of mouth interaction with each other is depriving them more than the boomer paranoia spread has deprived baby boomers from taking certain risks.
