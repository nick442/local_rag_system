Just wanted to chip in on the card reader thing. If they threaten to call the cops, call their bluff; worst case you'll spend the time waiting for a copy to show up that would've been wasted driving around looking for an ATM. Also, make sure you call the company after the fact and let them know about it (as well as identifying details about when and what cab # you were in) -- some companies don't care but the ones I've had to call about generally take that seriously (i.e. management calling me back later to get as much identifying info as possible to find the drivers responsible).
