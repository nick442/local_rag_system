That's because Priuses don't let the battery charge fall outside of a contained range of roughly 40-80%. Degradation is reduced to almost nothing if you keep Li-ions in a partial charge state, too high or too low and you damage the battery ever so slightly. Plug in hybrids use a wider range of the battery's potential. The Nissan dealer near me is the #1 Leaf dealer in the country and their techs have told me that battery life is already becoming an issue. I believe there's even a class action suit that just started over it, I'm on my phone so I'll try to find a source for that later.
