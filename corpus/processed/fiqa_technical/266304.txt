Using the http://calculators.ato.gov.au/scripts/asp/simpletaxcalc/main.asp calculator and noting all the caveats (Medicare etc) and assuming everything is proportionate you get: You earn: $110,000 less $28,647 tax = $81,353 She earns: $54,000 less $9,097 tax = $44,903 Total net: $126,256 You earn: $88,000 less $20,507 tax = $67,493 She earns: $72,000 less $14,947 tax = $57,053 Total net: $124,546 So, there is about $1,710 in it per annum or $33/week. Long day care will be setting you back $75-185/day so this is pretty small beans. This is all back of the envelope stuff and probably worth paying a few hundred dollars to an accountant to work it all out.
