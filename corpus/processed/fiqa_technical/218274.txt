"I might as well add my 2 cents here. Further to what robotik said, the intrinsic value is essentially the ""value contained within itself."" As an entity, an item, an object - anything for that matter, the intrinsic value is what someone can benefit from it. In reference to the Water paradox asked by Yorn; my perspective is that water has an ""positive"" intrinsic value in either case because the intrinsic value of something is independent of who it affects and how it affects anyone. If humans were a species that was allergic to water and caught fire upon touching it - water would be considered to have a very ""negative"" intrinsic value. It doesn't matter the second person is drowning in water, the fact that water is an essential part of life - the intrinsic value of it is positive and unchanged. Perhaps the ""situational value"" would be a more subjective measure?"
