People like you who despise socialism misunderstand the concept. It's not all or nothing, a nation can be both socialist and capitalist. A pure socialist state will likely fail, as would a purely capitalist one. If we were pure capitalist all roads would be toll roads, the police would only be for hire, anyone disabled and not wealthy would die in the street, schools are only for the wealthy, etc. But idk it sounds like that would be your preference
