">**Paulson explained that under this scenario, the common stock of the two government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, would be effectively wiped out.** So too would the various classes of preferred stock, he said. > >The fund manager says he was shocked that Paulson would furnish such specific information Despite what is claimed by the ""law professors"", what could possibly be considered any COMPELLING reason for him to share that VERY specific level of detail? I think the ""law professors"" are full of *shill* on this one. --- And Black makes that exact point: >William Black, associate professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, can’t understand why Paulson felt impelled to share the Treasury Department’s plan with the fund managers. > >“You just never ever do that as a government regulator -- transmit nonpublic market information to market participants,” says Black, who’s a former general counsel at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. “There were no legitimate reasons for those disclosures.” And apparently, one fund manager was of the same opinion: >The fund manager who described the meeting left after coffee and called his lawyer. The attorney’s quick conclusion: Paulson’s talk was material nonpublic information, **and his client should immediately stop trading the shares** of Washington- based Fannie and McLean, Virginia-based Freddie. **I don't buy into ANY of the rationalizations around this, Paulson was no neophyte, no kid straight off some Iowa farm, who was naive to the ways of finance.**"
