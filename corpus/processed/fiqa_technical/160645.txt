FTA's [like TiSA ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_pPqnbXpA4)will radically change the labor market by globalizing labor flows and contracts. Deregulation will certainly increase corporate profits and further decrease accountability. Given thats thats what triggered the GFC in 2008, its not a very wise idea to be pursuing it again through TiSA.
