Oh man.. youve been to school for this, i can tell! Haha. Excellent points, some i havent thought of. Like i mentioned, im not a buisness major or anything but im smart enough (and stupid enough) to take chances if i see opportunity to make money. (A mindset that probably started with my majuana empire in high school lol). I will most likely follow through with welding full time, at least until i have money built up to invest and still live comfortably. Like i said, im smart enough to know what needs to be done but im wide-eyed and hungry to make more also. Anyway, thank you for your response, its very helpful and full of things i hadnt considered yet; specifically the investment structure of the company.
