A Ponzi scheme takes investor money and lies about where it is invested. New investor money is then used to pay dividends to current investors to attract more investors. However there is a fundamental lie as to where the investment is and how much money is under control. The Fed satisfies none of these requirements. You're pretty confused on the terms. See my post above on how the Fed works.
