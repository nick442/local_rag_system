We are FAR FAR better off than the majority. That is COMPLETELY true. But the point is that this does not made 300k$ easily, despite being far far far ahead of most. That's the crazy part -- the income disparity. (P.s., where we live 400k$ gets you the shittiest house in town. You could get a tiny condo for 250k$ too)
