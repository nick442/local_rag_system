As a meat lover, I would absolutely eat the other burger. Things like meatballs, sausages, chicken fingers, etc would be great with total replacement..but would something like a good steak be possible? Could they replicate the marbling and fat content, could it be aged, etc. I'm all for moving forward, but I don't know if it's really realistic for total replacement.. another thing would be cost and sustainability. I also didn't read the article before commenting as I'm on my phone and didn't feel like opening a link, so I apologize if that was covered.
