EMV cards use an offline transaction counter to increase security. This counter is maintained inside the card and incremented every time a transaction is confirmed by the card. For (online) contact transactions, the card will usually receive feedback from its issuer, which (among other actions) will reset that counter to zero. For offline transactions, the card will increment the counter by one each time it is used. For contactless transactions, things are a bit different: Since contactless transactions usually do not maintain a connection between the card and the terminal long enough to transmit issuer feedback to the card, the counter cannot be reset that way. The counter will therefore even be incremented for online transactions. The implications of this are dependent on what your issuer is actually doing with the contents of the offline counter: Some issuers use this as a safety measure for contactless cards and allow only a limited number of contactless transactions, since those usually do not require any cardholder verification method below a certain threshold (e.g. 25â‚¬ in many European countries), and the total risk in case of physical card theft can therefore be limited to <number of offline transactions>*<maximum contactless transaction amount>. Usually, you would have to use your card in a contact-based transaction to reset the counter, and the terminal would display an according notice. It is indeed strange that the terminal instead requested your PIN. If this happens again, you could try to use your card once via the contact interface and see if this resets your offline counters and allows you to pay without PIN entry for the next few transactions.
