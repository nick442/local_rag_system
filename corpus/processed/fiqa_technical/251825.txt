Guilty as charged. Edit: And given the fact that [online grocery shopping has tried and failed in the past](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/27/why-webvan-failed-and-how-home-delivery-2-0-is-addressing-the-problems/) I don't feel my assessment is a mere statement of the obvious. It is at least somewhat remarkable that a company that doesn't fail much is aggressively undertaking something that used to be a bad idea.
