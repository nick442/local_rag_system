With the crazy amount of fee overhead in Instacart, I am not sure if teaming up would Aldi would make sense for them. Maybe it will be different for Aldi but for a Costco order, the items were %10-15 more expensive, there was a processing fee, delivery fee and they expected you to tip the shopper. That's just crazy so I would never use Instacart again unless they provided a large discount again similar to one they do for first time customers.
