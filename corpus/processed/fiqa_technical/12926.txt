yeah it sounds good but it includes a flaw that free marketeers wish was true but isnt. That this wouldnt have happened had they been allowed to fail. It is anthropomorphising corps. When mega businesses fail,it's not like the ceo, executives and traders have to open up their wallets. Look at what happen with leaman or bears, everyone who was working in those banks now work for the other banks, still making the big bucks. a shit ton of smaller banks were allowed to fail, why wasnt their behavior tempered by knowing they wouldnt have been bailed out? we should have bailed them out, all of our retirements where tied up in this bullshit and most of us didnt have shit to do with anything. But the problem is we should have owned them afterwards like we did the S&ls, we should have unseat the boards and wiped out shareholder value and restructured the banks back into healthy entities and resell back on the open market. It still wouldnt change anything, just like laws dont stop car thieves. But it would have been the right thing to do.
