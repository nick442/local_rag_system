So, my econ 101 class taught me that a business operating at a point where revenue equals cost is successful. Failing is when costs are too high, and above that is profit. As a society, we've chose to tax profits, not revenue. The fact that many of Amazon's vendors (FedEx, ups, companies they buy hardware from, etc) are profitable and paying taxes on profits they wouldn't have without Amazon says something about the overall value they bring to the economy. Also, states collect sales tax on good sold. EU countries collect VAT. And all countries collect capital gains when shares change hands. The fact that there's low turnover in shares isn't really a problem.
