"You obviously know staggeringly little about the automotive industry. Thanks for putting it on display. _edit_ You talk about companies like GM and BMW like they haven't been working on electric systems for _years_, and you throw the word ""technology"" around like some kind of buzzword you don't understand. The Model S does not operate on ""magic"", and outside of the drive train is no more sophisticated (less if you look at the actual available features) than your average E-Class or 5 series."
