So how would you regulate the financial sector to keep one ridiculous horde or powerhouse of cash from ruling it, and keep money flowing through the whole system rather than stagnating or spiraling to a small sector? These questions also bring to mind rivers versus blood vessels. In rivers, you get eddies and pools. In the circulatory system, eddies and pools lead to health issues, much like hording and enclosed loops create stagnation or poor financial health. Just an observation.
