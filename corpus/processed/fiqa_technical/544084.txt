Im not gonna get into the rabit hole about the direction of this country dont have nearly enough time for that lol but i acrually agree with u on alot of what u said actually. >I have an issue with people using any drug everyday. But most people don't drink and get drunk daily. Do u find issue with a person having a beer or a couple glasses of wine every other day? Same applies to mj most users arent getting completely blasted everyday and i have sources to prove it if youre interested. >But to reply to what you said, things like alcohol have rules. You can't drink everywhere, you can't drink and drive, etc.. There needs to be some rules for MJ. Not trying to be rude but you havent even done your research on mj laws in your own state. Prop 64 is almost identical to drinking laws so you're absolutely incorrect here >I'm completely okay with medicinal use, but most people don't use it in that way. Youre right but my point was alcohol is perfectly legal and offers no medicinal value isn't that a bit ridiculous? With all due respect man you dont seem like an unintelligent person but you are greatly misinformed about alot of this stuff. I think youre a bit hung up politcal divides conservative vs liberal. You'd greatly benefit from educating yourself on the matter of mj. There's a reason why many conservatives also support mj legalzation including myself. Id be willing to send u some credible information if you're interested.
