It's really all just speculation, we don't know what they're looking for. I do know from a roads perspective Boston in general can be difficult because trucks can't get in there easily from every direction. Western and newer builds that didn't grow up around colonial times seem preferred when I've spoken to logistics people. They'll also want a city capable of incubating trial platforms so Socal or NY could be huge. Atlanta and Austin as well. Boston seems to mostly have a surrounding metro population, yes, but it's also one of the furthest way from Seattle which isn't an advantage so much as a proximity thing.
