"You start with an error. >a known disadvantaged minority. This tells me that you buy into the liberal ""no man is responsible for himself"" bullshit. As you probably do not know, the poorest counties in the US are 95% white, but somehow you need to be a fucking minority to fit into your little box. [PROOF](http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/08/sanders-is-wrong-americas-poorest-counties-are-95-percent-white/) If you would have bothered to click on the link I provided for your ass you would see that the assistance that we have been providing for 50 god damn years does not work. In adult world we make decisions based on data, not what our social justice handlers tell us are disadvantaged minorities. Read the links assmunch. Here is my solution. 1.If you are willing to work and show progress we as a society will support that process. If you sit back and ""woe as me"" because you are a disadvantaged minority you can fuck right off. 2.If you as a regular person want to give them some money or start a charity because you feel bad about things we cannot measure, then fine. Has nothing to do with society owing you a thing. Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Not a check for 50 years, like Detroit and Baltimore. 3.Family and Church support worked pretty well until the welfare society. **'When the people find that they can vote themselves money that will herald the end of the republic.'** -------------Ben Franklin"
