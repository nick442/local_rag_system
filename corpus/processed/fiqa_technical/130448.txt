Careful, here. The last time we got a bill from the doctor's office because they made a billing mistake it turns out the bill was a mistake. Before you pay anything go through the list of charges and payments and make sure it's accurate. (In our case she went to an appointment and was then told there was no reason for the doctor to see her that day. Several months later a bill for the visit showed up--except they hadn't kept straight what payment was for what visit so it took some digging to figure out what had happened.
