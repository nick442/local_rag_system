Paying weekly to be able to have maneuver room under your credit limit is a way to handle low credit limits. Doing it to boost your credit score when you have no immediate need for a loan is wasting energy. A few months in advance of buying a car or house, you can start to worry about your utilization rate. When you apply for the loan they will pull your credit file, and that will lock in your utilization rates. Then make sure that you pay the balance quickly, and if you need to make a big purchase pay the bill before the account closes for the month. Keep in mind that if you pay the balance every month the highest utilization rate will occur the day the payment is due. This is because it not only has all the purchases from the previous bill, but all the purchases you have made since that bill closed. For example if you have a credit limit of 10K and you spend 2K a month on the credit card, on the day the payment is due it is not unusual to see the total owed to be above 3K. If they pulled your file on that day, your utilization rate would appear to be above 30%.
