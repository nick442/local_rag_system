First decide if the best route is to distribute as a middle man (eg.land an Amazon or Walmart contract), or to distribute it through yourself (your own company). Is it more profitable to form your own corporation or have the mother company establish a international entity in N.A? (fees apply but they could be minuscule to your projected margins(eg.$5000 fee to open up a market of $1,000,000+ GP)) If you decide you want to establish your own means of distribution, you will have to decide if your going to build physical locations or do online distribution. Depending on what the product or service your providing, you generally have more possibilities and opportunities with online market. You can run an online website, incorporate an online store that accept online payments, and shipping products for less than $5000 a year. (Monthly payments for the services provided, excluding any shipping/import costs) This would be done with the means of website hosts such as GoDaddy, or retail hosts like Shopify.
