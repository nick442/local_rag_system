I am myself from Scandinavia. We had low taxes until WW2 and were largely spared the horrors of WW2 which is the main reason we are still rich. As we have increased taxes, our growth rates have stagnated in Scandinavia. We still, however, do a lot of things right, we have high taxes, but also our governments are quite efficient, we have very free markets, free trade, very little labour regulation, etc. There are many more reasons Scandinavia is succesful - it is because we are so succesful that we have been able to have high taxes and support a welfare state, not the other way around.. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03585522.2013.836985
