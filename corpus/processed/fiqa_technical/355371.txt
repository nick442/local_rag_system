Never met any myself, but I know some manufacturers use them and are happy with their services. There is definitely a legitimate need for it, just a lot of swamp that gets dragged in. I would call around the midwest and ask. All the business folks I've met there seem to be very nice and happy to help. Try casting, extruding, or large welding shops and see if they have any recommendations. I know this isn't the best way.. but it is a way of finding someone who is probably reputable.
