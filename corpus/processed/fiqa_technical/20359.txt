According to the United Nations things that people need to live are classified as human rights. Food, water, basic communication etc, all listed as human rights. Those things you listed are (I believe) from the American constitution(?) and are protected 'rights' but they are not human rights. For more information you can visit the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) pay listed by the united nations. These are things that most countries on the planet agree all people need.
