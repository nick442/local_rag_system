"I wouldn't go so far as to call them victims. US airlines have most certainly benefitted from the ""enhanced security screenings"" that make it impossible to sell/trade ""non-refundable"" tickets, force people to show up an hour earlier, and kick anyone off a plane (without a refund or credit) ""for security reasons"". As a result, US airlines have fewer complaints, and face less backlash as they reduce the quality of service. With how much benefit its had to the bottom line, US airlines would be *stupid* to not support these bullshit security measures. Here's a fun fact: At many airports, flying first (or even just business) means you get your own security line. At some airports you don't get scanned or questioned, and at least *one* airport you can walk *around* the metal detector in the security line. Whether they actually *created* these measures or not isn't an entirely different beast: When 9/11 happened, I'm sure the US state department asked the airlines *what can we do* to stop this from happening, and I'm sure that *all* of these measures were cleared by top airlines, but then I think most new legislation is cleared by lobbyists, and etc. The debate isn't whether this happens, but as always, it's whether lobbyists and corporate rights benefit Americans."
