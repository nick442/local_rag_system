Normally, under law today (at least in the United States; perhaps there is somewhere in the world where things are different) debts expire upon the death of someone; debt may consume much of their estate, but there cannot be a net debt passed on to their children. That's a bit unsatisfactory, if you are a lender. People can only sell their future labor to you up to a point; they cannot sell that of their children. There's only so much debt that they can run up. However, that is only true of private debt. *Public* debt is a whole different ballgame. There, debts can be passed down from generation to generation.
