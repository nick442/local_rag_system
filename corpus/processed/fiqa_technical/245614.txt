The thing that is working to Foxconn's advantage here is that there were several states competing for this, thats exactly it. This is actually how all business works, its no surprise. States usually compete for large businesses to move their by giving tax breaks, because it benefits their people and they will eventually still collect taxes. Now, the first part interest me, how much does the state usually spend on a project like this? I wouldnt really consider it a gamble unless you consider all investments to be gambles, but that also connotates that you think this is high risk. What makes you say that Foxconn wont live up to its promises? Wont the state just sue based on the terms of agreement?
