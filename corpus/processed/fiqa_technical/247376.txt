(I'm a bot) ***** > The resulting fractal patterns are rare for man-made systems and lead to optimal harvests without global planning. > As a result of this constraint, fractal planting patterns emerge, which yield close to maximal harvests. > &quot;The remarkable finding is that this optimal situation arises without central planners or coordination. Farmers interact locally and take local individual free decisions, which they believe will optimize their own harvest. And yet the global system works optimally,&quot; says Lansing. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6gikun/fractal_planting_patterns_yield_optimal_harvests/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~141298 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **farmers**^#1 **plant**^#2 **system**^#3 **patterns**^#4 **rice**^#5"
