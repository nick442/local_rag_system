> The debt part: http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/[1] (ie closing in on $18T) The US government debt is how much USD the government has paid the US non-government in excess of what it's taxed them. Correct? Do you know another way of putting that? It's the US non-government's *savings*. So that scary US debt clock, with the big red numbers? Consider that from *our* side of the accounting ledger it's actually a non-government savings clock, with big green numbers. It's just not a bad thing. Every year the government pays us more than it taxes us, our savings go up. And it's not like the US is going to run out of USD - this is a perfectly sustainable way to growth.
