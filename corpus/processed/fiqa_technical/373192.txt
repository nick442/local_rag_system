This is not a supply side issue (bank), but a demand side (small business) and there is simply no demand. Bank CEOs have been repeating that there is just no interest in borrowing right now, they would love to lend, but businesses are not taking the loans. Businesses are trying to firm up their balance sheets and with concerns of a recession looming most small business owners don't want to borrow and risk defaulting.
