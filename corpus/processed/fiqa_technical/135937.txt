OP: - I graduated with a Finance Degree from USC with a focus on financial analysis and valuation - Failed to get accept into one of the major investment banks with a 3.7 (turned out for the best). I thought my world was fucking over. My career trajectory in the last 4 years has been: Commercial Insurance (1.5 years, 40hrs/week)> Consulting (1.5 years, 80hrs/week) > Technology firm (current, ~40hrs/week). At this point, I have parlayed by financial modeling experience into a strategy and corporate planning role. My income has gone from 50K to 85K in those 4 years. Takeaway: Don't worry so much about being at a target school. Connections/internships (which you can get despite your school of choice) will determine where you end up. Join any relevant investing / finance clubs. Develop a network and learn to leverage that network's network (I didn't learn the true value of this until after I graduated). Furthermore, there are a VARIETY of small, boutique firms where you could get an internship/first-job that would be great springboard into a larger firm. Sometimes your circumstance dictates a small start with a rapid increase. Do not get so hung up on your school and focus more on the opportunities your school opens up for you, and take advantage of those.
