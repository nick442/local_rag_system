"This is true, to an extent. But conditions ""on the ground"" in Japan are not always as good as they appear. There's [a lot of poverty](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/26/national/social-issues/hidden-poverty-growing-abe-particularly-among-young-single-mothers/#.WVTsMWgrLIU) in Japan, much of which is not obvious. The Japanese sometimes massage numbers too: there are large Korean immigrant populations that aren't necessarily included in Japanese statistics because they aren't always considered ""permanent"" residents. Also, many Japanese companies and individuals do not use cutting edge technology. While it's true *some* families have consoles, many don't. Most people still don't use smart phones. Fax machines, a classic example, are only just beginning to give way to email for the sending of documents. Japanese medical clinics are often backwards compared to other countries'. I'm not saying Japan doesn't have good quality of life, I'm just concerned that the picture the government paints is usually rosier than the reality in the streets."
