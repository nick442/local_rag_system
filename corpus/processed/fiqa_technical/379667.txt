Before the financial crisis it was all the rage with Sears being another controversial one. Sears Canada shareholders were upset that that company sold off all of its flagship stores and then distributed the cash via dividends to shareholders (in particular Lampert). Unsurprisingly with no reinvestment in the business, they declared bankruptcy recently. The US Sears is going through this selling stores to a separate real estate holding company.
