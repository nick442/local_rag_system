My assumption was given the amount of supply from Russia to Europe limited, the price would rise, as it mostly happens when there is a disruption in any of the producing countries in the world. As you also mentioned we don't know his 10 O&G stocks and I'd expect mixed reaction instead of one direction mov't. But I still agree with your point.
