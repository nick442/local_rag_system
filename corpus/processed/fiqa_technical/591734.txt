Nope. Not claiming any expertise just common sense. After 2008 when everything crashed I got interested in economic depressions and asset bubbles from a historical perspective. How long they lasted in the past and what I should expect. Figuring that past experience is a good indicator for the present and the future. Now I keep reading that the recovery is just around the corner! Just be patient, everything will be fine people. No worries. It's different this time. Oh wait, you took a $500k HELOC because your wages have stagnated for the last 20 years and now you can't afford to pay it. Multiply that story millions of times. I can't for the life of me understand how banks routinely approved mortgages to people 5 or 10 times their annual income. A neighbor of mine got two mortgages for $1.3 million in 2006 working part time at Home Depot.
