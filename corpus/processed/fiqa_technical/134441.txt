Well that's because you're trying to apply the same rules that apply everyone else to government officials. Don't be silly. On a serious note, I find this one of the most offensive abuses of power in America today. Insider trading has been illegal in various forms since 1933. It is an enormous conflict of interest. A government official has the ability to enrich themselves in an almost unlimited way from trading on insider information. I don't believe the average American even realizes this. How there can be any justification of this is beyond me. It is a crime. No question about it. So if stealing is illegal for the general public, how can it be ok for public officials? And they wonder [public trust in government](http://www.people-press.org/2017/05/03/public-trust-in-government-1958-2017/) is at all-time lows.
