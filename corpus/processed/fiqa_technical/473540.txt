Thanks for sharing. I honestly didn't know about that. At the same time, I have to point out that Detroit is certainly an outlier from the rest of the country. Their housing market appears to have **really** hit rock bottom, so I assume it is the same in the neighboring communities. Some houses in the city itself were selling for like $5, so it stands to reason they had nowhere to go but up.
