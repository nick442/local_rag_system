Customers are regularly confused by software pricing. Microsoft's Windows, for example. Either they're dumb and shouldn't confuse the customers or they know what they're doing. I'm betting the latter. At 99 bucks, a product can seem expensive, but if the other offerings are 89 and 150, 99 seems like you're saving a lot on the 150 while only paying a bit more than the 99. Yet without those other options, 99 might seem expensive. Business consumers are more likely to pay more so you can gouge them with the Enterprise edition at 150. 99 for the gold edition and 89 for lite. 99 will sell great and if that's what you were hoping for in the first place, that's good anchoring. Don't think of the premium getting cannibalised. Just thing of the premium edition as a way to capture the consumer surplus of businesses.
