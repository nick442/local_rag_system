SurePay is not designed to send money from one person to himself. It is designed to transfer money from one person to someone else. What SurePay does, is allow you to link an account to a name/email/phone number. Then, when someone else, who's also linked an account to a name/email/phone number, selects your name/email/phone number to send money to, the money is transferred. This doesn't buy you anything when transferring money to another of your own accounts. I won't say it's impossible to use SurePay to do so, but it's definitely not designed to do so, and may not be permitted. If you could use it for that purpose, you would have to separately register your two accounts, using a separate email for each, and then use the first email to send to the second email; each will have been tied to a different account, so you'll know which is which. My suggestion would be to follow Wells Fargo's instructions here: Can I transfer funds to or from my accounts at another institution? You can transfer money between your Wells Fargo checking and savings accounts and accounts you may have at other U.S. financial institutions. Wells Fargo gives you greater flexibility, convenience, and control to transfer funds where and when you need it. Sign on to Wells Fargo Online and click the Transfers tab to learn more about transferring funds to your account at another financial institution. As that should give you the official answer, at least.
