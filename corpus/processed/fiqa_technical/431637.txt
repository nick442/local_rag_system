US Bank just introduced this feature, but they want $.50 per deposit! No way man. Schwab has an Android App I have used a dozen times. Very easy and pretty consistent. It worked on folded checks, pictures on a reflective background (kitchen table top), big company issued checks and of course personal checks. Very positive feeling from this app and the ability to deposit.
