This is why Singapore's economy makes the most sense, the government has a huge sovereign wealth fund where the government actually owns a sizeable portion of the economy/businesses, i believe this is called 'socialism', but done through their stock exchange (and foreign exchanges too), and the returns go back towards people's social security accounts and also funds government programs. Norway also does something similar.
