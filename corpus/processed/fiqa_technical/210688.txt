Gruelling. The most difficult thing I ever did. Everything they say about it is true. I wrote 5 times, passed 3 times and failed twice. It took 4 years. Would I do it again - probably not. I'd do a year or 2 year MBA instead. WIth an MBA there is more certainty of completion than CFA. with the CFA many people give up after years of trying. MBA costs much more, CFA is so cheap I'd say its pretty much free (relative to MBA of course). So pros and cons - gotta weigh 'em.
