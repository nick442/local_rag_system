irresponsible jerk? go fuck yourself. I did nothing illegal, unethical, immoral, or irresponsible. I racked up a large amount of debt (as the banks intended) and when I got into a position I couldn't pay any longer I tried to negotiate. I spent hours on the phone, days all in all. the banks response (six different banks) we don't give a fuck. so I took that attitude and ran with it. it's only business. in addition I profited by a few thousand dollars suing a collection agency/lawyer group that got a judgement against me using forged documents. JUdgment was removed, my lawyer got 7 grand, I got three, and the debt was erased. win, win, win, and did I say fuck you? fuck you.
