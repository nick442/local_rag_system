It passes itself off as the provider of all things that it touches. Obviously that's bullshit, but the state believes it comes before the chicken or the egg. If it claims to own everything then it gives everything you have as a loan. At least the statists I have argued with seem to think the state provides first and you receive. Like some religious arrangement since the state is often passed off as benevolent.
