economies and the money system above and beyond _normal_ human work (making things) and business (selling and organizing things) are fantasy anyway, the trick is to keep it running. The stupid and immoral thing about work is the inequality of it, you have people working in factories and other workplaces doing 40/50/60 plus hours per week, being burnt out and exploited for crap wages, not to mention paying most of their income on essentials (housing/food/travel/insurance) and having very little leisure/family time, and the name of the game for people with not much leisure time is very expensive hobbies/pusuits that _require_ expensive tools that get used only a couple of times a year. Then theres others who do 30 hour weeks and have a light work load. Theres a lot to be said for a European style work week (with a living wage) and more people working, people who work and have time for leisure spend and promote growth/activity in society. And forcing people to actually take off their vacation time too.
