Yeah exactly. The problem is that metrics like unemployment rate are just really poor metrics the way they're measured. And to make matters worse we double down and use those same poor metrics to create derivative measurements like the Phillips curve. The result is models that model nothing, but still manage to be the basis of policy decisions.
