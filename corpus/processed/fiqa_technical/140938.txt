Then we do agree in a sense. Pensions are an anathema in the modern economy and likely were never a good idea, that said I do not agree with putting those owed and promised pensions behind other creditors. You would not bring down the credit system, you would simply kill what is left of the seriously broken pensions system and punish any company that was fool enough to play games with their pension system. All that said I am not against a bankruptcy court discharging pensions and saying tough-titties to the employees. I just want that consideration by the court to happen when whatever is left of the cash pile is still big enough to matter to the pensioners. If you are a company dumb enough to operate such a system today I see no reason why your creditors should not be aware of the promised debt load you carry that is bound up in your employees and take it into account. Does it make credit more expensive for them? It better!
