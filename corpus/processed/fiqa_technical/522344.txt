"I'm an SF resident. Trust me when I say that the vast majority of this city's residents are VERY sick of the cabs here. Most of the time they won't take you to the part of town that you want to go to (eg. outer Richmond, sunset, etc.), and when they do, it isnt uncommon for them to claim that their card reader is ""busted"" and make you head to an atm with the meter running to pay in cash or they call the cops. And the safer driver claim is bullshit. Every cab that I've been in tends to go like 60 mph on geary while road raging and scares the shit out of me. No uber/lyft driver has ever done that."
