This discussion over at Google Answers suggests that the only time it matters is if your signature is challenged -- that is, someone has reason to doubt it's you authorizing your signature. (Assuming US here.) But if you wanted to get another debit card and sign it differently, and start signing things that way from then on, you might never get challenged about it.
