Find local small business or real estate networking events, ask to attend as a guest and introduce yourself to everyone. Ask about them first, ask a follow up question or two, and then tell them you help achieve a result of some kind. (Did you know houses sell x times quicker with Ariel footage?). Check meetup.com to get started.
