It's because we have refineries, (to make oil into gas) while other countries have the oil, but not as many refineries, if any. This sounds crazy at first blush, but actually there is nothing weird about it. Analogy: the US could import a lot of wool and export a lot of sweaters, but also import some sweaters too, for reasons outlined elsewhere ITT. This would not imply either way whether we were wool-independent, it only necessarily means we have more sweater factories.
