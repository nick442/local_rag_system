But were they bad mortgages? At the time, real estate prices were going up. The thinking was if someone defaulted, they could just foreclose on the property and recoup their money. Is that deceptive? They bundled poorer mortgages with better rated mortgages to eliminate risk. The risk was all the debtors defaulting in a short period - which happened. Again, no financial model forecasted the worst recession since the Great Depression. Not the top financial firms, not the Federal Reserve, not the Treasury. They were all wrong.
