">From what I've read, all the testimony has been roundly discredited. Then you read wrong. It hasn't been discredited. The evidence is right fucking there. Read the 200 page report, read even a part of it. [Here is the evidence, maybe this will finally shut you up?](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444799904578048673157864186.html) >I'm just looking for actual evidence while you keep saying he needs to prove himself innocent instead of the accusers proving him guilty. ITS RIGHT FUCKING THERE! Do you not see why it's so frustrating to argue with people like you? You're basically a creationist saying ""Where is the evidence for evolution?"" Again, you don't have to look very fucking far to find it. Instead you're burying your head in the sand and saying ""Where is the evidence?"""
