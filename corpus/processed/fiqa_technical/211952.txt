I've never thought about the difference in goals between manufacturers and local businesses..Hmmm, your knowledge about the facebook ad model might be able to help me with a personal project I'm doing. If you care to take a whack at it, read on: What interested me before the IPO was the debate about the **value** of FB's ad model. To get a better idea, I wanted to use regression modeling test the efficacy of advertising on Facebook compared to traditional media (TV, magazines, banner ads..). I haven't quite got how the model is going to *prove* the relative effectiveness/ineffectiveness of Sponsored Ads and Fan Pages. This really depends on the kind of independent variables I'm able to draw from the data sets I can find and this a lot of this information is hard to come by.. Any pointers on where I should look?
