"Ok, would ""a form supply -side economics"" make you feel better about the term? Because you responded to zero points? Company's force workers to stay: they can't work or move to a job in the same industry. That benefits firms. Firms knowing this can deny raises, promotions, stock options. They can spend less on recruiting/training and pay employees less because they know the employee has little incentive to leave. This limits firms expenses the same way a tax break could. It's done under the guise of keeping Idahos tech workers in Idaho because the idahos tech bubble is good for the ""common man"", while allowing CEOs and Boards to spend less and reap benefits and bonuses for staying under budget."
