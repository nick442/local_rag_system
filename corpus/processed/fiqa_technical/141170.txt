So to sum up, a Keynesian would suggest that the way out of this economic malaise is to incur more public debt now to make up for the fact that the private sector is paying down its way-too-high debt. And you suggest that the way out is to produce more cheap electronics in this country by cutting taxes and regulation? I bet ending unions would probably help, too.
