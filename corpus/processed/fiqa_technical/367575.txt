Actually I was talking about years of having computers do all the flying and people just being there as the contingency. I don't think we're more than a few years away from seeing the first commercial airliners that are piloted completely by computer and the person is the co-pilot. I don't honestly think it will take more than 10 years for automated commercial airliners to be commonplace. They won't completely take over the market in that time but my guess is that it will be common sooner rather than later.
