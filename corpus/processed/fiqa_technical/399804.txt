My wife has to pay tax on that? No. This will be treated as gift to your wife. As a son he can gift unlimited amount to his mother without any tax implication to his mother. If the amounts are large more than few lacs, best talk to CA and get a gift deed executed. Keep the paper work intact, i.e. details of the transfer, debit to your son's account with corresponding credit to your wife's account.
