It's a good point and I think you answered the question yourself, most IPOs don't have the option. There is a real risk of an undersubscribed IPO, which can be a real problem for a company since they can't easily go back to the market for money. Facebook might have a tough time issuing an IPO under the current market conditions, especially following Zynga's weak showing. They might feel safer with a traditional IPO.
