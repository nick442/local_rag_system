>> You're just being pedantic. > I'm really not. Okay. No, seriously. It is always good to see someone back to champion their beliefs. > ..you are responsible for the outcomes in your life. The sooner you accept that, and stop blaming everything listed above, the sooner you'll be on the road to a better life. I totally agree but looking only at an individual in the job market will miss the unfairness of the job market. Yes, someone can better themselves and get a better job but somebody else is going to find themselves with only the option of that vacant job or something worse. Your position is like saying musical chairs is a fair and equitable game for all because any player can work harder at getting to a seat first. The fact that one player can improve their odds of winning doesn't change the fact that there are simply not enough chairs for everyone. It sounds like you might agree that farm workers, ditch diggers, security guards, and dishwashers don't get paid a living wage. If so, would you agree that unless there are more living wage or better jobs in an economy than workers, you are forcing people into a below living wage job?
