Excellent summary. I'd add a minor point that it's cheaper to setup and run a hedge fund. The legal fees associated with starting a 40 Act mutual fund are about $750,000. A hedge fund cane be setup for about $80,000. It's also cheaper to keep the hedge fund going as the reporting requirements are much less. source: Have setup hedge funds and mutual funds. edit: A word and source. Edi
