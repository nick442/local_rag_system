That's overly simplistic. The stockholders made millions. She kept the ship afloat and maintained their multi-billion dollar investments long enough for the acquisition. She paid for her shortcomings through the years through stock withholding and cuts, so while the investors were making x amount of money, she was making x-y. Imagine a more skittish CEO who would cash out investments to plug a hole in a ship that was destined to sink, delay the inevitable. The company fails anyway, just later rather than sooner, and the stockholders lose their money.
