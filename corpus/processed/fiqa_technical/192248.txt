Agree, but from a consumer standpoint, isn't that awesome? We get fresh, new content at low prices, publishers and authors continue to get paid to produce it, and everyone's happy. Monopsony power is real, but substantially less harmful on the internet - publishers could always produce their own e-books, with DRM, that would be readable on any tablet, but they would want to charge higher prices. The way I see it, publishers are in a tough spot here: their customers are flocking to e-readers, where they're much less willing to pay $15-$25 a pop for a product with virtually zero marginal cost. Amazon isn't the bad guy there - technology is. I think, like the music industry, we're just going to see a fundamental restructuring of the playing field, and publishing is just going to become a much less lucrative market to be in.
