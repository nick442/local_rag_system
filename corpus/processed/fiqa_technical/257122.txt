"I think that all else being equal, if more people have solar panels on our roof, we keep our military in FEWER countries, instead of planning on RAMPING up the number (see: Nigeria). Furthermore, the initial question wasn't whether installing solar panels is going to stop the action. **The conversation started by being about whether solar is actually cheaper when you factor in the amount used to subsidize both sources of energy. Not whether switching to solar would stop subsidies to oil.** What you did is called ""moving the goalposts"". The word 2016 doesn't show up in the article or in the study it cites. That was a typo. I understand it was about 2013, I was trying to saying that it was about the same year as yours. That was my bad. I read the whole thing originally, and I even read the study. I accept responsibility for the typo though. ANYWAYS, neither set of data is manipulated, my study just includes more things, like foreign tax credits, cleanup subsidies for both coal and oil, tar sands exemption from cleanup funds, Power Africa (a five year, 7 billion dollar program that was only ANNOUNCED in 2013). That overseas stuff that goes on is a HUGE part of the equation. And okay, so they aren't equivalent. Then your point is moot. Yes, both sides have off the book subsidies, but one side's off the book subsidies are so unfathomably bigger that it's laughable to even put them in the same category. Not to mention the costs of war in the middle east stretch beyond money (think lives), and recycling programs actually come with benefits (think smaller landfills)."
