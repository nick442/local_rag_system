It actually has already started. People were protesting outside offices that sold defaulted WMPs across China. The government forced landlords to cut the leases of those wealth managers so that they wouldn't have a premises for investors to protest at. Lol. This news isn't **new** but it shouldn't be ignored either. China does have a problem.
