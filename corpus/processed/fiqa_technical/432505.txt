Or, put another way, diversity is a kind of efficiency in that it provides a ready sources of alternative ways if a new problem with an established way of doing things comes up. So killing off competitors reduces the efficiency of one of those competitors rising as market need shifts. It's one reason we fear cloning, that although we might pick good traits, we can't be sure those traits that are good for something now will be the right things for the future, not least of which when fending off disease. A monopoly is like a clone-of-one, where the business model and thought process is cloned throughout the company and there isn't legitimate independent thought. To make that tangible, a thing I worry about is that Climate Change might make travel more difficult. With large storms, we might need a lot more local production and distribution and some of our reliance on just getting things quickly from one part of the world that has a monopoly on things might be dreadfully painful. Having Amazon declare this a done deal kills off a kind of resilience that can be essential if the world gets carved up. I don't know that such a future is certain, I just wanted to paint a picture of what it would look like to find these assumptions false and why monopolies might be bad in such cases, even when there's some perception that ""gee, don't a lot of people want this?""
