> the less chance of people defaulting, You know a non-trivial part of the mortgages out there are adjustable right? Did you never study what happened when in '07 after rates went up 4% in a year or two? Rising interest rates are also a factor in rent prices. Meaning rent prices go up and people won't be saving as much. Investment accounts (savings) will be taking a shit because of severe contractionary fiscal policy. > more people buying with flat cash, How much cash do you think the average American has ready to pay for a home? I agree higher interest rates will definitely lead to lower home prices (that's ultimately what happened in '07) but you need to stop thinking about a ceteris paribus model and begin considering the cascade of other variables and what the impact of housing affordability is from their respective changes as well.
