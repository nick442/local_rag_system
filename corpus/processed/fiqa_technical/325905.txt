Perhaps where we are losing touch is in how income inequality is being measured. What I'm saying is how much more wealthy the top 10% is than the bottom 10%, in real numbers, not by ratio. The United States, and other modern democracies with free markets, absolutely annihilate these smaller less free nations. Although places like Honduras, South Africa, and Bolivia have gigantic inequality by ratio, that primarily because the poor are SO poor in those nations. For instance, if one man makes $100 a year, and another makes $100,000, the difference is $99,900 in real numbers, but 1000 *times* as much. However, If a man makes $10,000 a year where another makes $1,000,000, it is only 100 times as much, but the real number difference is $990,000. Although, by ratio, the poorer nation has greater income inequality, the wealthier nation has a far greater real gap between the upper and lower class. Measuring income inequalities both ways has it's purpose, but to judge by only the ratio often gives false impressions. Often, the false impressions given are intentional, as in the case of the UN which has a markedly anti-Capitalism lean in its bureaucratic membership. Try rereading my original statement with how I am measuring income inequality in mind.
