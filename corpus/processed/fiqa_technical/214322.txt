Doesn't mean this user isn't right. My experiences in all stores lead me to believe that everyone in the business is freaking out. They are all trying to use data science to generate reliable sales. Costco is determined to fuck you over with their science. They have algo that says if you buy LMN there is a 90% probability you will by P and therefore we can rip you off on P. Don't forget most retailers know who you are know and they know when you visit and what you bought and for how much. I predict within 5 years the only thing sold on stores will be stuff with a very inelastic demand curve that you need right now. And can't wait a day for it to come in the mail.
