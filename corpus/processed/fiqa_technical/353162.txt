The numbers you provided would just barely make it (depending on taxes where you are), and I'd say there's lots of room to cut expenses back if need be. The big assumption is that your fianc√© will have a steady income of over $3k/mo take-home. My advice would be to keep your job until you see that as a reality. That said, getting an education is, imho, the single most important thing you can do. In the long run, it's worth eating ramen noodles and rice and beans for a couple years. It's even worth going into debt. (It took me nearly 10 years to pay off my student loans. No regrets here.) While working your way through school is noble and it's great if you can do it, being able to focus on your studies is what will make it worthwhile. It sounds to me like you're on the right track.
