I would honestly find it difficult to believe that the high rate of failure are due to opioids (they break down way too fast and many have some kind of scrip even if the legitimacy is questionable). Admittedly we have an epidemic in our country however I would suspect that the author is looking at general failure rates and then mentioning opioids in the same breath as I don't think I have ever seen public data on what drugs people are being failed for. Also while the article mentions opioids it also mentions an upcoming medicinal law in Ohio that is expected to be a problem for employers heavily drug testing. This leads me to further believe that any testing stats mentioned are aggregates. EDIT: And lets be honest, opioids are eyeball grabbers in discussion these days. When you have ghost white parents passed out in public places, children overheating in the back of a minivan that is going to grab your attention. I don't think anyone has been horrified like that watching someone stoned eating an entire large pizza on their own.
