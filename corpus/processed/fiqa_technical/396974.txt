The problem is very fundamental. Equity is traded on limit order books while fixed income is not. Meaning counterparty to counterparty, if you buy a bond off say barclays, chances are if you hit them for a price to sell it will be somewhat higher than the market as they do not want you to just take their money. Putting fixed income on a limit order book could help however there may be fundamental liquidity problems on some smaller issues.
