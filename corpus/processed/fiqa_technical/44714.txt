Took it early in the Spring, got a 98th percentile. Got about 20 requests for my resume since then, but no responses back after I released it. Most of the firms asking for my resume were undisclosed. Test is really easy. You are probably going to be surprised by how well you will do. I would take it, maybe you will have more luck than me in getting responses.
