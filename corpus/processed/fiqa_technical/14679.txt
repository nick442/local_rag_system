They're not just giving away money because they're nice, they're doing what they think (or hope) is a good business decision. Even if they lost money on that particular transaction, there are still positive effects such as OP telling the story about how great BestBuy is which will get more people in their stores, many of which won't be as rigorous in their price checking or will possibly buy other items once they're in the store. You can't look at one sale in a vacuum to make a determination like that.
