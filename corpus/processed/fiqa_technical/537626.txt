If markets are efficient (which they aren't, but anyways..), the frequency of DCA investments shouldn't yield any meaningful difference in return. The one possible item to note is that if you're able to invest more frequently, you'll have more money exposed to the effects of compounding for longer, which *may* increase return. However, there are also transaction costs to consider, which may render something like *continuous* DCA-ing ineffective. That same compounding effect also negates the potential benefits of DCA altogether, making it more logical to lump sum your investments. You may be conflating DCA with simply making additional cash every week that's available for investment. If that's the case, again, lump sum as early as possible should yield the best results..
