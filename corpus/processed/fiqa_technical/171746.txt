I think you're on the right track. Keep it up. You are still relatively young, and it wont have an impact. You have experience and you have a lot of education, both will be assets. I can't comment on the region question because I have only ever worked in one region. Are you asking from a purely economics/getting paid perspective? One approach you can take is making a little spreadsheet with average trader salary divided by cost of living in that region. The issue is that trader salaries and bonuses vary SO MUCH in every region, that you can't make any generalizations.
