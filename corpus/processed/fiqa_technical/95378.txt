"Under the Lanham Act, the issue is whether the use of a name will have a ""likelihood of confusion"" with a registered trademark. Courts look at similarities in the marks but also realize that consumers are not necessarily looking at side by side comparisons to try to determine the source of the product. Krogers appears to be arguing that a consumer goes to the store and see ""preferred selection"" and thinks, ""oh, that's the brand that has the cheap price"" so they buy it. Krogers spent a lot of time and money to create that initial impression in the consumer's mind. It looks like they did a survey by an expert to confirm that consumers are getting the brands confused. If that's truly the case, it's probably worth the investment to try to protect their territory. Obviously that is what Kroger has decided to do. It will be an interesting case to follow. But I will probably watch Netflix instead."
