I know my experience is anecdotal, but where I work I see this scenario playing out. Most of the people I work with, in a health care administrative role, have children *MY AGE*. In the entire corporate office of ~50 people there is maybe 6 people in their 20's early 30's. As far as my role as an Accountant, I'm second in command at age 28. I report directly to the CFO who has a daughter my age. These demographics seem problematic. I know my company isn't the only one that is top heavy with Baby Boomers and few Generation X or younger.
