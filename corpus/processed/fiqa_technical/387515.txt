How about looking into the market price of risk? Ive always wanted to know if risk is or should be priced the same across markets/asset classes/etc. Eh? Let me know what you figure out. Edit: I just realized you people probably consider it to be the Sharpe ratio. That's not what I meant. I meant in the sense of option pricing.
