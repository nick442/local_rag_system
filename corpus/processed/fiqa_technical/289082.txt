Its all about speculation. Like stocks, real estate fluctuates and is sometimes volatile. Educate yourself on the house you are buying and the area it is in. I wouldn't spend over 20% of current net worth on a house. Its all a gamble. And you have to think realistically whether or not you can AFFORD losing all the value of it.
