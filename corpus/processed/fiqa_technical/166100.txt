> I hope you're not trying to become a lawyer. That field is way over saturated. No, but it was one of the better paying jobs offered when I was in school that at least claimed to work with student schedules. I don't have the cash for a top tier law school or even to afford to live near one, and even those who can find work from lower-tiered schools don't make enough to make it worth it. My goal is to work in some form of rehab or addiction treatment or trauma counseling (or possibly emergency medicine, if I decide I still need that pace and get tired of mostly talking). I was thinking about just getting my MSW but, since I'm already an EMT and probably going to be getting my CNA certification for a side job, now I'm leaning toward becoming a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner or possibly a Physician's Assistant. I was looking at PA first, but NP seems most flexible in terms of being able to keep working and doing school. If all else fails, I'll hop back into sales. I'm licensed for real estate & insurance and sold cars until I got into a wreck and had to take some time off. Good money there and I liked the challenge, but I have personal reasons for wanting to go into the other field.
