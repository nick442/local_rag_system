"[Netflix is targeting 50% in-house content ""within the next few years.""](http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-50-percent-content-original-programming-cfo-1201865902/) It says right now it is about 1/3 of the way there which - to me - works out to about 16.5%. So maybe ""rarely"" wasn't the right word, but a large majority of the content it streams is not in-house."
