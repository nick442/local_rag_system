"I don't work for the PO. but i'm a client. This issue is the last straw for me with what's happened to the US and A. Read the constitution people [**Article I, Section 8, Clause 7**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Clause) of the United States Constitution, known as the Postal Clause or the Postal Power, empowers Congress ""To establish Post Offices and post Roads"". I mean WTF? its in the goddam Constitution. its not some sort of half-assed law that was passed to test kids, or make pizza a fucking vegetable. The founding fathers put this in there on purpose. the post office has an awesome responsibility to provide a communication system for the *entire* country and overseas possessions. you can send a letter to Anchorage Alaska, Lubbock Texas, Shitsville California, Boondocks Maine or Guam. yes you can send a letter to goddamn Guam at 1st class rate (ZIP code range: 96910â€“96932 for no extra charge). The PO has got army's of trucks and personell that get the mail out pretty much all the time. yeah shit happens, weather, disasters, etc maybe you run into some asshole at the PO but hey. my mom tells me there's a dick in every crowd. I don't take it personal. IMHO Truth of the matter is that if we could provide healthcare like we provide mailing services, shit. this country would be 1st tier again. But does FedEx, UPS, DHL, etc? do that? do they have a facility in nearly every major population center? Does FedEx, UPS, DHL etc have offices that *they operate* in every town? hell no. They even use PO services for things that are not economically viable. The establishment of the Post Office enabled the nation to grow. Rural Free Delivery sparked Sears, Montgomery Ward etc an entire retail industry. The Rail Post which was way more efficient than trucking and was used as an organizational model for Ma Bell (that's right the exec who organized Ma Bell into a powerhouse was a former Railway Post Employee). The Republican Congress (and Blue-dog Democrats too) are killing this National Asset. The Post Office is essential to the basic components of our society. Its bullshit that electronic mail etc is making this form of communication obsolete. Much like the paperless office --paper is still needed. The Service needs to be capable and free to move with the market, not what some asshole Senator/Rep who's on the take from AEI or Grover Norquist etc. How would they be able to recruit new members anyway without their stupid solicitation *""junk""* mail? You can't delete a piece of junkmail with a click. you actually have to touch it. Why do you think business still make goddam catalogs. Victoria's secret must have an entire forest dedicated to theirs'. This is also a thinly veiled attack on Veterans. US veterans get preferential status when taking the postal exam, yes exam. That guy or gal behind the counter might just have taken a bullet for this pathetic excuse for a country. He or she was repaid by getting a few extra points so that he/she could potentially get a decent paying job with promotional potential, you know not be fucking homeless. WTF is wrong with that? Gee i think i know why the number of homeless veterans has increased in the past 10 years. You become a career post office employee by taking an exam. And what's wrong with being a Career Postal Employee? A Letter Carrier, A Postmaster? WTF do we look down upon these careers. My kids watch Sprout and PBS kids programs and guess who brings goddam birthday cards? It aint the goddam FedEx, UPS, or DHL man. These are careers and individuals that are pillars of our society. You meet people at the post office, you interact with other citizens, and the Post Office in your Town give your Town legitimacy! Its really sad. TL:DR **What Congress is allowing to happen to the Postal Service is a fucking crime!**"
