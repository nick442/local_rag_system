"Holy shit! Talk about pushing a ""narrative"". >We spend the most & get the overall worst outcomes of any industrialized nation. This is such a crock of shit. The US has had a monopoly on the greatest level of medical advancement and the highest level of skilled medical practitioners in the entire world. When the best and highest quality of care is needed people come to the United States to have it. Equally, the average American has had the most abundant and varied access to quality health services than any other nation for the last 50+ years. You are peddling in dishonesty in order to promote an end game of single payer. The VA failed to provide quality service. Medicare/Medicaid has failed to provide quality service. Every example ever of centralized bureaucracy getting involved in health care has resulted in a lower quality of service, rationing of service, and fewer options for patients. GTFO of here with this tired ass shit. >ACA's failures were bullshit put in by the GOP & collusion by insurance companies and Republican governors. It wasn't perfect, but it would have been a helluva lot closer if the GOP hadn't lied and colluded through the process. Yea I don't buy this polarized partisan bull shit. The insurance companies were part and parcel when Obama's white house was writing the ACA and they are part and parcel now as the Republicans stumble through the repeal effort. Take your ""Democratic"" talking points against the ""Republicans"" back to r/politics because I ain't fucking buying this partisan crap. >Source: I wrote the 20 year health plan for the Republican Governor of the State of Florida ten or so years ago and have lobbied & built facilities and other projects in healthcare Thanks for showing us your bias right out. Saves me a lot of time."
