"NO! They're the *victims* of that development. The music that gets sold today as ""the sound of the 60s/70s/80s"" is the lowest-common-denominator crap that was acceptable to commercial radio owners -- even the DJs hated it. ""Boomers"" had a whole other musical experience, esp. before the record companies yanked their advertising out of the widespread and rapidly growing underground press (effectively killing it) and dropped all the controversial acts in favor of material that could also be sold to television and Muzak. When young people today cite what they think of as 80s music -- never mind 60s and 70s -- it's completely alien to many of us, even though we certainly lived through those years. I don't know anybody who listens to that ""classic rock"" crap voluntarily, or ever did. Of course, there will always be fabricated nostalgia -- I'm sure that after a couple of decades of pervasive indoctrination, some people by now believe they always listened to ""classic rock"" and have forgotten what they actually listened to on vinyl. But don't blame everybody in an age group when it's really the same greedheads who profit by appropriating culture and fucking up everything. I need a big dose of Patti Smith right now."
