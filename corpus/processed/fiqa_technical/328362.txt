While I don't hate Walmart and I do believe in the labor market, it's important to note that Walmart's taxes aren't earmarked specifically for the welfare benefits of its employees; they support _every_ part of the huge, US government spending machine. It is fair to say, though, that if Walmart didn't pay their employees, then those employees would be sucking up even _more_ tax money in the form of welfare, costs of incarceration, and so on.
