"I am opposed to fracking it is a horrible idea. But as long as they only ruin thier piece of land I don't care. There are far better choices. But we subsidize and choose favorites with stolen ""tax"" money. If the govenment wasn't subsidizing it we would be leaving oil and gas behind to favor better products, like nuclear, solar and wind and whatever we havent thought of yet. But like I have been saying governments love to force people to do stupid shit. You like that about govenment though because you want them to force the stupid things you like instead of some other stupid idea."
