"You're not ""encouraging thought"", you're patronizing me and calling the ideology I have chosen ""anti-human"". What is there to debate if you already have decided that socialism is anti-human? The issue here is that you don't understand socialism, while I do understand laissez-faire capitalism and disregarded it as something I would stand for. There are plenty of ""objective conclusions"" drawn by Marx, but somehow I get the feeling you haven't actually read much of Marx since you probably feel that you already know what socialism is all about anyway. Let's just both save some time and skip debating this at all, because I'm not in the mood for more patronizing."
