Start with real analysis before you jump into stochastic calculus. The two books I have (Oksendal: Stochastic Differential Equations and Steele: Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications) both begin with formal algebraic set-theory definitions of probability spaces, random variables, functions, and stochastic processes. If you're not comfortable with that sort of language it's hard to gain traction in any further reading.
