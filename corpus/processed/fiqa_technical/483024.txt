As a non medical person, I think it would be difficult to look at a list of services, treatments, surgeries and drug costs and figure out, in advance, which providers I would go to. It would definitely be impossible if I were unexpectedly sick or injured. That's why it would be much easier to have a single payer system to negotiate all those prices. After all, we don't individually have to figure out the best private company from which to buy fire department or police services, or roads, and it seems to work out ok and there isn't any middleman to drive up prices.
