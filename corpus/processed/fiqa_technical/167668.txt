"I worked one summer at WalMart. The company song was a complete shock to me and I found it to be one of the creepiest things ever devised. (there are ""moves"" that go along with the song/chant). Some people actually seemed to be into it. The song was just the beginning of the meeting though, where they would discuss how much revenue/profit the store made in the previous day (or week maybe I don't remember). All I could think about was a) at least I don't actually have to do any work while I'm over here b) why to hell do I care what this fucking dump made yesterday? I'm making minimum wage and I'll be making minimum wage tomorrow."
