>Hourly rates aside Really? The guy who defines success by the $ they make doesn't want to compare hourly rates? Ok, let's compare standard of living. My buddy lives in Thailand at the moment. He travels around but has been there about 6 months. He has a passive income of $55k derived from rental units here in the US, his blog, and online business. He works about 5 hours a week. He rents a beach house for $450/month and his expenses are about $20/day to live quite well eating out every meal, working out, etc. That $55k is about 15x the local median wage. Your $500k in the US is about 10x the average wage in the US and if you live in an expensive city like NYC, DC, or SF then it's much less. You work 80 hours a week and he works 5 and has a higher relative standard of living. Who is more succesful? >I'd rather have the half mill annually I'm sorry you never learned that we should work to live, not live to work. Its truly sad.
