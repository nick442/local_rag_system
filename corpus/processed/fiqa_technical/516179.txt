it is always fun to giggle at situations like these, and i have seen several myself with elderly lawyers, but really.. what does a Navy Admiral need with eMail when they have staff? you can carry that piece of paper with you, scribble notes on it, wave it around in a subordinate's face for dramatic effect, &tc &tc. i kinda don't like the idea of an Admiral checking their gmail while trying to run one of those ships. the fact that they don't know is pretty hilarious, however that knowledge doesn't - i wouldn't think - effect their performance on the job.
