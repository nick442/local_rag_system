"You know what helped me? Asking this question: ""What happens if this fails utterly and miserably?"" When you really assess that question,and answer it honestly and rationally, you will probably find that you stand to lose very little in the grand scheme. Some cash. Some time. But there will be more of both. And if you've got the cajones to pursue your own business now, you'll have still have them if your first attempt goes bottom-up. The best thing about this exercise is that it forces you to realize that you aren't ever going to be homeless, barring some mental breakdown and/or crippling addiction."
