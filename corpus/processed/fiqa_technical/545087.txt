Let's say I buy eggs from a farmer. That farmer gives the money I paid him to a dentist. The dentist buys a new car. I work at the car factory and buy some eggs from the farmer. The money is running around, everyone who uses it gets something he needs, everyone who gets money supplies something to someone. I got an omelette, the farmer got his teeth fixed, the dentist has a new car. People got things they wanted from the money circulation. Now imagine I have to pay taxes. I will not get the eggs I want to buy. The farmer will not get his teeth fixed. The dentist will not get a new car. I will lose my job because there is no one to buy a car from me. The public sector worker who got paid with the tax money will have money to buy a car, but he won't have a car to buy, because I'm not making cars anymore. I'm not making cars because the dentist is not buying cars, he's not buying cars because the farmer is not hiring the dentist because I'm not buying his eggs. The chain works because everyone gets something useful from his suppliers and provides something useful to his clients. When the public sector comes in, there will be a lot of people in between who consume resources yet do not provide anything useful in return. Pay someone to dig a hole, pay someone else to fill the hole. You have money circulating, but nothing useful is being generated. That's what taxes mean, they are a way to get people to pay for things they wouldn't pay volutarily. Taxes make people pay for things they don't really want or need. Taxes make money disappear from the economy.
