"On the bright side, I love your username.. unfortunately, I'm at odds with just about everything else in your post. > Many of the people who under-estimate TV do not realize the amount of money, talent, research, staff and infrastructure needed to produce top-level high-quality shows and programming. >It is easy to stream a TV show or movie AFTER it's been already produced and broadcast, but do you really think the internet will give us a Mad Men, LOST, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones? I highly doubt it, and that's a big reason why TV is here to stay. These production costs do not have to be incurred by traditional TV companies. Anyone with comparable revenue streams can concievably hire talent and produce content, regardless of how it is distributed. >What makes Netflix/Hulu any more right than a Viacom or Comcast? You seem to think a future of Netflix and iTunes is utopia, when in reality it would be an oppressive dystopian closed system with NO competition. At least with TV and Cable, you have networks actively competing with each other- they are literally tripping over themselves working as hard as they can to PLEASE you- the audience. I don't think the argument is that Netflix/iTunes is utopia, and have never heard anyone claim that (here or elsewhere). The internet makes for far **more** competition for content, as anyone with a youtube account can reach millions of viewers. Instead of paying for access to specific channels, the user gains access to **all** content on the internet - created by dedicated content providers, as well as all other users, all competing for viewers. >You talk about how a future without TV is a good thing, but you fail to realize that it would actually be a bad thing for American culture. .. ? >People seem to think that sitting in front of the 20inch computer monitors at a table for one is preferable to a 50 inch LCD screen with dolby surround in the den. I am not surprised because the internet is comprised of people who mainly dwell on the internet, where people who watch TV are probably watching TV right now. While people may 'seem to think' this, anyone who does think this doesn't know much about the technology they're using. You can access the internet on many devices with almost any imaginable screens size (including mobile devices, 20"" monitors and the 50"" LCD in your den) a number of different ways. >On top of that, many people would lose their jobs. Just because Apple or Netflix can distribute shows and movies cheap does not mean that many thousands of people should lose their jobs . In a capitalist economy (or to remain competitive globally), this is almost exactly what it means. Are you suggesting we hire miners to dig through mountains because dynamite steals jobs ? >(especially if the majority of America still prefers to watch programming on their TV's and not locked in their room on a small computer screen with the tinny-sounding computer speakers). Already explained this one to you. Not an issue. >This is one of the reasons why we're having an unemployment problem, because these jobs are disappearing by the cold mechanical algorithms of a computer program. Think of the many thousands of jobs that have been lost in the music industry, don't you think college kids would have loved to start their careers at a record label promoting music and encouraging growth? Instead we have MP3's and instant gratification, music is arguably dead (read: 90's music). Another misconception you seem to have of why jobs exist, or should exist. People wanting a certain job is not a reason for the job to exist. >And if we think a future without TV is utopia, then I have some bad news for you, it isn't. TV is American, we do it best and we should NOT be turning our backs on it. Once we do that, we lose our culture. If American culture is solely based on outdated distribution technology, then the loss is no great one. >Who do you think will own the internet in 50 years? I can tell you it won't be the US of A. Think very carefully and be careful what you wish for.. Own the internet ? I don't care about the nationality of the owners, but I can assure you that no single entity will 'own the internet'. I really think you misunderstand the fundamental ideas behind the debate. Your biggest argument is that people prefer to watch their programming on traditional, large TVs.. many different technologies exist to enjoy the internet on this same piece of hardware. You have not made a single compelling argument here, but I felt I should break it down point by point, because you do seem interested in thinking critically about the topic, just slightly misinformed.
