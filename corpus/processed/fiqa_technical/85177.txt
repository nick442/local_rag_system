"You have a very short memory and don't realize that Amazon is not different from any past retailers. Do you remember that once there were mom-and-pops stores for each and any kind of goods? Department stores came and killed most of those stores. Supermarkets came (after the shopping cart was invented by Mr. Goldman) and killed most groceries. Wal-Mart, Target, Kmart, etc came and killed many department stores and remaining stores in more remote areas. Sears catalog and JCPenney catalog killed even more remote stores than Wal-Mart did. CVS, Walgreen, Rite Aid, etc came and killed all the pharmacies. No more pharmacies. Chains that sell electronics (e.g. Circuit City) killed all the ""electric"" stores, fashion chains (e.g. GAP) killed all the boutique clothing stores, etc. Franchises killed almost all independent restaurants (McDonald, Cracker Barrel, etc) Costco and Price Club came and killed many supermarkets. Do you get it now? Amazon is just one step in the cycle. 10 years from now, 3D printers will kill most furniture stores and home goods stores. Amazon will have to fight against ""We print what you need when you need it"" versus their old module ""we ship ready made items we stock in warehouses and put in boxes""."
