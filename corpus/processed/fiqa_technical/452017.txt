Some times you need to go through a stage of suffering before we see the long term benefit. Ideally these beautiful animals shouldn't ever had been bred for a life in captivity. I'm not completely innocent. I've visited zoos in my life, but only those where the animals live a good life, have plenty of open space and are not distressed in any way. The problem that SeaWorld have is that these animals are so large it would be next to impossible to build a tank that resembles anything close to what they would experience in the wild. I'm not sure if these animals can be released into the wild now and would presume they lack the many skills needed to survive; but what one can hope for is for their breeding program to come to an end if customer numbers continue to dwindle.
