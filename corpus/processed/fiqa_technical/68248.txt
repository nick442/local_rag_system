"I don't know if it counts as a formal answer, but Dale Carnegie has always preached that income is related to how well you treat and get along with other people. His observation is that the highest paid people are those with the best people skills, because the ability to manage other people has higher value than singular ability. Conversely, people making minimum wage often work ""harder"" than people making more money. The old saw about ""work smart, not hard"" is a bit trite. In many fields, efficiency is valued over ""hard work""."
