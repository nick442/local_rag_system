The desire to be debt free is smart; but I think the purpose of a large group is motivation and peer pressure. Getting out of debt faster isn't going to work mathmatically. (I can't reason a scenario where the group's collective power doesn't favor one individual in the group over another.) All of the following conditions must be met: If any single thing fails, or if anybody changes their mind about how they feel about paying another person's debt, this plan will breakdown quickly and get very ugly. Please notice most of those items are emotions, which cannot be planned nor controlled. Bottom line: Don't do it. The risks are too high compared to the average reward. If your family could pull it off, a better plan would be to sell a reality show about the magical family who never fights and always puts the good of the others before themselves. Everybody do a debt snowball individually but have an email group, weekly group call, regular family meeting, group chat session or dinner event where you encourage each other, talk about the success, failures and openly discuss everybody's situation. This is called a support group and they can be more effective than doing it on your own. Go around the table and This will require humility, patience and grace from the participating family. It will rely on similar peer pressure to succeed as a single group, without all of the very real pitfalls and very real consequences of a individual failing in a big group.
