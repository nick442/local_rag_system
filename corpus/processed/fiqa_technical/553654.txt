After working my way up the corporate ladder I learned one thing. Anyone above you is an idiot and anyone below you thinks you're an idiot. It's that simple. Everyone thinks they could do it better. You promote them and suddenly the understand that you really can't just do whatever you want. It's easy to say what you would do, but it's another thing to get in a place of power and realize you have no control to change anything.
