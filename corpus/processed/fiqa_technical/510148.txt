"Same in childcare, but people are more willing to pay and the work isn't as hard. So it kind of works out. I do tutoring on the side and my officemate suggested I get into at home childcare because ""My daycare lady makes BANK! It's so expensive!!!"" then I broke down for her how inexpensive those prices really are. She was shocked and agreed that it's actually a quite low paying gig. People don't think critically about what they're getting for the money- they just see a huge check written weekly."
