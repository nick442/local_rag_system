"Yes! It all starts with the family unit and an emphasis on education. One common trait I see in both rural white ""redneck"" communities and urban black ""ghetto"" communities is a propensity towards anti-intellectualism. In both of those communities, studying, schoolwork, and getting good grades is kind of looked down upon or ridiculed. The community seems to view this as the student thinking he/she is ""better"" than they are. Being from a small town in Georgia, I saw more of the redneck side of it. Fortunately, I was in a family that emphasized education. That is the reason I'm where I'm at today."
