This article is correct, but it's focused on just one issue with IBM which is the tip of an iceberg. IBM has taken its office work policy too far, especially in light of all of its recent office closures. The company has driven out its most senior skilled labor while limiting its recruiting to a very narrow set of remaining offices, located exclusively in the most competitive hiring environments. And no, IBM does not have cash on hand to BOTH pay new recruits premium salaries AND continue supporting their massive product portfolio - in fact, all hiring is presently frozen for lack of stable finances. Don't be surprised as it continues to tank after it fails to meet contract obligations due to a lack of skilled resources.
