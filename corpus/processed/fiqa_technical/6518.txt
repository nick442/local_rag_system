A company would diversify in their investment activities. When a company begins acquiring other companies in vastly different industries, that is grounds for steering toward being a conglomerate. Amazon is not there yet bc the whole foods deal can mesh with their food e-commerce agenda, but Facebook and Google are def grounds at this point. And I 100% agree with you that tech is tightening, but also with crazy valuations. You are what the market says you are but some of these valuations are a little questionable AKA Snapchat lol
