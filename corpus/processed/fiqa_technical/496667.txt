I used Pidgin instead of AIM on Windows and Linux, so they weren't even showing me ads on the contact window. The last time I really used AIM was my Verizon Motorola e815 flip phone. I was somehow able to send aim messages that did not count as text messages or data. It made no sense. There were also no ads in the app.
