"I did read your comment, and all the other ones that referred to me as ""he."" Believe it or not, the melodrama you see is imagined. I didn't write, for example, ""This stupid fucker doesn't realize I've got a vagina."" And I wasn't arguing with your anecdote, I was supporting it for the other people reading. That's why I said ""you (not OP)."""
