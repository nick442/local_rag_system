"Pros for WHOM? Cons for WHOM? Whether the Federal Reserve is good or not really depends on WHO you are (i.e. where in the ""inflate/debase the money supply"" you are positioned, and how that affects your position in the debt/asset game). Because the impacts of just about everything the Fed (or any central bank or government/cartel manipulated ""fiat"" money supply) does.. affect you significantly different depending on where you are in regards to those things."
