Whole Foods' quality standards are not as strict as you think. Their products tend not to contain certain ingredients, but I think you should read the ingredient labels further the next time you take a visit. As someone who is incredibly specific with my food preferences and admittedly snobbish about ingredients, WF has a lot of crap honestly. And FWIW, Costco and the like sell many of the same brands that WF does, but at cheaper per unit prices.
