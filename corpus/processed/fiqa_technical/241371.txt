It's not like most of the people working there will care if Obama loses his job. The chief position of a government agency, who is selected by POTUS, often isn't a person liked by the rest of the agency and they couldn't care less if he was changed in 2013. For example in the CIA the Director was always chosen by the President, and thusly the rest of the CIA usually don't fully respect them since they are just some random person from outside the Agency who was put into power for political reasons. They don't like the Director and likewise don't care if POTUS changes and the Director gets fired by the new guy. My point is that entire government agencies are not lying and cheating just to keep Obama in office. Just because the Director was appointed by Obama doesn't mean the entire organization will lie to help Obama. I mean what if Romney gets elected? Will the entire agency and it's hundreds/thousands of employees now immediately do a 180 and lie and cheat to keep Romney in power? The same workers that were doing illegal things to help Obama and now going to on a whim break laws to help Romney? These agencies are not machines, they are made of hundreds of real people, each with their own polical views. Just because Obama chose the Director doesn't mean all those people are now his slaves willing to lie and cheat to help him. What's to stop one of them from leaking the story to the media? I would think there has to be at least one Republican working there. If the Director told everyone that this quarter they were all going to lie to help Obama stay in power, pretty sure any Republicans in the agency would leak that to the media. If that story got out Obama would be impeached. No way the entire agency would go forward with a lie to help Obama.
