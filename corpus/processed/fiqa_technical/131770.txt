"LOL!! Oh Jesus.. the FBI (yes, the FBI) thinks that Hillary mishandled top security e-mail(s) but ""there was no intent behind her actions, so she will not go to jail"" (but a sailor who took a picture of a ship and never even shared it is in jail for 10 years). The FBI is part of the political system. Trump will change that. **Any, I asked you to use COMMON SENSE, and not what you are told by the FBI and the fake media. Do you think the Russian could possibly rig the election for Trump from July until November?** Or, is it a simple case of Americans hating Hillary and the DNC for their corruption, incompetence, crimes, cheating, killing, mishandling, etc?"
