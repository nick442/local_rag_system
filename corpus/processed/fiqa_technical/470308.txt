>What SoftBank seemed to do was lower prices in Japan and offer better service. While I admire your rose-tinted optimism, I really think you ought to ask someone actually living in Japan, and a former Softbank customer to boot, what the truth is. *Former* in the sense that I quit their service around iPhone 3G time, and will never go back to them. The only reason they're even a player in Japan is because they took the iPhone before the other two networks, and if you wanted Apple's beast, they were the only choice. They are still the only provider with the iPad, and despite wanting one for a while, I refuse to buy one until it's available on another network. A few choice items from their track record: * Their network has consistently been the slowest of the 3 main Japanese networks with the worst coverage (this is partly not their fault because when they bought Vodafone, it was already a shitty service) but they've had a few years to sort things out now, and they're still behind the bigger networks in most areas. * They ran Yahoo! BB (Japan's largest ISP) famous for outrageous hard selling, shitty customer service and just about the slowest broadband speeds in the country for a major provider due to massively overselling their capacity. They also had a bizarre and stubborn preference for ADSL when everyone else was selling optical fiber. * They also run Yahoo! Japan, which while pretty much the biggest website in the country (Yahoo! is still huge here) has ridiculously inflated fees for stuff like auctions and other services (we have no eBay). So they're not averse to profiteering when the opportunity presents itself. If Japan is anything to go by, I wouldn't hold your breath. Combining a third-rate Japanese operator with a third-rate US one isn't the recipe for success.
