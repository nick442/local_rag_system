The 70B would be their regulatory & class action liabilities and penalties. Sometimes it depends on the size of the company or the breach, other times it will be fixed fines and assessed fines based on a framework/standard. Firstly they will pay a smaller amount because of their insurance retention/deductible, then insurance will pay they amount they are covered for, then Equifax will be liable for the remainder. It will decimate their bottom line I imagine. Edit: the biggest cyber insurance stack I know of is $500M and I don't think Equifax took part in that
