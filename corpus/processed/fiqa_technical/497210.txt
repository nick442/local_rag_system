Well put. In all the hysteria there is hope. Scientific advances like contraception and modern farming have changed the resource equation. Investing in science and understanding of these problems, including how the monetary system works, will continue to help. Government investing (i.e spending) on technology may be the best way out of the problems OP mentioned. Bubbles will always happen. But overall we are living in one of the most stable-peaceful times in human history.
