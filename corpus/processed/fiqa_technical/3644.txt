You have to remember that Costco only builds in richer areas too. I live near the Quad Cities (Davenport, Iowa is the biggest of those cities) and we are just getting our first Costco (not sure if they have even broken ground yet). And it is closest to Bettendorf, the richest city in the area. There are no Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, etc in the area. As of now, there is one Trader Joe's in Iowa, in Des Moines, with another going up in Iowa City. Any chain that can be that selective about locating themselves in the richest neighborhoods will almost always be able to afford to pay more, unlike Walmart which is everywhere.
