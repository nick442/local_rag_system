"The problem you are referring to has to do with the different financial terms between retailers. Amazon wants better terms all the time, that favor Amazon, so we give them better terms and bake those terms into cost. Walmart historically has had better terms that favor suppliers, to be an EDLP retailer you had to get suppliers on board with EDLC, to do this it meant simpler terms.. I know one company who has ""similar"" items on both sites, the supplier's internal margins at/and amazon's margins are much higher. They make less margin at Walmart and Walmart takes less margin, but volume makes up for that! Source: Supplier to both"
