"This popped up on /r/health recently. One thing that I'd point out: the assertions that you'll suffer just as much from slow diets as crash ones are speculative; toward the end of the article, it notes that ""Proietto is now conducting a study using a slower weight-loss method and following dieters for three years instead of one."" Obviously, n=1, but it doesn't jibe with my experience. I got fat. Didn't like it. I started eating a diet where I would lose weight slowly and exercising a little more. Now I'm not fat. I eat a quantity of food pretty much commensurate with my caloric expenditure, I don't spend my days starving and thinking constantly about food, and enjoy exercising regularly. This effect if it exists is definitely not universal."
