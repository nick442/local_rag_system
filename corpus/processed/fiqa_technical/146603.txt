Your tenant made a mistake. You deal with this exactly as you would deal with a delinquent tenant, which is a hard and sticky question that involves you, your lease, your relationship with the tenant, your priorities, your values, local laws, your estimation of tenant's honest and creditworthiness, and so forth. It's not an easy question. It just falls under the question of how to deal with delinquency that happens to involve the circumstance of allegedly paying cash and having it stolen, which is a hard question.
