Emergency fund first. Period. The interest you pay on the HELOC until you have the emergency savings fund is like buying insurance. It's an expense you incur until you can afford to bear the risk yourself (here the risk is of a personal liquidity crisis). When you have enough in your emergency fund to be comfortable, start using whatever amount you were putting into savings to pay down the HELOC. Alex B is right that paying off the HELOC is a guaranteed return, but your emergency fund is not an investment -- it's your safety net.
