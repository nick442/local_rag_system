The example you give would clearly be illegal, and so unenforceable in court. If a contract contains a clause which is deemed legal but so unreasonable (completely unfair) it is unenforceable by the court, then the court can replace that cause with a more reasonable clause. I think it would be a fairly expensive (and likely losing) argument to convince a court that this particular contract was unfair, but if you did it would probably mean only a change in the penalty clause to make it 'reasonable'.
