"**Vice Media** Vice Media LLC is a North American digital media and broadcasting company. Originating from the Montreal-based VICE magazine co-founded by Suroosh Alvi, Shane Smith, and Gavin McInnes (who departed the company in 2008), VICE expanded primarily into youth and young adult-focused digital media, including online content verticals and related web series, the news division VICE News, a film production studio, and a record label among other properties. In 2015 VICE Media was called ""[arguably] a poster child for new-media success—especially when it comes to attracting a valuable millennial audience."" In February 2016, VICE Media launched a cable television network in Canada and the United States known as Viceland—a millennial-targeted network which draws upon the resources of the lifestyle-oriented verticals of VICE. The Viceland TV channel currently operates in many international territories, with plans to expand to a total of 44 by the end of 2017. VICE Media broadcasts two news programs on HBO. VICE News Tonight, which premiered October 10, 2016, showcases a nightly roundup of global news, technology, the environment, economics, and pop culture while eschewing traditional news anchors. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/business/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.23"
