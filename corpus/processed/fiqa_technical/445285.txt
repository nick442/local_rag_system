If *everyone* earned enough credits during the summer so they don't have to pay for their energy use in the winter then who is paying the people to produce the energy in the winter? It's mathematically impossible for net metering (crediting people at the same rate they are debited for each unit of energy) to work when everyone is on it. That's why a reduced credit (the same rate wholesale energy producers receive for their energy) is inevitable.
