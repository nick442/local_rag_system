We cannot count on a repeat of Ford's action (especially if it was of necessity, but even if it was altruistic). How many years -- months? -- before we start to see the impact of automation on the large scale? Transportation alone is going to be massive, and the transition is no longer among the advancements that are perpetually '15-20 years' out. It's on a clock now. Maybe that will be enough to force our hand in redefining elements of our economic system. However, if not, there will be no Ford-style necessity to raise wages. Workers will be bent over a barrel, taking literally anything from employers, just so they can feed their families. No offense to /u/proudoppressor, but he's completely mistaken if he thinks supply side economics has done anything but provided evidence that such a system is a vacuum of wealth. More people may have jobs in this momentary snapshot, but those jobs are paying far less. More people are working because it now takes two incomes to keep a family afloat. And we're about to remove the ability of those people to find work. Transportation is just one sector due for automation. Add finance. Add fast food and other minimum wage work.. I'm not a socialist. I'm wary of how much power might be consolidated into the hands of a few. But then I have to ask.. how is that any different than the path we're on now? We're consolidating wealth and power into an oligarchical class, leaving what scraps for the common joe? I'm not advocating radical solutions. I'm asking anyone who reads this to process it. Look at what it means, and look at creating some kind of foundation for when the bottom falls out.
