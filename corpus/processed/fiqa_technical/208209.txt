"I worked on a competing app a few yeas back. The primary use case isn't high-rollers wanting to save some money by selling off unused seats, it's the charter company wanting to recoup costs on completely empty planes. If they fly someone from NYC to Seattle and that person isn't returning to NYC for a week, they aren't just going to leave the plane there for the duration. So they need to reroute the plane to the next pickup pointâ€”and usually, they're doing that with no one on the plane, which is a ""dead leg"" in industry parlance. The selection is pretty limited (compared to commercial airlines), and due to FAA regulations, they have limits on how far in advance they can advertise, so it's limited to basically 24 hours notice. You'll almost never be able to use any of these services to fly both ways on a trip. All the existing services I'm aware of also require chartering the entire plane, not just getting a seat, which leaves you to try to find a large group of people to share the cost."
