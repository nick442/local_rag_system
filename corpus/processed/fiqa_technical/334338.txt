It's because I can go on the internet and find free porn that will satisfy me for the 5-10 minutes that I need. The quality may not be great, but who *wants* to spend money on porn? That's like admitting to your friends the only way you can get laid is by prostitutes, except here you're not even getting laid. I would say there's anecdotal evidence based on personal experience that it's less about the actual cost of porn, but more about the psychological part of having to purchase a video to jerk off to.
