"That's because Ford - like many other managers of large defined benefit plans - decided that, instead of defeasing its obligations through an [effective immunization program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization_%28finance%29), they would just put less money into equities and pray for the equity risk premium to carry the day for them. Lo and behold, it didn't work for a lot of them. In the meantime, their liabilities began to far outstrip the assets meant to offset them to the point where even a one-for-one asset-liability match wouldn't help. So now guess what? They tell you ""shit, we fucked this up, so here's your payout - good luck."" As if the worker is going to have a clue as to how to effectively manage his money so as to minimize longevity and savings risk. Let me make something clear: It is not beyond the means of modern finance to effectively implement and administer a defined benefit program. It involves ""doing the right thing"" by employees, which in some cases involves not taking risks with equity and instead simply ensuring that assets meant to offset liabilities are appropriate in both timing and magnitude."
