">Truthfully, I don't see a way out of this that doesn't involve economic upheaval on a scale that would make 2008 look like boom times. Economic ""upheaval"" could also be considered economic ""re-formation"" and ""re-organization"". The danger lies in the *political* sphere -- that the problems inherent in any such even will create a ""mob"" that makes demands which inevitably result in ""strong-man"" rule (i.e. a full blown ""dictator""). Americans delude themselves that we have never had this in the past, when in fact we have, several times (most notably FDR) -- we just retained the ""forms"" of a democracy, and the euphemistic labels of a ""republic"" -- and then we got VERY lucky that the dictator died when he did, and power transitioned to someone who was a token/place-holder, and NOT party to his grand scheme, and so ""unwound"" the whole thing. IOW, we may be headed over a *proverbial* ""cliff"", but that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be an apocalyptic affair, just that it will be tough to weather and get through (though the ""agile"" will still manage, and there IS potential ""hope"" for the other side, however minimal)."
