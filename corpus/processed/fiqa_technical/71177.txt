1) Yes, there are. Advances in materials or aerodynamics reduce fuel consumption thereby reducing carbon emissions. 2) There is plenty of evidence that businesses act to reduce costs. Any important question is how they measure carbon emissions. Are the emissions charges reduced with more efficient aircraft? Airlines may find ways to reduce the charges in ways that don't necessarily help the environment.
