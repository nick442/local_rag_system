Starbucks has litigation in place to end this since the TSA is cutting into their handjob market. Depending on how SCOTUS rules on Obamacare, they could either argue for a government mandated handjob that they can contract out or that the government can't force handjobs, therefore they have to leave it to handjob enterprises. The details get fuzzy around whether customers will have a claim for reimbursement if they argue that they don't have time or a handjob right now and miss their plane.
