My wife's uncle is a high quality Italian chef and constantly gets shat on for not having large enough portions. His restaurant serves lamb and veal and generally good entrees. People keep coming in expecting olive garden portions. That's not the kind of place he tries to be. He smokes his own duck for his pasta dish. It's funny how people value a $2 bag of pasta for $17.
