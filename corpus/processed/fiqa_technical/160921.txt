Frankly, I think all the higher maths in finance is mental masturbation. EDIT: wht all the down votes? I've made my money by trading against the PhDs in European investment banks who actually and innocently believe their models represent the real world. Their models work when they work. I love trading against the combination of arrogance and faux intellectualism. Folks, read Fooled by Randomness or Black Swan.
