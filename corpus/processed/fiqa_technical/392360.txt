"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://angrybearblog.com/2014/09/why-the-rich-hate-inflation-because-theyre-creditors.html) reduced by 78%. (I'm a bot) ***** > So given an outstanding stock of trillions of dollars in fixed-interest loans/bonds, an extra point of inflation should transfer tens of or hundreds of billions of dollars a year in real buying power from creditors to debtors. > While the 20% certainly have debts, they owe them mostly to themselves as bank shareholders, so The-20%-As-Debtors don&#039;t benefit from the cheaper payback caused by inflation; it&#039;s a wash. > It&#039;s roughly 3% of the 20%ers annual income from capital,* and only $6,000 a year for each of the 20 million households in the top 20%. But you can be quite sure that that number is at least one order of magnitude larger for households in the top 1,.1, or.01%. If the top 1,000 or 10,000 households perceive themselves as losing, say, $600,000 a year in real buying power for each point of inflation, are you curious why they hate inflation? ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6j48pa/why_the_rich_hate_inflation_because_theyre/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~151146 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **Inflation**^#1 **bank**^#2 **year**^#3 **million**^#4 **20%er**^#5"
