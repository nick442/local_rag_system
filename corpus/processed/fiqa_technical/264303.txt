Not my argument at all - corporate profits are down and wages are either stagnant or down (one of the hardest things to measure because it doesnt measure fringe benefits pension etc) -- my problem with that statement is that if companies just pay their employees more it will 'create' demand, it simply does not. If companies pay their employees more for the same amount of output it will just drive up the cost of goods leaving us with the same shitty demand.
