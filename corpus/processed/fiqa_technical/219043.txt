If I appear to be attacking you, I apologize up front because that's not my intent. * Windows phone has a market share of 2.5% and it's falling. Their market share is more closely compared with Blackberry than with Android or iOS. In addition, they are really only releasing low end phones and there are no known high end phones scheduled. * Office may be better but Blackberry was leading edge and 10 years later, they're pretty much gone. As a developer who has worked with Office products since Office 4.3 back in the 90's, there are just too many components that are clearly 10-15 years old that have not been updated. From data importing to VBA, there is just too much in there that they're just milking for as long as they can. I would add that when they introduced the Office subscription service in 2012, they told users that it was better to buy the subscription instead of buying the software outright because they would be constantly providing functional improvements like Google docs. That simply hasn't happened as there has been nothing but bug fixes for two years. * Azure may have a nice console (it's from 2011) but I'm here to tell you that working with Azure can be downright painful compared to AWS. Whether it's the firewall between two servers, SQL Azure data synch (in beta for 1.5 years and counting..seriously MS, what the f are you doing with that anyway?) to paid support (if you think Comcast ignores you, you aint seen nothing yet), they clearly are working in silos and not listening to their customers. * As for Windows 8, by their own admission, it's been a disaster and has really harmed their brand. 8.1 has brought back some much needed functionality but they need to make Windows 9 a winner, release it immediately and get everyone on it asap.
