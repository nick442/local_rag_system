"I say this with all due understanding: If they're only there for the money, if that's what motivates them, I don't want them in the government. We are better off without them. Really. Maybe I confused things by saying bubble because it isn't just that, but I don't want the attitude that because one is educated or powerful one is deserving of better. I understand that you might not be saying that, and you might be saying ""let's use them well"", but alas this is too subtle a line and too easy to slip. If big dollars hinge on a particular situation being optimized, let a manager make a case-by-case exception, but the norm is not that. And, by transitivity, the mindset leads to a creeping overall theory that government needs to insulate itself from its own effects. It's presumably why Congress gets its own health care, because these people are too important to be sick. But then in having done that, we reduce the pressure to make it work for everyone. I'm sorry, I just don't agree. It's a legitimate position you stake out, clearly presented, I am just not buying it."
