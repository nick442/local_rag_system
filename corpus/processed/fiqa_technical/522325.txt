Agriculture is a great sector to get into right now. The average farmer in US and Canada are at or near retirement age (well past 60). And because most farmers are old, the sector really hasn't changed much. They're proud to say that what they do is passed down for generations. The sector is ready for new blood and ripe for a revolution to increase productivity. All that is missing is the capital needed.
