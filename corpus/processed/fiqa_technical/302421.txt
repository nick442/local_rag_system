I've done it 5 or 6 times. I'm talking when the position drops by 10-15% in a matter of days and the vix spikes. My rationale is that the VIX cannot remain at 80+ levels for weeks. It always reverts back to a calmer level and XIV gains back its losses. I'm not betting the house, just putting money on something that has always rewarded me.
