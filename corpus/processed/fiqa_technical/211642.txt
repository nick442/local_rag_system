By in combination with fiat I mean we will continue to use sterling or dollars in society along with Bitcoin perhaps for online purchases exclusively, as an example. Many people here advocate for a society that would only use cryptocurrency as money. Cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin, is unlike fiat currency firstly because it is not backed by a government, it's in the ether so to speak, it proves its own value intrinsically. No central authority decides on the actions to take in regard to the currency. Other characteristics that separate Bitcoin from fiat are its inability to be inflated, it's finite nature, there will only ever be x amount of bitcoins - it is deflationary by nature of the algorithm. Central authorities can devalue their fiat currency through financial instruments like inflation and controlling the production (quantitative easing). This isn't true of all crypto currencies like dogecoin and maybe ETH
