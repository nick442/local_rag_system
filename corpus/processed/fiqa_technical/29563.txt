Wesley gave a great answer and a follow up comment. Heed his advice. If you cannot make ends meet by working two jobs, either you are working very few hours or you have a spending problem. I feel it is more of a spending problem as you should have been able to complete your program and stay within the FAFSA limit. This is a tough situation of your own making. If you are at UNC and an engineering student, you have a good mind. You should use it to find a solution. Then learn the lessons and do not make those decisions again. While many people in authority told you that it was a good idea to go to school on student loans one of the paramount lessons to learn is that sometimes those people give bad advice. In your case that is exactly what happened.
