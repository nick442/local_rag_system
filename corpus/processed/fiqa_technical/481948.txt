They were killing it for a while. And I feel like using Est√©e Lauder's guidance as a metric was kinda shit since no one really buys their stuff anymore except old people. But it's really making a massive impact of people's perceptions. Been kinda stuck where it is now so I'm tempted to wait for the next earnings report. But that's either gonna make me look like a genius or a fool. So it's a tough call. I do know I'm down 20ish percent so it's a shit place to sell but hey it's better than 30-40%. *shrug*
