Huge gamer. But it isn't linked to gaming at all. It is linked to the issue of broadband in the U.S. Your water and Electricity are so cheap because those industries have been tightly regulated into very fixed rolls. Your Internet Service and Wireless are so expensive because they have not been. Now think how easy your water and electricity is to use, do the companies dictate what containers you can use to collect water? Where you can store the water? Etc? Does the electric company tell you what type, for how long, and how many devices you can plug in to the service you pay for? no they don't outside of some regulations put in place for standardization and safety they are not allowed to dictate what you do with the service you pay for. This is the direct opposite of what ISP, Cable, and wireless providers do.
