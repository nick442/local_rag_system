Thank you for letting me know because I didn't realize that it's been covered in this sub before. Not everyone is a seasoned veteran of the sub so I had no idea. I'm not sure what's wrong with posting a non-paywall link for those who don't have access to WSJ. I wasn't trying to shit on anyone or make some kind of statement or anything. I was just offering up what I found because I think WSJ is a total ripoff and I refuse to pay for their site. No big deal. Anyway, sorry my post from 8 days ago annoyed you.
