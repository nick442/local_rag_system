There are ways to avoid having federal income taxes withheld: In order to avoid withholding altogether, you’ll have to fall into both of the following categories: you have no tax liability this year and you had no tax liability in the previous tax season, so all of the federal income tax you paid was given back to you. Generally, you can say you have no tax liability when you’re not required to file an income tax return or you owe zero taxes. You may also be able to claim an exemption if your earned income for the year is extremely low ($1,050 or less). If those conditions apply to you, you can write “exempt” in line 7. Keep in mind that the exemption only eliminates your federal income taxes, not your Medicare or Social Security. If your parents use an accountant to prepare their taxes, I'm sure he/she would be able to give you a solid answer on how to fill it out.
