>So what you're saying is if the janitor got a degree in a lesser paying field, he should be entitled to that 100k as a janitor. Ok. Nope. I did not say that. How you got that from what I said is beyond understanding. Perhaps you should really learn basic logic. Or you are just a fucking asshole who repeatedly ignores what has been said and pretends something else was said. Again because your small brain cannot comprehend this a janitor is not entitled to a better pay because special skills are not required to do his job and anyone can do it. Doesn't matter how many degrees the janitor has if he is not using those skills. >Just because you went to college doesn't mean your job takes more skill, or is harder. True. Finally you made a true statement. Here would you like a gold star and a sticker? Sadly for you noone has said that just because you went to college your job requires more skills or is harder. Alas the janitor job requires neither skill nor knowledge and is therefore going to remain a lower class job that is badly paid (compared to the area's cost of living). >My ex also has a brother who didn't go to college and got a bomb ass job at EA games as a programmer. I guess he deserves minimum wage. You are beyond retarded. There are other ways to get skills besides college. Your ex's brother acquired them, got a job that uses them and is getting a salary better than your no special skills needed janitor.
