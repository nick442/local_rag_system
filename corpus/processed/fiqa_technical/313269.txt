"i would add only -- and you alluded in this direction, but to clarify -- that barter economies rarely ever exist. if you ask an economist about the origin of money, they usually offer thus barter-to-credit story because Adam Smith hypothesized this line of development. it subsequently became ""true"", even though there was no evidence for it. anthropology has come a long way since Smith lived, and we now know that early societies were communal, as in from each according to their means, etc. the term of art is ""gift economy"", where there are no tallies or accountings of who owes exactly what but rather a general sense of mutual obligation. accounting, credit and debt as we think of them were a result of dealing with people you did not trust. money, being a debt, arose from this mistrust and was typically only used to settle the most serious matters -- stolen wives, murder, etc. -- in a way that could prevent deadly conflict by protecting the honor of the aggrieved. money was intended to ""replace"" the lost person. money, debt and the rest have come in and out of fashion over the ages -- the efficiency argument is really null, if you consider a gift economy, and there have been prolonged periods since the first use of metallic money in which money has gone away. for most of the middle ages, for example, europe reverted to credit and gift economies. anthropologists believe in fact that the use of money comes to typically prevail in societies that are rife with mistrust and ""lost persons"" -- that is, societies plagued by war and slavery (slaves being historically one of the primary products of war). the rise of money usually brings the rise of a creditor class, a debtor class who approximate slaves even though not losers in war per se, and a terrific amount of social strife. and that leads often to collapse if not addressed by periodic debt jubilees."
