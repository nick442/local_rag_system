Here's Chicago's medallion prices for June: http://chicagodispatcher.com/clients/chicagodispatcher/July2014MedallionPrices.pdf The people that buy medallions and the ones who drive the cabs are not usually the same people. The medallion owner typically buys a vehicle and leases it to a driver. That means the medallion owner has to make back his investment, along with maintaining and insuring the vehicle. The drivers typically pay for the gas. Now here's New York City: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/july_2014_medallion_transfers.pdf $1m for a medallion. Unless you have a lot of cash sitting around, you're taking out a loan to buy these medallions, which means loan payments and interest. Do you still not get how this creates a small margin?
