>The problem isn't the kid asking for the cookie, it's when Mom gives them the cookie when they shouldn't be having cookies. Your analogy breaks down by attempting to draw a parallel between the behaviour of a child and that of a corporation. Corporations are managed by adults with the full range of experience and cognitive abilities at their disposal. Children, on the other hand, are not capable of engaging in the same level of decision-making and are excused from misbehaving. >Lobbyists asking for modifications to tax & legal code - fine. There's nothing wrong with asking. Sometimes the ask is a good one. Asking and paying for are two different things in my mind. Level the playing field for everyone. >Why do you people blame the companies or lobbyists but exonerate the legislators & regulators who are ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOWING THESE THING TO HAPPEN!? I don't recall absolving legislators from responsibility. They're just as dirty and corrupt.
