Alright my dude, I looked over it. Not sure what the ls&s project proposal is (so, it's hard to sanity check your numbers - you also don't include a growth percentage in those operations, so I assume that is correct or under contract), and I have no idea if the 250k / year is reasonable for library materials on the ls&s, but I would totally expect the internal service charges to vary - would you expect either model to effect them more, why or why not, and provide a model for potentials? Also, you have some English I would recommend you clean up before sharing. Good luck!
