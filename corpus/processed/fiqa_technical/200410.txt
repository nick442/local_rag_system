My boss doesn't seem to do a good job of it. I wonder, have you ever had a job? I don't see any reason why I shouldn't have a say in the nature of my work, etc. In fact, what I am saying is that some labor is necessary from the perspective of the capitalist, because she needs profits, but that doesn't mean it is necessary according to the workers.
