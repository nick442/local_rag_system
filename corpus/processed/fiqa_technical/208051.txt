Shanghai can not be the international financial center of China, or China's inbound/outbound trade, as long as it does not have rule of law. Even Chinese corporates go to Hong Kong to sign contracts because the commercial legal system is efficient, fair, and predictable. Shanghai is a city (and a great one, no doubt!) doing business in a restricted, capital-controlled currency, under a legal system which is corrupt and arbitrary. You wouldn't want to get into a dispute there with, say, Bank of China. When there is a trusted legal system in China then finance will follow. Meanwhile, show me anyone who wants to sign an ISDA agreement under Chinese law, subject an international bond indenture to Chinese law (rather than New York or English law), or do a securitization using Chinese law or counterparties. HK's biggest problem may be that the Mainland is imperiling rule of law in the SAR. If that is lost, the city has no reason to exist.
