The point I made is it isn't 'free' trade, it's a race to the bottom where workers in the most developed countries are the ones that pay - at the same time that they are supposed to be consuming those products. So as you follow it through, its pretty obvious that in the end it falls apart, and that in the meantime it's the businesses that benefit and the workers everywhere who pay. There's nothing 'free' about it. Fair trade is better than free trade.
