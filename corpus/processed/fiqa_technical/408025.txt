I've used ING Direct for several years. Never had any problems with them. They were (and maybe still are?) ahead of the curve on security arrangements. You don't need to have a brick and mortar bank to transfer money in, but it is faster and easier if you do. (At least this is true with my mail account -- see next item.) You don't have to have an online account. You can bank entirely by mail if you want. (At least I have one account set up this way, I assume you can still open an account by mail.) They offer CDs with somewhat mediocre rates that are easy to open and fund online from your savings account. The website is relatively simple to use. I have never had any problems with transfers in or out. When you have to call, you get a human on the phone, quickly. Someone who speaks American English with reasonable diction. (At least it used to be this way, I don't think I've called them in over a year.) I'm a fan of ING, but I do wish they managed to keep their rates on top of the chief competition.
