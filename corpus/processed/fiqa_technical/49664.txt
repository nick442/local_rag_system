Public sector union rep here. 1) First class? You haven’t worked for many non-profits, have you? 2) the idea that I’m essentially a public employee is ridiculous. My members pay my salary out of their paycheck. I’m accountable to them, not their employer. That’s like saying the groceries they buy are public property or their house is a public building. Once the government pays my members, that money is theirs, period.
