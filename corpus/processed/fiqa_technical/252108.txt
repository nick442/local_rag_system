Al-Jazeera is a bit more complicated as they are state-funded by Qatar, but Qatar has a more complex internal power structure than Putin's virtual domibance if Russia and a far more complex regional situation having recently become ostracized by its neighbors. Again, plenty of decent articles but the real agenda is not necessarily journalism. Qatar, like Russia, very much wants to be considered a peer of the rest of the developed, primarily Western, world. Unsurprisingly, the next two World Cups (of football/soccer) of 2018 and 2022 are scheduled to be held in Russia and Qatar respectively. So news media is just one tool of this push for influence and soft-power.
