On top of the emergence of self driving cars, Oil is a shitty fuel source, because it costs 4 units of energy per unit delivered, and then most applications are only about 30% efficient (cars). It's literally a massive energy waste to use it how we use it. Oil won't die because people hate it, or your average Climate Denier believes in something other than God, it'll die for economic reasons.
