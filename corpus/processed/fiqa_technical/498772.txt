Rapid Injection Molding is producing better molds better suited to run low volume production. The manufacturing process is based on the process of injecting material into a mold. It can be performed with a host of materials like metals, glasses, elastomers, and most common thermosetting polymers. Raw materials are fed through a hopper during the thermoplastic molding process. There are two different types of molds namely single and multiple molds.
