I really can't wait to buy a McMansion for 35% of its value when the economy bottoms out. They'll be crying they didn't sell and I'll offer them a onetime cash offer. I won't be mean or try to screw over, I just will feel no pain or remorse for ripping off a baby boomer owner in the housing market. That's the Millennial revenge. Too bad we're still 5 or so years out.
