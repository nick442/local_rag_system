"I always used Uber until one day they just stopped accepting any payment method I added! No matter what I used, credit cards, debit cards, Paypal, it always claimed that it was an invalid payment method. I worked with Uber support for weeks to resolve this, including being given access to their super-secret web-based option that requires them to explicitly enable for you. THAT worked exactly one time, then I was right back where I was. I created a Lyft account out of desperation, and it worked every time with the same payment methods that Uber had issues with. So, I used Lyft exclusively for awhile. The only difference I noticed was that Uber drivers, at least for awhile, seemed to be professionals in other industries who drive for fun or just extra cash. I would ride with someone who's day job was providing IT consulting for area casinos, and it was always a really fascinating conversation! Conversations with Lyft drivers tended to center around how they had just done a title loan against the REALLY old car I was driving in, because he lost everything in the divorce and couldn't get back on his feetâ€¦ Eventually, I found that my issue with Uber was a ""family"" profile I had created and forgotten about that included debit card information that had expired, and once I deleted the profile, things worked again. (NEVER got any feedback from their support department when I shared this with them) So now I tend to favor Lyft just because of the issues with Uber's corporate culture. I was in a LOT of start-ups during Silicon Valley's heyday, and even though I encountered some levels of misogyny, anything even remotely close to the stories I've heard out of Uber would have caused an uproar!"
