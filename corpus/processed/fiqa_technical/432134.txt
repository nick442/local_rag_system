All my computers have come through bartering in some form or another. I now own 2, and the only thing ever purchased was certain limited parts. It's not very appropriate to the cost of electronics as a proxy for the affordability of the cost of living. If that proxy was even mildly valid you could rent a decent apartment for $200 bucks or less, and furniture, food, etc., would be nearly free. The electronics cost proxy is absurd. Basically, 35 years ago almost nobody owned a computer. While the cost of living has skyrocketed what sense does it make to claim that the cost of something that people didn't even own then is a valid proxy of the cost of the things they require to live?
