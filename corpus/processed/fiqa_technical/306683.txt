Inflation hasn't occurred because the banks aren't using the money created by the central bank buying their debt to lend out more money to the economy. If the economy seems to improve to the point where the banks believe they can make money by lending out more, hyperinflation will occur relatively fast like a dam bursting. The US could emulate Japan by also limiting the ability of banks to lend out money while buying their debt, but this kind of playing with the books doesn't really improve the economy for the normal person.
