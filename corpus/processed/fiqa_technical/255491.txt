"Because ""my accountant said I'm in the 28% bracket and need more write-offs."" When I hear someone say this I tell them to get a new accountant/advisor/tax guy. The benefit, if any, is the fact that if, and only if, (a hat tip to @staticx) you are already itemizing your deductions. It means that for me, my 3.5% mortgage is really costing me 2.625%. The only effect of this is the when I line up my debts, the mortgage might fall to a lower priority for payback. This is where there's a balance between the choice of a robust emergency fund, earning close to 0% today, or using those funds to pay the mortgage at an accelerated rate. If the sentiment expressed by the question implies that one should carry a mortgage, needed or not, it really comes down the a question of risk over the long term. I don't suggest that people take a mortgage today to invest in the market. A zero return as we just saw in the '00s will show you that the 10% market return is an average over the very long term. FWIW, the '96-'05 period returned 9.08%, and '06-'13 (2 years short of the 10) 7.26%. Few have the discipline to patiently wait out the dips and see the returns I quoted. That said, the fact that the interest is deductible is a small factor given the low rates we are currently enjoying. Each of the points above can be expanded into its own answer. A great question with not-so-simple answers."
