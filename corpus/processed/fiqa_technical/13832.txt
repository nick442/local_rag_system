> The alternative is to do nothing. Well, what many people do not realize is that even if all man made CO2 magically ceased to be created that the climate would still change. Climates change, always. So, you think that something that accounts for .04% of the atmosphere is the key to humanity's survival on the planet, really? The market will reduce CO2 production as it already has (the only reason that the US is in line with the Kyoto protocols as it was not ratified by the Senate). As prices lower, you will see cleaner sources of energy (i.e. solar) become more and more prevalent. Ironically, poor people (through burning of wood for heat and to cook with) actually have a much greater impact on CO2 levels than to rich people. Go figure. All that is certain is that what the 99% you quote agree on is that mankind is responsible for some of the warming. There is no consensus over the magnitude of the change (I have seen estimates from a .5 to a 4 degrees of Celsius change over the coming decade) or over how to address the issue.
