eh on second thought Suppose I earned $1 Billion per year. then 10,000*365 = 3,650,000 and 3,650,000 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.35% of my yearly income in terms of percentage costs. If someone makes $20,000 per year and spends $500 a month on rent then 500*12 = 6,000 6,000/20,000 = 30% of ones yearly income in terms percentage costs.. sooooo yeaaaah Is swap that rent percentage any day of the week. At 20,000 a year a rental rate of .35% comes out to a monthly rent of $5.84. I'll take the Billionaire yacht mansion. [edit in response to the above edited comment]: You're right I'm a billionaire i don't got time for maintenance. I'm just gonna buy a new one every year AND Im gonna assume that operating costs are $40,000,000 per year on top of buying a new $40,000,000 each year which comes out to $80,000,000: 80,000,000/1,000,000,000 = 8% STILL GONNA TAKE THE BILLIONAIRE YAGHT OVER THE NORMAL RENT To be clear 30% of 1 Billion is 3 Hundred Million: which means as a billionaire I could buy **25** $40 Million yachts. [Moar Edit]: Ok like Since Ive got a super Yacht for just 8% of a billion this extra $920 Million Is burning a hole in my pocket. I'm gonna buy 40 $2 million homes (one for each top city) which leaves me with only $840 Million. I gonna buuuuy A Hillary Clinton Level politician ($200 Million or so). So got $640 Million left..
