>I note that each response to me includes a personal insult. False. I don't know, nor do I care, why people downvote, but I assume it's because you're letting emotion cloud reason. The point isn't that people may lose jobs, it's that an inefficient business should go under. This is [/r/business](/r/business) not [/r/sappytearjerker](/r/sappytearjerker). Brick and Mortar retailers suffer when a more efficient and broad-reaching business such as amazon comes about. They mostly go into these stores to check out the products and decided which to purchase online for less. What I think about whether or not these people will get another job in T time is irrelevant to the point, again, that inefficient companies should go under.
