Well considering I am middle class and living in America (and a woman to boot!).. However, your father on his factory salary probably didn't have to save for his own retirement, at the time he probably thought his company's pension would provide for him. Now if you want any hope of having a decent retirement, you gotta save 15% a year. Your dad probably also didn't have to pay for insurance in the age of Lipitor and Viagra. But the chances of his dying of a heart attack at 60 were much greater (lost my own grandpa to a heart attack at 58 in 1975) We live longer and better thanks to medicine, albeit expensive medicine. I still think if you subtract out all the things from our current lives that normal middle class folks pay for today that they wouldn't have had to pay for in say 1960 we'd be able to raise a family of 4 on one middle class salary. PS we can have an awesome discussion without being rude. :)
