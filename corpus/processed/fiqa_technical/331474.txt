Right. Ultimately, this golden parachute is $200mil+ too large, but she was never likely to turn Yahoo around. She did not succeed in turning around a failing enterprise. Mistakes and mishaps in that scenario are always very glaring. So, while she didn't do a great job, I think the narrative of her being the downfall of Yahoo is incorrect. Ultimately, Yahoo needed a visionary type to turn it around. Those are few and far between and often seem to need to be very connected to the company they are turning around. Even with that type of person at the helm it would have been a long shot to turn Yahoo around.
