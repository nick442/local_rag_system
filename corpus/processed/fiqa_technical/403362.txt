The issue has nothing whatsoever to do with hating on women you stupid bitch. Employers don't want to have to incur the cost and expectation of women leaving work for eight weeks. Get it through your stupid feminist head that when you demand laws for special benefits they end up biting you in the ass later on. You asked for this shit so shut the fuck up and take it.
