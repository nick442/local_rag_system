i think this argument is the crux of the sharing economy and everything with uber/airbnb. is google responsible for the content of every website it shows in it's search results? it all depends on what sort of warranties are implied or written in the contracts, what's HP's onsite tech support SLA with the third party? i'd argue it's not dumb, but one of the most important arguments in business and the economy as a whole at the moment
