Yes, but your point doesn't really convince me - I don't believe that Andersen split into two for that reason a decade before everyone else and then failed to IPO for 12 years- and if the Andersen partners at the time stood to make money, why would they enter into direct competition before the IPO? I don't know what you call an MD at Accenture, as that's not actually a career level. I'm not in the US but Accenture partners certainly make rather more than 250k here. I know for sure that EY and Accenture are quite comparable on non-exec salary levels, at least in my market, as I know a few people who have switched between Accenture and EY without massive increases in salary. They do seem happier with the work at Big4 companies though ;)
