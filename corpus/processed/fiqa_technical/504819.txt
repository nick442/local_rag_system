From a linked article: > You’ll want to keep the case with you, too, because it carries four extra charges, and heavy use **(snapping 20 or 30 10-second videos in a half hour) will put a serious hurt on Spectacles’ battery.** Um, so you get 5-10 minutes of record time per charge? What the heck is the point of wearing goofy glasses if that is the longest they can record??
