> This again avoids the point, which is that military functions are being outsourced - I assume you really agree, and that to the extent there's a debate, it's only about the extent. Of course I agree. I was a contractor to both the Department of Defense and the Department of State. I just disagree with the notion that there is any significance to the thought that contractors outnumbered troops in Iraq or Afghanistan. It is an absolutely meaningless statement as there is so much more going on there than would be understood by someone who hadn't seen it in person or worked on the contracts themselves. At no point during the occupation, prior to the drawdown, did DoD contractors of any nationality outnumber troops. After the drawdown started they did, of course, because that is how the withdrawal was formulated. Contractors outnumber troops in Iraq several hundred to one now.
