The problem with this is that arn't getting quality answers - pragmatic people with product knowledge will be able to tell you which unit has the best GPS for geo-caching or which bearings will run the longest without needing an overhaul. Truly useful salespeople are rare & worth coming back to: but I really doubt you'll find many in a single-product consumer environment who doesn't pay competitively.
