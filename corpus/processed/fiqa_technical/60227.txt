being prepared to take advantage of opportunities is also determined by luck. Did you get to choose who your parents were or how they brought you up, eventually defining your personality and therefore propensity to be prepared for opportunities? No. Did you get to choose what random events occurred around an opportunity, which modified your ability or propensity to act up on it? No. The idea of 'success' depends on the idea of free will and the ability to overcome disadvantages, but you don't even need to rule out free will to see that ability itself is determined by luck. Luck is all. Read The Sirens of Titan by Vonnegut, it really solidified my thinking in this vein.
