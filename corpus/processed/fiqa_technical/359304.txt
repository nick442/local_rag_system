Ah, I actually have heard this idea once before from one of my professors back in university (a greenish economist). He was skeptical about slapping more dollar signs on everything as a solution to all our problems, because monetizing things usually has odd side-effects (due to quirks in human psychology). It's certainly an interesting concept though, and I'd love to see some trials done.
