How to start is pretty simple. With your next pay check set aside an amount and open a separate savings account. Since this is an emergency fund - you want it someplace where you can get to the money quickly (so a CD or mutual fund is not good), but you want it in a separate account so that you don't accidentally use it. Once the account is opened I'd recommend setting up an automatic transfer, or make it part of the direct deposit if you do that, so that you put in some money regularly (every pay check). By adding to it regularly and not using it, you'll more quickly achieve your goal. I'd recommend stopping, or slowing any retirement savings or other investing, until you get the emergency fund in place. If you have an emergency, the money in the retirement fund isn't going to do you much good as it costs too much to do an early withdrawal. The whole point of the emergency fund is to have liquidity when you need it so that you don't incur the costs of unplugging your longer term investments. Also don't worry overly much about making money on this money. This isn't an investment it is there for emergencies.
