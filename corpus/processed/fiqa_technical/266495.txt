"Nothing will happen under Republican rule. They want all the money to go to billionaires that use some of it to fund the Republicans. Hillary had plans for a number of programs; but the media made sure those never got mentioned above the din of ""what about her emails."" But I agree about living wages. Add on publicly funded retraining programs and higher education and you have something. After all every country with which we compete has free education both professional and technical."
