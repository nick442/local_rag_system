I would consider it a personal decision based on your individual situation. When I was younger and short on cash tipping sucked. On a 6 figure income with no kids, I can leave 25% regularly without an issue. But everyone's got a different situation. I think 15% should be minimum but life isn't that black and white. Do what you think is fair and good.
