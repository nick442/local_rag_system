Because people use financial terms loosely and I wanted to clarify. Note: You raised the issue only after you saw the response which is a cheesy way to try to prove something. Translation: When you know how things turned out it’s always easy to say “I knew it all along”. There is a term for that behavior, it’s called hindsight bias. Look it up at your leisure. This is my last response.
