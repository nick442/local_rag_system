If it was all toward operating expenses (i.e. not investments) then I'd be all aboard the hate train. But that's not where it goes. I don't spend time on reddit to educate people so I can shit on them. Just know that there are a lot of smart people who follow this company. I'm not here to prove that I'm one of them, but at least consider there is more to this story than an argument about whether someone checked a damn income statement. I mean, really?
