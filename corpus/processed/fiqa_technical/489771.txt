"For a 10€ trip on uber, it will cost you 11€ on cabify, man. By choosing uber and paying 1€ less, you're basically accepting to give money to a company with not only worse cars, but one with what worse work environment that pays really bad to their drivers usually and that has been reported as sexist towards women in both the US and several other countries. For that 1€ more - as far as I know, so far - you could support a fairer company, better-paying for their drivers, with better cars and overall better service in my opinion. Next time you go on a ride with cabify, ask them about this thing with uber and most have worked there and will gladly talk about it. Besides, in busy times Uber turns on dynamic pricing and in those times I've used cabify and paid 13€ when uber quoted me 19€-23€.. Every time you give someone a piece of your money, it's a ""vote"" you make on which companies you prefer on the market. Something to reflect on."
