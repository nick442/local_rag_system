The best answer is, I think, also the simplest: A bank is an entity which performs maturity transformation. (Conversely, any entity that performs maturity transformation is acting as a bank, regardless of whether it is called one or is regulated as one. And an entity which does not perform maturity transformation isn't really a bank.) Maturity transformation is the process by which a bank accepts short-term deposits, and makes long-term loans. The benefit to society is fairly obvious; we (collectively) like being able to take out mortgages, but we also like having our money in a checking account and available on demand. Banks allow this to happen, although property bubbles and similar make it clear that this isn't without cost. (Note: Central banks are a completely different kettle of fish.)
