Each bank builds or buys their own bill pay system, so answers are not universal (try your banks bill pay system out before fully transferring over, if I didn't like mine I'd get a new bank), but for your questions in order: Other things to consider include: Check your bank account at least twice a month to verify what payments have been made (this is just good general advice). I use bill pay to automatically pay the minimum payment so I avoid forgetting to pay my credit card bill. I strongly recommend a push vs. pull method for bill pay; that is, pushing money from your bank account to pay bills, rather than allowing billers to pull money from your account. This limits the number of companies that you directly give your bank account information to, and makes it easier to hold onto your money when you dispute a mistake they made. It also puts all payment information in once central place so you can keep track of all payment schedules together.
