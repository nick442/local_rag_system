I think that the minimum wage is too low. That said the people in this article are making shitty decisions and their plight is not the reason to change the minimum wage. Perhaps if she had always worked minimum wage jobs she shouldn't have had 2 kids. There is no discussion about the father contribution. Perhaps if he can't contribute to kids, she shouldn't have had kids with him. Perhaps if she felt the need to quit one of her jobs (to be fair I understand that need given the ridiculous hours she was working), she should have quit the lower paying one. Instead she kept the 9.50 an our one and quit the 11 dollar one. That is almost 500 bucks a month difference for a 40 hr week. And her friends, while good example of poor people being super kind to others, are not a good case either. Like seriously 4 kids on minimum wage? Minimum wage should change but not because of these people's poor choices.
