Using your figures, a couple making $172,000 each earn enough to be in the 1%. So that is even less than I had originally stated. I couldn't find any hard data about personal incomes in the USA since everything seems to be intertwined with household earnings, but I did for Canada. There, household income was around the same $350K mark to be in the top 1% and around the same $170,000 to be in the top 1% for personal incomes. Given that, I think we can assume the wealth distribution is fairly close between countries, therefore I stand by my statement that a sub-$200,000 income will put in you the top 1% of earners, though you would need an equally successful partner to be in the top 1% of households.
