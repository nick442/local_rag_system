They are actively provoking nations with much larger militaries. They better have all available resources in their military. NK is responding like a little kid when the big kid takes their football.

I'm not saying Trump's actions are the right move, but this reaction could have been predicted by a monkey with slight understanding of international policy. Doesn't mean it is going to amount to anything."
