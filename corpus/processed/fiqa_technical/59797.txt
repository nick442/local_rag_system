Well an empty fridge is a waste of 100% of the cooling. If you are cooling nothing then all of the energy to cool it is wasted. Air is not very conductive of Heat. Its why double paned glass is more effiecent than single pane the air provides an isulation barrier. So in a fridge you want to quickly bring the temperature of items placed inside down to a storage temperature. (Around 34F 1c) Having a fridge full of already cold items will allow for a much quicker transfer of heat out of the item placed within. And since the heat is dispersed out through a larger mass the amount of cooling required will be the same but because the mean temperature change over time is less the fridge will have to work harder for less time if the fridge is full. But in the end the amount of energy required to cool a full freeser will be higher than an empty one as there is more heat to disapate. But the cost of keeping it cold is spread out among many items. So if you only have 1 orange per day in your fridge and it costs you 30 a month to run your fridge then your oranges have an additional 1 cost on them. But if you use 20 things a day and it costs you 60 a month it only costs you .1 extra per item.
