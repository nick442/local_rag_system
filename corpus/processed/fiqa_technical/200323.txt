I think the article mentions Circuit City because their employees were historically paid based on commissions. Shopping at Circuit City in the late 90's/early 2000's was great from my experience because the employees were knowledgeable and were motivated to sell their assigned products. At some point, they got rid of the commision based sales switching to flat low wages and they lost the competitive edge over Best Buy in my opinion. Shopping at Circuit City became the same as shopping at Best Buy because both stores had non-motivated/knowledgeable sales people.
