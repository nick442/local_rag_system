"I don't think there's any federal law prohibiting them from allowing you to AutoPay more than your minimum. Certainly there are federal laws telling them what to do with payments more than the minimum - they must apply the leftover to the principal by default - so the law doesn't assume you can't overpay. However, federal law does require them to advance your next payment date if you overpay by a multiple of your minimum payment; i.e., if your payment is $50 and you send them $100, you don't have to make your next payment [though interest still accrues of course]. It's possible Navient isn't interested in implementing this functionality in their AutoPay, who knows. In any event, assuming you have a bank that has AutoBillPay functionality, you may want to consider using that - either for the ""extra"" or for the whole amount (if Navient isn't giving you a discount for AutoPay - if so, use that at least). Your bank is happy to cut a check in any amount and send it on, and Navient is required to apply it to the principal. (Though if you do the autopay-and-billpay and are sending an extra amount less than a whole payment, verify that they're willing to accept amounts less than a full payment, first; not all lenders are.)"
