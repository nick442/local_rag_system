"You must buy both tickets in 1 transaction and the purchased ticket cannot be purchased with miles. You'll pay full price (technically a ""paid published coach airfare"") for the first ticket and enter in your discount code for the companion fare which will ring up as $99 + fees ($118 in your example). If the regular price is $500, you'll book 2 tickets for $618 (one fare at $500 and companion fare at $118).
