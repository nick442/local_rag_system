"The whole premise of the article is that there is not enough ""aggregate demand"" aka spending in the economy, a theory rooted in a Keynesian understanding of economics. When will we finally realize that this is all completely wrong? We've tried this for decades and it's only lead to unsustainable public debt. Americans need to save right now, not spend. [Keynes' War on Capital Formation](http://www.alhambrapartners.com/2011/11/02/keynes-war-on-capital-formation/) >No distinction is made between consumptive and productive spending in [the Keynesian] framework. And this is the all-decisive point: Keynesians have cause and effect backward here, as in so many other places. Spending, for them, induces demand, which evokes production (and, it is assumed implicitly, the creation of capital). This is of course tragically and naively backward, for it is production that yields income that permits spending."
