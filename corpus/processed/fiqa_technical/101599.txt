Someone please feel free to correct me on this, but I believe the point is that the HSA is used to pay for that high deductible, and the insurance takes care of additional costs beyond the deductible. I believe your premiums are lower as a result of the high deductible, but the HSA money helps to offset that cost of those deductibles when you encounter them.
