I am not sure why this gets downvoted. First, the quality of education in bottom 90% of the schools is downright atrocious. I am interviewing engineering grads - often PhDs who can't tell the formula for the surface area of a sphere - AND CANNOT DERIVE IT! Second, sorry, but paying $250k for a degree in something that pays $30k a year just does not make sense. You can invest this $250 into medium risk paper and together with a trade salary get much more money.
