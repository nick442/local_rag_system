Your logic is correct, you are making a bet that pays 1:10K odds for $2. The likelihood of the event is certainly much lower, certainly several orders of magnitude lower (Probably around 1:10,000K). So it is a bad deal and yes it seems like a lottery ticket is a much better deal. Especially when you consider that you will be alive to enjoy the proceeds of the lottery ticket! If you have the option of purchasing this insurance, don't. If you need life insurance, then purchase it without conditions and clauses. Your dependents will need the proceeds regardless of how one passes.
