>Is she really more than a pretty face which helps the company grow revenues and attract a high valuation? You say that like its a small feat. The amount of attention she is has generated for the Company and its products makes her involvement incredibly valuable. I don't imagine she is there packing boxes or negotiating with suppliers, but I don't think that makes her contributions less valuable than those of the other primary investors.
