I've found a much better time at the independent toy stores. My daughter is into some unique things at her age. Graphic novels and weird dolls. At 11 toysrus doesn't cut it. It's a shame though, babies r us was a great place for our baby needs when we had kids. In the end it is sad to see a toy store chain go down. Kids need the stuff that toy stores have to offer. Kids are too engrossed in digital media. They need the 3d world that toys give them, and it's really tragic to see where kids are going.
