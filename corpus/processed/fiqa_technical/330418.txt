"WOW. So much for ""Do No Evil"" huh? It's this stuff that has convinced me that everyone should be boycotting google, that we should not refer to ""alphabet"" by that name but instead just call it Google. That way we can prevent them from hiding from their crimes. They wanted to own ""search"" and when they couldn't have that they decided to try and purchase ""alphabet"" and we shouldn't let them have that either. Really who do they think they are?"
