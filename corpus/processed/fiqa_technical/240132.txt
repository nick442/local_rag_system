One of the key characteristics of capitalism is commodification of labor and exchange. Thus, one truly is forced under capitalism to work. We see this today in the economy (falling wages are a key indicator) but also in the origins of capitalism, where the enclosures and dispossessions (essentially, the imposition of commodity exchange and labor) were accompanied by a massive state-sponsored bloodbath and spectacular terrorism. So, I think it is clear that capitalism does indeed force your to work.
