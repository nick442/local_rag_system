Look at the non-grocery store use of a single Whole Foods location. Amazon lockbox can be created for delivery holds of Amazon online orders that drives upscale foot traffic into the store. Standardize a few choices of meats then can compete as two hour shipping point of Plated meal prep alternative where can get other grocery items delivered at same time. Each WF location just became a food warehouse for Amazon with cold storage. Complex undertaking though Amazon is able to roll the dice.
