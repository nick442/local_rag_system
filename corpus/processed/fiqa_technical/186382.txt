"Ideally government is of the people by the people. Unfortunately the people we are electing these days just use their position to collect kickbacks for doing a shit job so companies like nestle (not just them) can just fucking print money for little benefit to the people the government is supposed to represent. You americans need to get your house in order. You got a pack of crooks running the show and you are all just trapped by fear of ""THE ENEMY"" that those crooks have manufactured. Vive la revolution! That said it doesn't have to be a voilent one, you have mid terms coming up."
