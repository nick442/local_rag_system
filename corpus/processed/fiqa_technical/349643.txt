.. Dude. PLEASE turn off Fox News for a few minutes. Your world view is so far from reality that I don't even know where to begin. I have no interest in continuing this discussion. If you'd ever like to have a discussion where you DON'T act like a racist dick head, I'd be glad to have such a discussion. But the false garbage that you're spreading right now, not only is ignorant, but is also irresponsible and dangerous. There are people (much like you) who are not smart enough to realize that that's pure fabricated bologna. It's dangerous to expose them to such false narratives, because some might actually believe it. I beg you to stop spreading bullshit about things you don't understand, even though we both know that people who think like you don't listen to reason and logic.
