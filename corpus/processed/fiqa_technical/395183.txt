Unemployment rate for the United States is at 4.4%. This is the lowest it has been since the year 2000 when it was 3.8%. This is at the same point as it was at the height of the housing boom. So you are wrong, we do not need another housing boom to get our unemployment level back to that level, since we are there already. As a nation, we are at full employment.
