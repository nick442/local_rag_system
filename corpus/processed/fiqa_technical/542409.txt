"I sometimes ask myself this question. But I was totally blown away that you missed the main reasons I think we are in trouble. Wall Street is a casino, and worse than that, it is a rigged casino that is more and more dependent on computers making trades. And we are at their mercy. One greedy bank, one computer glitch, and it's off to the races we go again. I'm blown away by what they did in the 2000's, and the fact that they got away with it totally and completely. You worry about government debt, and social security/medicare, but consider that if wall street banks hadn't *purposely* collapsed the American (and world) economy for a few quick bucks, we wouldn't be in this recession for almost 6 years now, and people/businesses would have paid a lot more taxes. And as far as I can see, we are just waiting on the next bubble that wall street will inflate and pop. We could reduce government debt to zero, and wall street could still take the whole thing down again, with no fear of repercussion. So long as they can make a profit, why wouldn't they?
