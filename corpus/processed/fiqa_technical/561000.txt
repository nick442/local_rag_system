"I am a customer. I only want minimal service and to be sold stuff at cheap prices. I am blaming everything about the experience. The employees did not give the vibe of being overworked, and the other departments nearby didn't look very busy. They leisurely walked up after a bunch of customers were obviously irate, and showed not even a little bit of urgency, and again only after a manager showed up. As a customer, I can blame everyone/everything I want at the store/entity that is trying to sell me stuff. I had already invested too much time trying to get the manager several times to come over for me to just leave in disgust, but it is not something I will forget when considering future purchases.
