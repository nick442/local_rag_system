True but I also hate when companies try to sell me products. When I watch a documentary I want to see little bias (there is always some). This guy uses sensational reporting to try and sell viewers on the notion that everything from an animal is terrible for you and plant foods are the only possible solution. It's a load of shit just the same way weight loss pills are a load of shit. My issue is that it's a documentary not a fucking ad. The dude isn't even subtle about his bullshit so he has absolutely no credibility in my eyes. He presents veganism like he's trying to convert you to a religion (which I understand it basically is for many).
