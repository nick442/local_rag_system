This even happens in union environments. I work for a company that is heavily unionized and company seniority is all that matters. If there isn't enough work for a full timer to do, he is allowed to bump two part timers out of their hours for the day. When the economy really tanked a few years ago, we had guys with three or four years of seniority who were getting bumped out of their hours regularly because our volume was way down. Newer hires weren't getting any hours at all because they were at the bottom of the seniority list.
