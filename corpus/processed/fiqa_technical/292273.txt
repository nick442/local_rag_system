And that's the rub, you didn't win a fucking thing. You are not part of a team. You are just brainwashed by the politics you choose to isolate yourself with. Trump won, not you, and he won on accident and on lying to people that supported him foolishly. He was expecting to lose, and the day before and day of election Tuesday his campaign was pushing a narrative that democrats cheated to win. We all fucking lost. You lost worse that I did, because you continue to put your hope in a lying scumbag who has no morals, scruples, or sense of decency whatsoever, and it is too painful to admit your monumental fuckup.
