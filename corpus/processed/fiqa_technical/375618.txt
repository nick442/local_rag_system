- it devistates you're credit record (good luck getting even a car loan) - rents are artificially high due to the foreclosure backlog and those who haven't let go yet, so there might not be any relief by defaulting - they will be prohibited from buying another house for at least 7 years - it is very possible that they will be pursued by the banks in court for years to come and may end up having tax refunds and pay checks garnished for decades to come (again impacting their ability to obtain loans or get credit), effectively turning them into renters for the remainder of their working life.
