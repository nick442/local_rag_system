All the GS displays are absurdly cool, especially when viewed from an angle. I don't understand it. the Galaxy Nexus display is far better (though still not as good as the iPhone). It almost makes me think they are doing it on purpose; if they can produce this quality display for the GN, but they have stuck to the blue display of the GS for 3 generations, it has to be on purpose, right?
