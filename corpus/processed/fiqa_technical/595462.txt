All lenders make money from loans, despite the fact that there will be some defaults, they just have to make enough money from those that don't default to offset the losses from those that do, so that their over all profit is good enough to be justified, so there's no reason the p2p lending companies can't protect your loan. If you remove the risk of losing your investment you can expect your return to be reduced though, as they have to take more profit away from you in order to fund the pool used to pay out when there is a default. This doesn't necessarily mean your money is completely safe though, if the p2p lender itself went bust you would probably still lose your money, unless it was appropriately insured. I'm not sure liquidity is really the right word really, liquidity is about encashment without serious penalty. If you can transfer the debt to someone else at any time then liquidity is good, but if you don't really have that option (as most lenders don't) then your investment amount (whatever isn't paid back yet) is completely illiquid still, just for a shorter time. I don't see how the term is important myself, there are many investments that have differing maturity time scales, and you just have to pick one that has a suitable time scale, return and risk for you. 1% charge or not, there is still an ultimate net return on investment, secondary market or not. Virtually any investment has costs of some sort, you just have to take them into account and make sure you don't get fooled into thinking the ROI is better than it seems because of the way they've packaged and presented it.
