It sounds like you are in great shape, congratulations! Things I would think about in your position: Consider putting 20% down instead of 30% and find a great house that has a key missing modernization, like a kitchen. Then replace the kitchen, which if done right can instantly add that 10% (or more) right back in equity.. or stick to your plan.. You have earned the luxury of taking your time and doing what's right for you. Think real carefully about location. Here are some ideas based on my experience.
