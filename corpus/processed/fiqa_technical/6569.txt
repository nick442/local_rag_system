As someone who has followed the world of beer (and wine) internationally for over two decades, I will argue with anyone that Vermont's Hill Farmstead is the best brewery operating anywhere in the world right now. I don't use the word lightly, but Shaun Hill is genuinely a genius when it comes to brewing. Vermont also has The Alchemist (which makes Heady Topper, my pick for the best DIPA in the world) and Lawson's Finest Liquids.
