">Wrong. Between Ford (1914) and FDR's Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) the middle class formed. Unions forming from textile plants pushed for what became the FLSA. That's more the working class, but we're just splitting hairs now. >The right has been conned into wanting to dismantle all of that even though the only people who would benefit are the top 1%. A free market wouldn't stop unions, in fact it would give them more freedom. >This is why the rest of us call you dupes or dummies. No, you do that because you're a condescending asshole. >A ""slow down"" is no shortage. You said it generally as well. There's no overall housing shortage. Actually the example I gave you showed that allowing the construction of new apartments reduced rent increases as more demand is met. As far as actual vacant houses go, Seattle is actively stopping people from living in them, and giving permits to destroy them. You could solve the homeless problem in Seattle by getting govt out of the way."
