The author makes a quick jump here conflating Walker's efforts against public sector unions and the long-term decline in private sector unions. These two are analytically, politically, and perhaps even morally distinct. He then makes a correlation argument: union membership has declined and conditions for the worker have gotten worse. He doesn't substantiate the latter point, nor does he draw a causal link between the two. There are decent explanations for the secular decline of union membership: sectoral shifts in the economy away from labor-intensive manufacturing and toward technology, information, and service-sectors in which unions are traditionally not present nor as necessary. > The weakening of unions has had a huge political effect as well: the realignment of the white working class. Since the ’60s, exit polls have shown that unionized blue-collar whites vote Democratic at a rate 20 to 30 percent higher than their nonunion counterparts. The decline in union membership has weakened Democrats in such heavily white, increasingly deunionized states as West Virginia and Wisconsin… The author is placing the cart before the horse here. White working class voters don't think that Democrats represent their interests, so why would they continue to financially support unions that guarantee that their dues will go to politicians who don't represent them? White working class voters are going to voluntarily join associations that support their own interests and identities, and that's apparently not unions. If the white working class thought that the Democrats represented their interests, union membership would probably not have declined to such a degree in these regions.
