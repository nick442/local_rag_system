"Yes, old people shop there, but K-mart is much older and has established stores in very rural areas that other retailers are slow to move into. I was driving through nowhere West Virginia, about 60 miles from the nearest interstate on a two lane ""highway"", when I come around a corner and there's a K-mart sitting there."
