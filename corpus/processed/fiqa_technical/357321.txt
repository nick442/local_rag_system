"Thank you very much for this - an exceptional answer. On a related note, I heard that back in the day when IBM was huge, they actually had manufacturing plants to build parts for other IBM divisions, because those divisions couldn't get what they needed anywhere else. Then one day, a VP asked another VP ""Hey, we make this stuff because nobody else does, right?"" ""Yeah"" ""Which means other companies that need it don't have anywhere to get it?"" ""Yeah"" ""So couldn't they get them from us?"" ""What, like we sell them parts?"" ""Yeah."" ""How would *that* work?"""
