"Life insurance is not required to be used to pay the debts of the estate. Life insurance proceeds are not part of your estate. They go directly to the beneficiary, and are their property. Your daughter can do whatever she wants with the proceeds. She can pay off your credit cards if she wants, but she doesn’t have to, even if your will said she should use the insurance money to pay your debts. If that’s what you really want, you should make your estate—not your daughter—the beneficiary of your insurance policies. Then, the proceeds will become part of your estate, so they’d be available to repay your debts. Source .. if the deceased owned life insurance and nominated a beneficiary of the policy, the proceeds of that policy would not pass into the deceased's estate, but would go directly to the nominated beneficiary Source The amount of the life insurance is included in the estate for the purpose of calculating estate tax, but not for the purpose of debt repayment. The estate for the purpose of estate tax is called the ""Gross estate"" and includes many things that are not included in a ""probate"" estate. Source"
