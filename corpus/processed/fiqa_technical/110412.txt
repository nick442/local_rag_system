Therein lies the risk MoviePass is taking. They are basically going long on the idea that a $10/person/month subscription is the only way to see a theatrical showing. In order to convince the theaters to play along, they are going to have to demonstrate that they move the needle on attendance such that even without the subsidy, the added concession sales would make it worthwhile for the theaters. Before they burn through their subsidy money.
