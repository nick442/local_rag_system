What the hell are you talking about? The job requires some skills and the cost of living is really high in New York. They should be able to live off of a full time job - plain and simple. To put things in perspective I made 40k a few years back when I lived in Michigan - when looking at New York to keep my same standard of living I would of had to make 95k+ and would of had to give up my car.
