That's kind of my point. Mutton was cheap, as a byproduct of wool. It's essentially no longer eaten by humans due to the increase in prosperity. Presumably if we were to go back to eating primarily mutton rather than lamb, mostly roosters and chickens too old to lay, and ex-dairy beef, food prices would be lower.
