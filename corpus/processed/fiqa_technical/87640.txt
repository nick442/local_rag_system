"BLUF: Your question is subjective and as such, the answer varies from person to person. The rent you ""should be"" paying is the tricky part. Minimum is whatever is the least you can find. Maximum is the most you can afford. To be financially responsible, you would live as close to that minimum as you can bear. However, this can cause stress if you are trying to subsist on lower than you can actually bear. You have certain expenses that are required to survive. Housing, clothing, food. These are your needs. Everything else is convenience or luxury. Best way to develop a budget is to list the categories of everything you have spent over several months. Figure out a monthly amount for each one. Divide them up into groups of things you need, things that make life bearable, and things you can do without. Then start with your income and figure out how much you bring home each pay period. When you get paid, allocate the money to your needs until they're all covered. If there's anything left, fund the second group, then on to the third. Continue tracking your spending and adjust where you allocate the money. After 2-3 months, you'll start having a decent idea on how much you actually spend on each category. You'll probably find areas where you're spending a lot more than you realize. The method I've just described is the one advised by ""You Need a Budget"" software, but you don't need the software to use the method. Though it does help. Also, if there's any debt, that goes in with the 'needs' because we all need to pay our bills."
