I think you severely underestimate the math requirement for finance phds. I took first year metrics with the econ and finance phds at berkeley. Almost all of them had the equivalent of a bachelors, if not a masters, degree in math. You are going to need to go far beyond calculus. At a minimum you should have multivariate calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and real anaylsis. For example, you'll need real analysis and measure theory for stochastic calculus which would be used for continuous time asset pricing. Real analysis would also be required for first year micro. You'll also need a strong background in probability and statistics for financial econometrics and time series.
