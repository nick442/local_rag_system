I'm pretty sure my dog is better at catching balls than I am, also dogs don't think that the alignment of the stars during their birth had any affect on how happy they are. I read a book called *The Drunkard's Walk* and in it they talk about a experiment where humans and rats were shown a deck of cards that was 2/3 red and 1/3 black. When humans were asked to guess the cards, they guessed black 1/3 of the time, and red 2/3 of the time, while rats picked red every time. Humans were right about 60% of the time, rats were right 2/3 (66.7%) of the time. Rat brains are more correct than human brains.
