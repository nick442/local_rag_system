Where I work they hire unskilled to learn machining. Except they don't want to learn and are not good with computers and have no idea, or care, what 'making rate' means. The few skilled people they have left don't have any intention of training anyone, there is no money in it for us, only makes the owner richer. None of us have had a raise in years and we already know how to get by on less. We don't care if the owner has to turn away work for his machines. The super rich wanted a drugged up, dumbed down, and pacified population. Now they have it and that will cost the rich man money, just as the super rich want. I can help fix that problem at the place where I work, but not for free. A fat 2 digit raise or do it yourself.
