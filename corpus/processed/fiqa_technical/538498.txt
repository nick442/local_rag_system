"Chance favors the prepared mind - Einstein That being said, I liken it to a poker analogy. To win at poker you must play. To play you must already have something to put on the table. If you are betting your entire existence at every hand because you started poor you *can* win but it is far less likely to happen. You will make illogical decisions due to the fear or being destroyed. It's like how walking across a tightrope is easy when it is 6"" above the ground, but not 600 feet above the ground. Also, in the beggining of life there is a good chance you will flame out or mess up a few times. Rich kids can do this as much as they need to, over and over again, to learn and get their feet under them. Poor kids generally get one chance and if anything goes wrong it's back to the factory to work for several more years to save up money again. I believe they are calling this growing class of young people on the edge the ""precariat""."
