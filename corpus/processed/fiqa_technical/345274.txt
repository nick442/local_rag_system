As the answer from Guest5 noted, any expense you have before the HSA is established is not considered a qualified medical expense for an HSA distribution. However, it is important to note that since you now have the HSA established, any medical expense you have from this point on is a qualified medical expense, even if you don't take an HSA distribution for it right away. For example, let's say that you have a medical expense this year, but you don't take an HSA distribution to reimburse yourself right away. (Maybe it is because you don't have enough money in your HSA to reimburse yourself at this time.) You can reimburse yourself in the future for this expense. As long as you had an HSA in place when the expense was incurred, it doesn't matter if you wait to take the distribution.
