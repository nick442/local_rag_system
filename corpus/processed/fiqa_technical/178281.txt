Slavery is a bad example considering everyone benefited from it. Cheap labor lowers the cost of living and improves living conditions for the majority. I'm curious. What do you think about this angle? Let's say businesses like Romney's didn't exist. What happens when a family run business starts failing? Not because of market forces but because of poor management and lack of knowledge/ability? They would simply vanish along with all of the jobs that business provided. The debt would remain and burden the owners. Instead, jobs have the possibility to be saved, and the owner(s) can resolve debts and/or make money from the sale.
