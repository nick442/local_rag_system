"I somewhat agree to Alex B's post. I was a finance manager for 7 years both prime and sub-prime(special)(in other words bad). The parts he's 100% right on. Hit up you local credit union then your bank. Get your financing done first if you can. Now 690 credit score is one of 3 bureaus, not all banks and lending institutions use all three or the same one. Also the score isn't everything. That could be good or bad. The 2-3% range is normally for the 720+ crowd unless its a manufacture. (GM, Ford, so on) With rates capping out at around 30% depending on state laws. However 690 should not be 19% on a new or late model car. At 690 at 19% you would have be going for a 70,000+ mile 6 year or older car if I had to guess. Assuming you have no BK's and repos. Some times dealerships have to pay banks to get people financed. Its hidden in the cost and they by law are not allowed to tell you about it because it cannot be passed on to you. However the banks don't just fund any crazy amount of money either say like 115% of book and that it. That is where and why they want that big down payment because that is used to off set the finance amount and what you pay. Making the dealership money. and i can go on and on and on.. But you should always try to get the funding prior. Your credit union won't charge the hidden fees and they only care about your down payment to see that you are making a commitment. If you are buying used. Save out 1500 for future repairs and tires and such. Don't buy paint protectant and such. If you finance thru the dealership and put less than 20% down DO buy Gap Insurance but thats it. I can go on and on but I won't. Feel free to ask though. And to answer your original only question with not context. ""Is there any reason not to put a 35% down payment on a car?"" Yes if the money is better served paying off credit cards or long term mortgage, assuming you don't need the write off."
