Just out of curiosity, what if one of those CEOs told Warren Buffett to 'stick it' could Warren Buffett have them removed or would the CEO's board of directors or whatever mechanism the company has only have that right (I mean, not removal for cause, which I am sure is built in but for purely personal reasons)? Just wondering how autonomous some of these companies are because it seems like a handful of corporations own most of the others.
