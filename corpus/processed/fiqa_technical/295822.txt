Stripe Atlas helps with this. They form US companies for foreign solo entrepreneurs and get them US bank accounts. Another thing to remember with banks though, it doesn't matter what the compliance documents say, money talks. So your troubles will more likely stem from the amount of money you need to put in banks, more so than what the rules are.
