"I work with a company that American Airlines hires to fulfill work for them. This week they flew one of my co-workers out to Texas for a week long barbecue. He said he is going to ""promote the relationship."" They flew several other people from my company out, as well as masses of their own employees and people from other companies. Yet they declared bankruptcy and cost my company 5 million (the open revenue waiting for payment.) Edit: American Airlines"
