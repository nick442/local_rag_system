> The vast majority of companies in the US are small businesses This is a fairly useless measure. Example: Imagine if there was one company that hired 1 billion people. And 99 companies that hired 1 person each. You can now say that 99% of companies are small businesses. Which is true, but 99.9999999% of people don't work for a small business, they work for a large business. The small businesses are inconsequential.
