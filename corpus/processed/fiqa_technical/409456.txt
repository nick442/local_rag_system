"I heard the prices lowered didn't seem to make much of a difference (yet?). Also, I wonder if he shopped there. It seems like he wrote (terribly) as someone that never set foot into one of their stores. For me, Whole Foods is a ""high-end store"", and you can find deals and interesting things there. For some of the common staples, if you are getting things like milk and eggs, the prices I found weren't that bad at all, at least compared to Safeway."
