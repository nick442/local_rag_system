>You can't throw 90% of energy subsidies to one part of the industry which produces a fraction of the rest of the industry without negatively affecting consumers (everyone). This assumes the money/subsidies given to domestic solar/wind energy companies would be allocated to multi-national energy companies. They're not equivalent, one is a cutting edge domestic industry; the other is a mature global industry. We've jumped in leaps and bounds in terms of solar cell efficiency vs. cost in the last ten years as a result of R&D, likely funded by these subsidies. OAG is necessary and shouldn't go away anytime soon. but nuclear and renewables are the future, they're growth, they're national security -- we shouldn't be wasting money on pumping that shit out of the ground faster. If anything, you should be bitching about nuclear regulations since the US should be building next generation nuclear, instead of wasting metric shit tons of cash running bullshit baby boomer built nuclear plants.
