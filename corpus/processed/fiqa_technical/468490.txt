"Try the general stock exchange web page. http://www.aex.nl I did a quick trial myself and was able to download historical data for the AEX index for the last few years. To get to the data, I went to the menu point ""Koersen"" on the main page and chose ""Indices"". I then entered into the sub page for the AEX index. There is a price chart window in which you have to choose the tab ""view data"". Now you can choose the date range you need and then download in a table format such as excel or csv. This should be easy to import into any software. This is the direct link to the sub page: http://www.aex.nl/nl/products/indices/NL0000000107-XAMS/quotes"
