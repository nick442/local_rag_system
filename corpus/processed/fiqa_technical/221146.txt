actually there is a surprising amount of libertarian politics i do agree with; i even think most of Ron Paul's criticisms are valid - i just disagree with almost all of his solutions. They're politically and economically untenable. Did you mean comments like my first comment or like my second? My first was inflammatory, sure. But if Paul actually has a plan in place for how we'll make do without the FAA, which his budget eliminates without further note, along with most cabinet departments and a host of other organizations, I am eager to hear it.
