I don't see the problem with what they proposed. Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc don't run charities, they charge for their services. And you better believe that cost gets passed down to the consumer one way ir another. Verizon wanted to itemize this charge directly on your bill. Big whoop. I'd prefer a little bit of transparency in where, exactly, my money goes when I pay a bill.
