Yeah that is definitely the venue. I worked for a concert promoter that used Ticketfly. Unless they've completely changed their fee structure over the past year and a half a $20 ticket would have roughly a $5 service fee. The only reason I could think of it being that high is it being a big venue and their facility fee being high
