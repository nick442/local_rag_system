Major in whatever you find interesting. Don't look at college as a pathway to a job, but the time where you learn how to learn. Your undergraduate major has very little to do with what jobs you're able to do unless you limit yourself (all you). I'm a software engineer that ended up in this industry after having worked in: Video Games (Midway primarily, contract for others) Military Intelligence (former CTM, US Navy) Network Video and now algo/quant. No college degree. My wife has a degree in anthropology and prior to raising our kids she was a particle accelerator operator/technician. She studied what physics she had to in her off time and landed the job. Honestly just focus on increasing your capacity to learn, especially stuff that's hard and doesn't come naturally. That'll help you get pretty much any job once you're out.
