Your wild tangents and attacks on liberal straw men demonstrate to me that continued discussion along these lines is futile. I have stated that it is a lesser evil to force business owners to serve the public without prejudice than it is to allow prejudice to thrive unabated in the private sector. You have said nothing regarding this point; you have only repeated your ideological stance that property rights are paramount without providing any evidence to show why this is preferable.
