"That depends on where/how you're charging. A Model 3 with a 55kWh battery will take less time to charge than a 75kWh battery. Supercharger charges at 120kW, so the charge times would be: 55kWh / 120kW = 0.4583 hours = 27.5 minutes 75kWh / 120kW = 0.625 hours = 37.5 minutes The appeal of an EV though is charging at home. If a user has a NEMA 14-50 installed that does 220v @ 40amps maximum, it offers 8.8kW of charging. So: 55kWh / 8.8kW = 6.25 hours 75kWh / 8.8kW = 8.52 hours Other options exist for charging at home, such as the High Power Wall Charger, could do 220v @ 72amps, or 15.840kW. 55kWh / 15.840kW = 3.472 hours 75kWh / 15.840kW = 4.735 hours The ""time to charge"" issue is more relevant for road trips, since the the average driver does less than 200 miles per day, and their car spends more time at home potentially plugged into a charger than driving. I have a 75kW battery in my Tesla, and it's nice to know that I could drive it to ""empty"" and then charge back up fully once I get home. Better yet, it will charge completely to full in about the amount of time I should be sleeping at home. The ""range anxiety"" is closely tied to the charging concerns, and with the Tesla Supercharger network doubling by year's end and continuing to grow (both Tesla's 480v charging network, as well as other plug-in options like Chargepoint, Blink, EV-GO, etc), charging is less of a gamble and more of just simple planning. Apps like ""PlugShare"" allow you to see crowd-sourced reports of EV plugs, what types they use, type of charging available, cost, availability, and more. You can plan your drive to use Superchargers on the road, and then plan your destination or evening stop in a place with charging capability. I think it's only a matter of time before destination chargers develop a valet system like what Tesla does at many Superchargers. Otherwise, by the end of 2017, you should never be too far from a Supercharger, an EV charging station, or even some kind individual who will ""lend you some juice"" to get you where you're going."
