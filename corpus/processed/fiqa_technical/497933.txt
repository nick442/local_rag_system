I think the government has been pretty cautious about this. The housing bubble only started taking off when we dropped our prime interest rates to match the US. Since then the finance minister has personally called up banks when he felt like they were dropping rates too low and I think there's been some fairly strict rules about down payments. I had to put a 35% downpayment for my bungalow in the city since I was on contract. Most of my friends put in around 25%. Everyone in Canada think the housing market is inflated and everyone is trying to calm it down.
