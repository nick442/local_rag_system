Aside from my preamble and conclusion, do you agree or disagree with the principles that I have stated? If you have studied a wide range of works and have drawn an objective conclusion that contradicts the principles that I've stated, then please let us debate them. I'm not interested in ad-hominem mud slinging. I will however defend myself against one claim which I see as the most dangerous: you accuse me of playing an 'enlightenment game', implying that the process of demonstrating new ideas and encouraging thought is somehow a cheap or underhanded tactic. I reject your implication.
