"I'm curious to know if you or any of your relatives have ever been declared as being mentally ill or having a psychological disorder. Worst case scenario, let's say it is a ""con operation."" In that case, that just makes all of the psychologists(and other people who aided them) look smart and the general public(which I already agree with) look stupid. If most of psychology is all BS, then that just makes everyone else stupid for spending all of their money to get ""treated."" And, really if we are that stupid (stupid enough to believe such a huge lie) I would then agree with the (25% of americans suffer from mental illness) statement because you have to be pretty stupid to be told such a huge lie and not figure it out. Another thing: if it is so easy to tell that psychology is a scam, then why is there (in general) cross-field(scholars from physics, biology, history, language, medicine, etc) acceptance of psychology as a science?"
