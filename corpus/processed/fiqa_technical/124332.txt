Or perhaps you like feeling superior to people and you forget that you should treat people with some basic respect by default. There's no reason to be openly rude to begin with. Yes my statement was overly general, and I later admitted I didn't know about what I was talking about and should have qualified better. But generally I have had good interactions with most people on reddit even when disagreeing with them. I love conversation and learning things and actually have very little problem with being called wrong. It just rubbed me the wrong way how your comment needed to personally belittle me through direct insults to get a point across when I was stating a general opinion. Your words didn't help to illustrate your point or advance the discussion, only to be insulting a rude. Yes, this is the Internet and I should post on reddit like I have all the other message in the past and not try to fight the rudeness, hostility, and general rude and abrasive behavior of posters by default, but I've seen so much better here day after day. I try to treat people here with the utmost respect even when disagreeing with them. I just thought I would point out how off putting your comment is, and how unnecessary that attitude would have been because I would have admitted the same thing without your insults. Also, you may not be a douchebag, but your last response uses the same belittling attitude of your other posts in this thread, and all of your claims about me could be made about yourself (with some minor tweaking). I would rather just have civil conversations on reddit where I consider everybody friends by default, instead of the rest of the Internet where I consider everybody as savages with alanonymity who attack others for pleasure and lulz.
