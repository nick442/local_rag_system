They have data on their own CURRENT inventory- but if they had in theatre data set? They could do a number checks and references that'd be WELL worth the investment. For example: They couldCross compare audience viewing for statistically meaningful overlap for particular genres and movie types. I.e. We see that big grosses for horror movies don't actually align with our viewer's habits, so despite the studio playing up that metric as a success factor, we instead won't pursue adding more horror films to our library. That's just off the top of my head, but I beleive a valid counter to your argument you should consider.
