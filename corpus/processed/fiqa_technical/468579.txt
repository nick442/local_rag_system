For a company the size of Amazon a 1% increase in prices is substantial. Many of their products are in fiercely competitive price sensitive markets. There are some products that people would notice a 1% difference from competitors. So the actual increase would have to be concentrated on a smaller subset of products that are not as price sensitive. However, that would still mean reduced sales. In short, I don't think amazon is foregoing a 50% bump in profits if they could get it. Also a 5% SGA cut is absolutely enormous for a lean organization. In any one year that would mean an effective ~10% cut once you factor in inflation.
