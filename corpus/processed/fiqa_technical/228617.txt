> Never said that. Huh? Did you NOT say: * Governments **taxing** people people too much that's causing deflation. I mean, there are some out there who claim that it's *inflation* that is fiscal. While I also think that's an interesting and particular theory, the theory that *deflation* is fiscal is a view that one just doesn't encounter often. Which is why I'm interested in seeing what sort of sources and/or evidence this theory flows from. > You don't **believe** taxes are deflationary? You're asking me what I believe in? I believe in the old-school, neoclassical view on the matter.
