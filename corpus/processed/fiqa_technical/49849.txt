In a very basic sense you can only issue a dividend from distributable profits, which in practice is usually the businesses retained profits. As a new company you will not have any retained profits and therefore technically no distributable profits. In practice though, many companies issue interim dividends before the year end, however you are best taking professional advice as to whether you are in a position to do this. If the company pays out dividends in the first year and then makes a loss you will have been deemed to make an illegal distribution. The 'dividend' can then actually be treated as loan rather than a distribution but there are potential tax implications there. See ACCA guidance here on Illegal Dividends. A Chartered Accountant will be able to advise you accordingly.
