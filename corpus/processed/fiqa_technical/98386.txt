They're easily taken advantage of just like H1 visa folks. People can cry about expectations all they want but the real world isn't the world people expect. If there is advantage to be taken some people will take it. And it's not DACA getting the better end of the stick that I can assure you. As someone who consults executives and leads companies through transformation - forget the world you *want and expect*. First we deal with the world *that is* and we're honest so we can change it. Expecting others to do what you wish is a redline throttle into a brick wall. What you want or expect doesn't fucking matter so drop it. Get real with the field you're given to work with. Then change that.
