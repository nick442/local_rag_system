These spots could easily be filled by MSFT, but they're going to do whatever they can to make you think they can't be.. The problem with the programming and computer engineering industry is that anyone smart enough to be good at their craft can probably put food on their table on their own (subcontracting, developing their own software, consulting, etc.). In other words, they have plenty of leverage in salary negotiations. Foreigners are a different story. I've worked with plenty, and most are great at what they do. But, the biggest barrier they have that keeps them from going into business in the Western market themselves is often their communication ability, or the fact that they are so specialized in their knowledge that they aren't very business savvy (and xenophobic ignorance by many Westerner's, to be honest). Put those two factors together, and I'm more than willing to bet that MSFT gets a fat discount during negotiations, that saves them way more than the 10g's that the Visa's would cost.
