>You are watching the wrong stuff. TV is in a Golden Age. I agree, but at the same time the bottom-end of the programming spectrum is taking a nose dive. For every Mad Men or Breaking Bad there's five Jersey Shores or Khardashian-grade toxic waste. The divergence is wider now than ever. Personally, I don't really mind because I barely have time to watch the good stuff anyway, but I otherwise weep for humanity.
