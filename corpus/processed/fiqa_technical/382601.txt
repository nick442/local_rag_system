I worked with both of them at Apple some time ago. Scott tries to be nice to people, but is realistic and gets difficult assignments because of his reputation for getting things done under pressure. Jon is more of a dreamer type. Of course mileage always varies. I wish them all the best of luck. As for people outside Apple who do this fanboy thing like you do, for your own sake please grow up.
