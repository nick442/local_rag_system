Because you have one major bank saying they don't want to be involved with bitcoin, and another saying that they may go deeper in to it. It's interesting just because of the contrast of the two. Personally, I suspect there's a lot of low hanging fruit in cryptocurrency trading, especially given that most people in on cryptos seem to be retail individuals like ourselves, and probably relatively unsophisticated.
