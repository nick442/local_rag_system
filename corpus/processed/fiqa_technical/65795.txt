It should go without saying (should being the key word) that you must pay employees enough so that they stop thinking about money. If your people are under that thresshold, these points aren't as powerful. Underpaid people will always underperform, mentally check-out, look for a new job, etc. Being underpaid is like being on fire. Before anything else can happen, this must be addressed. Once they're above the thresshold and money is no longer a motivator, that's when you need these things to happen. Compensation sort of falls into the law of diminishing return. More is always better..to a point. I've read that point cited at $75-77k in the US. After that, people aren't working solely for compensation anymore.
