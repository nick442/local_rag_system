What are single stock futures? Futures that are based on a single underlying stock value? What is the norm in this case then? A basket of stocks of companies that work in similar fields, thereby allowing you to bet on the fate of a particular market(like betting against the oil industry after learning of the fact that solar energy has become very cheap?)? Also, won't the price of the stock of the company itself be a more accurate indicator and helper in the price discovery process(say, BP stock price goes down and GreenEnergyInc.'s value goes up?) than the price of a derivative based ON it? EDIT: You have already answered the aforementioned question in your original reply.
