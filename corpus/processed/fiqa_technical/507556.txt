> In many cases we are actually wasting energy by first burning coal to generate electricity, only to convert it back to heat again. Yes and no. Thermodynamically, you are correct in some cases. What we gain, nowadays, with electricity generation is lower distribution costs and flexibility. The value of that far exceeds the cost of any thermodynamic losses. If it didn't, we wouldn't be using it quite as extensively.
