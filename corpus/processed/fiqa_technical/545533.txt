That isn't stopping the market from seeking unhealthy norms: lowest paid workers, maximum price service/product the market will bare. Which would be fine if EVERY individual could and would stand up and fight for a livable wage. But we are all too busy trying to make a livable wage that we don't have the time or resources to stand up and fight.
