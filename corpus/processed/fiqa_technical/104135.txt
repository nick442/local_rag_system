Wasn't trying to be combative. Apparently I came off that way unintentionally, I think there is a distinction between a real monopoly and what amazon is/is becoming that is important to distinguish. I can respect choosing other options because you think they are effecting the marketplace too heavily, just wanted to point out a monopoly would be a different problem.
