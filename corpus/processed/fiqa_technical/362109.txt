Per the Washington Post, [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/25/AR2010122502600.html): *The BPP's inflation measure is markedly different from the government's. The economists average all the prices culled online, meaning the basket of goods is whatever you can buy on the Web. (Some items, like books, are most often bought online. Others, like cats, are not.) Plus, the researchers do not weight certain items' prices, even if they tend to make up a larger proportion of household spending.* *Still, thus far, the BPP has tracked the CPI closely.*
