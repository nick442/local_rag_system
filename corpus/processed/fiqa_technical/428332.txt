"Also, do not trust anyone who phones you up. If someone phones up, claiming to be your bank, and trying to ""sort out this situation""; how do you know it's your bank? You've given the scammer your phone number - it could be the scammer calling. Only discuss this with someone at the bank when you have phoned them."
