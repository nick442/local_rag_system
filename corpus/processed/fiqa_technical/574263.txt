I'm not going to address everything here, we are politically too far apart for much meaningful dialogue. But I only made the claim workers should be paid a living wage. Not give her more because she has kids. I have no clue how that wasn't clear. Social safety nets can provide for large families, I obviously don't think anyone's wage should be based on being a teenager living at home etc. Notice how you defined value, it is a very subjective opinion. I think human lives have value beyond measure. This is certainly not the case in reality. And thus a mother can work 80 hour weeks yet be homeless. That is ok with you? I understand pragmatism, but I believe we can do better. You can worship the market or invisible hand. That's fine. I personally find my values and ethics outweigh any allegiance to any given system. I, on the other hand, find our current corporate oligarchy ridiculous. This isn't capitalism. This is not a free market. Not even close.
