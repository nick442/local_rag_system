"I was there a couple weeks ago minding my own business and this short little overweight lady waddled up to me and asked for help. (Which I'm used to, I'm [tall](/r/tall). *""Can you reach that for me?""* and the like.) But this was a Walmart employee picking an order for an online customer. She had a regular shopping cart and was trying to load a *heavy* ""wooden"" entertainment center in the cart. I was trying to be the nice human that I usually am and help, but it was all I could do to muscle this thing in the cart. She needed a flatbed cart. (But oh what a delicious payday that would've been if a customer had hurt himself loading an order at the request of a paid Walmart employee! :eyeroll:)"
