"To the same people commenting on the Laffer curve being not true on another post, here ya go. This is how you don't collect taxes at exorbitant rates. Government is greedy and dumb, while private enterprise is greedy and smart. They will never get what they want because the people with the money are smarter than those writing the rules. Go put Elon Musk alone in a room with Maxine Waters and he will own Inglewood, Hawthorne, Lawndale, and Lomita in an hour as she embezzles some off the books ""donation."" And, for the record, those communities would be a thousand times better for it. George Steinbrenner DIED at the exact right time for his family to not have to pay 55% on the estate. They paid nothing. In New York State. The second bastion of high taxes, and they still got fleeced for 55% of one of the most valuable sports franchises in the world."
