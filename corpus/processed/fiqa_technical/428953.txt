My first credit card was a JC Penney card, 30-ish years ago. I had a steady job paying maybe $11/hr at the time, and putting that on the application (with no other long-term debts) was all it took. They gave me a card and a $4100 limit!! I bought some clothes and stuff there every month or so, and paid the bill in full every month by the due date. After a few months of that, I was able to apply and get approved for a Visa card (having the JCP card already helped). After that, just keep on buying and paying in full every month. Eventually you'll buy a car, and the credit history from the cards will help you get approved for that. Continue making your payments on time every month. Same with a house/condo (just bigger). Basically, don't spend more that you can afford, make your payments regularly and on time. Pay in full--do NOT just make the minimum payments..that's a recipe for disaster! Don't miss payments, and try not to be late on them. A late payment once in a great while isn't the end of the world, as long as you pay the late fees and interest charges.
