That is very true. I should have used the qualifier that they basically only do domestic travel. I have never tried to red-eye with them, but I guess they don't do it much, if at all. However, if you have freedom, they are awesome due to their policies on: * changing tickets (no fees, just fair difference and you keep the credit until you use it even when you buy the cheap fair), * they don't fuck around with 24 hour cancellation policy (if you decide to cancel, no question/pressure, they just refund the money), * [their rewards program is arguably the best if not one of the best](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/best-worst-frequent-flier-programs/story?id=13693563#.UIlyFK28FQI), * they don't charge to check bags, * **their boarding process get people on the plane in 15 mins instead of 30 or 45 mins** (my favorite part of SW after recently flying AA after like 10 consequitve SW flight), * [they are the most on-time airline in the US](http://www.forbes.com/2010/02/18/americas-on-time-lifestyle-travel-tech-airlines-jet-blue-southwest.html), * and they give away drink tickets like candy on halloween
