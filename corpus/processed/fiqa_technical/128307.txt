There was this /r/offmychest post yesterday from a person claiming to work for a large investment bank as part of their default risk modelling team. The poster claims that the commercial and real estate lending divisions have been fudging numbers regarding default risks due to a lack of oversight and a bunch of bad commercial loans are about to become due. They further claim that a rise in interest rates could prevent many commercial properties from being able to properly ~~finance~~ refinance their loan. Here is the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/77a1vw/i_work_in_bankingfinance_risk_management_i_am/. Any one have any thoughts? I also found this link on the Mises blog (though it is a year old) that discusses how delinquency rates on commercial and industry loans have been steadily rising since bottoming out in 2015: https://mises.org/blog/delinquency-rates-rising-new-crisis-approaching. Could be something to keep an eye on. I would love to see some more updated data on delinquency.
