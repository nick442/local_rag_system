>ever heard of unions? They love seniority. One of the main reasons why labor intensive manufacturing has left the midwest and new england. Unionized industries like airlines and auto manufacturing have seen most major firms go bankrupt in the last decade. >Over time, this is how asian countries will take over with their education and work ethic being at the top of their values. This could happen but I think Asian aversion to innovation will prevent them from racing past the US. Becoming a developed country shouldn't really be that hard. There is an easy playbook followed by Japan, South Korea etc. Leading the global economy in a rich country is a much more difficult task. >and as for those who went to college, did poorly, picked bad majors, and are wondering why the fact they went to college isnt landing them a plush job, welcome to how it has always been. Just doing the minimum of going to college hasnt been enough for a very long time and people were naive to think that there was ever a golden path or ticket to success. This is Obama's base: entitled whiners who need the government to give them goodies because they have no marketable skills.
