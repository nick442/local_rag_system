You are grossly wrong. COL differences are nowhere that big. Especially for a younger person, for which buying a house is not on the table. I've done the math - I had to, as I received a bay area offer. The cost of most of the things you spend money on (travel, household items, material goods) will hardly change. It's only housing, which is not a big enough of a expense to come even close to your outlandish claim. I'm tired of people who have no cold hard facts and simply parrot what they've heard elsewhere regarding this situation. If you don't know what your talking about, it's best you keep your mouth closed.
