Shareholders are NOT better off in the *long* run if they drive the legitimate streaming companies out of business. If they took 20% less, they'd had a reliable stream of income for virtually forever. If they don't, they collect more for a few years, then get busted down to zero when the streaming companies go out of business and people just go back to stealing music.
