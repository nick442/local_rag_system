I nowhere mentioned equal amount of assets. The point of my argument was wealth disparity. And, unless the rich pay more in taxes; that disparity will grow. Increasing tax from 24.7% to 50% would still leave the wealthy with a mountain of wealth; but, will help contribute greater to the overall economy. What do you think will need to happen in about a decade, when millions of American's are left permanently unemployed by automation?
