Cable companies that sell internet access realize that high speed internet enables high speed TV distribution that bypasses cable. Cable companies (which operate as de facto monopolies) don't want competition for the highly lucrative and powerful TV distribution business and therefore use whatever dirty tricks they can come up with to frustrate both internet at higher speeds and internet provided by any other entities. They know it's ultimately a losing battle but they'll remain obstinate for as long as they can.
