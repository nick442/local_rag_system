"> Do you know why it's so popular? I thought other trucks are pretty good too. Well, for starters because FORD (the company) is considered a more solid brand/firm -- the two chief competitors (Chevy/GMC & Chrysler/Dodge) are considered by some (many actually) to have ""soiled"" themselves in the financial crash of 2008-2009. I know many previously ""loyal"" GM fans who swore after it became ""Government Motors"" that they would never buy another GM.. and the vast majority of them switched over to Ford. And Chrysler -- having gone through various owners -- is likewise looked at somewhat dubiously by many. You have to keep in mind that business owners are (generally) not just thinking of a singular vehicle purchase, but of a series of such purchases (often over years and decades), as well as the supply of parts, the availability & consistency of service & support (whether internal in company ""shops"" or at dealers) and so on.. anything & everything that brings those things into the ""question mark"" territory, tends to reduce confidence, and thus shift the focus onto other brands that seem to be more ""stable"". >You're right that they get burned out quickly, although I'd think there'd be a longevity version of trucks by now. That would be part of the reputation of the F series, and especially the F150.. it is widely considered to be one of the BEST (longest lasting, least problematic) vehicles made. >aren't toyota trucks very long living? Yes and yet no. The history/reputation has been a bit more ""spotty"" than with Ford. The same is true of Dodge, GMC and the other brands. Certainly there will be people who think/believe/state otherwise -- I myself own a Dodge that I am generally VERY happy with, and I know others who have Chevy/GMC and other brands and are likewise quite happy with them -- but over the years, Ford has undisputably built up a solid reputation with it's truck line."
