*People clamoring for more and more regulation will always be disappointed because businesses will always find ways to get around it.* This is only true in America where we have too many retards who believe regulation doesn't work (thus you get broken regulation you basically wished for). Canada's financial regulatory system (which actually has teeth, unlike their American counterparts) did a magnificent job avoiding the financial meltdown.
