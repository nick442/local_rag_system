Your chart and your claim don't match. You're looking at one marginal tax rate and saying that its historical change doesn't impact overall federal revenues. This is true on the surface, but you're only looking at one aspect of the overall picture. Saying that federal revenue doesn't correlate with tax rates is disingenuous. An across the board cut or an across the board increase will both have significant effect. Likewise an increase to the top marginal tax rate by itself would have an impact as long as there were no corresponding cuts or increased expenditures to wipe out the impact. A budget is a budget whether it's a great big one like the federal government's or a small one like a household budget. Revenues and expenses need to match in order for the budget to balance. Increasing tax rates increases revenue from everyone within the affected tax bracket. It makes an impact.
