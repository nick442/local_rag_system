"I hear the ""West Virginia Strong"" argument all the time. It follows along the lines of ""we've survived doing the same shit for so long we'll survive doing the same shit now."" They think as long as coal is coming out of the mountains, WV will continue to chug along and everything will be peachy. I'm not a native, but I've lived in the area long enough to notice a few things about some of the people in the area. There's a nonsensical pride concerning hard labor in many of the coal mining towns. A family tradition dating back to when children could work at the ripe age of ""when dad died in the mines."" They're proud of the tradition, and if their children want to do something else with their lives, it's looked at as foreign and weird. It's almost as if they don't want their children to have better lives than they grew up in. The whole phenomenon blows my mind."
