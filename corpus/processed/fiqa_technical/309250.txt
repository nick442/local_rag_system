"This shows that in each market (US and Canada) the company is registered with the appropriate regulatory organization. OANDA is registered in the US with the National Futures Association which is a ""self-regulatory organization for the U.S. derivatives industry"". OANDA Canada is registered in Canada with IIROC which is the ""Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada"". The company does business in both the US and in Canada so the US arm is registered with the US regulatory organization and the Canadian arm is registered with the Canadian regulatory organization."
