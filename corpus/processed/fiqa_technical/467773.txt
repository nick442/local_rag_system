Foreign policy being regime change in Iraq was the goal, the method was invasion to achieve this, and nation building to avoid the need for continuous military presence. Conflating military action with foreign policy objective, as you did when conflating government action with military action, are just ways of obscuring things by using more vague terms. We’re talking about outsourcing military functions. There are many things the government does which are not wasteful and which private enterprise is not well suited for – but that’s another debate. If you measure outsourcing of military functions by headcount or expense, the same point is made, which is the military (and associated) functions are outsourced and there’s no reason to think this won’t continue or increase. Really, I don’t even see this point as being controversial or debatable. The extent may vary but so does everything. It's a reality and it's not going away.
