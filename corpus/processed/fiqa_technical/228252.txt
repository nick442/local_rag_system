> You must not understand how profitable advertising is to Google and YouTube and Facebook.. it is very very very profitable, and AdBlock can't block those ads. I DO understand, that's why I am making noise now, because all of them are going to be in big trouble soon. Ad block DOES block those ads. 100% of them. I see _zero_ ads. Nothing on facebook, nothing on google, nothing on youtube. There are ad blockers for all of it.
