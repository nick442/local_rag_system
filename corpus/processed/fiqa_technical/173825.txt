This is a problem that is rampant in general on reddit. The general population seems to be undereducated, uninformed, unemployed, immature kids. Quite honestly, the only way to combat the problem is by making the subreddit private. By doing this you also run the risk of keeping out high potential members while accidentally letting in people that have no business being in here in the first place. This is probably why the creators included internet Karma, to give the collective subreddit the power to bring topics to the top that they would like seen and discussed while also allowing them to bury the crap they don't want to see. The only problem with that is those same uninformed members mentioned above also have the ability to vote. That is why we are attempting to generate a discussion here to get opinions from people that want to take the sub in a certain direction that voting alone cannot accomplish.
