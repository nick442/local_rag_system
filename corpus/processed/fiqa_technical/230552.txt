There is no reason that HFT in itself should be illegal. It provides a significant advantage to companies with access to those automated systems but then, we might as well eschew NASDAQ and go back to the manually traded days of NYSE or ban day trading in favor of long-term investing. What is problematic is that they place and immediately cancel large number of orders for two reasons - to test the market and to slow down the competition. A proposed ~~tax~~fee to charge for cancellation of non-executed trades seems like an interesting solution.
