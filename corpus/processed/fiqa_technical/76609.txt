"I came across a text when I was reading my textbook a few days ago that talked about how China surpassed Japan as world's second largest economy in 2011. I read some articles and I thought it was really interesting to see how China is developing so quickly. I understand to have economic growth, you have to have increase factors of production; and that technology is the fourth factors of production. From an economic standpoint, how do one measure ""tech?"" And what do you mean markets innovate, while governments help? Thank you in advance. -Curious student"
