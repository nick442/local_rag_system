The questions what the price of the mechanisms would have been if there were several large scale manufacturers in the marketplace. Given that few people have bothered to try,it suggests that there is little opportunity to produce these mechanisms for a healthy profit and make them cheaper than swatch. However, the industry is probably a very conservative slow moving beast (little new technology impacting them in the last 50 years) and heavily brand focused, so it sounds very plausible to me that there has been a missing efficiency opportunity. We'll certainly find out in the coming years.
