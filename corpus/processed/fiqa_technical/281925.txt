Because the current government policies, yes the ones enacted by President Obama, favor cash accumulation over capital purchases. Nothing has changed in eight years and I don't think that Donald Trump or the Republicans in congress want to change that. It is a chicken and egg problem. Business won't increase capital until demand in the market increases and demand in the market won't increase until business increases spending. Now then the one bright spot for the market is that the Boomers are entering the twilight of their lives. This generation accumulated a massive amount of wealth that is being inherited by their money starved children.
