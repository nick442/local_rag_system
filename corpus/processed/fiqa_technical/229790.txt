"Okay Stevie. Let me introduce you to a distinction that may help you as you go through life. You can thank me later. The distinction is between prescription and description. What you get when you look in a dictionary or a reference source like Wikipedia for a definition of a word or phrase is a descriptive example. It's a description of a common usage but not a limitation or restriction. You seem to have confused this descriptive resource with a presciptive edict such as a law against parking in a handicapped zone without plates that allow you to do so. The latter is a hard-fast rule that cannot be altered and that seems to be what you think a dictionary or Wikipedia represents. That's not what how it works. You can go ahead and write a letter to Jimmy Wales yourself if you like but I'm sure he's on my side. Besides which, if you don't like the phrase ""patent troll"" in reference to LEGO then I'm happy to work with you and say instead they're ugly mutherfucking thugs that abuse the patent system. Does that work out better for you? Anyway, glad you took the time to make sure the message was crystal clear."
