It goes both ways. You can work hard, take pride in your work, but if you are not simultaneously participating in the organization of your co-workers, taking your employer to task to provide a living wage, and are unwilling to show up on the picket lines when your employer locks their employees in the building overnight or threatens your fellow working man with INS investigations of him and his whole family for speaking up, then you might want to consider that your position is less about self derived principles and more about you being well trained.
