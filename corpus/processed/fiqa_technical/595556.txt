> Just like you don't wear hockey skates to play football, you don't wear stupid looking shoes to work in finance. Did you respond to the wrong person? I'm the one making fun of people wearing dumb as fucj square toed shoes here lol. My comment was that if the person above thinks I have a stick up my ass for making fun of his dumb as fuck shoes, he's too insecure to be in finance.
