I have to agree with Krazy, its not the same thing. The mouse was not raised for food, he was just walking by. I live in a very rural area. I have all sorts of animals through my yard. From deer to yes, wild turkeys. I leave them alone. They are not bothering me. However, a turkey in a slaughter house is a different story. More to the point, if I thought I could, the big ass turkey walking through my yard, would be on my dinner table and I wouldnt care if I had to beat it with a stick to kill it. Its food.
