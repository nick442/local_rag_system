"Nothing you've provided does anything but prove you are wrong. The ""basic cop + nurse"" do not make $300k based on any stretch or interpretation of the data you've provided. The basic cop makes $70-80k with opportunity to make over 6 figures as a detective, if they pursue and make that rank later in their career. The basic nurse looks to make about $74k in LA, and I'm having trouble reasoning out how you figure that somehow increases by a factor of 2. You're exaggerating by a factor of 2 in both cases."
