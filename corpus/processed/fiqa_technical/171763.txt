Does MS have Android and iPhone apps? I think they can reach customers just fine. > The enormous success of the Chrome browser means that Chrome OS may yet achieve a similar kind of success. Chrome OS feels like a bargain basement desktop. It's ill-fitted to both tablets and more traditional computing. In its niche - smarphone-cored laptops - it's servicable, but that niche is small, and has Microsoft as competition on low-end x86 core laptops. Chrome OS, in my opinion, will get about the same level of success as OS-X, except without the high-ticket hardware helping to justify ever-widening per-unit profit margins (a situation that isn't likely sustainable either). Of course, I may be ivory-towering here from my Ubuntu-powered laptop.
