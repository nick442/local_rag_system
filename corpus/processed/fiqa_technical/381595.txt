A question that shoukd be asked by the employee is do you mind if I disagree with you. I just left a job because I refused to agree with a scope of work that looked liked it was written by drunks in a bar (which they admitted it was). They grilled me in a room for almost an hour trying to get my agreement with no access to my notes or anything. I just sat there and said no, went to my desk and resigned. Edited to add, while I was writing my resignation I was called in to HR and given a personal warning on record about misspellings on a mobile phone. Great place to work! Anyways start a new job Monday all good, More pay, they like disagreement they think it's healthy and my new boss was my old boss for 6 years.
