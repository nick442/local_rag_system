Yes there is regulation in place see here Quote from the page Instant-access savings accounts As with current accounts, if a bank is to reduce the interest rate on an instant-access savings account it generally has to give two months’ notice. Other savings accounts To change the interest rate on other savings accounts, such as those with a notice period and cash ISAs, a bank should give you reasonable notice that it intends to make a ‘material reduction’. A reduction is consider to be ‘material’ if you have £500 or more in your account and the interest rate falls by more than 0.25% at one time or by 0.5% or more over 12 months. This should give you enough time to move your money to another account, without penalty, if you are not happy with the reduced rate.
