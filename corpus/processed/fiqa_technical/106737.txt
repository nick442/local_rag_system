Not a bad article but pretty simplified and a little bit sensationalized. It's not like using math to figure out fixing wealth inequality is a novel idea. There are thousands of researchers and professors in political science, economics and mathematics that have applied their entire research careers on figuring out 1. How inequality has *actually* developed and 2. The best ways to fix it. You can find them in damn near any university in the United States. You want to read some good, peer reviewed, highly cited research and papers and income and wealth inequality, read anything written by Thomas Piketty or Emmanuel Saez, pretty much the preeminent inequality scholars in Western economics as well as select writings by Krugman or Stiglitz, both of whom have won Nobel prizes. Their works are more palatable for non-academic readers, but their biases (particularly Stiglitz) are more apparent. Still great reads though. I like that this article addressed the fact that to legitimately change the wealth distribution we need a huge range of programs and tax changes. There's no one right answer and every solution has it's downsides and externalities.
