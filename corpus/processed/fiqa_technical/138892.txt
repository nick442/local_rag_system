Mainly because I have it and you don't, I can make you do stuff for it because more of us perceive its value than bother about the paper you are holding. Picture if you will a moment in time, when the paper you are holding, represented the amount of gold you had at home, as time went by you spent all your gold and the amount the paper represented, became less and less and the amount of lunch you could buy with it became less and less. Today the day has arrived, that you have no gold left and what your paper represents is an empty coffer . . Move along . .people who can pay for their lunch are waiting and look, the paper they hold represents gold they have.
