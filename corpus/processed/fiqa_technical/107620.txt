Reddit has always had people paid to shill for nuclear, as did Slashdot before it. I rarely trust these threads to be genuine when there is a mad rush of seemingly well written pro-nuclear arguments instead of the usual mix of meme bullshit and irrational arguments and yelling. Something is just ALWAYS off about these threads.
