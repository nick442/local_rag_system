According to Apple, usage of passwords on phones went from 50% to 80% when they brought out Touch ID. It's a really cool and really useful feature, especially for people who had to enter long complex passwords frequently (e.g. enterprise users). When it's integrated into 3rd party apps it will make password managers like 1password, which are pretty much a necessity if you want your accounts to be secure these days, much more convenient to use. For me personally, it's nice to be able to leave my phone around without my family going through my messages and photos.
