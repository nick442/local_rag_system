What do you think happens when cash gets paid out to investors? People don't just collect the cash and stuff it in their mattress. They reinvest it, sometimes in other giant corporations, sometimes in start-ups, sometimes in government bonds. Some of it goes to fund R&D elsewhere, some of it goes to fund building bridges and roads, some of it goes toward buying houses. Ultimately, how much goes to each piece of the pie depends on the attractiveness of each opportunity. If there are a lot of good R&D projects that would generate good returns, people will invest in them.
