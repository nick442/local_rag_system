No kidding, I'm shocked. /s The flipper boom after the 2008 downturn basically means that anything affordable gets snapped up by an investor in a cash sale, they do some half-assed renovations, and then turn and sell it for double the original price. They out-compete low-end buyers during purchase, even if those buyers have outstanding credit, and then they move the house out of reach of those very buyers. $300k - $600k houses are everywhere around here. What isn't available are reasonably priced houses under $300k that might need some minor updating. Anything under that you can actually purchase is probably something barely above occupancy standards. There is *no* incentive to build or renovate affordable low end houses. None.
