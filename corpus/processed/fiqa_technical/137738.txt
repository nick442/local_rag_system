Technically, everyone would be fine with you not being insured. As long as you pay your fair share in taxes for the time you break a leg or something and suddenly you're really glad it doesn't cost you the arm as well, if you catch my figurative drift. It is literally proven by reality outside of the us that it works. It's sure as hell not perfect, but miles ahead of privatized health care. Low costs for the individual, access to every necessary treatment and drug for close to nothing.
