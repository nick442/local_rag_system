"They won't court you, but Delta's program is described [here](https://www.delta.com/planning_reservations/leisure_travel_program/status_match.jsp). In a nutshell they'll take your status level on another airline and matched it to a corresponding level with them for basically a trial period, during which you need to fly a certain amount to ""prove"" you're a frequent flyer and keep the status. The challenge you have to meet isn't bad at all and is basically just the same amount you'd need to normally be flying to keep your status for next year. Pretty much all the airlines have a standing setup to let you move your status over. Delta and United are fairly straightforward, you just apply and meet the challenge target for your level. US Airways is actually fairly dickish, they make you pay to even get the option to challenge (at least they did, I checked once and saw it was $600 for my level and stopped flying them whenever possible). Beyond that I don't have particular details, but it's easy to find."
