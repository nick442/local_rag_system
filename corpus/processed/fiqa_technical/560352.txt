"I remember the bailout propaganda using economic pseudo-science pretending it was well established that using debt and QE 1, 2 and 3 would only be good. They refused to prosecute obvious banking fraud too. I recommend the book ""Bailout"" by the IG for TARP. Geithner and Holder did everything they could to protect their banker buddies and Obama knew they would. However, I have to say, most of those hurt worst by it all voted for ""Hope and Change"" in disproportionate numbers. Baby Boomers not as much. Biggest bait and switch in American history."
