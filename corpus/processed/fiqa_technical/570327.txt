This reminds me of the guy that yells out at 3:48 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rls8H6MktrA). It's a pretty good video too. Worth watching if you agree with the general sentiment of this thread and have never heard an intelligent person offer a different perspective. Escape the bubble.
