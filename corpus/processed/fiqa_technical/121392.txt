I have an idea: Let's make home loans for people who traditionally wouldn't have been able to afford them, package them up into large packages of many loans, then sell, as a super-safe investment, a portion of that package designed to absorb the least of the default risk. The big investors will have a safe place to put their money; people will get houses they couldn't otherwise afford; and we'll get management fees from the former and high returns from the latter paying back their high-interest mortgages, satisfying the more-risky portion of the mortgage package that we're not selling (assuming not too many of them default, but that's unlikely, given that the housing market can only go up from here). Everyone wins!
