Paralegal? It varies from country to country (assuming SomeDutchGuy is Dutch), but in the US you just file papers, no lawyer or legal professional needed. That's why there's a limit on small claims court, so that small disputes can be settled without having to pay a lawyer (probably in excess of the disputed amount).
