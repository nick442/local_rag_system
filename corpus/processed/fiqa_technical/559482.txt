It certainly makes the NAFTA renegotiations unnecessary. Canada has already stated that it will not relax/weaken provisions in the Paris Agreement and will therefore be piling carbon tariffs onto US imports. There is hope however. Rejecting Trump's opinion on the matter, several states will seek out their own trade agreements with Canada and the world as they are committed to following the Paris Agreement on their own. (Governor Brown has even gone on to state that California will not remit any federal taxes for its independent, Paris Agreement trade deals)
