"That's true. I think the reason the chains are blaming other factors is that they are thinking ""our food hasn't changed much, so that can't be the problem."" However, people have more options now. Plenty of fast casual places make genuinely good food now, so people don't have to choose between a chain or a fast food place. And knowledge of cooking at home is increasing. So while they're kind of right in saying ""It's not our fault, we haven't changed, our customers have,"" that's a cop-out, they should say ""Our customers and the competition have changed, so we will too."""
