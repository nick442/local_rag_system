"I don't know why people ask these types of questions. Do you have an interest in the business world? Do you play the stock market, or do you at least follow some companies? Do you read about hedge funds? Do you read about algorithmic trading? If the answer is ""no"" to all of these, then consider something else. I've seen too many people in the industry who are desperately unhappy because they have no interest in the industry, but are hooked on the money."
