Teachers are important people in your child’s life. A good fit versus a bad one can make all the difference in your child’s success during that school year. Someone else has an equally important role in your child’s education, and that’s you, the parent! Many teachers see the relationship with parents as a key partner, and they count on your support to make the learning work.
