[Macabus](http://macabacus.com/learn) is one of my favorite resources. It walks you through the model, top to bottom - and best of all it's free. When you get closer to understanding what you want to do long term, your firm will probably recommend/pay for a more comprehensive program like Training the Street or Wall Street Prep. It's really hard to master this without working in the field, but if you can demonstrate that you have a strong grasp of the finance, accounting, and modeling (mainly excel) concepts, you will be a rockstar in your interviews.
