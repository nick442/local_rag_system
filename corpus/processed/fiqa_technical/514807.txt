So I just graduated from uni with a finance degree, this is what I would advise. 1) Figure out what you want to do and have a clear plan behind. Finance is very big so there are a lot of options to choose from. There is IB , ER , AM , Operations , corporate finance at an MNC , etc. Figure what interests you and focus towards it. 2) When you have figured out what to do , find out what you need to know to get the interview and full time offer. The internet is your best friend here , there are sites like wall street oasis , reddit , merger & inquisition , etc. All these have a wealth of information. 3) Your penultimate year internship is important , try to get the internship in the industry and role that you desire. So start networking , cold calling , cold emailing . Basically try to meet as many people you can who can help you reach your goal. This is pretty important. 4) Don't be a complete bookworm and focus only on your GPA. Join student socities that interest you. Participate in case competitions and stock pitches , this allows you to build a valuable skillset. Where in interviews you can always talk about it , and people will at least know that you have an interest or passion for finance. 5) And finally since you are at the last 1 and a half years of your college career, just try not to be jaded. A lot of people end up being like this cos they cant get that job they want or their GPA is crap. Try not to be them , always be fighting and hustling to get the best grades , best job you can. Cos this is prob the most crucial time in your college life
