Supply and demand.. It creates an equilibrium. Right now there is a food surplus so prices and production should go down. If there is a food shortage.. Prices should be allowed to go up which will create money-making opportunities and food production will increase. The Communist types of US agriculture policies don't fix pricing, supply or demand issues. Being able to produce agriculture products below cost creates a surplus that winds up getting dumped on other countries. Government subsidy corn from the US has decimated the agriculture industries in countries that don't subsidize agriculture like Mexico. Our communist types of agriculture policies hurt WAY more farmers than they help.
