"The cry of ""jobs"" doesn't justify environmental harm, racial prejudice, or people working without earning a livable wage. A job that doesn't allow someone to live with dignity and have their basic needs covered shouldn't exist. Personally, I'm all for automation. The faster they eliminate menial jobs the sooner we can start retraining our workforce for a modern economy. Hopefully, people will support the needed labor force shift."
