Did you read her article? She actually has depression and anxiety. Why do people always assume it is not diagnosed? And one, I admire her honesty. Many people lie for why they are sick. She didn't have to give the reason, and it was a valid one. If you don't have depression, anxiety, or some form of mental illness, you may have no idea how much one day, heck, even 5 minutes can restore you. Not every condition is all Hollywood psyche ward.
