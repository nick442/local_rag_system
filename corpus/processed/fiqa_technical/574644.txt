I apologize that I mixed you up with a previous commenter. On mobile, I can't see who posted and reply at the same time, and I should've been more careful. I am aware of immigration to Europe. All of my previous responses pertained to Scandinavia because I was replying to the Scandinavian comment specifically. I did not say that all of Europe is insulated geographically or that all of Europe is ethnically homogeneous. To address your question specifically, this paper would suggest that not only is the scale of illegal immigration in the EU much smaller than it is in the US (this paper doesn't make the comparison, but it does mention roughly half a million illegal immigrants enter Europe every year, which is about half that of the US), but also that illegal labor is an issue and it is growing as illegal immigration grows. https://archive.intereconomics.eu/downloads/getfile.php?id=323 So I guess we are at a bit of an impasse. I'm not sure I concede that Europe doesn't have this problem or that the US is unique in how supply and demand relate to labor. I do agree that the scale of the problem is different, so perhaps that is enough to continue discussion?
