"I wrote about it above.. my employer doesn't pay for the service, and isn't under any contract (other peer companies do pay for it). I'm partially a hero for completing the project for free, but that's another story. I also created the company and did the work outside of business hours, so that I wouldn't breach any conflict of interest rules. And being a government body, rather than a ""for profit"" corporation actually makes this kind of thing a lot easier to do, assuming you don't charge your employer money."
