I'm not saying I don't like the idea of on-the-job training too, but you can't expect the company to do that. Training workers is not their job - they're building software. Perhaps educational systems in the U.S. (or their students) should worry a little about getting marketable skills in exchange for their massive investment in education, rather than getting out with thousands in student debt and then complaining that they aren't qualified to do anything.
