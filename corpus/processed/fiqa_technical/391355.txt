This is a real problem. My current job doesn't even have IB hours (it's more in the 60 hr/week area), and I struggle with it just because of how much I need to be seated at a desk. With that said, I found [this post](http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-fitness/) recently and it really helped. I think it's pretty tough to actually develop/tone muscles etc. while working a job like this, but there's a lot you can do to control weight. The keys I've found are to limit what you're eating (especially sugar, junk, etc.), get up whenever you have a chance, and simply planning for shorter workout sessions.
