No, what I'm saying is that the extant regulations have created such massive overheads to compliance that *only* big businesses can operate in that market because of the expenses required to be compliant. Eliminating that overhead would reduce expenses and make it possible for a greater diversity of firms to exist, reducing the *average size of any individual firm*, and increasing stability through diversity.
