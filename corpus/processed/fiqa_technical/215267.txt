It's still an asset because you're keeping it on your books in an interest bearing account. And it's still also a liability because as you note, the money is not technically yours and you owe it to the renter until you settle at the end of the lease/term. Thus, I'd recommend setting the security deposit up in two accounts - an asset account and a liability account. The two will cancel each other out so it won't add to your net worth or equity. If the money is in a bank account that's shared for other purposes, you can create a sub account for the security deposit: Assets->Savings->Bank->Security Deposit: $1500 and the liability can simply be: Liabilities->Security Deposit: $1500 You of course can modify these to best fit your account structure (e.g. organize by property, etc). Finally, instead of transferring the money from an 'Income' account to your savings account, you transfer it directly from the liability account in one go:
