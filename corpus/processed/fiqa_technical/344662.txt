The other factor in increasing disability claims is that during an up economy, someone with a disability can probably get a job doing what little they are able to. Go through a down turn, and no employer is going to hire a worker that has a known disability that might in any way limit their productivity. So having a disability can go from having a lower paid job, to having no job and no chance of getting one.
