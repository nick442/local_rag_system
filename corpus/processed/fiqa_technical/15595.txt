Sorry to hear about your situation. It sounds like you would agree with the sentiment that we're being asked to put in more time without pay. To be honest with you, I worked retail when I was in HS, and I have many friends who were serially employed in retail. I've rarely seen retailers deviate from this pattern. Managers are mostly idiots, and employees are treated like sub-humans. Honestly, you just need to leave retail. It sounds like you're biding your time until something better comes along - that's the right way to look at it.
