Have you even looked at youtube? Every song or scene from any movie is available for free. Youtube is supposed to be about home videos, not stolen entertainment that would cost money to watch normally. Even with a plethora of options like netflix, itunes, amazon on demand, hulu, vudu, redbox, blockbuster, time warner vod, xbox live, psn on demand, people endlessly download movies and songs. We deserve to have laws like this.
