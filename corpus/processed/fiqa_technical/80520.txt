I find indexing minimum wage to inflation helps put upward pressure on non minimum wages due to behavior of humans. If a person working at say $30/hr sees someone working at minimum wage getting a pay raise, the person at $30/hr is going to feel like they are falling behind and more likely to ask for a raise. I do not shop at Wal-Mart due to how they treat their employees.
