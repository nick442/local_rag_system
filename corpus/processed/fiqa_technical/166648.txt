Unions can go away or be switched. It has to be done with a vote just as establishing one does. However, the rub is that these votes only come about if the membership wants it to begin with. You can bet that the union itself would discourage it. This makes it unlikely. Switching to another union (state or national leadership) would work the same way. Hiring a worker that doesn't want to be in a union is fine. Using that as a discriminator is the problem. Their decision to be in the union comes after they are hired, not before. I am not sure on all the legal stuff, but you cannot go out with the intention of hiring only people who will stay out of the union.
