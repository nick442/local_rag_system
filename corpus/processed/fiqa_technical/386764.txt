"EmploymentProTip, especially regarding boilerplate employment forms and larger companies: When you get to something disagreeable like that, line it out and initial it. I've done it several times over the years and nobody's ever come back to ask me about it. (Because they don't look at it - they just file it). **IF** they ever tried to enforce it, you just tell them to take a look at your contract. They're either going to end up with a) no enforceable noncompete or b) since they never counter-signed the agreement, it's not a valid contract (which still means - no noncompete) Note that (b) above might come back to bite you if **you** need to depend on the employment contract, but I'm not sure that's ever happened in the modern ""employees are disposable resources"" age. NOTE: While I am an attorney, this is not legal advice. Please seek the advice of an attorney licensed in your state."
