Quite the opposite, crony capitalism has caused all of these problems. Big cable? Subsidized. Big oil? Subsidized. Big banks? Bailed out. And the tax code changes they're putting through now, why do you suppose this is being done? The US has the highest statutory corporate rate in the developed world, on small and large businesses. This is anti-competitive because in order avoid steep rates you need to hire big teams of tax lawyers, accountants, and other overhead to handle the paperwork and manage liability for you. Not only that, but its to the point now where most business decisions are not undertaken with the heath of the company in mind, but with great consideration to how it will effect the company's tax liability.
