"i think we are roughly in agreement, but i should stress: > Can't blame capitalism for shitty politicians shitty politicians are a natural result of capitalism out of control - the big owners call the shots. the politicians that take the bribes win elections bc the money buys exposure thru (once again private) media. the politicians with any amount of ethics or servitude to their electorate will be starved of funds. they tend to lose. the evolution of the honorable politician to the corrupt one has been a consequence of obscene money. the sort of money that apple et al make. or the most insidious: the federal reserve, which is PRIVATELY owned by a cabal of the richest bankers. they get to print money to ""lend"" to the government at interest whenever the gov needs to issue bonds. they determine interest rates. their objective is to make more money for themselves. they are not there to provide a service to the people. TL;DR you cannot get non-shitty politicians without controlling capitalism. adam smith warned us 250 years ago in his seminal wealth of nations that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers: ""the interest of manufacturers and merchants . in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public .. The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention."""
