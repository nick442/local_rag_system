"Ever seen a very low price on near-rotten apples or tomatoes? Think the world hates tomatoes or apples ""from Solar energy""? Durrp! If you can figure out *which* industry hates electricity .. I'd like to short their stock. It would seem electricity is *not* tainted by its source. Just stupid politicians. The *only* cost that generates negative prices is the cost to the distribution system (the grid) that needs to drain its extra capacity. There's no cost from the marketplace for electricity. That's just stupid."
