"Not saying the trading activity in FACE is related or unrelated. But where do you see a 10Q released on 3/31? First of all, 3/31 is the last day of Q1. It is virtually impossible to have an entire 10Q prepared the same day that the quarter ends. Most 10Q/Ks are released approximately 6 weeks after the close of the quarter. In addition, look at EDGAR: http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&match=&CIK=face&filenum=&State=&Country=&SIC=&owner=exclude&Find=Find+Companies&action=getcompany The Q1 10Q wasn't released until May 4. On a side note - I was on a roadshow for an unrelated IPO a couple weeks back and the FB IPO consistently came up with brokers. Probably 80% said that their number 1 question from clients was ""How can I get a part of the facebook IPO."""
