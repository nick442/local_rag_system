Cleaning the skin with water and detergents did not help at all. The water and the detergent solution just flowed over the pores and the pores continued to be blocked. When the same skin was exposed to Clarisonic original 2-speed Sonic Skin Cleansing System, the pores instantly opened and the microscope revealed the dirt and grime popping out of the pores. This led to skin that was not only 100% clean, the absence of dirt in the pores made it feel soft to the touch.
