I'm expecting the opposite problem. We're going on a long road trip around the west. Reserved a Mitsubishi Mirage or similar. I'm fully expecting them to come back with a Ford Explorer all thrilled to tell me they had to upgrade me because all their sub compacts are gone. I do not want to take a truck on a 2000+ miles road trip. The difference in MPG becomes very significant with those kinds of miles. Counter point, we got married in a city with a very small airport. Expected to get an upgrade because they never had the tiny low-end cars.. except for that weekend. Drove around a Kia Rio all wedding weekend.
