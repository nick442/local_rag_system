For some reason you are using Uber's numbers. Lyft is not nearly as widespread as Uber. If you want to see how damaging this is to Lyft, you would have to show us Lyft's numbers. And you can probably assume this was the only one who got caught, not the only one who was doing it. Furthermore, the lost revenue largely falls on the drivers, not the company. Uber is trying to aggressively recruit drivers, including Lyft's drivers. If Lyft rides get cancelled more frequently, the drivers are likely to migrate.
