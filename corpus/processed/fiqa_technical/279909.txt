In the few places I worked in my younger years, the establishment lost the value of the counterfeit note when they attempted to pay it in at the bank - they simply won't honour the note. I remember working a New Years Eve one night and we had taken a few hundred pounds in fake twenty pound notes. The staff were given a strong telling off, because these note were effectively useless and it was up to the staff to check that the notes were genuine.
