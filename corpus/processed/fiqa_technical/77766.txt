You can't defer reporting of the RRSP purchases. The financial institution will report those purchases to CRA, and the CRA expects to see you report those purchases on your return. If they don't match, expect to be audited and to pay penalties. However, you can defer the tax deduction of those purchases until later years. That means you but you must have the RRSP contribution room available in the year you make the purchase. So if you have $50 000 of contribution room, you can contribute $50 000 all at once and deduct $16 667 in the next 3 years. However, if you only have $20 000 of contribution room, CRA will make your life very unhappy if you contribute $50 000 all at once. In that case, your best bet is to contribute enough to use all your contribution room and repeat each year as you get more contribution room. Also, you have a $2000 lifetime overcontribution limit. That means whatever contribution room you have, you can contribute $2000 more. But you won't be able to deduct that amount, and you don't get more overcontribution space each year.
