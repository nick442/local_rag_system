"Wow that's pretty bad with the passwords. I do have an account there which had my basic website up there but just with their default URL which is when I noticed how much facebook hated that and I hadn't gone through the process of connecting my domain name. I would have done more research if it was one that took payments or customer info but it's more of a hub for my work and the platforms I'm on so there wasn't that risk so I stuck it up there as a temporary measure, but it doens't seem like it is too good a one by the sounds for the long term. I also asked about this on r/webdev and I studied both buyshared and AWS (taking advantage of the ""free"" year) and I have now but the website on AWS (it took forever to work it out adn connect the domain but it is finally done now)."
