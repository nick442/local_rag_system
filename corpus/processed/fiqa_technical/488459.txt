Hmm. almost poetic. As someone who has worked for startups and firms as an consultant, and is an investor I have a unique insight on both aspects, so I really enjoyed this rant. I don't know if I necessarily agree with what she says, but I think what it comes down to is the uniqueness for every given situation. I've seen firms do a ~3 month project for 1.2million dollars. I've seen startups fail. I've seen startups not require investment money. If anything, no two situations have been alike actually. From the investment aspect, roughly 1 in 10 companies that receive investments do not fail, so it is an extremely risky business. The author has no insight to this aspect which explains her rant. From a coder standpoint, it is EXTREMELY frustrating being told a project has to be a certain way that will most likely guarantee its failure, or generally fuck it over, and it is being commanded from a high up 'investor' that never speaks to the software engineer directly.
