And this company's business model has been somewhat holding up for 6 years because you're in a minority. Even when I lived in London, reasonably near the cinema and with free time and disposable income, I think they'd have made money on me some months. I'm not saying it's a *viable* model in the long run, or that it isn't supplemented by other factors (potential partnerships with cinemas / selling data to advertisers), but that's probably a big factor in their gamble here.
