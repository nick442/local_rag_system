">Well put and, honestly, seemingly unavoidable. Yes, there is an aspect of it that I think is the equivalent to ""ocean tides"" -- there are ""winds and waves"" of fortune (which are often mistaken as entirely due to ""merit"", when in fact the ""merit"" may have been only a minor factor). >As I see it, RE is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and oversize are not absorbed. People have to live, so rentals will be key; but, they have already bloomed quite a bit. I'd agree. I've looked into (and decided to ""pass"") on the whole ""buy up a bunch of homes & rent them out"" line. There was definitely an ""opportunity"" with REO/foreclosure/distressed sale properties in the area, but after conferring and seeking advice from several *experienced* landlords, I have concluded that it is NOT the ""risk free/passive income"" mechanism that a lot of neophytes think it is; and there is substantial risk/effort involved, both in the form of capital investment (repairs, maintenance -- requiring both time & money) as well as the unpredictability/probability of an interrupted revenue steam (bad renters are deuced difficult/expensive to deal with) as well as other costs (significantly increased property taxes, especially on rentals, etc.) The truly ""big"" gains (to my understanding anyway) of being a landlord are the windfall ""cash out"" phase (where, having had renters paying the mortgage/interest, you get the benefit of the capital gain on the sale of the property) -- but due to what I *think* (and sincerely believe based on the dempgraphics of Boomer die-off), I am fairly certain that said ""payoff"" will not be anywhere NEAR as large in the coming decades as it has been in the past (if the payoff even exists at all, and isn't a net ""loss"", especially in light of the work/effort/investment involved). >Stocks will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced/willing withdrawals start happening from the Boomers. So, keeping it in stocks doesn't sound overly positive, unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced. Depends on what you mean by ""stocks"". The overall market is one thing, specific stocks can be quite a different story. (While it is an extreme example, note the [dramatic difference between AAPL vs the Dow during the past decade](http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1340654400000&chddm=493051&chls=IntervalBasedLine&cmpto=INDEXDJX:.DJI&cmptdms=0&q=NASDAQ:AAPL&ntsp=0) etc.) Basically, the whole idea of passive/mindless (""set it and forget it"") gains from investments being the path to ""wealth"" has to go bye-bye -- it was never really ""real"" to begin with (unless you ""timed"" the market just right), and the vast majority of the gains were nominal anyway. >For me personally and selfishly, I have 20 years minimum for retirement, so I'm fine qith the market trending sideways or down. It means that I'm getting more bang for my DCA buck and, 20+ years from now, I will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up. I guess I take the long-term historical view that the very concept of some ""guaranteed retirement"" was simply an aberration -- a lucky generation or two got away with it (sheerly by accident in the timing of their birth, something they really had no input into). Instead I think one will ALWAYS need to be ""working"" in some manner or another -- actively overseeing ones investments and remaining ""agile"" in response. And of course there is risk involved in that (as if there is really any reason we should expect there NOT to be? Anyone who thinks that way IMO is simply ignorant of the vast scope of human history). The best I think one can do is to TRULY diversify (and that does NOT mean ""mutual funds"") -- to separate your eggs into various ""baskets"", holding some major part in solid (as solid as can be) form (even with the possibility of zero return and/or some ""loss"" -- i.e. owning primary housing clear of debt, some PM's in physical form, etc); having other assets in what are fairly solid ""bets"" (based on demographic trends, company quality, etc); and then some things (several small bets) that are ""long shots"" but potentially high-return things (where just one ""win"" can not only offset a dozen non-performers/losers, but gain you a substantial *real* profit). Basically I think one has to use their mind and available information (which must be actively sought out and seriously analyzed/considered), and then even with all of that realize that there is a certain ""crap shoot"" aspect to everything, and that ""big winners"" are just as often either scam artists (who often get their comeuppance -- think Skilling/Enron); or who are just lucky shits who were in the right place, at the right time, were dealt the right cards AND subsequently made the right bets (due to [survivor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) and other biases we just don't often hear about the ones who hit 4 out of 5 of those things and who might have still been ""winners"" but just not large/prominent enough to gain fame & recognition, much less the 3 out of 5 whose gains were minimal or a wash)."
