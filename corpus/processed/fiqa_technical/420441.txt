Disclosure: I work for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. This is normal. The bank is giving you a discount on the interest rate in exchange for the automatic payments. Unfortunately, the bank has the power here; they have your mortgage, and they have the right to call your loan in full at any time, and foreclose on your house if you don't pony up. It's okay to not like being pushed around, but you need to know when to hold'em and when to fold'em, and your facing a royal flush with pair of 4s.
