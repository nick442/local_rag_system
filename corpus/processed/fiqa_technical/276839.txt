"By protected you mean what exactly? In the US, generally you'd get a promissory note signed by B saying ""B promises to repay A such and such amount on such and such terms"". In case of default you can sue in a court of law, and the promissory note will be the evidence for your case. In case of B declaring bankruptcy, you'd submit the promissory note to the bankruptcy court to get in line with all the other creditors. Similarly in all the rest of the world, you make a contract, you enforce the contract in courts."
