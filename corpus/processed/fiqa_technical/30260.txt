Once you start going down the bitcoin rabbit hole (I've tried not to go too far myself), two things become abundantly clear: * It is the perfect vehicle to hide theft (including graft); * It is the perfect vehicle to circumvent currency controls (China). For those two reasons alone you're likely to see *severe* controls - and if not controls, outright bans. It would be nearly impossible to ban/eliminate bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies), but the ecosystem necessary to sustain it could be crippled by such efforts.
