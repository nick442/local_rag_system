Wishful thinking. Like it or not, we exist in a global economy today. The U.S. has certain competitive advantages in that economy, and we need to build/expand them, but cheap labor is not one. The days when assembly/manufacturing workers could union up and command high wages (or, increasingly, even middle-class wages) are basically gone. And as another commenter here alluded to, workers can choose to take a job at lower wages, or.. not have a job. Go ahead and complain about CEO pay if you want. It doesn't change the basic argument of labor supply vs. demand that sets wages. Workers aren't owed some % of company profits.
