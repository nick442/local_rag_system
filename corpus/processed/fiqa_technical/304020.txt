Why should I have to prove anything? I am not the one making the claims. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If you are making a claim that ammonia washed meat is bad for people - something that has been going on for over 40 years and cleared by all scientists at the FDA - then you should have to provide the evidence for that. There is none.
