"In economics, the term ""middle class"" refers to the middle 50% of incomes, excluding the bottom 25% and top 25%. The bottom edge of middle class is currently a household income of $22,500 per year in the US. That's poor. Middle class and poverty are not mutually exclusive. They used to be, but they aren't anymore. Also, quoting a source talking about extreme poverty, and absolute poverty in a discussion of poverty implies you don't understand the difference. Stop pretending that just because a bunch of people in china now aren't starving to death the world's economies are ok. They aren't. They're broken, and getting more so all the time. Our rapid technological progress has masked the effects, but economic collapse is becoming more widespread, and change will be needed to eliminate the problem. If you need an example of what's fundamentally wrong, look at Greece. Nobody has a plan to fix their economic trouble. They just keep kicking the can forward hoping the problem will go away as it worsens."
