Keep in mind this is a great primer on *macro*economics, or how the economies and money supplies of societies as a whole work. It's equally fascinating and important to learn about the basics of *micro*economics, the other side of that coin (pun intended), or how individual people and businesses make decisions about production and consumption. You've probably heard of the laws of supply and demand which are really important for understanding things like how and why prices change and why some businesses and industries are more successful than others.
