"Per capita joint-stock market capitalization is strongly correlated (Pearson's r = .51) with the transparency.org corruption perceptions index (higher index score is cleaner, more transparent government). So if by ""capitalism"" you mean joint-stock capitalism the data suggests you're wrong. When I studied this about a year ago, China's per capita joint-stock market capitalization was a little over $2,000 while their corruption index was a miserable 3.5. On the other hand, the US had a per capita joint-stock market capitalization of about $38,000 and a pretty good corruption index score of 7.1. If you graph this regression on a log scale Morocco and Colombia occupy similar positions as China. The nearest statistical ""neighbors"" to the US are France and Norway. Are China, Morocco and Colombia less corrupt than the US, France and Norway?"
