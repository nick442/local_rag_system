Thanks for your comment! I don't understand what you mean by 'thinking their funny.. in the graph..?' I also didn't set out to influence you, it is statistics from sproutsocial with I elaborated on. I understand your cynicism of bad products, but how will people find out about your good product? It's about marketing, not sales. I 100% agree with your grandfatherThe whole point of the article is to encourage businesses and brands to storytell instead of sell. Thanks again for your time
