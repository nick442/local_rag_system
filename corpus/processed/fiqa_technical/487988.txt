The funny thing is that mom & pop type establishments usually prefer cash due to the merchant charges they have to pay to the credit card companies. Some of these are percentage-based & others are fixed like a per-transaction charge. In the long run, accepting 10k USD wouldn't be enough. They would lose more than that in people who don't have a card on them vs accepting both cash and cards.
