"He was Head of Public Health education in Sweden, responsible for (among other things) educating Swedish medical students on health trends. He identified wild areas of consistent ""positive"" ignorance (where wrong ideas can't be attributed to no knowledge) among the student population. This got him investigating how widespread these wrong ideas were in the Swedish public, which led him then to the EU, and then to all Europe and North America. Which then led to him creating a foundation to study this form of ""ignorance"" among educated people (where they do worse on statistical knowledge than would be produced by random results). The 3 areas they identified are Personal Bias (from limited personal experience), Education bias (from outdated teaching) and News bias (from ""the unusual sells stories""). I don't know that he's done surveys in 3rd world (I'd imagine similar results) but he's mostly trying to fight first world ""ignorance"" by getting people to recognize and reverse their thought errors (things are generally getting better everywhere, most people are in the middle, rich and poor are one solid ""bell"" curve, You should assume you are over-estimating things that scare you) This has huge implications for anyone doing planning -- as he points out ""no wonder people think you can never eliminate poverty"" when they don't know that we eliminated half of world poverty in the last 20 years."
