This is pretty much it. Plus if you actually get a kick out of the job you'll probably enjoy it more often than not. It's not unusual in your first couple of years to work really extreme hours (I've got a buddy in a well know US bank in fixed incomes for example, who works from 8am-11pm every day), but half the time you sort of enjoy the work that you're doing and the people you work with. It's not for everyone, don't get me wrong, but there's a lot of room for development as long as you're willing to put in a bit of hard graft.
