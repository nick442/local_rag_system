"I've come to accept the fact that all these people that hark on and on about ""moving up the ladder"" topped out in pay years ago and have no real understanding that the world is shaped more like a pyramid. You're not standing on a ladder with 3 people above you waiting to get on the roof and 3 under you waiting for the same. You're standing at the bottom of a pyramid with 3 people and only one of you makes that next step at which point two others are now standing waiting for the next step up and so on. Some move up quickly, others never do. And the situations are all different."
