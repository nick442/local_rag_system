>No, a tip is a reward for quality of service. I give a 10% tip for horrible service (service, not food). I give a 15% tip when I don't notice the waiter/ess as part of my meal. I give 20% tip when service (not food) was exceptional. Then you're agreeing that the tip is a base form of compensation. I shouldn't have said that they're exclusive because they're not, but in the 95% of cases where people are obeying a 15-20 rule, then you're agreeing that it's compensation + a little bit extra for good service (typically what, 5% extra up to 20%)? >If you want to argue that tipping is not a reward for quality of service, then I will abstain from tipping altogether because I paid for my food and I'm willing to get my own damn water and pick up my food from the kitchen if someone will let me. This business model is becoming more common. Upscale fast is a similar genre. The blending of self-service with higher quality food. Listen, restaurants are going to be run by machines sooner or later. I worked in a chain that was literally computer run. The computer told the host where to sit a table (and knew exactly what was clean/dirty), it watched to see if waiters got drinks in x time, servers put in a food order and it popped up each item (or part of item) on screens for cooks in the correct time (IE long dishes popping up quickly and fast dishes popping up later). The entire restaurant was run through that, it monitored everything. At this point, I think they keep waiters around because they're so cheap ($2.13) and their tips can be so easily used to cover other costs in the business because honestly otherwise they'd be pretty easy to replace.
