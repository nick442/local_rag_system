"In the UK there are Premium Bonds, http://www.nsandi.com/. In simple terms these get you a ""raffle ticket"" for each £1 you invest. Each month multiple tickets are drawn and they each win between £25 and £1m. Your capital does not go down but you aren't guaranteed to win. So you can't lose your money but there's potential to not make any either."
