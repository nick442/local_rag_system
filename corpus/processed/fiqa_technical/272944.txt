"Although there are occasional cases where simply moving money between countries results in a tax liability - for example a ""non-domiciled"" UK resident using the ""remittance basis"" - this is not the case in your situation. In general it would be extremely rare for non-residents of a country to be taxed on bringing money into that country, as it would be bad for tourism which most countries want to encourage. The requirement to declare large sums of money on entry is primarily so that the authorities can detect money laundering, rather than tax. Note that you will have to pay US tax on any interest you earn on that US bank account."
