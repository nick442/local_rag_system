Going to get down voted to hell because its not what you want to hear but: So over a 9 year period the author of the study claims that after 56 incidents the industry is corrupt. Does this guy have any idea how many hedge funds there are out there? its well over 10,000 and there are probably around 20 incidents a year in which they could redeem ahead of investors. Finance is completely corrupt and broken to all hell but ridiculous reports like this and knee jerk reactions wont solve anything.
