> I don't know what the BLS currently reports to be the Unemployment Rate including Discouraged Workers, U4 The BLS tracks discouraged workers. U3 is the traditional measure of unemployment, the headline number. U4 counts discouraged workers. You can find them, along with other measures of unemployment in [Table A-15. Alternative measures of labor underutilization](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm). [Adding Discouraged workers to the mix doesn't change the unemployment rate very much](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=HAV).
