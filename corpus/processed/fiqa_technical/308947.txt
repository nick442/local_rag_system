You're right, things can get a little out of hand on Reddit. The prior post is gone now so I can't really remember, but the gist of what I meant earlier was that your logic didn't line up in that the price of a stock is indicative of it's value, but doesn't equate to it's value. The price is a combination of the perceived intrinsic valuation of the company as well as sentiment. The price can go up if people are buying but it doesn't necessarily mean the company's value or financial conditions are improving (though it can). It's a common trap to fall into, and can lead one to ignore for example revenues falling or other metrics deteriorating merely because the stock price continues up so it must be getting better and better. Sorry, not a very coherent response, if you're unsure feel free to pm me
