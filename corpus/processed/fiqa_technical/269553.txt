Unlucky is accepting the fact that there isn't anything you can do about your current situation. If the person in the slum is selling drugs, why wouldn't it work to make friends and get to know people? Aren't all of them your potential customers? The point that I'm trying to make is that there's more to it than just hard work. It's networking and having some sort of understanding or intuition about the climate of your industry.
