Do you think those people at Sears made a decent wage within the last few decades? I certainly don't. If you want to talk about the changing envionment let's talk about Social security. The system used to be 30 workers to 1 retiree now its under 3:1 and soon to be under 2:1. There simply isnt enough production to keep up with growth, profit is shrinking in all but the most alchemical sectors. Clinging to dead or dying systems is one of the biggest obstacles to our future success and re-emergence as a healthy society. You say you are older, you have experience and wisdom. So what is the solution?
