"You just listed problems with our present form of government. You don't like our present form of government. That's different than saying all government is bad or that we can live well without a government. If there is a monopoly, or a corporation that has many monopolies, it is very hard for a competitor to challenge it. This is especially true where the ""barrier to entry"" is large, such as utilities, phone companies, car companies, etc. In addition to the fair barriers to entry, it is easy for monopolies to do unfair things to prevent competition. For example, have you ever heard the term ""dumping""?"
