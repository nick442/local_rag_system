There's a very small subset of people that I think could legitimately use the Amazon Echo-Alexa / Google Home-Assistant thing, and they're generally, in my mind, single and affluent. The kind of person that really loves the idea of full home automation, and doesn't have anyone around to fuck with the voice commands. I, for instance, would probably get one of these things if I lived alone. I'd love to dim the lights, play a movie, and say, order a pizza whilst shouting into the ceiling. I don't think I could pull that off or sell the cost or utility to the SO.
