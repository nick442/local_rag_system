>Vice is a broadcast company worth over $4B. lol wut? Vice is a media company, not a broadcasting company. HBO charges premium prices to access HBO not Vice. >You've falsely equated them in quality to buzzfeed Go back and read what I said. I am equating them to buzzfeed on the quality of their content. >Correct. If you agree with me then why are you defending Vice here so much? Every article by them is shallow like this one and at that with a very noticeable liberal bias. >The problem with your logic is that I actually am exposed to its content while you self-select not to expose yourself to it. How exactly is that a flaw in my logic? I've seen enough from Vice to know its content is crap so why would I bother to read it? >the reality is that my perceptions are broadly based considerations based on a much larger sampling of their content while your perceptions amount to an opinion derived from a first impression glance. More like the reality is you are making a grand assumption here on my end. I'ved watched their documentaries that aired in the 90's, and read various articles and watch various Youtube video's from them. They use to do high quality work, but now its crap.
