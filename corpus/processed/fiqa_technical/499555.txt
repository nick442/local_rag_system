It means many people will be forced out of the cities into rural areas or in many cases, people who cannot drive (many urban residents) they may have to accept not being able to get around, being dependent, losing pensions because they could not remain living near work, etc. Its not known what happens to many people, especially older people because social workers lose track of them, since they don't have addresses and are no longer on the voting rolls. A fairly large number of older people who lose affordable housing seem to perhaps die.
