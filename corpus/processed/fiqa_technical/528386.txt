Oh yeah. I used to rent a room from my buddy for awhile. He had an unused heated garage. He decided to remodel it, ad a full bathroom and kitchenette. This summer, he made $4500 per month on Airbnb rentals. He no longer needs roommates. This is only good for the few that have homes to rent out. It is a good idea that has gotten out of control. Airbnb has been and will continue to drive up rental prices. The market can't handle these sort of price strains long term, it is simply not sustainable for the average Joe.
