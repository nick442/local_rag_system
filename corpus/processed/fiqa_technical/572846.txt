There are a lot of reasons why this is a mediocre idea. The first of which is that he is using salary.com and glassdoor as his sources for his software's salary information.The second problem is that it makes it easier for other companies to poach people because they will know what those people are being paid before headhunting. Third, his model assumes that people have the same incentives. Many people often forgo salary bumps and other things for reasons that aren't clear on the surface. Maybe in lieu of a promotion someone got a raise? Maybe someone accepted a lower salary with an unwritten rule that they could work fewer hours in a week or have a more flexible schedule? This guys product looks like an untested idea that could create a lot of complications.
