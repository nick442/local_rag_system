I'm just a sole trader who doesn't have much money which is why I'm looking at budget stuff. It's not like I'm a big business just being really tight. I need advice on this, not to get down-voted. I need one that is cheap or free but I would prefer that I can upload my own files and I would like to connect my own domain to it.
