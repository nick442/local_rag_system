This afternoon I used an ANZ ATM inside the Branch on Lane Xang Avenue. The ATM tells you the maximum. Pro tip: If the wad of bills is too thick you can change it at the teller to bills of 100,000 kip each to slim it down a little. I read on a forum that most other banks' ATMs in Laos have a maximum of 1,000,000 LAK but that ANZ's fees are a bit higher than the other ATMs.
