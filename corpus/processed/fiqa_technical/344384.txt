I had a joint account at Chase, and each of us had own on-line login, and could access the account (each of us also had non-joint accounts in Chase, and with the same login we already had we could access the joint accounts, but not the other's non-joint accounts). It seems like your bank is really backwards on this, change the bank. By the way, in joint accounts you have the option of requiring both partners to sign on every document, so that every check or order you write will only be valid with both of your signatures. I don't know if that's what you need, but some may want that (it is quite uncomfortable, IMHO).
