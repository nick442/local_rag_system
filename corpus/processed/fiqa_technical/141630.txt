1. Pick hotels/restaurants/bars with your ideal clients. 2. Offer to take/pick up employees to or from work (receptionist/manager/bartender/owner) once a week for free. Anyone who is customer facing can be a great opportunity for your business but try and be smart about this. 3. Build relationships with these people. show them you are kind, courteous, professional, and make it obvious that you speak English well. Smile. This is your opportunity to show them the quality of your service. 4. Ask them for referrals. Give them your business card and make sure there is English on the card. Bring them a snack or a drink the first and second time they send a customer your way. 5. Build stronger relationships with the people who are driving more business to you, and focus your effort on these people. If you get no referrals from someone, then kindly stop giving them free rides. good luck :)
