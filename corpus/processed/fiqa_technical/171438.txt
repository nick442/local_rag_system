Yes. I am in favour of democracy and a small state and help to those that truly need it like the handicapped, poor children, and disaster victims. However, if you do not reward work, savings, and investments - the only way to get people to actually behave sensibly and do the boring tasks needing to maintain and improve standards of living, is by punishing those that do not work - like they do in socialist states.
