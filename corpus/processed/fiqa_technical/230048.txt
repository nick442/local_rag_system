"Dude, SHUT UP. This is not an argument. You are wrong, ignorant and stupid. The fact that you keep bring up the same false narrative DOES NOT make it true. I would gladly continue to explain to you how much of an idiot you are, but, what with your ability to ""think critically"" as you called whatever is is that seems like rational thought to you (I'm laughing, even as I write that sarcastically, you're just such an idiot), it would be a waste of both of our time. Feel free to continue to have your backwards ideas of the world. The rest of us will continue our lives happy and not full of hate for another person just because of the way they choose to worship. We understand hoe numbers work. It's great. You should try it, even though I know percentages are a little complicated for your tiny little racist brain. I would challenge you to go see that Muslim friend you claim to have, and share some of your ideas with him. Show him this thread of trash that you've created. See if he still considers you a friend, if he exists at all. You can continue sending messages if you'd like. It's DEFINITELY going to convince me that you're not a moron. You're not digging that hole deeper with every ignorant word you say at all. You're totally fooling us."
