It's the same thing as employer-provided healthcare. It's insane that we still put those burdens on employers and not society at large. I'm in Canada, and I don't think the issue of maternity leave is nearly so hard on companies here and we also have public health care coverage. Because we do not mandate paternity leave, there is some talk about women who just hang on to their jobs for 3-4 years while they have 2-3 children, always planning their pregnancies at the exact right time to maximize their maternity leave. The best way to handle this seems to be mandating equal leave for both parents and removing the burden from employers by having it publicly funded.
