"At what rate? ""Millions""? No one would start at that rate, but the mid-100k range is standard for Harvard undergrads entering finance, plus generous benefits and bonuses. But the structure in most institutions weeds most of these people out after five years. That's fine for most people, who are just trying to pay off loans, buy a house, and maybe feel secure starting a business. People who stay for 5-10 years could certainly be in the million range when bonuses and benefits are considered."
