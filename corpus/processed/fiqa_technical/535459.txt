#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; [**Misuse of statistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse%20of%20statistics): [](#sfw) --- > >A __misuse of statistics__ occurs when a statistical argument asserts a falsehood. In some cases, the misuse may be accidental. In others, it is purposeful and for the gain of the perpetrator. When the statistical reason involved is false or misapplied, this constitutes a __statistical [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy)__. >The false statistics trap can be quite damaging to the quest for knowledge. For example, in medical science, correcting a falsehood may take decades and cost lives. >Misuses can be easy to fall into. Professional scientists, even mathematicians and professional statisticians, can be fooled by even some simple methods, even if they are careful to check everything. Scientists have been known to fool themselves with statistics due to lack of knowledge of [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) and lack of [standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization) of their [tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_test). > --- ^Interesting: [^How ^to ^Lie ^with ^Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics) ^| [^Misleading ^graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misleading_graph) ^| [^Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) ^| [^Data ^dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjiek7a) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjiek7a)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)
