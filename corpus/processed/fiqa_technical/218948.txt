Everyone wants good health in the immediate sense, of course. However, it certainly doesn't stop many from smoking or drinking. Do people complain about firemen or police taxes like they do with the price of healthcare? Just like the government insuring all of college debt in guaranteed loans, it will only add fuel to the fire. It's the same story again and again Medicare and medicaid is already an expense in the form of taxes that is beyond comprehension. Government needs to get out to improve the costs, both lobbying and legislation portions.
