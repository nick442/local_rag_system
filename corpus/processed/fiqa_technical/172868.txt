"**American School (economics)** See also American System (economic plan). The American School, also known as the ""National System"", represents three different yet related constructs in politics, policy and philosophy. It was the American policy from the 1860s to the 1970s, waxing and waning in actual degrees and details of implementation. Historian Michael Lind describes it as a coherent applied economic philosophy with logical and conceptual relationships with other economic ideas. *** **American System (economic plan)** The American System was an economic plan that played a prominent role in American policy during the first half of the 19th century. Rooted in the ""American School"" ideas of Alexander Hamilton, the plan ""consisted of three mutually reinforcing parts: a tariff to protect and promote American industry; a national bank to foster care; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other 'internal improvements' to develop profitable markets for farmculture"". Congressman Henry Clay was the plan's foremost proponent and the first to refer to it as the ""American System"". *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27"
