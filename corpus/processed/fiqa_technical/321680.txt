It's impossible to claim that *no* regulation does this. But it's ignorant to claim regulations as a *whole* are preventing progress. Which regulations are you buthurt by exactly? The ones that make the police department buy fords? The ones preventing land seizure for government projects? Let's see a list. Other than tump spewing bullshit I doubt you can come up with a list off the top of your head your mad about.
