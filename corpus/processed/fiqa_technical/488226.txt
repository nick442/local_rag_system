Student homes are not like home loans. The housing bubble happened in large part because people didn't care about the size of the loan. They intended to flip their house in a couple years and sell it for a profit. You can't resell an education. > Certainly it is better than the current system which guarantees student loans to benefit the bankers. That doesn't exist any more. For the last couple of years only the government can offer government-backed student loans.
