There are a few issues: 1. Googlers', FB's et al (Brin&Page, Zuck, Sandberg) image as world saviors (pledging money, cancelling death etc..), while they finance hedenostic idleness. 2. These are public companies, so I guess this decadence is funded by public money. So there is a huge issue - especially when scores of people go unemployed.
