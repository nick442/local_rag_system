"Also posting here to get answers 1) In pre-university education, what do I list along with my A levels? Are AS levels and GCSEs necessary? 2) Should i upload a degree transcript? (they say its optional hence why i'm asking) 3) Does the answer to ""How did you hear about JPM/GS/CS/BAML?"" affect your application? (moronic i know, but i thought better to know than to be clueless) 4) Do your answers to the equal opportunities form affect your application? (just want to know since its almost accepted now that if youre not a white male, your application will get scrutinised in some way depending on the reader, and i'm not white) 5) Following on from the previous question, my first name is Mohammad so should I consider changing my name on my CV and application forms? Again because of the bad press that Muslims get, and since Mohammad is such an obvious Muslim name. I also speak an Asian language so should i list that on my form/CV? I know this sounds like I want to hide my identity, but believe me it's the last thing I want to do. It's just something I feel like I might have to do. Nor do I want any sympathy for doing this. It's something a friend of mine suggested and I want to get people's opinions."
