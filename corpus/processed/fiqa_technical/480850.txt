You mean Gary Johnson, he was not a libertarian, he was a republican. He also left New Mexico dependent on the federal government, [they are just now fixing that](http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/news/2012/10/02/martinez-nm-must-reduce-economic.html?page=all). Libertarians advocate for privatizing all basic infrastructure and eliminating all forms of social welfare. What Gary Johnson did was cut spending on those at a state level knowing the federal government would pick up the slack like they did in the Southern states. New Mexico went from being tax positive with the federal budget to massively depending upon it. The point is they will be, because you are the fringe of the fringe and mean nothing to the political process. Your opinions are a drop of ink in an ocean. Change them and contribute among the vast, vast majority of Americans who believe in a nation state or knowingly continue spouting your ideology which will amount to nothing.
