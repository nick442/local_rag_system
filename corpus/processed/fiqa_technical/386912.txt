It's a circular firing squad. There always is much more going on behind the scenes than is what the public knows . no I don't know anything, but I have been involved is some very nasty Board room battles. Just to put it in perspective how nasty these get - you have a founder that created a company in his image vs. Board members that have fiduciary responsibilities to investors (this includes the potential for personal liability). I cannot see how this gets better before it gets worse . these are just the opening maneuvers.
