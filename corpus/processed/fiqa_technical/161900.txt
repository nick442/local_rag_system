"> but I think Microsoft have hit the money with the idea of the Surface Pro The problem is that they are not taking the **idea** of ""Surface"" to it's necessary & logical (practical) extent. IMO there ***is*** a market for a really LARGE (like 2 ft x 3 ft) single surface interactive screen-based computer -- **solidly mounted in a fully tilt-able (and height adjustable) manner akin to a drafting table or a large ""paste up"" board** -- something that you can comfortably sit at (or raise and stand in front of) and lean in to work on -- IOW, something that is capable of really being a *true* ***desk-top***, as in capable of displaying multiple pages, or a (one or more) large blueprint sized drawings. CAD people would LOVE that. Publications people would EAT it up! And even general office workers & business people would probably like it as well. (So the thing *doesn't* have to be lightweight & portable, much less ""thin"" to achieve that, in fact some ""heft"" & thickness/weight would probably be a beneficial thing, provided the base was solidly built -- and in fact the computer doesn't *have* to be part of the screen, it could be in a box located on the support structure underneath somewhere). *In a lot of ways I think people are TRYING to achieve that very thing with DIY multiple monitor arrays.* They ALMOST had it with the [""surface/table"" concept (renamed PixelSense)](http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/00002387d/51cf_orh350w620/Microsoft-Surface-PixelSens.jpg) but they apparently they are too caught up in the gaming/Star-Trek concept origins, and don't realize that working ""hunched over"" on a flat (horizontal) surface (especially some ""coffee table"" height thing, but [even seated](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/01/surface-2-hands-dsc0297-rm-eng.jpg)) is just a *literally* royal frigging **pain in the neck.** (Besides, most work is text/image related and has an up/down orientation on the display -- no one really WANTS to be on the opposite side looking at shit upside-down, much less on the two adjacent sides looking at things while trying to cock your head 90 degrees). And hanging the thing on the **wall** doesn't work well for most applications either. It's [much like the curved screen concept thing in the Minority Report flick](http://blog.templatemonster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/minority-report.jpg).. looks cool, but who the hell wants to **stand** in front of a permanently high-mounted screen all day (much less have to **stretch-reach** several feet away to ""grab"" something .. and even worse to ""grasp"" something in the nothingness of mid-air). Much like the [Star Trek horizontal ""pool table"" screen thing](http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/inconsistencies/props/pooltable-hollowpursuits.jpg).. it *looks* like it works in a movie & TV (and for the types of things they are using them for) .. but not very practical for most real life computer applications."
