The underlying condescension of this article is palpable. I would imagine that given any lack of compulsory regulation, that Americans are using whatever means of payment that suits them. There's always this assumption that Americans are the most backwards people around. And Americans are always willing to just sit there and willingly and unquestionably imbibe the yokel-dom status ascribed to them by these elitists. I'm calling bullshit on this one.
