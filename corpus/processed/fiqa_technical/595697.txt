I think you're not considering the opportunity cost of giving up your money early. I'm not sure what the total money you have to spend, but spending extra on things you're going to buy later might not be the best choice. Consider you could just get a credit card that does 3% (6% with fee) on groceries, 3% on gas, etc. So you can make some money there without spending it all up front. Also, you could be turning that money into more money by investing it. Assuming you're not going to just carry a balance and pay interest on the card, you have this cash on hand to invest. One more thing, I'm not sure of your financial situation but I don't think something like spending an extra 5k is a pittance to you (since you wanted $500 so badly). Having the cash at hand has its own advantages even if you're just sitting on it. In short, consider if you want to follow through with this plan. You can still keep the card.
