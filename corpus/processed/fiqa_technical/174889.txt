It doesn't make rational sense, if you think the goal of having money is to have more money. On the other hand, imagine you are someone for whom the goal of having money is to feel powerful, successful, and to be able to tell the world in no uncertain terms to fuck itself. Imagine on top of that, you already have enough money that _your money alone_ is earning you enough to keep you in the good life, and will likely continue to do so for a long time. In that position, being able to hold a cheque for $300m and _not_ cash it would be the ultimate validation of all the things you got rich for in the first place.
