>It's a nice park No it's not. It's a blight on Niagara. The park is [constantly under investigation for animal cruelty](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/marineland-charged-with-6-counts-animal-cruelty-1.3927659), but somehow always seems to skate with a slap on the wrist (politicians love tourism dollars!). Also, it's all owned by a [known psychopath who is known to threaten, stalk, and physically abuse people he doesn't like, or those who protest against his way of doing business](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/10/03/the_man_behind_marineland_50_years_of_controversy.html). Please don't encourage people to spend their money here.
