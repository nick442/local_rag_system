By most estimates, North Korea doesn't have an effective means of retaliating with a nuclear weapon. Further, its not like we were attacking North Korea even when they have repeatedly attempted to assassinate the leader of South Korea, shelled South Korea, or Torpoedoed one of their ships. The thing that keeps them from being steamrolled is that no one wants to pay to fix their country afterwards.
