I was making the point that Accenture is no longer Big4. There are a lot of consulting companies, but Accenture is not in the same league as the Big4 any more. This is demonstrable by the difference in benefits and bill rates. The Big4s are owned by partners. Their compensation is private, but recently PWC had to reveal that their average compensation is $600k/partner. My firm has about 1500 consulting partners and each of the Big4 varies quite a bit. Whatever the Accenture equivalent is for partner, whatever you call that, they make nowhere near the same compensation level. And this actually gets disclosed as they are a public corporation. Higher compensation; therefore higher bill rates; therefore small overlap for competition. The business model is very different between public and private consulting companies.
