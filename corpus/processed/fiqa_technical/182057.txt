"> If the stock price goes down it wouldn't make sense that ABC had a higher dividend yield, so my argument was you have to make assume the stock price went down because it could have cost less for other reasons, but you don't have to assume the dividend yield which would make it a good investment. I'm not sure I understand your argument. The wording doesn't seem clear to me (""you have to make assume""? make assume? ""but you don't have to assume the dividend yield"" assume it what?) Dividend yield has a negative correlation with stock price. If price goes down, all else being equal, yield rises."
