>You could even pull a cash figure from the income projection in the business plan you asked to see. You did ask for that, right? As well as the resumes from the founders and the name of the VC company so that you can check them out? I guess this is my point - a fresh grad is unlikely to know how to evaluate this stuff, assuming they even know to ask for the things you mention. They also will be less likely to be in a position to be making a lot of demands of that nature. You act as if it's straightforward, when I don't think it is. OP was making the point that, as you rightly point out, you need to do a lot of due diligence and decide if it's the right thing, whereas in the popular culture there is a lot of glossing over of the failure cases, making people less likely to know that they need to be careful.
