I find that hard to believe because when compared to the other engineering professions, software is already extremely highly paid. The problem is that the tech industry has continued to grow massively since 2001, and yet the number of computer science enrolments has dropped precipitously since that time. According to the [computing research association](http://cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/taulbee/CRA_Taulbee_2011-2012_Results.pdf), the number of CS graduates fell by more than half between 2001 and 2009. Furthermore, the [jobless rate](http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2012/01/software-developers-44-percent-jobless.html) for software developers is at 4.4%, 3.6% for web developers, and 3.6% for computer programmers. These are well below the national averages. So when companies like Microsoft complain that they're finding a shortage of engineers, I'm inclined to believe them - the statistics seem to back it up. So for the past decade software engineers have experienced high demand, low supply, and consistently high pay. This leads me to believe that further increasing pay isn't going to help the situation. What we need is more investment in STEM education, which is precisely what this $10k per visa fee is supposed to go towards. It seems like a pretty good idea to me.
