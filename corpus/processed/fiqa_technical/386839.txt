my friend and his wife are expecting their 2nd kid and living in a 1 1/2 bedroom apt downtown. Reason: his job is downtown and parking and public transit to get there from the suburbs is crap. They want something bigger with a yard but just can't do it. They can rent in the burbs for around what they are currently paying - it's just the hour commute (if he's lucky) each way - right now it's a 10 min. walk.
