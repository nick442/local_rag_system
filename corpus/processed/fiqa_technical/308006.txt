Yes, that would qualify as a scam to me. I didn't think they could do most of those things, especially buying insurance without your permission. When my area was reclassified as a flood area, they told me I had to provide proof of flood insurance, and if I didn't, they would get it for me at a price that might be higher than if I did it myself. But there was no problem with my choice of an online flood insurance company that was much cheaper than my AAA insurance for the same. I think that at least some of the rules are from the underwriter (?) like Fannie Mae or whoever it is that they work through. I don't really know all the ins and outs, though. I do know that when I had a loan through Wells Fargo, I had to increase my insurance in one area to match the value in another - I forget the details, but I think I could have reduced coverage in an alternate category if I had so desired.
