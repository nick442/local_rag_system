When I think of the loopholes that the richest of the rich exploit to get out of paying taxes, this article does seem kind of pointless. Why attack the 529 plan? It would be better to attack the expense of the education and the need for the plan in the first place. Upper middle classers shouldn't have to give a second thought to how much it will cost to send their kids to university, unless it is a private school. 30 years ago it cost 350 bucks for a semester. Now it is 10k or more. We all see that this is ridiculous, but it goes on and on. Rents have doubled or even tripled in the last 7 years and this is normal?
