I can tell you other than Black Friday I haven't been there, and I have 3 kids to buy toys for. Amazon is bae - just compare prices online. We're not our parents who would walk into the store and buy us a random toy. Kids want specific things and if I can get it shipped free in a day for 30% less I'm doing it.
