Again, dude, with this projecting shit. Now you're creating me in your mind as some country bumpkin redneck that also shops at hot topic? Is that the kind of person you usually get your ass handed to you by? I am honestly worried about you. You're probably, what, mid 30s? Shitty job, failed restaurant, meaningless MBA. You need to find a way to not be a failure eventually.
