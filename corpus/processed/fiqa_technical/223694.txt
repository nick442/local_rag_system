"Usually.. if you can't figure the business model for a cheap or ""free"" product it's because you ARE the product and just don't know it. In this case, moviepass has found a buyer who will pay more for the data on your movie watching habits than they have to fork out for movie tickets. This is why the price dropped from $60 to $10. It's a data play now. Don't worry.. You're giving Google and Facebook way more for access to their ""free"" technologies, I assure you."
