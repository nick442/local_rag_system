"> And wanting fully 10 % of all employees to resign every year? That sounds completely insane to me. Is that really normal? Am I not getting something? I worked at a place like that. The thinking there was that this gets rid of the poor performers. Note the quote says ""turns over 10%"" not ""has 10% churn"". A lot of these are the company firing people or encouraging them to quit. My company did this with almost yearly company-wide layoffs. Every group would have to cut at least one employee."
