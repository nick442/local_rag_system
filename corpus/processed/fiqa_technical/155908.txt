"All of their recommendations.. are about 3 decades too late. The resistant strains that are currently such a major problem (MRSA, VRSA, VRE, etc) were ""bred"" for the most part back in the 1960's (they actually pre-existed antibiotics, but the use/abuse of antibiotics ""clear the ground"" of other bacteria and allow them to proliferate). What then happened is that the medical industry engaged in a combination of ridiculously sloppy hygiene (see they didn't need to worry about things like washing hands between patients, because they could always just pump people full of yet another ""wonder drug"" antibiotic) AND they also engaged in ""cover their arse"" denial (and self-delusion) -- which allowed the proverbial monkey to get out of the cage. Yes, later antibiotic usage in animals to cause inordinate weight gain (really only needed in artificially *confined* animals, who by definition have suppressed immune systems and generally gain weight *slower* than non-confined animals) -- has worsened the situation as far as ANIMAL infections (which despite the scaremongering, seldom crossover into humans) -- but.. The REAL problem with the future viability of antibiotics in human, lies **entirely** at the feet of the medical profession (and this kind of PR attempt to ""blame someone else"" is utter BS)."
