"Servers were overwhelmed with traffic when there was little to no traffic, it was always backed by Conde Nast even when they were as hands off as they ever were, and is there anybody running discussion forums with a chance to rival Twitter in significance, how many of them would say, ""nah, I just want to stay small and stay away from corporate influence."" I would have migrated from Reddit around the SOPA/PIPA days, the rally to restore sanity days, if I knew where to go, but I don't think I can win this chess game. Go to Voat? Why, is there any special reason Voat is impervious to botnet server attacks? Any reason three letter agencies can't manipulate, let alone spy, on Voat users? Any reason Wall Street, the same crooks that spin climate change denial scientific research and buying congress, would every call it quits and let me use Voat or any other site? Reddit has evolved as it has grown, and any site that tries to capture the good old days of Reddit are facing ""better chess players;"" orgs that have successfully beaten the old Reddit I pine for."
