All fair points. I don't mean to say that Jamie Dimon is smart or responsible, and it is possible that he intends high personal taxes and low corporate taxes, although even high personal taxes would be a controversial view among today's conservative/business groups. In my experience with senior corporate executives (and it is a LOT of experience), they are a lot like artists in that they tend to be highly skilled and knowledgeable within their domain, but they actually don't have a good sense of how politics works -- they may have studied psychology but not sociology, government, or history -- and so they subscribe to political views that are naive in the same way that their understanding of astrophysics is unsophisticated. Only they don't pontificate about astrophysics and attempt to change the laws of physics, both of which they DO do with politics.
