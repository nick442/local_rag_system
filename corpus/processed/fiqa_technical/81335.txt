"I get it - you hate california, as evidenced by you calling it ""the most overrated strip of land on God's green earth."" Your clearly biased against the area. But the numbers work out. Your not just making three figures - in my offer, and in most mid career offers, your making 200k+. You talk about these groups of triple digit income devs living in a house together - yeah this does happen in some cases, mostly in San Fran. Look dude, I have friends out there who work for these companies, I've been offered and done the math knowing the real facts. I'm not here to say California, and more specifically the valley is cheap, I'm just saying for someone in tech the money usually works out as better out here (if your not buying a house, I should mention - I'm younger and have no desire to be tied down to a house), the career trajectory perks are here, and the perks and nature factor are real. I live in the Midwest - I get it, you like it here. But of you think having to drive 3 hours down to red river gorge to see actual terrain, as in something more than ant hills, is great access to nature then we clearly have different ideas on what sorts of nature we enjoy. I myself am a backpacker and mountain biker so the west coast is much better for my hobbies. Moab would be ideal, but there are no jobs there, but that's part of the reason I turned down my valley offers for a 100% remote gig so I can travel to those sorts of areas."
