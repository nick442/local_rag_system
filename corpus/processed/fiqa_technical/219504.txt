">I would expect to see more ""rent with option to buy/contract for deed"" sales when the flipper crowd realizes they need to address the fact that buyers can be found without using banks. Provided the sellers can afford to ""self-finance"" the deals, yes. But the plain fact is that a lot of Boomers are highly leveraged -- they may have their name on the title deed of a McMansion and a couple of vacation homes, but these days they all too often hit retirement with significant mortgages on one or more of those properties -- so the reality is that a lot of them will NOT be able to sell without getting the bank involved (and that number will be sufficient to drive the ""at the margin"" prices way down, especially in the face of minimal demand)."
