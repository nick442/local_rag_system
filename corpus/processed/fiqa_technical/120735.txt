Probably because at this point they have an extremely limited use. I use my Amazon Echo to play music, set alarms/timers, and track my grocery list. Those are convenient, but I don't NEED one. The advertised function of asking a question doesn't work very well, and until you can interact with it as more of an AI device then people won't truly rely on them.
