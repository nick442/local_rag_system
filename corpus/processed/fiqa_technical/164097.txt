"Managers aren't receiving pension plans? They do nothing on their own? I agree there needs to be strong leadership and direction, and most people specialize in 1 thing while others specialize in coordinating teams with different skill sets, but the workers aren't just pieces in an intricate assembly line. If you take this corporate philosophy obsessed with short term gains you get jaded workers and create a similar culture. ""*Corporate:* I'll pay the least I can for the best I can get AND I'll fire them on the spot the second I find someone better. *Worker:* I'll work the least I can for as much as I can get AND I'll be on the lookout for better opportunities constantly"". You need to strike a balance of respect somewhere. These are interdependent processes, not a hierarchy of dependent sheep vs corporate overlords."
