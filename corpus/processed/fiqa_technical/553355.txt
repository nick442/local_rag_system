No expert here, but my guess is because of the shear scale and wide impacts this would cause. A ban is a pretty severe step, so companies and individuals need to take steps to move in that direction. Gas stations, gas truckers, oil refineries, auto shops, dealerships, manufacturers, auto parts stores, are among the many, many affected. If they required that change to happen in three years, it would be catastrophic. We spent a century getting ourselves into this mess. Can't hastily jump out.
