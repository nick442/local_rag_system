A few ideas : sell snacks for the trip, or alternatively just raise your prices and give the snacks for free. Print out a sign with some pictures of where you'll take them, tease the experience. Install curtains that can be opened or closed in case customers want more or less shade / privacy. Have a radio or some speaker to play music during the trip.
