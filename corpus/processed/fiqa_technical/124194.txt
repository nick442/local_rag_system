> Say you repeal a tax, without reducing public spending. Then if you analyze the economic impact, that does not fairly represent the impact of the tax, now does it? You are right but my issue is that you are accounting for changes that are not happening. If you are comparing a country's tax structure before and after a wealth tax then I would agree; however, in this case all the subjects are separate economies and have (presumably) found some sort of equilibrium. The wealth tax policy is not changing for them so there is no surplus or deficit of public spending to adjust for.
