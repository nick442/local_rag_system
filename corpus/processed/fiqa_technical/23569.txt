Does this make sense? Some corporate behemoth was making tons of money by selling disgusting sludge which I would not feed to a fucking dog, and because the true nature of this shit came to light, they lost a lot of business. They only had the business in the first place because people were unaware of what they were doing, and when the people learned, they were disgusted and tended to avoid it.
