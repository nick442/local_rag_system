"In Germany most terror attacks are made by right-wing guys who want to save Germany from the muslim terrorists (ironic isnt it) and most physical attacks also come from this group. So the problems comes fron people saying things like you did: Muslims are terrorists. Taking a group as a whole and given them an attribute. If you say americans are fat idiots you say all of them (allthough i did not explicitly say ALL OF THEM) This is not helping fighting obesity, it is just pure hatespeech. You still want to pass of hate as criticism.. that is just not the same. And heres a link to the sweden Problem: http://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/ Do yourself a favor check your information sources because there is a ""fake news"" (i hate this expression :-) ) source in it. Sweden is a common target of right-wing manipulators which often spread simple untruths.. and i hate to say it but they got in your head. You don't seem like a lost cause though, that is why im still talking to you. So please try to be more open and stay critical about information ESPECIALLY if it seems to confirm common prejudices. Your Right about the nazis though. Ignoring isn't helping. Sadly I have other fights to fight and therefore rely on the society to go ahead with a good example and if they are out of line (hatespeech). Heres a link to what xenophobia and hatespeech in Germany led: https://www.google.de/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/germany-rightwing-violence-surges-asylum-seekers So you can see.. hatespeech is a huge Problem which does a lot of physical damage."
