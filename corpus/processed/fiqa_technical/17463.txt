If you are doing this because you are interested.. this is one thing. But a degree in economics is probably not going to help you find a job. Before going into it, research available opportunities in the field first. Is it worth the cost of the degree to study it? Are you going into it because your employer wants you to have this knowledge? The answer to the question about Math is yes. There is a lot of math in Economics. A good idea is to get the course catalog for the degree at the university where you would be going and see which classes are required to get the degree. Wannabe2good is completely correct, Money and Banking (one of the classes required for an Eco degree) is something that helps you know why the president of the US is doing what he is doing, but really does not apply much to you personally, and employers will not care. I urge you and ANYONE else who plans to go to school, please research if there are JOBS in the field of your study. I have seen so many people study things they were interested in and then later graduate and were not able to find jobs. Good luck!
