Do you have a clue of what would of happened to you if you had some serious condition and at some point you lost your job? Insurers would deny you insurance because of pre-existing conditions, and you would be left out to dry. Now maybe you aren't as unfortunate as having a serious health condition, but no new bill will make everything better for everyone.
