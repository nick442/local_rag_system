Talk to a good tax accountant in the UK who deals with this sort of thing, as it sounds like most of the issues concern local tax. You actually have at least four different ways to do this transaction: You definitely need good local tax and legal advice. No matter how you do it, if the borrower defaults, it will be socially ugly and will involve some kind of collection or legal action if you want your money back. If it were me, I think I'd choose the lease with option to buy. At least that way you may be able to inspect the property from time to time, make sure it is kept up, and be able to get it back through eviction rather than foreclosure.
