Um, wut? It took a failure for the SIFI to be defined in the first place. It took the failure of Lehman and Bear Stearns for the US goverments to actively attempt precluding *any more failures* of what were yet-to-be-called, SIFI's. Is this really such a hard concept to grasp? Largely unforeseen failure first, further failure avoidance second.
