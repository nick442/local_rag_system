Hahaha 'grand speech.' Good one. I'm saying if I, an outsider, see a company paying people less than what I think the job is worth, but somehow the company retains employees, yes, I say nothing. Because it's none of my fucking business what a company pays it's employees. If they don't like it, they can walk. If they stay, (as they must do in order for you to complain about it) then clearly the wage is worth more than the alternative. Or maybe you think the world owes you something?
