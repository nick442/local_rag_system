No one is arguing communism. No one wants that. I find it curious that that is the go-to accusation to anyone who wishes to put an end to the favor-the-wealthy economic policies that we've embraced since the 1980s (trickle-down theory, supply-side theory, Reaganomics). We need a favor-the-middle class economic policy. Your taxes and mine will not be affected, only the wealthiest among us will be, the billionaires and multi-millionaires. What I'm saying is we need a return to the tax rates on the top tax bracket that we had during the 1950s and 1960s, a period shortly after World War II that was America's heyday. I would hardly call that period in time communist, with McCarthyism and all the anti-communist fervor going around. It's time to undo Reaganomics and go back to what has worked for our country before.
