"> All companies are incorporated. It's the definition of a company. That is incorrect; you have to follow specific legal procedures (the exact procedure seems to vary per state) to give a company the legal status of being ""incorporated"". Dunno about incorporated companies automatically being ""public institutions"", but all companies are definitely not automatically incorporated."
