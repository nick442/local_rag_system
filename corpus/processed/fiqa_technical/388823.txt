>>I doubt any person that complains about immigrants taking jobs would ever take a job picking vegetables. I can't wait for this. I mean, I say it ecstatically, but in reality it is going to affect everyone. So many stupid racist assholes believing Trumptard that this is going to help the economy when all its going to do is make things more expensive. You think white people are going to pick fruits? Hispanics that arent illegal sure as shit arent going to do it. Construction: Houses are already expensive, imagine when they're paying living wages. Every market is going to look like Seattle. Immigrants are good for our country.
