I don't know much about Amit Mehrotra individually, or much about Deutsche Bank's equity research division. I was just trying to point out that the source of this information is a corporation that does not have stock in the debate between Amazon, WalMart, and the Trucking Companies, and is a company that doesn't really have an interest in this debate as a whole, because Deutsche Bank isn't involved in the US consumer products market, the US shipping market, or the US trucking market. It is secondhand knowledge at best, and secondhand knowledge from a totally disinterested party at that.
