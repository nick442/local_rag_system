That's.. sort of what anti-trust law does. The idea of anti-trust law isn't to help small companies to compete. It's to stop big companies from abusing consumers. That's why you not only need to be a monopoly, but you also have to abuse that monopoly position. A good comparison here may be the anti-trust concerns with Nielsen ratings, over the years. As recently as just a few years ago, though, any such suits have been struck down. Even though Nielsen has a near 100% monopoly on the ratings industry, there's no evidence they've used that monopoly to stymie competition.
