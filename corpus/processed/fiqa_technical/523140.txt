G spread - you have a 5.5 year bond, you take your yield minus the yield on the 5.5y point (interpolated) of the benchmark sovereign curve. Think of G = Government. I Spread - same as G Spread but you use the relevant Swap Curve. E.g. USD bond, compare against the USD Swaps curve. I = interpolated. Z Spread - stands for zero volatility curve spread. You strip the swaps curve to get zero rates (i.e. Zero coupon rates for each tenor), then find the constant spread on top of each part of the curve's zero rates to arrive at your bond's yield. In G and I Spread, you're basically discounting the bond's cash flows using one rate (i.e. The interpolated yield on the curve). With Z Spread, you're discounting using the entire portion of the curve that's relevant to your bond's maturity.
