It doesn't. Bitcoin isn't big enough to have economic relevance. And the design of Bitcoin means that it pretty much never could be. Now cryptocurrencies in general, maybe they would someday have some relevance. They'd have to be much better designed than Bitcoin. But the advantage they might, in theory, convey which would have actual economic relevance is to lower many transactions costs by taking banks out of the middle. And if they did enough of that, then they'd force banks to lower costs to compete. That could, in theory, be significant.
