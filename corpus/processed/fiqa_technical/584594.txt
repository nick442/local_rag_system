"When I complained to some older, successful business owners at my synagogue that I couldn't afford anything better than a 1BR basement apartment in my city while making an $80k salary, they basically told me, ""If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."" Because obviously living in the city is a privilege of the rich rather than the *merely* upper-middle class."
