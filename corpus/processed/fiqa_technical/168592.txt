So, if we can't trust people to know what they want, who makes the decisions about what they should have, and what gives them that right? I'm not suggesting environments don't play a role in human development, I'm suggesting that people need to learn to deal with the realities of their environments as part of their character growth. When you say that not being able to resist buying skittles is a serious problem, while there are still people living on the streets, I think you need some perspective. I'd wager that what you're seeing as you get older is the poverty trap, which is a real problem, but which is caused by barriers to expanding earnings much more than by irrational spending (though it is a factor). As for the insult, that's the impression your arguments gave, and I'd still like to know whether you believe you yourself need to be protected from these marketing practices, or you only feel that this is only necessary for others (implying they are somehow your inferiors in their ability to self-manage).
