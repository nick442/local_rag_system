Sounds like a terrible situation. The only thing I can think of (if you have the cash for it) is to pay down enough of the Mortgage and refinance to the point where the rent covers the mortgage plus expenses. On the one hand, this feels like literally burning money in the fireplace, as you will likely never see back the difference between the likely value when you sell and what you are putting in now. On the other hand, every time you make an interest payment, you are burning the (smaller amount of) money with no hope of seeing it back ever. If you don't have the cash, or you find that just throwing away money, then I would get out as fast as I can. Every month you hold you are paying a huge amount of interest. If you sold at $300,000, you would have only a $30,000 debt to manage. The total amount it would take to pay that off (at anything resembling normal interest rates) would probably be less than you have already sunk into this thing. Of course, if you are willing to bet that the market will come back and make you profitable on what you will have to put in from now on, then you might want to hold on. Personally, I would not make that bet. All around a terrible situation. I wish you lots of luck in resolving it.
