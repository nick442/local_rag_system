Definitely the wrong sub to ask this in, for two reasons: a) That is going to be specific to the player base of the game and how they will react. Without understanding the value of the chests to the players it won't make much sense to respond. b) /r/economy is mostly just a place to read posts by dipshits who don't know anything about the economy or the field of economics. Any actual economic information you may want in the future is best found at /r/economics.
