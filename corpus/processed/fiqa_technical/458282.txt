"She didn't know that having sex can lead to kids? I mean, you'd think she might have at least pieced it together after the first one. At what point do people's bad decisions stop being society's burden to bear? If I decide to take on insurmountable debt because I don't know any better, should everyone else be forced to pick up the tab? That may sound heartless, but it's not. A $15/hr minimum wage would ruin our economy and cause a lot more suffering and homelessness. Just because we want to help people (and I do feel bad for her), if we put policies in place that will ruin everyone, we don't get off the hook just by blaming it on other factors or because ""we didn't see it coming"". In a way, making bad policy decisions that will fuck up our entire country is kind of a large scale version of what Fran and many others have done to their own life."
