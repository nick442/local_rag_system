Car clubs are designed for your use case. They (are supposed to) feature (some or all of) local 24 hour availability; hourly rates for things like big shopping trips; whole-weekend use; insurance isn't your problem. If one is available in your area it's well worth a look. You may find that for longer trips a conventional hire is cheaper, but membership fees can be low (another variable between schemes is the tradeoff between the membership fee and the per-use fees).
