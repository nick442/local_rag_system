New Zeeland is quite prone to earthquakes, that is why low buildings are popular. Also, it is the foreigners that are the problem. They do drive the price up. Especially some 'lucky' house numbers are really wanted by Chinese immigrants. But there's nothing you can do about it. Instead of foreigners buying houses, it will be companies registered in New Zealand that will buy them. Those measures will only hit middle class immigrants, not richer people who are driving prices up.
