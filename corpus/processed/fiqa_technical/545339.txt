Running for-profit business doesn't pressure those involved to make the best product, it pressures them to make the best profit. Making the best profit pressures those involved to produce the cheapest product that the market won't reject marked at the highest price the market won't reject. Private companies have the freedom to avoid or limit the effect of that pressure if they choose, and sacrifice some profit for quality and improved customer satisfaction (though many still choose profit). Public companies, who are eventually beholdent to shareholders who sole goal is profitability, are much less likely to avoid the pressures to increase profits at all costs; particularly in the age of day traders and CEO merry-go-round, long-term planning is very difficult when short-term profitability is on the line. A company that made one widget a year for $1 and sold that widget for $10 billion would be a very successful company from the profit standpoint, and would likely have an excellent share price if the business model looked secure for the next year or two. Competition helps alleviate this morass and pushes for better products and lower prices by upping the bar of what the market will reject over time - increase the available alternatives, and the features/quality/price scale shifts. The importance of having a level playing field, anti-monopoly laws and ensure that new players can come onto the scene is fundamental to capitalism working - otherwise those who hold monopoly positions will prevent competition from emerging and charge as much as is possible for the cheapest product people will still buy. This is of particular issue when not buying the product is a threat to one's life or safety (medical care, emergency services, food, etc).
