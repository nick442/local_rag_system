I think it would be a wise move on the part of the 3D printing small businesses if contingency plans were put in place: Plan on alternate locations with backup printers, or better yet, print offsite in several undisclosed locations and employ couriers to transport the parts to the final customer. A dispersed mechanism is much harder to squash, and if a business starts by using satellite printers in the first place it's much easier to bring previously unused resources online in the event of a disruption. Better yet, subcontract the printing to individuals around your area that have the capabilities, giving them a steady stream of income in return for a reduced rate. I anticipate demand for this sort of service will pick up as both variety of materials and performance characteristics of output products improves. This will last until 3D printing is so ubiquitous that Epson and HP are selling units as cheaply as you buy Inkjet printers now. By that time, smart printing services will have figured out alternative ways to stay in business instead of fighting to stay on top just like the older business models they usurped.
