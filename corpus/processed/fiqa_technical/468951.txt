Where are you marketing your shirts? Are you on Instagram? If not that would be the best place to start. Then run promos. And reach out to influencers and have them give you a shoutout. If you're on a budget send a free shirt to specific influences with your targeted audience in mind & hopefully they'll give you a shoutout.
