The cost for publication is US$ 25, which they accept only via money order or check. I only own a saving account in an Indian bank. India does not have International Money Order to US. If check's are fine, walk into your Branch and request for a US Dollar Banks Check. They should be able to arrange for one, there are fees associated with this. You can then mail this out to the US Organization.
