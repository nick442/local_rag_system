I know it's popular to hate on Amazon, but look: by offering lower-priced product (both hardcopy and ebooks), they allow more people greater access to books. Yes, smaller, local bookstores and independents find it difficult (if not impossible) to compete with their prices, but customers vote with their dollars (or euros): they prefer cheaper books to cute bookstore/cafes. Amazon has led to more people reading more books, and it's a godsend to emerging writers who are no longer held in thrall to the major gatekeepers of the publishing industry. Hating on Amazon because it's corporate is pointless, unless you heap equal amounts of criticism against the big publishers who pick and choose who to publish and inflate prices on hardcopy books.
