One person on /r/Economics had a personal comment: Have briefed Powell a few times in my career. Also not a republican (or partisan in any way). I never realized he was republican, especially given Obama nominated him. While I prefer an economist in the mold of Bernanke or Yellen, this is probably the best possible outcome. Always found Powell to be inherently interested in understanding the details, listening to the people around h, and being pragmatic and effective in approach. While I think some changes at the fed should occur, I think they are far more subtle than the nonsense of the gold standard or a Taylor rule. http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/79q2xk/trump_is_expected_to_name_jerome_powell_as_next/dp46etk Sorry for any possible weird formatting, I'm on mobile.
