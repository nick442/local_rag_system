"This article is so maddening. Near the end when they're talking about the ethics guy and retroactively recusing himself I just couldn't take it anymore. In fairness, I don't really blame Icahn, or even Trump. In a way this stuff has been boiling up over the last 20 years as the country has adopted this Ayn Rand style of wealth sycophantism/worship. The bailout and Trump are just the epitome of it and his goals and ethics are exactly as advertised. When this is what your society values this is what we get. I hope we vote in a democratic senate just so at least a tiny bit of justice will hit these self serving assholes. It's one thing for Icahn to do the ""greed is good"" thing but another to blatantly lie to everyone (including himself) that he is being anything other than greedy. Helping minority owned refineries? Good lord."
