"The difference it makes is in the magnitude of risk difference people will need in order to overcome the amount they're paying to keep their money ""safe"". For example, if someone charged me $100 to keep $10,000 of my money ""safe"", such that I felt very very confident in getting $9,900 back at the end of a year, I might go for that if the only alternatives are to move it somewhere where there's a good chance I get less than $9,900 back at the end of a year. In short, I might feel I lose less by paying that -1% interest rate."
