It appears that usury has always been a bit of a sticking point for the Catholic church. Ever since the First Council of Nicea it was officially the position of the church that charging usury was a sin. It wasn't until the rise of Napoleon and his implementation of the Napoleonic Code that moved usury into wider acceptance. Pope Pius VIII essentially said that usury was now in the realm of the state and not a concern of the church. However, the church itself was unable to invest in interest bearing securities until the Code of Canon Law was updated in 1917 to allow the church to engage in interest bearing investments. However, there seems to be a renewed push within the Holy See (essentially the governing body for Catholics) to push back against some tenets of capitalism. So, it's not so much that the church has ever condoned the use usury but just let it kind of slide into a grey area. Some religions like Islam still forbid the use usury which leads to a special type of banking called Islamic Banking. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vix_pervenit
