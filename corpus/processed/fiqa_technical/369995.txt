"Only people I personally love are allowed to use cell phones in my presence. If someone else does it, I sometimes start up a loud conversation or soliloquy so the cell phone user can't hear their call. If they ask me to not talk so loud, I say ""You stop talking on your cell phone and I will shut up too."" All phone calls should be made only in private."
