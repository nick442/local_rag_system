So I'm bored on the bus reading about the firing of John Clayton at ESPN. The situation got me thinking about the potential sale of ESPN (from what I recall from a Disney FPA employee - she said they would never sell, but that was 3 years ago). Assuming Disney was forced to orderly divest the ESPN unit - what do you think is the best option? PE backed MBO (similar to dell)? Public spinoff? Strategic? Other? The network has gone down hill - they are losing subscribers above and beyond cord cutters. They have been shedding talent like crazy. What's the best option sale option and what's the turn around Strategy?
