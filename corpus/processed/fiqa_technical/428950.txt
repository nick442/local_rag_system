"You know, people shit on Taco Bell for giving them ""the runs"" or say their food is terrible, and so on. But looking at the business's sales numbers, I don't see a real problem. Taco Bell is profitable, and this move is expanding into a new market. That's a win. On a personal note, Taco Bell's has become [one of the healthiest fast food chains in the nation](http://www.businessinsider.com/taco-bell-is-now-one-of-americas-healthiest-fast-food-chains-2016-10) in recent years, and the quality of their food has drastically improved since we were kids. On a slightly more personal note, if eating at Taco Bell gives you the shits, I'd say you need to go see a doctor. That's not normal."
