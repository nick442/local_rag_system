1. CFA isn't very cheap either. Do look at colleges like FMS and DFS amongst others that are run by the government universities. They are prestigious with good placement track records and charge peanuts as fees. 2. Like I mentioned earlier, it's not easy to get a job even when you have completed your CFA-L3. Indian market is highly competitive, - there are literally thousands of MBAs joining the workforce every year. 3. Are you very clear on what area of finance you want to get into. Because CFA is mainly directed towards equity research and asset pricing. 4. My suggestion would be to try and get a job straight away. CFA is something you can do along with a job as well (atleast L1 a d L2) and u can fund the programme with your salary.
