"If by way of thinking you mean an evidence based belief system, then I think you should be swayed to abandon ideology in favour of evidence because it will make the world a better place. Why are you so opposed to changing your world view in light of evidence? What bad thing will happen to you if you change a position? You made the ""dogshit"" claim about quality of care and you based it on pure ideology. Reality does not agree with your claim. What bad thing will happen to you if you say ""I might need to re-evaluate my belief in what is the best system"""
