"Taken from a reddit comment i read earlier: ""Tesla does not have a demand generation problem. We are production constrained, not demand constrained. Until production exceeds demand, it doesn't make much sense to try to generate more demand because we already have more demand than we can fulfill. The Model 3 was the most successful product launch of any kind. I mean like ever, in history. We had more preorders than Apple did with the iPhone and we haven't even advertised. We are not trying to make the Model 3 waiting list any longer. We are anti-selling the Model 3."""
