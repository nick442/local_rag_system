We work for each other. When people come here and join our economy, they create as many jobs as they consume. It's not like there's this fixed number of jobs in an empty country and we all walk in and fill them and then there's no more. That's not how economies work. They spend money just like we do. The difference is, we didn't have to cover the cost of raising them. It's free productivity in it's prime. A gift to any economy, and we spit in it's face.
