I agree. Finding success in life is hard. It will probably always be hard. There is no need for us to exacerbate the issue by NOT helping those we CAN help, or by blaming them for their failures, when we never taught them how to succeed, either. >In order to acquire capital you need to do productive things, which (idealy) are productive to some degree to society as a whole. Unless you inherit it. The problem is, there are TONS of non-productive ways to build capital, that require capital. Stocks and futures, monopolies, law manipulation, media manipulation, etc. There are few methods to gain capital, if you have low capital, that aren't controlled by someone with large capital. And this is okay, so long as those with low capital have sufficient avenues to increase their capital acquisition. It also doesn't help that capital they do have is now worth less than it used to be. A minimum wage job used to be sufficient to pay for a year of college. Now it isn't even sufficient to pay for housing. You can't just acquire more capital, because existence itself costs capital. You need food, water, a place to stay, warmth, a way for people to reach you, and a reliable method of transportation. You probably also need access to a computer and the internet. All of these repeatedly cost capital, and you already entered with low capital. I don't believe our capitalist system is a good reflection of s/d anymore. I believe it represents control by those with the most. ISPs have local monopolies because people can't easily move, and a startup ISP is expensive. Pharmaceuticals have a monopoly on new medicines that people need to survive. It's kind of a health blackmailing system. Net Neutrality is being attacked, because ISPs want to be able to charge and control who can access what. Like any company, they want to thrive. We are letting our freedom be sold off, one piece at a time, because profit, not people, are the most important thing. At least, that is where I see things heading.
