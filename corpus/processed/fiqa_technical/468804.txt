If you're so inclined, elaborate more on the NY mess, particularly as to why distribution costs are as high as they are. My residential bill seems to be about 50/50 for transmission and supply, and that both of those numbers are well taxed. Also, is there a good primer somewhere on understanding energy markets for someone who just needs to deal in energy for a small-medium office?
