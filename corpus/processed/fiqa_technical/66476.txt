It's pretty simple. - Increase banks ability to lend for.. a. mortgages b. Small businesses Banks have tremendous quantities of cash trapped on their balance sheets that should be deployed into the economy where it generates growth, jobs, and strengthens the middle class. - improve infrastructure Our infrastructure is in disrepair and improving it will generate growth and something to show for the massive debt load we've accumulated for our nation. - repatriation holiday This capital needs to be working in our economy. - Increase taxes The massive flood of liquidity we've seen from the FED, what we should be seeing released from banks, and then what we should see from corporations repatriating cash will need to move through the economy and and going to work. Then, taxed; reducing deficits and eventually liquidity. - raise interest rates In that order. Capital moves through the market at different rates and paces. I'm usually for lower taxes, but it isn't always the solution. Lower taxes, reduced regulation, and low interest rates are all different ways of increasing liquidity, but should be increased/reduced at different parts of the economic cycle. Dimon is right about Washington. This is bullshit.
