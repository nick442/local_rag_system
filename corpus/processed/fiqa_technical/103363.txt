Well I mean yea it's absolutely possible to be making as much. I was talking about teaching the people you sponsor into business downline from you. You teach those people to stop shopping from GNC and Red Bull and instead buy similar products from Amway. It's money they are already spending and you teach them to shop through their own store to keep the profit. Some people just want to make a little bit of money on the side selling their products without sponsoring people. That's not what I'm talking about. The whole idea is to build a business asset that will give you TIME. It's about creating cash flow so you can stop trading your time working for a boss and building his company. Then you find other people who want that lifestyle and teach them how to accomplish those dreams.
