Look into http://tech.co/ They post numerous events around the country. I have no idea where you are located but there are often Angel Groups or Venture groups that have events (some are paid and some you may be able to get access through your college). There is also a large national competition (http://www.vcic.unc.edu/) Really though it helps to be in a location where start-ups are and generally they tend to circulate around where the money is. Look into any local incubators or co-working environments where office space is rented (Example: http://www.co-merge.com/) These environments will often host various events.
