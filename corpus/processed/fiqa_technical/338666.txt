That Economist quote only offers a very weak argument. It doesn't argue from anything fundemental, it just says they think corporations borrow too much and the tax-code should remove this insentive to borrow. That's an arguement based on a feeling and weak. There's absolutely a logical consistency to allow a deduction for interest at the corporate level and not dividends. As mentioned, interest is an expense to a financier, dividends are distributed residual income.
