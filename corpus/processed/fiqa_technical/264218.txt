If you work for crap wages at Walmart or mcdonalds and are still there making crap wages 14 years later then you have done nothing to better yourself. If you're not willing to invest in yourself and demand a better paying job then why do you expect to get hand outs. The system is complicated it can be won but you have to be willing to work hard for it. Too many people sit on their hands and wait for hand outs.
