"just for shits, i'll give you the excerpts from Liar's Poker: ""I was living in London in the winter of 1984, finishing a master's degree in economics at the London School of Economics, when I received an invitation to dine with the Queen Mother. It came through a distant cousin of mine who, years before, and somewhat improbably, had married a German baron.. What had been advertised as a close encounter with British royalty proved to be a fundraiser with seven or eight hundred insurance salesmen..Somewhere in the Great Hall, as luck would have it, were two managing directors from Salomon Brothers. I knew this only because, as luck would further have it, I was seated between their wives. The wife of the more senior Salomon Brothers managing director, an American, took our table firmly in hand, once we'd finished craning our necks to snatch a glimpse of British royalty. When she learned that I was preparing to enter the job market and was considering investment banking, she turned the evening into an interview.. Having examined what good had come from my twenty-four years on earth, the asked why I didn't come and work on the Salomon Brothers' trading floor."" It's a great book, I highly recommend it."
