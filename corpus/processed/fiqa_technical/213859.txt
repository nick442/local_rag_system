I'm not a finance professional by any means, but my understanding of cashier's checks is that they're more in favour of the person receiving. They're essentially guaranteeing that you have the money in your account to provide payment to the recipient. The advice I've always received is to treat cashier's checks and money orders as straight up cash, because that's essentially what they are. Hopefully someone else can come in with a better background, but I figured I'd pitch in.
