"This reminds me of philosopher John Rawls' ""difference principle"", which states that growing inequality is acceptable as long as the people at the bottom of the income scale are better off than they were before. Edit: Low income people are surely better off in some ways; notably, they can afford to buy consumer goods that they couldn't before. But it is harder for them to achieve upward social mobility."
