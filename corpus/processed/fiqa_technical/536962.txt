- Would you want to work in an environment where your pay drops significantly if a large client leaves? You do nothing wrong, the client goes bankrupt, and you're assigned the work of smaller accounts to fill out your work week but you're making 15% less despite being more experienced than the year before and doing a great job. - Whoever is handling assignments would be granted an obscene amount of power within the organisation. How do accounts get shuffled fairly? Are people assigned permanently or do they get shuffled around to even things out? In short, your idea could be very good for the company, but terrible for the employees. Innovation would stagnate (or be kept to each employee in the hopes of gaining an edge), office politics would increase, and the environment could turn toxic quickly. Turnover would probably increase as well.
