Yeah, good luck to you dude. The way I see it is, I have absolutely zero chance of reaching my goals if I don't try. Can't focus on my poor academic history. Just need to keep improving myself to incrementally improve my chances. Plus, the level of intellect required to succeed in IB should make community college a breeze. Since I have been focused on Finance I haven't been close to receiving a B. You should kill it.
