Aah.. well, then in that case you should actually integrate a monte carlo return scenario with your equity values. Ultimately it's not going to matter what your RFR is because it's going to be equal in both cases, so you're really just talking about return differences. Again, it would be impractical for these two options. Maybe just look at cash outlay - an amortization table of sorts, and that's how you'd calculate the breakeven point. You could inflate the unspent cash difference by a small margin (perhaps 0.5% to account for something like a CD or an ARS) but the big difference is going to be the interest rate with respect to a mortgage vs. a perpetual cash payment of rent that never attains any real value.
