Its pretty simple why BMW and other German companies have thrived and its that they've delivered cars that consumers want. GM failed at this and Ford is at least producing high quality cars, but not necessarily conveying the kind of brand value that the Germans have been so successful at. Keeping a cap on costs is just one element of business. Augmenting revenues is another. If you're exceptional at selling the product and have great brand value (Apple, Coca-Cola, BMW) you don't have to pay attention to the costs as much.
