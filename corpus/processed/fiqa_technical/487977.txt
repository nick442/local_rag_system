You're not an engineer, are you? It is an exchange, work for pay. The whole idea of 'joint community' went out the window with outsourcing, arbitrary layoffs because the boss thought he should sack 10%, and worst of all - HR, treating people as line replaceable units Engineers were never particularly bought into the touchy feely crap, and they are certainly empirically minded enough to reflect the above reality back - zero loyalty on both sides.
