This is nothing more than a great way to sell out plane and ensure that no more seats are available at any price, even a high price that would be willingly paid by someone who really, really needs it. The fact that this isn't the general reaction by the public is indicative of a gross lack of education in basic economics, just like the following: Lack of understanding in evolution: If people came from apes, why are there still apes? Lack of understanding in geometry: How can the Earth be round if the horizon always rises to eye level? Lack of understanding in statistics: If global warming is real, how come we hit a record for coldest July in this one town I heard about? Lack of understanding in economics: If a business dramatically underprices their extremely limited goods, it helps the people who really need those goods.
