Patents grant one company or individual a coercive monopoly on an idea. One cannot own information..information is neither scarce nor rivalrous. “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” -George Bernard Shaw Granting someone a monopoly on an idea is a wrong in practical terms, as stories like these, and the various patent trolling occurring in the tech sector demonstrate. Patent/copyright protect neither the fashion nor the food industry (in terms of recipes) and those industries thrive, as well as constantly innovate (indeed, they are *forced* to innovate, since they cannot monopolize one idea and rest on their laurels). Coercively preventing someone from doing as they will with an idea using their own resources is morally wrong because you are denying their freedom to act using their own body, and justly owned property. By building a chair using my own tools and materials, that happens to look similar to another chair someone else built 1000 miles away using their own resources, I've done nothing to deprive the other chair builder of his property..yet under current law, I can be prosecuted (i.e. fined, jailed, and beaten if I attempt to resist) if he has been granted a legal monopoly to that design..whether I've ever even seen his chair or not. On both ideological and pragmatic grounds, the concept of patents is a failure.
