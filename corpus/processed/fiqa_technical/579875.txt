USPS is in debt because they have a wonky pension system where they have to guarantee (And pre-pay) pensions for the next X years (Where X is large). Also, shipping is part letters and part packages. Letters are hard to make profitable. Fedex, UPS and DHL get the sweet deal of shipping (mostly) packages. They pretty much get to only play the profitable part of the game while USPS has to play both. They can be competitive since they don't have the low-margin job of shipping letters, and in turn they can eat into the profitable part of USPS while leaving the unprofitable part untouched.
