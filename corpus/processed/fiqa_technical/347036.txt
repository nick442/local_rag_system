I'm sorry, does this somehow change the fact that your original comment is wrong? I make about 7 times minimum wage. I have no direct personal interest in having it raised. People shouldn't be able to work 40 hours a week and still have to collect government benefits to make ends meet. That is essentially corporate welfare, with the government paying the difference between what wal-mart pays its employees and what they actually need to live.
