I guess that is one example out of hundreds. It does not exemplify the tribes here with huge casinos, hotels and shopping malls. Maybe those tribes do not want to grow. I am sick to death of growth. It serves the few at the expense of the many. Human sprawling is killing the region where I live in every way, and has killed many before. If UBI money is helping the surrounding states, it works. If the Native Americans don't grow their economy, that is their choice. If they don't want to integrate in whities back stabbing dog eat dog economy. I empathize fully. Edit: And the Navajo people's needs were met. What is utterly ridiculous is that everyone in this country is given money from someone. Some just get more than others. Someone tell me why I am less deserving.
