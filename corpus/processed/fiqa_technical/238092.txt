In Portugal, Uber competes with Cabify. Though Uber is the cheapest, Cabify is only marginally more expensive (10% max usually), no dynamic pricing, great customer service, they give you water for free if necessary - great for when you go out, cars are newer/better overall, drivers are nicer and they themselves mention that Cabify on top of commission it also pays them a fixed price/hour which even if low it guarantees them some money on the table. I personally switched due to the PR scandals and honestly for the reasons I mentioned I don't know how people still go for Uber over here.
