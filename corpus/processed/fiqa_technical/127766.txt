"I think this quote from the article sums things up really well: > ""No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all. There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number."" A claim by Trump is not the same as a claim about Trump. As a reminder, his claim was: > Trump tweeted, ""The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion."" And this is the claim that has been rated Mostly False. A claim **by** Trump."
