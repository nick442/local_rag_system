> It's a huge joke. People are putting their stock in it, but there was a front page story just yesterday about another crypto currency that went from $300 to $0.10 with a single transaction. Hi, long time crypto nerd here.. Just wanted to say that transaction was on one exchange and the price pretty much went back to normal in a few seconds. Due to the lack of experience in trading some people just dump like that on a whim, its not the norm, but it does happen. In any case, that was some +1,000 units worth which again is super rare. They likely bought a long time ago and forgot them.. again, fairly uncommon.
