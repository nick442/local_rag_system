I don't want to ruin your childhood, but, some companies are in the red with no sight of seeing black on their balance sheets in the future with whatever Kay-Bee toys business model was. Some business models just don't adapt to changes in the game, and have been too inefficient for too long. They run a business, not a charity. EDIT: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted. We're not talking about a fantasy world where everyone will be employed and every business will succeed. That's just not realistic. If Kay-Bee toys was sold to Romney's Bain Capital means it was probably in shambles in the first place, and the employees would have lost their jobs anyway.
