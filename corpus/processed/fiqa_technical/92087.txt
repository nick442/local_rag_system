46 years for Fred Smith - this is quite a feat. Jeff Bezos is exactly half that at 23 years. Incredible what Fred did in all those years to build up FedEx and how to company has changed the world. Though, what an awesome job it'd have been to be a runner before FedEx - catching overnight flights to deliver an envelope. Speaking to shipping, I'd say Smith has had the biggest impact since Malcom McLean pioneered the shipping container.
