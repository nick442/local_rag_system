Well, the author *could* be right, but not necessarily for the reasons cited. Several states, including California and Nevada, recently changed their laws to slow down the foreclosure process and protect borrowers. It took lenders/servicers awhile to figure out how to work within the new legal structure, so foreclosure starts fell during that time. Now they've got it figured out, so filings went up. It doesn't mean the sky is falling. If the economy keeps improving, that will temper potential defaults due to, well, unemployment and HELOC expirations causing higher mortgage payments. There's not a lot of available inventory right now (investors have been converting short sale and foreclosed properties to rentals) so there is some pent-up demand. If credit availability is increased by the FICO score reducing the hit for lates and defaults on medical expenses, more people will be eligible to buy a house and that will reduce foreclosure rates. There's a lot of moving parts here, and this story only focused on a small section so take it with a grain of salt. And remember: if the author could really predict the future, he wouldn't be making a living as a writer for the New Republic. edit: for clarity
