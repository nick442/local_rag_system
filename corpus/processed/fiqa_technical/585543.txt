"Just speaking from my experience here. When I was younger (lol only 23 now), I didn't really get pocket money. If I wanted something I had to work for this, luckily at 13 I scored a paper round gaining Â£10 per week. I would personally say to encourage children to do some ""work"", whether its a paper round, or even just house chores. I learned early on, that to get money you have to work for it. I've always had a job since 13, most of my college years I held 2 jobs at a time, even 3 at 1 point. Many of my friends didn't work for their pocket money, they relied on handouts, quite a few of these friends have later on in life taken the easy route, not working and rely on state (pocket money), or still have mummy and daddy pay for everything So my moral is; don't just give out willy-nilly, teach some value to money and it will go a long way ;) /2 cents"
