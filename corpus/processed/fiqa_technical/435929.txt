There are several disadvantages: You cannot generally withdraw from a 401(k) while you're still employed at the same employer. When you do withdraw, then unless you roll it over, you pay tax on the whole amount based on the marginal tax rate you have that year. If it comes on top of your regular salary, the whole withdrawal will be taxed at the higher marginal rates. You will also pay extra 10% penalty for the withdrawal. For home purchase you can take out up to $10K without the penalty, I doubt that would be enough for downpayment. There are probably more, but these are the major ones I can spot. The same goes to the 457(k), except that those don't have the 10% penalty.
