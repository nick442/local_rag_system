"> to be replaced by some whipped up reality trash That's exactly my point. The reason everything is being replaced with ""reality"" tv shows is because they're so inexpensive to make. A ""smash hit"" is defined by its profit margins. A reality tv show can generate less income than a scripted show, and end up with more profits for the network since they cost so little to produce."
