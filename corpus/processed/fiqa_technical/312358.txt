"But it's also true that the FDIC (or equivalent) insurance account doesn't have enough to cover all deposits. The FDIC may come in handy if your local FDIC member bank goes belly up and a few hundred depositors need to be made whole. However, in a national crisis, where the government is ""legally"" stealing funds, that FDIC insurance is a joke. I do agree though, if you have more than the insured amount in a single account, split it up."
