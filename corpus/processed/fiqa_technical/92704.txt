Normally, except this is 160 characters or less. Twitter is basically free public SMS, not that dissimilar to WhatsApp. Except WhatsApp has an annual fee, and twitter is free. And twitter makes money.. How? See, Facebook is a huge platform that wants to know everything about everyone which is extremely valuable to marketers. I can't tick a button on Facebook, or like a post, without it affecting the ads. But twitter? No ads. No marketing information.. Hence as a business, the concept is fantastic but revenue poor. If I was them, I most likely would have accepted the $500 million dollar offer from Facebook, as they have the Information and the money that twitter doesn't have, and probably never will.
