"> StockTwits Chairman Howard Lindzon, who is long Apple stock, dismissed the IDC report, arguing that what matters is that the company's ""products are great, the stores are great, and new products are coming."" What the what. Samsung has now 25% of the market, Huawei may very well reach 10% in mid 2015, if not sooner, yet their shares are up 20% since the beginning of the year. I'm fond of Apple products, but I just can't see them resisting against State-backed Samsung for one or two more years. And the $9bn market for the iWatch is pure speculation."
