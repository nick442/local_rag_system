I just researched it a bit more and you are correct. It is essentially only a drive-reduction gear and a reverse gear. This means there is very, very little to be serviced on the entire drivetrain. The biggest service issue is the battery pack, and that has a lifetime that is accounted for in the 8 year warranty limit. So Tesla is not sweating the number of miles, honestly.
