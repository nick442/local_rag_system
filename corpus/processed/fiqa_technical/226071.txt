I would listen to chrissundberg below. Most professionals I meet and interact with in accounting firms, law firms, lending, and others are by the book, smart, professional, and honest in their business dealings. Of course I have also run into a small minority that try to avoid contractual obligations or pull a fast one on the auditors, but these guys are known quickly throughout the business community and avoided. You need to reevaluate your thoughts on government's role in business and the finance industry, which you are clearly interested in joining. Quite frankly you won't last a week coming in most companies if you vocalize the government should do audits and business is amoral.
