This are my opinions on the subject: -People are tired of the corrupt system of bankers who poorly manage money, Bitcoin is built on trust, and more people are starting to trust it. Can you trust a banker? NO. Can you trust computer systems built on strict code that will always do what you tell them too? YES. To understand why Bitcoin is safe, one must first understand the block-chain technology. MORE INFO -More companies are starting to accept Bitcoin as payment, which creates more trust in the system, which brings more people interest. LIST OF COMPANIES -Bitcoin is a worldwide coin, you can pay your friend in Japan with Bitcoin and the transaction is done in 10 minutes, as opposed to 5-7 business day if done through a bank. The banker fee is huge, the Bitcoin miner fee is minimal. -Bitcoin is like Gold but better, Bitcoin is not built for everyday transactions just like gold, its not built for buying coffee either, its built to retain value which is why there is a finite amount (21 million). -A huge benefit of bitcoin is anyone with a smartphone or a computer can download an App and start accepting Bitcoins as payments. Gold is not easily trade-able. Bitcoins is as simple as sending a picture message. (NOTE: More than 2 billion smartphone users around the world around 3.7 billion internet users around the world all capable of one day trading using bitcoin) LIVE INTERNET USERS -Keep in mind, there is more than one crypto currency, all built on different ideas and systems, all performing with incredible gains.
