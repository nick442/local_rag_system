"I think people naturally overreact to crises. And, like you, I'm not really sure what the answer is. Capital requirements were a good start though. It also makes you wonder what would happen if ""mark-to-market"" accounting was not necessary, would the severity of the financial crisis have been muted? At the same time, maintaining the value of worthless debt seems equally silly (I'm talking to you, Europe!). Just an interesting time. I don't think things are as broken as people make it seem. 2008-9 was a big check and re-balancing. Unfortunately the consumers haven't been re-balanced like businesses due to poor employment and wages. Sorry, I'm just talking in circles now."
