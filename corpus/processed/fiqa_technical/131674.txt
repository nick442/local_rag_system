"I *loved* the Zune. I had a ZuneHD (the 16g touch screen, sort of like the ipod touch, but smaller form factor). The PC software was actually _good_. The device was great, it played music wonderfully. The only reason I don't have a Zune anymore is because I got an Android phone (HTC Incredible) back then, and I have a strict personal policy of ""one overpriced gadget on me at any time"", and I wasn't going to carry a music player and a phone when the phone can do both just fine."
