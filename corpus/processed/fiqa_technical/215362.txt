> Home solar doesn't need to completely replace grid power - a 70% reduction in demand would be sufficient to reduce generation requirements to only existing hydro / wind / nuclear plants. That is exactly where the problem is. When your home solar and battery is out of power, then your grid (without traditional backup) is out of power as well. So in the end you need your grid to supply power in the 30% of time when your renewable plus some storage has none. At the same time all household, equipped like yours are out of power as well. So either the grid/power company has conventional backup or huge storage. Of course, the cost of these must be levied over the 30% of time they are used, not economically attractive. So you expect as a household to be able to just get energy from the grid/power company when it is necessary for you as a backup. Are you ready to pay the triple rate during that time ?
