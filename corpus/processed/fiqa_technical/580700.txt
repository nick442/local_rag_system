No, the real problem is government-induced tuition inflation. Prior to the formation of the federal Department of Education, and the Sallie Mae student loan clearing house around the late 1970s / 1980 .. inflation adjusted tuition had been flat for many decades. There's an overwhelmingly obvious inflection point right when those 2 organizations started operating, and inflation adjusted tuition has been sky rocketing ever since. Tuition inflation is directly caused by the federal government, the data is abundantly clear. And the only way to stop it is to get the federal government out of the education loan business. Make student debt no different from any other form of unsecured debt. Not government guaranteed, dischargeable in bankruptcy, etc. And then take all that money that the federal government would have been wasting on inflating tuition prices, and plow it into building new land grant universities. Like we've done for 100 years already. You know, the same system that gave us the amazing universities we have today? That will shift the supply curve, driving tuition prices even lower. And then you can get back to having a social worker go get a 4 year degree, learning the latest and greatest research in social work, becoming the best damn social worker in comparable OECD nations, because it only cost them $5k for their entire 4 year degree.
