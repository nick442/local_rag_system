Yes but I get a TV delivered to my door. I have to lug it in to my car and take it to my house and have someone help me if I buy it from a store. I just bought a TV from Amazon and it came with white glove delivery service where they even unpack it for you. There were no TVs at retail stores that were remotely competitive with the prices on Amazon for the price range I was looking for as sales tax would have added like 80 bucks to my TV.
