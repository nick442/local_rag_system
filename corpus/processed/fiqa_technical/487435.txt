The card-holder agreement does not explicitly specify a minimum spending requirement. It does though, have the following catch-all clause for closing the account: We may: • cancel your Account, • suspend the ability to make charges, • cancel or suspend any feature on your Account, and • notify merchants that your Account has been cancelled or suspended. If we do any of these, you must still pay us for all charges under the terms of this Agreement. We may do any of these things at our discretion, even if you pay on time and your Account is not in default. If your Account is cancelled, you must destroy your cards. We may agree to reinstate your Account after a cancellation. If we do this, we may: • reinstate any additional cards issued on your Account, • charge you any applicable annual fees, and • charge you a fee for reinstating the Account. One would suspect that American Express would happily collect the fee from anyone who holds the card, but is not using it (in any way). Someone, though, that isn't spending the expected amount of money, but is availing themselves of the 24 hour concierge service, etc., would probably find their privileges revoked and/or their card canceled.
