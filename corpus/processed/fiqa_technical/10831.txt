Did anyone else catch this gem from CEO Richard Johnson: >On the Friday earnings call, Johnson went on to say that the company isnâ€™t worried about Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.22% **because of the experience at Foot Locker stores, like a special event or a conversation with one of the store associates.** How fucking out of touch are these upper level executives? It's unbelievable. Consumers don't want a conversation with minimum wage employees who don't give a damn. The shareholders would do well to boot him out ASAP and get someone new in.
