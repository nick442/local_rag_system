I work for a Nissan dealership, the lot is full of customer's Versas. Apparently they ran a risk of the passenger airbag randomly deploying. We are giving them all brand new loaners because the airbag won't be available until next year sometime. Crazy stuff.. Looks like subaru won't have nearly as many cars recalled.
