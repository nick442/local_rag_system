"This might sound absurd, but Japan has a lot of debt held by itself. In other words, when people say a country is ""just printing money"" it's rarely true. It's often some kind of beyond being issued and sold to the public or to institutions. But in Japan's case they actually did ""print money"" and have done so for 30 years. Yet they've had a deflation almost every year since. This shows that expanding the money supply doesn't always result in inflation, it depends a lot on the country and its people and means of production. I guess Japan's move to cut the debt is a step into unknown territory, and we can't really know what will happen."
