The safest real estate investment is to underpay. In most areas the market is very public. Flippers are abundant, because most people want a move-in ready home, and as it is leveraged, they will overpay for that luxury. Buy an under market, and you are safer. The people who lose their shirts buy new condos at market rates at the peak of the market. At the same time, people are purchasing starter homes that need a little work, and stay well above water. Always remember you can't change the location of a home, but you can change almost everything else. Find a well located but beat up home priced well under market, and financially you will generally do very well.
