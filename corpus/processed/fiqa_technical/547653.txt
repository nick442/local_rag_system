I don't think so, but: - It depends on the product, some products are simple (Vodka) others have plenty of restrictions (Plutonium). So without you naming what your product is nobody can help you. - Regulation differ for each country. Greece and Italy are different countries. For most products you pay some import duty, the applicable VAT and some customs fees and all is well.
