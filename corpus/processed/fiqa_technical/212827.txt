"I expect that the loan documents show both you and your ex-partner as ""jointly and severally liable"" for the debt, and thus you're both responsible for it. It doesn't really matter what other paperwork you have that says otherwise or what other promises might have been made. Certainly, the other agreements give you legal ground to go after your ex-partner for the money, but they give you no leverage with the bank. If you end up paying this debt off to save your credit, you need to make sure that the account is closed. Make sure you have paperwork showing it as closed, and showing that it was paid in full, and then keep that paperwork forever. Re #1: I think it will eventually show up on your credit report. You could ask the bank for proof that you owe the money, if you like, but that will probably just delay the inevitable. Re #2: His bankruptcy filing really has no bearing on you and your obligation to repay the loan. If he didn't list this debt, then he is still liable for it as well (and you can still go after him under your other agreements). But either way, you're still on the debt."
