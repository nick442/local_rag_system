Haha, you are aware that there are articles you can read if you click those links right? My impression after reading the articles and another posted yesterday about German automakers isn't that it was something forced by the unions, but more of an agreement reached between the unions and VW. Unions and management in Germany don't have quite the adversarial mindset that exists in the US, so they're a lot more likely to make concessions on either side, but it usually benefits people other than the executives since there's so many more of them.
