Data mining + uber connections can land you in with a hedge fund. I would focus on being as social as possible, joining business clubs / connected fraternities and enrolling in CFA 1 to maximize your chances. A solid connection will get you further faster than anything else. I'm going to say that the graduate classes you take won't be as relevant at the Msc at the end of your name.
