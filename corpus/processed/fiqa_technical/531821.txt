"Seriously whole foods accounts for maybe 5% of market share in the grocery industry. I feel like I have seen a lot of ""writers/reporters/bloggers"" trying to paint amazon as taking over groceries and retail, but it's just a huge overreaction. Just like the stock market overreacted to amazon purchasing whole foods, this is just another overreaction."
