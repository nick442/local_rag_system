It's not native functionality, but you could probably do it. You could create a fake security/currency for the meter type (kWh, whatever gas/water get measured in ). Updating would be a pain, though. You'd have to go read it and enter the data manually -- unless it was a smart meter, and then you could probably build some sort of script for it. In terms of figuring how much to pay -- maybe have an account in liabilities for stuff you haven't paid for yet, and another in assets for what you have paid for? This seems like it could be a lot more complicated than it's worth.
