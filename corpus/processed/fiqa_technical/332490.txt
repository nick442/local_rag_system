I just want to clarify that accounting and finance are two very different fields and if you're looking into finance you should get a finance degree, not an accounting degree. It is much more versatile. Finance is forward-looking, accounting is backward-looking. If you want to take online courses then take them from a reputable state school which offers them. Don't get a degree from an online-only school; even if they aren't a scam, you will have a degree from an online-only school.
