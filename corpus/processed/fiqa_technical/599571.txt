Im in texas so as far as i know we are allowed to work pretty much as much as we wantm its probably different in different states and i could be wrong about texas. Ive only worked in fast food so they could have smuged the rules a bit. I cant really work that little since if i do I'll only be able to spend or save 80 a month after bills and gas. So i qish i could work that little lol
