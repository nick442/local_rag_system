"> why we should compare the minimum wage with the average rent is unknown. Um, because, since the 60's, ""poverty"" in the U.S. is measured against expenses and ""the cost of living,"" of which housing is a major component? Because the ""30%"" rule has been around for decades? Whether you agree with the ""30%"" line or not, pleading ignorance of it only serves to show that you absolutely do not know what you are talking about, and your piece is worthless nonsense which serves only to muddy the waters."
