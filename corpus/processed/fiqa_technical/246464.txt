These aren't just any old run of the mill unions, these are ***Public*** unions. These are unions of ***government*** employees. Government employees already get special benefits by dint of their government jobs, such as wonderful pension and medical plans that the rest of us can only dream about. When they unionize, they demand even more and get it. Seems to me that if government workers want to unionize then they should forfeit their government benefits and be paid as non-government contractors or something similar.
