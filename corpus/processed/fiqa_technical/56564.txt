So the EU is forcing its ~~green religion dogma~~ taxation policies on US airlines flying in international airspace? Or is it just taxing the fuel that is burned while flying through EU airspace? If the tax applies to all of the fuel that is burned, even that which is burned in international and US airspace, who gets the money?
