You are correct, Chipotle is not by any Hispanic areas, it's pretty much located in mainly white dominated areas. ..Frontera is the other restaurant that Rick Bayless owns, and it is good, but it has nothing on Xoco. ..definitely a must try next time you are in Chicago. Chicago does have the best food in America, after that I feel Minneapolis is a close second. I would also imagine the Latinos you see are american and that's why they go to Chipotle. Where in Chicago you have more of a foreign and 1st generation Hispanic population.
