"I listen to EDM and for whatever reason, many EDM artists post their mixes on Soundcloud. So I use Soundcloud. But holy shit is everything about it garbage. The app likes to close, freeze, or just refuse to play despite appearing to otherwise be functioning. The search is hot garbage. You can't really string together a play list (at least not easily that we've found). You can favorite things.. but I am constantly hunting through the list of new stuff looking for mixes amongst the 2-3 minute song reposts. An ""add to playlist"" option would be really nice. Soundcloud is hot garbage and them cutting 40% of their staff makes me immediately think that they fired only two people because it is hard to believe that more than five people could work at a place with such a shitty app."
