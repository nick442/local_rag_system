I'm the odd man out. My previous boss (at the same company) had a kid at 15. Despite the extra responsibility, she managed to become a CPA and have a relatively successful accounting career. Yeah it's nuts, what are the odds that all these people had kids early right? Get this, the purchasing manager's daughter had a baby at 19. She managed to hook her daughter up with a job at my place of employment in order to help her earn enough money to care for the baby (father punked out). There definitely seems to be a company culture of this sort of thing. As far as seizing a promotion. I don't understand why someone who is inferior in every aspect except personal favor is automatically the best candidate for a promotion due to backdoor politics. So what you're saying is that I should focus on my soft skills and less on everything else in order to get ahead? It seems wrong that I'm forced to be stuck where I am because of back door politics and not because of merit and my ability to add value to the company. I guess I don't fit into the company culture because I don't have a sob story about how I'm supporting children I conceived before I was legally able to vote. Edit: I should probably find another company that appreciates high performers.
