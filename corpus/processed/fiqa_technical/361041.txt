Like how the Great Instagram Purge of 2015 saw large accounts lose millions of followers? Haha. I can only imagine people stopped paying so much for followers after that. I’m not sure what algorithm they use to find fake users but I’m sure it can’t be hard to trick with a bit of randomizing content. I’m sure bringing Instagram to the web didn’t help there either.
