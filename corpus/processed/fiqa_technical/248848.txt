">but we can always produce more classrooms. can we? we certainly can't at a moment's notice, those things take time. time represents risk. education could be just another bubble like real estate, is it worth taking the risk of building more classrooms considering the possibility that, in 2 years, the demand may drop, because people have realized that education does not necessarily correlate to motivation? in fact, that's already happened a few times recently. for example, the tech bubble of the .. memory fades, late 90s, right? while the bubble was growing, and computers were going from either toys that geeks played with or tools of business to things that everybody ""had to"" have, it looked like programming (and related skills) might soon be highly valued- so schools started popping up to meet that demand. but by the time those students were ready to enter the market, the bubble had burst, and while still not a bad career, it was nowhere near the easy ride that many of the students had envisioned. the schools got their money, but people saw that the promise of an education doesn't always meet expectations- and a lot more people are seeing that right now, as record numbers of graduates can't find jobs- are schools going to bet on neverending growth? i don't think so. they might milk it while it lasts, though. meh, it's late and i haven't articulated my thoughts very well here, feel free to pick it apart."
