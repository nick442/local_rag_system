"You are spreading misinformation and propaganda in the form of ""knowledge"" which is why you should provide evidence for your claims. The argument that ammonia is ""natural"" is ridiculous. A lot of things are natural will kill you in small amounts. You don't go into detail for your claims other than to act like people who don't want ammonia added to their meat are dumb and uninformed. Why don't tell us how much ammonia is okay? Should we just trust these corporations that everything they do is good for us? You can spout your opinions on food where ever you want, but you are just as big an intellectual fraud as the people who avoid gluten and don't know what it is."
