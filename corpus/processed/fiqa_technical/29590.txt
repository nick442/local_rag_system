"In my area, the prices are actually fairly comparable (for produce) but WF's is definitely better quality. Where WF gets expensive is with meats (because so many are grass fed, organic, etc.) and with anything prepared/frozen. (Again, organic, gluten-free, etc.) So if you're using Whole Foods as a ""healthier"" replacement for a diet that consists of lots of frozen pizza, meat, etc. then Whole Foods will be exorbitant. I primarily use it for getting quality produce (when it's not farmshare season), bulk stuff like rice, and for occasional splurges like a nice piece of fish."
