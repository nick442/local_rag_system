I am actually partial to the idea of negative taxation systems, here in Australia we have the 'work for the dole' program which is essentially what the author describes, but it is inefficient and demeaning. It would be far more efficient to dramatically reduce the minimum wage and introduce a negative tax rate, or rather bracket the tax rate such that it enters negative territory at some point. This way employers can afford to employ more staff and people would still be compensated through the tax system and end up reasonably well off. So long as the compensation is fair I don't see how this is not preferable to a tax-and-transfer system where the government taxes with one hand and gives with the other?
