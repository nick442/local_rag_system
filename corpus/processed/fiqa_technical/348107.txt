It's a gift if there are no strings attached. If you are rationalizing it to try to make it a gift for tax or any other purpose when there really is a connection between the transactions, or when you expect any kind of value or benefit in return for it, then it's not a gift.. don't make it one and don't call it one. That would indeed likely be fraud. Play be the rules and sleep easy, is how I like to live.
