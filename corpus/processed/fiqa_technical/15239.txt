The economy. Which has a pretty strong effect on most people's lives. You can't throw 90% of energy subsidies to one part of the industry which produces a fraction of the rest of the industry without negatively affecting consumers (everyone). Because you're idealistic and don't understand that it is basic economics. https://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/ Renewables get $15B + compared to about $4B combined for oil, coal, and natural gas, while producing only 13% of total energy. So, you've got much larger industries in oil, especially, that receive less money for doing a more efficient job of providing energy. That means they can't lower their prices. There's also a further $12B in subsidies for transmission or delivery.
