• you have to mine the uranium (or other elements), destroying land, releasing sediments in the air and it does use fossil fuels and water. not to mention the extensive refining process after that • once the lifespan of the nuclear plant is over, it just sits there, you can't do anything with it • have to store the used rods for thousands to hundreds of thousands of years I studied this kind of stuff in school, nuclear isn't as clean as you would hope. even EVs aren't as clean as they make them out to be (still better than internal combustion). however I'm not familiar with MSRs, but I expect there to be trade offs as well. nothing is perfect
