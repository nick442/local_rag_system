"Overoptimism, making mistakes and wrong assumptions, being taken by lies, all of that is legal and, in a lot of ways, very human and forgivable. But when they ""buried her findings .. before, during and after the financial crisis, and even into 2012"" from senior management whose job it is to look out for bad investments, ""buying mortgages from outside lenders with doctored tax forms, phony appraisals and missing signatures"", ""systematically violating U.S. mortgage regulations"", and lying about losses while still taking money from the government, these are illegal and immoral practices with profit as a motive and with the knowledge that what they were doing was wrong. Buying into something with all you've got is any business's prerogative. Lying, manipulating, and willfully breaking the law, especially when the product and means to purchase directly impacts the customer, all to maximize profit is not."
