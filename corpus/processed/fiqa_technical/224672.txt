"For every buyer there is a seller. That rule refers to actual (historical) trades. It doesn't apply to ""wannabees."" Suppose there are buyers for 2,000 shares and sellers for only 1,000 at a given price, P. Some of those buyers will raise their ""bid"" (the indication of the price they are willing to pay) above P so that the sellers of the 1000 shares will fill their orders first (""sold to the highest bidder""). The ones that don't do this will (probably) not get their orders filled. Suppose there are more sellers than buyers. Then some sellers will lower their ""offer"" price to attract buyers (and some sellers probably won't). At a low enough price, there will likely be a ""match"" between the total number of shares on sale, and shares on purchase orders."
