"A lot bothers me about this article - numbers and claims that don't seem right.. http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbbl_a.htm - 10% increase in US oil production over 5 years.. Not a ""dramatic"" increase in production. Peace in the middle east? Err, yeah.. Slowdown in growth in China? Sure - only 8.1% GDP growth in Q12012, that doesn't mean demand will suddenly decline, just that it won't go up quite as quickly (http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/12/news/economy/china-gdp/index.htm) Lots of other little things as well, but the summary is that I don't think we'll be seeing $2 gas anytime soon."
