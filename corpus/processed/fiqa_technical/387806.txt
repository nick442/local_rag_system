Hardly anyone retail shops on eBay, this is visible just on the [Google trends compared to the two other competitors](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=amazon,ebay,walmart) mentioned here. Notice, compared to those two, eBay has basically no holiday season bump? It's peak was in December 2007 and since then Amazon's been eating it's lunch and even Walmart gained a little ground. As eBay transitioned from fleamarket to Chinese junk retailer, to compete with Amazon, one major thing it lost out on was reviews. Every item from every merchant is it's own listing with no history (beyond merchant reputation). Add onto that, the fact you're not dealing with a single entity (like Amazon) and it's a bust. That's why, even if I'm not intending on buying it from Amazon, I browse it to see the reputation of the product. Oftentimes, I buy a competitor's product from there. Even Walmart has it. Ebay has little to none of that - essentially buying blind. Price-matching a tiny subset of product won't fix shit.
