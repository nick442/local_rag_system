Bull! We built in the flood plains, because that is where the fresh water was. Then came levee building and that actually made floods worse, just not where the levees where the highest. If we are to eliminate the NFIP then we must also eliminate flood controls. That way no one city or state can alleviate their risk of flood by making the risk of flooding worse downstream from them. This means we tear down all dams, levees, and locks. Anything that affects the flow of water must go.
