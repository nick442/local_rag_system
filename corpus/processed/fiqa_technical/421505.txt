Walmart is evolving their online because they have to, not because it's profitable. They are still trying to figure out a way to get you in the store because impulse purchases lead profits. Amazon has an incredibly long way to go before they are actually a threat to Walmart. Look at the profit numbers, Amazons profit is primarily AWS. Retail profit is driven by 3rd party. If Walmart wants to crush Amazon retail, they can, but won't until it's absolutely neccessary. Walmart can already deliver goods in 30 minutes to 90% of the US, but right now it's more profitable to try and do everything possible to get you in store. If they open their logistics to 3rd party and clone FBA then that will be huge.
