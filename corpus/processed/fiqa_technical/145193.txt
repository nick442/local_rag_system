This is not about finding IT staff, this is about finding STEM talent (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). These are not easy jobs to fill, trying to convince someone with 10+ years experience to move across the country? Not that easy. Even if you can get a college graduate and train him up, in todays workforce he's unlikely to stick around for 10 years and you need to get experienced staff in the meantime from somewhere - foreign workers are the only sensible solution. The stupid solution is to offer the US citizen with 10 years experience twice what he's worth to get him to move - this won't last long term, tech companies are all competing for the same talent so if salaries go up, all US employees will jump ship for higher salaries, H-1B salaries go up soon after to stay at 'market rates', other areas of the US raise salaries so they don't lose their employees - in the end the problem hasn't gone away and you've just driven inflation up like crazy and increased the inequality between areas of the US.
