">Besides, if banks are so evil, why would I ever do any business with them? Are you not familiar with the phrase ""a necessary evil""? You must understand that the major difference between borrowing from an individual and borrowing from a financial institution is that the latter factors the risk of default into its business model. The bank expects a certain percentage of its borrowers to default and manages its risk accordingly, which is why there are such things as credit scores and variable APRs in the first place. Your bank doesn't ""trust"" you any further than it could throw you."
