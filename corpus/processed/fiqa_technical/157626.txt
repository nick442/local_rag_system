"What do you think Keynes recommended? He's got a bad rap in the US, I think unfairly. Also, you seem to be implying that Keynes was part of the Chicago School, which given the fact that the Chicago School has a history of rejecting Keynesianism and that it postdates Keynes' death seems a little unfair. Here's a quote from Keynes that often surprises Keynes-haters: > By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some.. > >Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become ""profiteers,"" who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery. > > *The Economic Consequences of the Peace*"
