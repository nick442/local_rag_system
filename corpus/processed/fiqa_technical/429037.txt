What about changing the income tax to a national sales tax and putting different products and services on a tiered system. Basic necessities would be taxed at a lower rate (if at all), then you work up the tiers towards purely luxury items that are taxed at a much higher rate? That would give us the benefits of a sales tax while, at the same time, not placing an extra burden on the lower class (who would, presumably, need to spend a higher portion of their income on basic necessities).
