On payWave transactions, the $100 limit applies per transaction, and your daily withdrawal limit doesn't usually apply - it's only for SAV/CHQ transactions and ATM withdrawals, and payWave transactions are counted as Credit transactions. So really, anything in your account is up for grabs. There are a couple of options as I see it. You should see if there's a option to get an old-style Maestro/Cirrus card, with no Visa/MasterCard scheme link. You might need to push for it, but you can probably do it. Failing that, you could see if you can open a linked savings account with no card access, and put most of your money in there, and transfer what you need into your transaction account.
