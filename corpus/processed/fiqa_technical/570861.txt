I can see your point. There are more investors than investment banks, so the power of each investment bank is substantially more than each individual investor. It would take a lot of coordinated effort on the part of investors to alter the balance of power. And to an extent, a new or existing and improved ratings agency would be a proxy war between investors and investment banks, even though the direct competition would be with other ratings agencies. At the same time, ratings agencies as an industry have never had less credibility, nor have the investment banks for that matter. I have to believe there is a realistic way to exploit that reality.
