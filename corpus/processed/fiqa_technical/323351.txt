">It can be argued that retarding the economy was a major goal of the Fed in the first place. To prevent the unrestrained runs that 1913-1929 saw which resulted in thousands of investors losing everything. The Fed was the underlying *cause* of the 1913-29 era. The ""Panic of 1907"" was really just a ""rich man's panic"" -- few people in the general population were invested in the stock market at that time -- and few businesses were listed either (the vast majority were privately owned, operated on a cash {i.e. not ""leveraged debt""} basis, and were substantially unaffected). The whole point of the Fed was to save the ""rich men's arses"" from their own screwups -- to ""socialize"" their losses. Which is exactly (and only) what it is doing. About the general welfare of the overall population.. they couldn't give a rat's tail (other than some minimal concern over whether and how they will be able to milk & bilk the population again)."
