I watch so little tv any more. The commercials are ruining it. You try to watch a great movie and every 8 minutes you have to watch 5 minutes of commercials. How can anyone enjoy a movie like this? I instantly close all pop up commercials on the internet. 90% of all commercials have no relevance to me so I have no use for them. Most of them are nothing but half-truths and lies anyway. But in reality, tv has nothing but garbage on it anyway and if it were not for sports I probably wouldn't watch it all.
