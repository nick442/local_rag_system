The working class and the rapidly disappearing middle class need to form an army and go to war against the rich. I'm going to visit Gettysburg soon where I will study how to conduct a civil war. Just today I learned that there are groups forming to fight this war. It really needs to happen. Last week over 51 people overdosed in my city from opiates out of sheer economic despair. All the programs intended to help these people will be defunded.
