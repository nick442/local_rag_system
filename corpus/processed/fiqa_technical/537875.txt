I bet it isn't too bad and if the numbers are large enough I could be better. I've been in too many rentals where the steering wheel at my desired angle obscured the speed and I had to do this weird scrunch and turn to see my speed. Have a Tesla S and can tell you I always glance over to see the song artist and map instead of the copy in front of me. I prefer it, but curious how it measures in distracted driving for a glance. If they get to full auto drive it will be much better where it is.
