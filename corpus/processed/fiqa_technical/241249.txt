I used to work for large retailers doing merchandising software and have some contacts within Infor, the company doing Whole Foods' new merchandisingâ€‹ software. According to what I was told, Whole Food's doesn't track inventory at the chain, head quarter level. Infor was at some point actually building their entire offering using Whole Foods as a base. Building transfers was to be challenging as they don't have the an actual dataset to do so. They do have some very experienced people. I will say this information is about 1 - 1 1/2 year old. At any rate, if indeed Whole Foods doesn't track inventory at the corporate/chain level then I can see Amazon's delivery plan taking some time until they get their supply chain under control for e-commerce.
