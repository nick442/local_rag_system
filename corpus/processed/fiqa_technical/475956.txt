"That's bringing another social problem into ""child care."" Lower income families (or 2/3rds of American families if you look at income statistics) simply can't pay for that and thus the child takes loans, gets scholarships or works during school for that opportunity. Suddenly, $900,000 seems more ridiculous to the majority of American parents."
