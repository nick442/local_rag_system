Why are you reading them? Most undergrad books are good enough for a general understanding of a subject. Graduate books, on the other hand, can sometimes get a bit difficult to read and start to throw in measure theory and other abstract concepts, and they're more rigorous with definitions compared to the intuitive explanations of undergrad books (this can be a good or bad thing). I probably wouldn't bother unless you're looking to take graduate level classes in the subjects. With that said, Hull's book isn't too advanced and you would probably not have too much difficulty with it, so recommended. Not sure if I've read the corp fin book.
