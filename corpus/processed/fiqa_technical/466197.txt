> it is myth that companies can get a monopoly and raise prices by themselves. They require government to do it. The only thing required is that a government exist to enforce private property rights. Once that is in place, then a company with sufficient funding can buy ownership of a vital natural resource. Once this has been accomplished, then there is little that any competitor can do to break this monopoly.
