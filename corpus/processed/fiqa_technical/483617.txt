Society does not seem to have a problem with prospective college students using Alzheimer's drugs to improve college board scores, but they do have a problem with athletes using steroids and human growth hormones to improve athletic performance. If this is not the case, then why are athletes tested for performance enhancing drugs, while students taking entrance exams are not. It seems like a double standard.
