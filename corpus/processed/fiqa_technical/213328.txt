In theory - Yes. So as long as someone will accept you as a (very) mature student, you plan to never earn over 21k a year for the next 30 years (no longer wiped out at 65), you could get a loan, slightly unethically (unless you fancy doing the course). Also if you did have to start paying it back - since interest rates are currently 6.1% this means the loan is doubling potentially just under every 12 years (approx) As to the side question of is it fraud? I couldn't say. Is a student getting maximum loans but planning on being a jobless bum for the rest of their lives and never paying back loans also committing fraud? One could argue Yes, but i don't believe a lack of ambition is currently illegal.
