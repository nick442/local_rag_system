Companies with more capital like Panerai, Breitling, Hublot (who once relied nearly 100% on ETA) started making their own movements 3-6 years ago in response to this impending ETA movement kit shortage. For the smaller guys like Glycine & Oris and lower end models of TAG, a company called Sellita has jumped into the game. Their movements are designed to basically be copies of the common ETA movements so manufactures don't have to change a thing, just buy from a new (lesser quality) company. http://www.ablogtoread.com/sellita-movement-makers-a-little-bit-of-china-in-switzerland/
