The technical term of a recession is 2 successive quarters of negative GDP growth. As is the natural cycle, the curve will invert at some point in the future; maybe it's tomorrow or 5 years from now - but nobody knows for certain. One also shouldn't take any single indicator as the end all be all of indicators. For example, there are other spreads that indicate the health of credit in the global economy such as the TED spread and the LIBOR-OIS spread. If you take a peek at the TED spread (http://www.macrotrends.net/1447/ted-spread-historical-chart), it tells a much different story. The TED spread measures the health of the global banking system by tracking the rate at which banks lend to each other. A lower TED rate equals more trust and perceived creditworthiness of the borrower, which would be another bank. Lastly, you really can't rely on a single article or single indicator to come to the conclusion that the sky is falling. Even if we are on the precipice of a recession here in the US, nobody can tell predetermine the impact and depth of the recession. In my opinion, we are nearing the top of the credit cycle and should be expecting a bit of a cooling off in the near term 1-3 years. Outside of that, your guess is as good as mine.
