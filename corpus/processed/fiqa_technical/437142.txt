given that japan is just about out of savings (due to their policy of QE and stealing wealth from everyone else and giving it to zombie banks for the last 15 years, creating loses in median income, rises energy and food costs and leading to a generation of people whom a signifigant propotion of them will never be employable because there are no jobs because the economy is not growing), pretty soon there is going to come a time when the massively overburdened japanese citizenry cannot afford to buy any more govt debt. when that happens they'll have to get foreign buyers. foreign buyers will laugh at them, and japan's debt market will implode.
