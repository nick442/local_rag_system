Yes, that's what a classical intelligent conservative (a rare breed in internet chat rooms) would say, and it is, of course, true as far as it goes. This is a point where real conservatism as opposed to its internet simulacrum actually touches base with the real left as opposed to *its* internet simulacrum. Believe it or not many of the people you mention are doing *exactly* what you recommend. The fly in the ointment is that, being on the left, they don't start with a rock hard belief that there is nothing wrong with 'the system', that it is the best of all possible worlds and that all people have to do to solve the problems of a group and its individuals is to play along and put their nose to the grindstone. There are such things as social norms quite separate from laws, and even in the most benevolent utopia there have to be and *will be* these vague expressions of what one should do. So.. your advise, true as it may be, only captures part of the solution. A fuller solution goes beyond individual response and involves shifts in political power.
