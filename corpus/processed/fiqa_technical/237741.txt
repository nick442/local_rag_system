I'm no expert -- but is our immediate future different? If automation or Amazon's decimation of low wage retail jobs puts large numbers of low-education workers out of work in a relatively short time period, isn't this more severe than, say, ATMs taking bank teller jobs? This could be a sea change of retail jobs disappearing across the board rather than a single disruptive technology affecting one sector. Sure, retail products might be cheaper because humans are replaced with kiosks, but now tons of people who used to have retail jobs can't afford it anyway. Seems like we're reaching a level of tech where it's not just advancing efficiency and generating good will, but is now a serious threat to many peoples' livelihoods and generating as much fear as convenience.
