"I'm answering my own question because in some sense, I alone know the answer. After the review, HMRC decided to waive all penalties (including the initial Â£100 penalty for late filing, which I had not appealed against) because ""HMRC may not have informed me"" about the mounting penalties. I had pretty good evidence that they hadn't informed me as there was a software change and immediately after that I got an initial penalty notice followed a day or so later by the further penalty notice. But I am happy with the outcome, I wasn't going to argue any further!"
