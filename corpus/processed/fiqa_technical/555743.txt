Its a good question but the answer is not at all obvious if one considers and understands the media. The fact that the electronic media of which the 'internet' makes up less than than a single percentage has thus far allowed morons like the RIAA play with it is nothing more than a tolerance. Governmental overview as a side note is amusing in that it illustrates the degree of ignorance displayed by our policy makers. They dont seem to understand that communication is a philosophy and the port 80 web sphere is one path upon thousands. They can't control what even they think they understand.. and they understand nothing. We control the routers. We control the tables. We control the traffic. We control all the black magic that these morons don't understand and that's all of it. We can't be stopped.
