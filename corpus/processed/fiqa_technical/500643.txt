Government employees earn lots of airline miles if they travel frequently. However they are not allowed to use them for anything other than upgrades for themselves, you can't convert them into private travel vouchers for example. If a Govt employee gets bumped off a flight they can't even keep that money. Because their fares are pre-negotiated on many city pair routes it will be a certain percentage of a refundable, flexible coach ticket, like 40% cheaper. However the airline miles rack up based on the class of the ticket which means they get a LOT of miles. Most private companies let their employees keep their miles and do whatever they want with them - so most of those people decide to stay in coach and keep them for a family vacation later.
