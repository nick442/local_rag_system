Math major here. ODE is relatively useless. Analysis, Linear Alg, and programming skills are going to be more helpful if you make it into quantitative role. And no, ODE doesn't require anything but the basics in physics.. and even then that shit will be given to you on a silver platter. Kinematics at most.
