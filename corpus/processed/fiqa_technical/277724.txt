Laurel is pretty nice, and centrally located to both D.C. And Baltimore, you can be downtown in either in 30 minutes, and the MART train runs through it. This would be my choice. If you're working in Laurel you could easily live in downtown Baltimore if you prefer the more cosmopolitan life. Germantown is western Maryland. More rural, cheap, conservative. Not bad though. It's a hike to get from there to anywhere though, it's pretty remote. Temple Hills is a D.C. suburb, and may be on the expensive side, but is pretty nice.
