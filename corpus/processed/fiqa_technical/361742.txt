"Ben is 100% correct. The question is how the police and even army are managed. In Chicago, the police is useless and crime is rampant. Police, Defense (Army) and health care not ""rights"", but a service provided by your government. It's all about how it's implemented. Obamacare is a disaster, unaffordeable, and soon not available because of all the insurance companies who quite supporting it or want to quit. Trump is not against national health care system. He just want to / have to / no choice but to fix the mess created by Obama. Let's wait and see what his fixes are all about."
