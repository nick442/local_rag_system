That is really in contravention to 50 years of conservative/Republican orthodoxy - that local control is better at understanding the needs of local citizens. It's also not so easy to pick up and move to a lower tax state - family, friends, culture, public ed system and opportunities for advancement are the better where we are. The truth is that as a rate payer in the top 10%, my household's tax increase will be used to subsidize the top 1%. If we move anywhere, it will be ex-pat. The opportunities are there for us . and tbh we have seriously talked about it.
