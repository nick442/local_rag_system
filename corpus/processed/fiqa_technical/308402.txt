Now, technically she is supposed to pay rent, but legally I am not sure. Her name is not there in the rental agreement so she is not eligible to pay the rent. Since, she is already living in the same house, there is some basic courtesy to pay the $200. Now thing here is how are we going to divide it? If she is paying $200, will that be deducted out of your room mate's or yours. Fact of the matter is, who is taking more space and who is paying for it, since there is no change to your space, you should continue paying the same amount, because there is no change in your space as you mentioned before. Moreover the fact that she is paying the utilities is good enough because that is shared by all 3. So keep the arrangement like somewhat like this, you pay half the rent + utilities, and your friend and his girlfriend will pay their share of the rent which is equal to yours, and they will share the utilities too. Hope this makes sense. Thanks, Thenicejerk
