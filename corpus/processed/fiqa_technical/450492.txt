"well, yes, your original comment was a general statement that ""paying taxes is a civic duty and patriotic"". General statements get general responses. So yeah, saying that taxes are a civic duty or are patriotic is meaningless, borderline tautology. I'm not sure how much deeper you want to go, because you didn't make a very deep comment. and it doesn't matter how much taxes you or I pay, or who pays more."
