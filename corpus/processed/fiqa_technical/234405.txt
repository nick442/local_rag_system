It would depend how the simulation is run. Is all of your revenue coming through A/R? Is none of it being paid until the end of the credit term? Are they simulating disruptions in revenue streams? If it's simulating daily then cash flows can be all over the place depending on who pays when. In a real business if you set credit terms of net 30 you will find some people pay you the day after you send them the invoice, some pay on a certain day of the month, some wait until day 30, some wait until you call them, and a few don't pay at all. They tend to simplify this in the classroom to longer intervals (months) and just have everyone pay you timely minus some allowance for bad debt. If that's the case, then whatever interval they have you on I would just assume you get paid ~95% of the A/R due over that term.
