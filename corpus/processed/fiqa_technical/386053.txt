I work in marketing - there's always spillover. We love hypertargeting people but it's still effective to target a broad audience so overall awareness of your brand is higher than your competitors. Seems like a waste to serve a 20 year old a Rocket Mortage ad. But 20 year olds become 30 year olds eventually.
