I could definitely see a future where Amazon runs home automation. Especially when you consider 24/7 access to their store and streaming platforms. That said, I imagine Google will probably repeat history and pivot to business applications. Google Assistant, partnered with Google Maps, could do very well with the autonomous car market. A distributor could handle entire fleets from his phone.
