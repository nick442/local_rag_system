Probably not, but they would have to remove old stock from the state after the one year grace period and they may have to entertain suits against them, which would probably end in settlements. In 2016 alone there was over 30 million [paid out in settlements.](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/prop65/2016-summary-settlements.pdf?) I have read there is somewhat of a cottage industry for those who seek out prop 65 violations just for the purpose of suing the manufacturer. Then there is the cost associated with the maintenance of complying with the ever changing regulations. I'm sure there is more to it but I can see where a company would not want to label there products as cancer causing if it was not necessary. People might also be more hesitant to purchase a product for there household if it's labeled as cancer causing. Additionally, the US has its own hazard communication standards that require manufacturers to label any IARC know carcinogens as such. Edit: Plus Monsanto probably thinks it can do what it wants
