"> I think you would need to know the man pretty well before you could make that judgement. I think his record speaks for itself. >A lot of people that knew him better than you do seem to have reached a different conclusion. And a lot of them are similar bullshitters -- they wash each others backs basically. >That's someone else describing him No, that's the description from [the front webpage of his own ""hire me as a *'technology visionary'* speaker"" operation.](http://www.sculleyspeaks.com/) >Honestly, the first part (I'm trying to imagine how he could be the quintessential of any kind of entrepreneur) is more off than the last part (which you could even imagine applying to a historian/anthropologist who had studied innovation in business & tech). The whole thing is demonstrative of the kind of bullshitter that he is.. and yeah it's all ""crap"" that has nothing to do with reality. The guy was good at marketing soda-water (or at least at taking the credit for a successful marketing campaign for soda-water, I rather highly doubt he was really responsible for any of the actual creative or critical decisions.. he just got the credit for them)."
