but we were in middle of bashing them.. you cant come in here and say they were just cleaning up house. Dont you know the ratings agencies in concert with all of american's poor encourages them to buy too much house via the CRA, that forced banks to rate mortgage backed securities as triple AAA. Sorry for that rant but a lot of the same people in here bitching about the rating industry will claim the markets didnt have anything to do with the recession it was all the government and the poor.
