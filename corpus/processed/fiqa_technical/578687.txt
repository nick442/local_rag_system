Part of the FB IPO hype was that institutions (smart money) got first dibs on the IPO shares while retail (dumb money) gets the leftover scraps. Everybody and their grandma was therefore scrambling to grab the few remaining precious shares before the price skyrockets. Of course that's not how it turned out as it seems retail stayed put and institutions had trouble unloading their shares.
