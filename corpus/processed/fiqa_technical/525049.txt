"Thanks for the reply man. Yeah it literally says ""closed"" next to the accou t name. But we finally got ahold of someone, I guess they close your account whenever you have $0 in it and the account should open again 1-2 business days after the direct deposit tries to go into her account. At least that's what the lady said. She hates this bank but we live in a small town and there's just not many options in terms of banking here. Thanks for the help though man I appreciate it!"
