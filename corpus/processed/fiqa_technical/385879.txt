Look up the pure-play beta method. (It also can be called project beta. On mobile or else I would link.) Essentially, you find a public company that business is the same (or as similar as possible) to the sub-unit business. You take this company's beta, unlever it from their capital structure, and relever it to the capital structure of the whole multinational company. This new beta can be considered the beta of the sub-unit.
