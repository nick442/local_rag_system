I'll play devils advocate even though i agree that they are overvalued. EPS is expected to go from .43 in 2016 to $1.20 2017 followed by $1.90 in 2018, this means they are expected to grow at 110% a year over the next two years, an many experts think they will continue to grow at 30-40% a year after that. Now many people don't think a stock is expensive until it hits a PE of 2x its growth rate, if we use a growth rate of 110% then they won pay more than 220x earnings. assuming they are using this years earnings estimates since the year is already more than half over that puts a valuation of $264 per share. If they use a 4 year estimates that EPS will grow at 72% a year the valuation is $172.8. Before people berate me i don't value stocks in this manner i use DCF, but alot of people who are looking for an easy way out will look at it this way.
