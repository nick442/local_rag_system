>Your analogy breaks down by attempting to draw a parallel between the behaviour of a child and that of a corporation. Your objections are irrelevant. The point is that the person requesting a thing is self-serving. The person in charge of allowing the request is supposed to be the responsible party as it is assumed that the person asking is self-serving. >Asking and paying for are two different things in my mind. Paying is bribery. Are you suggesting that the legislators & regulators are being bribed? >I don't recall absolving legislators from responsibility. They're just as dirty and corrupt. And yet ***THEY*** have the power to change a regulation or tax law, not the lobbyists, so ***THEY*** are the ones responsible for the problem, not the lobbyists or corporations.
