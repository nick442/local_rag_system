I love you guys, you’re the most honest and hard working taxi drivers I’ve ever met. People come to Siem reap two ways, by air and via the boarder from Thailand. When I was there the busses would drop you off at Poipet and you would have to hire a car to take you the rest of the way. Now the busses go direct. People via land don’t plan out much. I would have said years ago to get a contact in Poipet to hand out flyers. Now it’s different. I would work out deals with bus drivers and hotels. Another idea would be to find maybe four other drivers and start a company. I would advertise this company on trip advisor, and the other travel sites. You will have better luck as a conglomerate of people rather than one guy. The key is to get the client before anyone else snatches them up. To keep the client you should learn as much about Angkor Wat as you can and double as a tour guide. My driver just went to sleep after he dropped us off. Know the best restaurants, don’t take them to places that give you kickbacks, really look out for the client. You need to be more than just a driver. You are their tour guide. Make them feel safe and give them your knowledge.
