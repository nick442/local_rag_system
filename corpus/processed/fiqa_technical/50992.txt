"This is a clever add for Sourcify, but I like the thinking behind it. While it may not ever lead to a solid business, I find meme chasing to be fun and would consider it to be more of a hobby than a career. Like when everyone was making ""left shark"" costumes after Katy Perry's superbowl performance. Just like with this, you make a few bucks, then you get a legal threat. Is there a community of merchandise meme chasers? If so, I would like to join."
