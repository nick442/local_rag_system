"Nope, it's just relevant to point out that no additional credentials are required when some dipshit claims that the requirements for a job are somehow much higher than they actually are. My brother got a job at Boeing 2 or 3 years after leaving high school. He never attended college, he had no additional certs (welding, machinist, etc). Same goes for all the other people I know that are working at Boeing, except they have varying levels of college education (with the commonality that none of them actually have even a 2 year degree completed). You are just completely full of shit. But hey, don't take it from me. Take it from the requirements section of their job postings: http://jobs-boeing.com/st-louis/entry-level/jobid5850922-maintenance-mechanic-jobs I would love to know what possesses a person who clearly does not have the knowledge required for a conversation on a specific topic to enter it so passionately and to make such fraudulent claims. I mean, did you not do the 2 minutes of research necessary? Whatever the case, it sure makes statements like this more hilarious: >You know what the problem is with guys that ""started using a headhunter immediately after junior year ended"" is? They think they know about things they have no idea about."
