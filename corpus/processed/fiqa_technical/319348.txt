The economy would be a lot better if more people had money in their pockets to spend. The only ones with money are the GREEDY CEO and managers. The Rich list this year , the top 100 th wealth grew by Â£380,000,000,000 .. I wonder how much better the economy would be better off with some of that money in the workers pockets ? The only people with a Money Tree are Theresa May, and the rich list. http://i.imgur.com/BGapG2z.jpg
