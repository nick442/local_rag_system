"I feel like the idea ""vote with your dollars"" has been around for a long time now but very few people have enacted it seriously. Just think how much shit businesses get away with because they have little to no actual worry of anybody taking their business elsewhere. A serious large amount of people would have to actually do so to make an impact, but they don't. Meanwhile we know what happens when people actually do stop buying from businesses, e.g the disappearance of brick and mortar music stores since the advent of digital. So what's the difference? Obviously it is convenience. When it was convenient for people to get their music digitally they stopped buying cds. But it is apparently too inconvenient to adjust you buying for political reasons. Which is of course shortsighted when you take the long term consequences into account as inconveniences (and in many cases these consequences are far worse than a mere inconvenience)"
