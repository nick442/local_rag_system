There actually wouldn't be a need to increase prices in order to provide Wal-mart employees with a living wage though. There is another way. Cut executive pay. In fact, I'd like to see a law on the books that makes maximum executive pay, including bonuses and stock, a certain percentage or multiple of the pay of the lowest paid employee. Before you can raise the pay of an executive beyond a certain point, the pay of all the employees simply has to go up. This would give executives another incentive to raise the pay of their employees, since their ability to get a raise would depend on it. I'm thinking something along the lines of executive pay being capped at 100x the pay of the lowest paid employee. Your employees make $20,000 a year? Your executives make no more than $2,000,000 a year. Want that to go up? Guess it's time for raises then. The main point of such a law would be to make sure that employees are paid for the benefits they bring in to the company, along with having a living wage. As it stands, employees might get a 25 cent/hour raise a year in low wage jobs, if they get anything at all. This way, if there's enough money to go around to the people at the top, the people at the bottom also see some of that money.
