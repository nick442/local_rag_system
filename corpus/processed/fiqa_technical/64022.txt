I agree, but if that's *all* a person wants to discuss out of that story thats missing the forest for the trees. Also for the record, the $800 billion in 2007-2008 vs the larger muni bond market isn't actually a lie. You simply had a problem that it referred to more than just the 2007-2008 time frame. That's all. And either way it isn't material to the larger story here which was the fraud. Nobody got 'caught lying'.
