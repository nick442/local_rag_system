The end point of autonomous cars is not to own one at all. Why would you have a $35,000 hunk of metal sitting in a car park 90% of the day, when you could just subscribe to an automated car service? Even cheaper than that, an automated minibus service that auto-generates routes based on demand? The only reason we don't do it already is because of the relatively high price of an Uber with a human driver, and the lack of privacy from having a human driver in there with you.
