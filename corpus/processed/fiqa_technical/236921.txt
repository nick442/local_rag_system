Investigative journalism is another form of entertainment. Yes, it also happens to provide a service to the public. I have a budget and a family and I have to pick between different sources of entertainment. I *want* to give WaPo money for service, but I can't justify it at their current price. We don't go out to eat, we don't buy cable TV, and we don't go to the movies, so it's not like I can just give up a Big Mac to pay WaPo. At their current price point, they simply don't provide enough entertainment for me to give up a different source of entertainment to replace it with WaPo. I am a relatively poor person who wants to stay informed and contribute to supporting investigative journalism, but they've price themselves out of my reach.
