For insurance pricing, it seems as though it doesn't matter all that much which group it is in if they are adjusting it based on just the Tesla data. I imagine Tesla is more concerned about the perception. They want to market the car as a safer vehicle to drive. So if AAA came out and said the increase was due to repair costs, I doubt you'd hear anything from Tesla. But AAA said that it is also due to accident frequency, which goes against Tesla's marketing strategy.
