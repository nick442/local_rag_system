"To be at a dinner next to a ""big shot at a giant Wall Street investment bank"" to me makes me think they weren't at Applebee's. This guy went to Princeton. This may be a huge generalization but that sounds like a privileged life. Luck would be Eddie Murphy begging on the street when 2 old farts make him a partner in the company. That's lucky as hell. This dude is ivy league and thus run in the circles of success plus he also delivers the goods as a writer. It turns out he's successful. To me it's not really *that* lucky it's more about the cultivation of opportunities and focus."
