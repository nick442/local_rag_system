No idea how he gets Zimbabwe as a reference point. But America certainly would look very different without Anglo-Saxon / European founding. Anyone know a country or foreign land that was colonized by a predominantly African indigenous people? EDIT: I've no idea how the guy gets Zimbabwe. It's in the SE of Africa and all the ports for slave trade were on the far West horn. I guess a lot of the slaves came from the interior of Africa, but to pick off Zimbabwe as a reference instead of Nigeria, Senegal.. seems really crazy. Also apparently Brazil got 5 million slaves while North America got 500k slaves. I guess that would be a reference point from an economic standpoint, maybe. Impossible to say really because US has such different resources. Certainly the anglo-saxon rule of law was probably beneficial to America's founding. The whole issue seems to be speculative nonsense. I'm kind of mad at myself for wasting more than 5 minutes thinking about this. I just wondered where the hell Zimbabwe came about in all of this.. what is this guy think..
