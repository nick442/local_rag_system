"It's funny how you say they will resort to laws to stop consumers from getting what they want when in reality the so called ""upstarts"" are the ones on very thin ice with breaking the law. If you define Netflix as an upstart then I can already see that we don't agree on the same premise and hence further argument is pointless. And for the record, Seinfield was only possible with TV and all the talented people in production. Do you really think Youtube or Netflix will be able to produce a quality show? I think not. Like I pointed out, everyone is giving too much credit to Netflix because it's easy to stream a show after the risk has already been taken to spend the time and money to produce a show. This is why these ""upstarts"" operate on a profitable margin, they are eating TV/Cable's lunch. I am all for TV, I believe that TV will still be around 50 years from now. The internet and tech is very volatile and you never know where it will stand 5.. even 10 years from now. In the end, people do not want to watch cheap low-quality comedy on their iPhones. 60 inch LCD home theaters are here to stay in peoples homes. Maybe it will be streamed via the internet but TV will very much still pull a lot of weight. Afterall, TV built the industry, they deserve to own it. I don't see the logic and destroying TV to benefit companies like Apple or Netflix who really have no idea how to even begin preproduction on a quality show. This boils down to the fact that people will always consume the cheapest form of entertainment, and while this is true. Americans are sophisticated enough to distinguish cheap from quality. TV delivers quality and will continue to deliver quality, while the internet delivers a few occasional guffaws packaged in mediocrity."
