">Paul calls it unanimous. The government site does not. What does a unanimous voice vote even mean? [1] Here is the govt site where the votes are viewable. Note at the bottom that the postal bills have the statement ""Outcome: Favorably reported to the House of Representatives by unanimous consent"". Note that bill 459 does not state that. Watch the video and you'll see that Ron Paul has a little bit of trouble with reality. That site reports unanimous consent because it's an entirely different procedure from a voice vote. You should read Roberts Rules of Order so you don't look so stupid. Keep trying though.. because we know your hatred of Ron Paul won't stop you from spewing lies. For the rest of you.. if you want to see how much trouble crotchpoozie has with reality then [go to the link that he provided](http://oversight.house.gov/markup/full-committee-business-meeting-30/) and watch the video at 0:35:41 when the actual vote takes place and you'll see that it was indeed an unanimous voice vote."
