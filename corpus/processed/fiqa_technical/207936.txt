I think she misses a little bit in that thee definitely needs to be some middle ground. In due respect she did come from an undergrad at Wharton with a background in banking. By the time she entered the MBA she was well averse in the financial and accounting theory. This knowledge can be very useful to those; however, who chose to pursue the topics she discusses (like design, comp sci, engineering, etc.) as undergrads and are now seeking the business acumen necessary to run organizations. Further, I would like posits, based on her background, that she likely followed a pretty cookie cutter lifestyle throughout most of her career (excelled academically, followed the path academia laid out, etc.). Like any other experience, an MBA is what you chose to get out of it. If she believed she would further develop accounting and finance skills having already been a Wharton undergrad and banker, then the fault lies with her. Yes, the pursuit of ideas is extraordinarily valuable to MBA's (and arguably they should focus on it more). However, you are an adult by that point, and you should have the maturity and acumen to chose and understand what you want to get out of your degree, even if that means sacrificing grades..
