Wrote both exams over the summer. Make sure you do practice questions online. Also, I found that the breakdown of topics they have on their website is very accurate, so keep that in mind when studying. If you are in any business/econ/finance program, it will not be a difficult exam (especially exam 1). Oh, one last thing. They don't have too many questions where calculations are required. So don't worry about all the formulas, just understand the theoretical stuff.
