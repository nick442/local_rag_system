Trump voters aren’t the bottom 60%..he won every single income bracket $50k and up. If politicians had not been so hard at work importing another uneducated, unintegrated serf class into the country since the early 90s, this bottom 60% scenario might be more solvable. It’s easier to sustain a nation where only 30% of the citizens are peasants compared to 60%. (A dilemma that’s twice the size.)
