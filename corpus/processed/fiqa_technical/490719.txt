OMG. A recession is coming. Wait..hasn't that been a true statement since forever? No shit a recession is coming. That's like saying a thunderstorm is coming. This is a natural part of economics. Recessions are a necessary part of growth, almost like growing pains. Now the real question is 'when will the recession happen.' However nobody truly knows that, so it's better to spend your efforts making sure you're prepared for when a recession occurs as opposed to worrying about when that will happen.
