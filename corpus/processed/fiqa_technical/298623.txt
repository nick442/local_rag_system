40% of income going to debt payments being their line is reasonable I guess, BUT maybe it should be higher for educated high earners. For example, currently I'm technically using about 50% of my monthly income because I'm a new graduate with some student debt and I'm trying to pay it off aggressively, in under a year. Despite this, my income is high enough that the remaining 50% is enough to support a decent lifestyle. In a couple of months when I'm paid off I can probably start saving several thousand dollars a month. Do I really have a debt problem?
