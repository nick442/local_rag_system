"I'd argue that a significant amount of young people, even the majority, are fiscally conservative...however they align with Democrats because they don't want to associate themselves with the social bigotry and intolerance of the GOP (and Tea Party). If only we could have a fiscally conservative party that just let people do what they wanted to do with their personal lives...well, we do, but obviously libertarians aren't ""electable"" EDIT: I'm amazed that the fed spends 7 times more on people over 65 than children. Wow."
