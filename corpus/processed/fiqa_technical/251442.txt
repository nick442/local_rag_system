You've already got a well thought analysis of the problem done, that's a good start. How much can you dumb down the explanation of why your product is better? I mean, I don't even know what you're selling, but your description of the product made me believe you so I'd argue you're convincing enough, maybe all you need is to exemplify to your costumers and bring them down to earth examples of why your product will help them on a daily basis. Dumb down stuff as much as you want. Maybe be passionate about your product as you're being now. We buy stuff based more on emotion than reason most of the time anyway..
