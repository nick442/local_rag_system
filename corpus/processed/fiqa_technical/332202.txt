> Just curious, if your already at a BB how come you decided to go back for the MS and not an MBA? No interest in management. Far more interested in moving from market maker to a top 5 or top 10 HF trading/portfolio mgmt role. Finishing up my CFA now so a MS is a bit of a last resort (basically, if I can't get in via networking and a CFA charterholder then I'll pursue a MS)
