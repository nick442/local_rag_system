I disagree with you. Yes, employees should be helpful and eager to serve. Customers should not come in rude or disrespectful, or try to bully low-level associates to try to get their way. This is a reminder to the customer to not be an ass. The customer is always right, but not really, and employees should have the right to refuse service if they are feeling harassed and threatened.
