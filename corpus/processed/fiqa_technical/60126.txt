"Obama is a piece of shit, who is nothing more than a puppet. You will get no arguement from me on that. What piece of shit would you like to see in his place? These horrid anti-competition agreements are not possible without govenment's supporting them. You wonder why governments and corporations are so friendly with one another? Think about it. Who collects the taxes for the government? And do you think the government could get those taxes without those corporations doing the job for them? They would have to come to your house and force it out of your hands face to face. By getting your boss to do it they make him the bad guy who doesn't ""pay"" you what you feel you are worth. You ignore the fact that if he didn't steal from your cheque he would be shut down. You think the Mafia has a monopoly on extortion? What part in your own words do I have ""COMPLETELY"" backwards?"
