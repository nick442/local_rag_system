"Not at these rates. The motto used to be 3/6/3: ""Borrow at 3%, Loan out at 6%, and then be at the golf course by 3pm"". So they get 3% on the spread, minus fixed costs. Now, they borrow at near 0% and loan out at slightly above 0%. Those fixed costs starts becoming an issue. It isn't cheap to have all these ATMs, bank branches, tellers, computer systems, etc. Also, a lot of the money cannot be loaned out at all because there are not enough creditworthy borrowers. You might have recalled a few months ago, several banks started charging for deposits. They don't want more money that will just lay there while they have to pay the costs of maintaining the accounts. Some bank CEOs have stated that they would be better off if the Fed raised rates up to 1%."
