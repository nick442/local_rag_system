Lol you don't need a college degree for a lot of things has been said to you a billion times and yet you don't give a fuck and continue trying to go on the same stupid road. Nope your shitty janitor does not warrant special treatment to be middle class. It won't happen and honestly now I am starting to understand why your ex is an ex. You are too stupid to understand that there is skills in dissecting insects, and that more goes into science than stuff some shit into tubes. Yes that 100k in NYC is less than 40 k elsewhere. Neither is a middle class position. Your point? Oh wait you have no point besides people who can't be bothered to learn and use skills should be paid as much as those who do whine. Well whining about it until you are blue in the face won't change things. If you do however want some basic logic and actually decide to expand your argument beyond janitors need to be paid middle class wages because kid vomit and this other job that I am ignorant about makes it look easy, feel free to come back and have a discussion. Until then suck it up, learn a skill and stop whining.
