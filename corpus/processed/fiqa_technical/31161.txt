Spoken like a true conspiracy theorist. More realistically, the conservative audience includes a spectrum of people and viewpoints, so Fox includes a spectrum of people and viewpoints. While that spectrum all tends to fall into the conservative portion of the greater spectrum, it includes a range of people, as I said, from extremist commentators to legitimate newspeople because the conservative audience itself has that range and those demands.
