Uber should have crushed Lyft by being the first to market a long time ago. Instead they blew their lead by dumping all their money into 1. Warring with Google, which they will lose, and were always bound to lose, because nobody at Uber has ever heard of NDAs or sunk cost fallacies 2. Tolerating PR scandals until the point where customers actively sought out an alternative not because the product was bad, because Uber was in many ways a superior product, but because they saw Uber as a bad company. And it takes a lot to lose customers in that situation. What a stupid company.
