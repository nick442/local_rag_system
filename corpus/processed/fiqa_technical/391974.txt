Zurich has private banking, Singapore has commodities trading, London has EU passporting rights.. unless London becomes a major physical trading city or Zurich decides to move to London there is nothing really too feed all those banks. Germany and France have absolutely no incentive to give London passporting rights, they eagerly want Londons tax revenue. you might not have an inclination but that won't be up to you. People can and will move.
