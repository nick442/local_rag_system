Honestly I don't mind that they make money off of my resume. Where the rubber hits the road I put my resume out into the world in order for potential employers to find me. That's why I had a Monster profile and a Careerbulder oen as well. In fact, the best and most stabel jobs I have had have coem from employers reachign out to me as opposed to the other way around.
