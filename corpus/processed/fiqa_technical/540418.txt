Not an Amazon fanboy by any means, but part of their philosophy is basically that if we don't sell low, somebody else will. The low prices and service ARE the advertising, and the volume helps them push efficiencies further. There isn't anything stopping them from raising prices, but its sort of runs counter to their whole business mantra.
