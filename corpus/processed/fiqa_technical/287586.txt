This is supposed to be a comment, as this is anecdotal, but I can't post comments. Also, this information relates to the UK. I used to work in a Licensed Betting Office, or a bookies to use the informal word for it, and we had to deal with this issue all the time. The pens didn't really work all that well as the forgers found out that dipping forged notes in fabric softener nullified the effects of the pens, and some of the copies were incredibly good. Generally, we would take two or three notes per week.
