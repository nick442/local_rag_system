> I feel like Sprint charges a bit more, but they don't have a cap on their data plans, so if you do multiple GB per month they are the best choice. I left AT&T and dropped $30 a month switching to sprint, and have unlimited everything. AT&T is a ripoff in my opinion and they charge so much for the bare minimum. I'm on the West Coast.
