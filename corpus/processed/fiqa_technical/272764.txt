">> So, are you against Trump? Yes or no? > Yes, I think you would categorize me as against him but I don't think I'm against him but against the things I see him doing things that I do not think will make life better for the average American. So you are anti-Trump because what he does, and so far, when I asked for an example, the BEST you can find is this very gray topic of Medicare Part-D? And you get this Medicare ""issue"" from Vox whom you, yourself, say ""Vox does spin things left"". And Medicare Part-D issue was not dealt at all by Obama in 8 years, am I right? Ok!! Please find me something significant that Trump did that you don't like. If you can't find anything, then I ask to read about the topic of Tribalism: the sense that you must belong to one camp because everything is black or white. Look! I am even saying that Trump is not an ideal leader. I am 100% sure that he will do things I don't like. I also never liked his opinions about abortions and coal. There! You see? **But by far, Trump is much better than almost all Democrats, and even many many in the GOP. So I voted for him, first time in my life that I voted for a Republican! And I support him, not because he does everything exactly to my liking, but because he's a good president, better than all the rest, and he does a good job.**"
