It is literally what he said, and yet folks here are quick to note that it is certainly not what he meant. The 7 years aspect is not the unusual part here. The unusual aspects are: - It has been in a bubble for as long as it has existed, and will continue to be in such a state indefinitely. - It doesn't have an underlying intrinsic value. I think you'll agree that this is somewhat less commonly seen. (For clarity, I don't believe either of those statements to be true, but this is what many of the folks calling Bitcoin a bubble actually believe. See [Alan Greenspan](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20131205000421) and [Warren Buffet](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/14/buffett-blasts-bitcoin-as-mirage-stay-away.html)'s positions on the topic for example.)
