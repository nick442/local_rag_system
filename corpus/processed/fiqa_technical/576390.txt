This definitely helps me clear my head when I think about my future, I am fully aware that most lower level internships don't amount to employment (especially after Freshman year). I totally understand what you are saying, it is more so that I'd rather be learning something and working hard hours than working hard hours in retail or a restaurant. I worked in the service industry and I felt frustrated because I was surrounded by idiots (drug addicts, alcoholics, drop outs) and sometimes being surrounded by a lack of ambition can just get to you.
