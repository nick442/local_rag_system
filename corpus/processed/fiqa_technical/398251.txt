Edited because my first response was incoherent. The US and Western Europe have always had solid food and water supplies that helped them grow. The same can't be said for countries like Zimbabwe and other mineral rich countries. Diamonds and lithium and other similar commodities are only as valuable as they are because we have had the luck to grow our economy and technology to the point where we have the time/money to look into spending like that. I find it hard to believe that we would be making smartphones if we didn't have the basic resources first.
