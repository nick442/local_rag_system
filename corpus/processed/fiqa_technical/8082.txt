I am touched that you think I can start a civil war on reddit. You are a presumptuous fool and completely missed the point. I did not blame my employers for this country's oppressive monetary system. They did not design it, and they also struggle under it. Your incapacity for empathy of people who were not born lucky and have to struggle to make ends meet and live every day with financial worries is the asshole attitude of the rich fuckers of whom I speak. I am sure you enjoyed masturbating over your hallucinations about who you think I am. You must be one of privileged brats who has never applied for a job and has no idea what it takes to start or succeed in business if you think it is so easy. Or maybe you have stockholm syndrome and learned to enjoy taking it in the ass.
