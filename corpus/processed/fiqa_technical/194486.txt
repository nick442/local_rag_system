"I dunno about the economic miracle, to be honest. Count me among the skeptics. China seems like they're in the position to have the government build dozens of ""cities"" and artificially inflate economic data. If they cooked their books, no one would know the difference since I'm unaware of any reliable source or organization that would have the necessary access to their records. Edit: Instead of just downvoting, please respond with some sort of rebuttal."
