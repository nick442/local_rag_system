I cannot speak specifically to the Netherlands or the UK specifically, but my prejudice has me believing that there would be more consumer protection in those two countries than that we have here in the the US, certainly not less. Debt collectors mostly do their job by bullying. Here in the US they are mostly toothless and typically obtain payments when they invoke an emotional reaction. In your case they are attempting to invoke fear. Legal action over €400? Get real. It will cost them 20 times that to bring action, and they are equally likely to get a sympathetic judge to toss out the case. Now you very well know you should have returned the box, please don't be coy. If you still have it, you should attempt to return it. If not you should attempt to settle. Offer them €80, going no higher than €160. Get it in writing, that this satisfies the debt and use either a one time use credit card or a bank check/money order.
