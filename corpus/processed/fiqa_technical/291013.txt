I am trying to understand the mindset of these authors. They cite the research that shows top-10% companies in a given industry are much more productive than others, especially compared to the bottom 10%. OK, that's to be expected. That's why they are in the top 10%. They employees in those top-tier companies get paid more. Again, standard economics. Marginally higher productivity results in marginally higher wages. Got it. Then the concluding paragraph says: > This is the conundrum that policy makers have to solve: Productivity gaps create inequality. Public policy can and should help. But in trying to protect workers, policies might well endanger future productivity growth, and with it, workersâ€™ prospects. Well, yeah. If you subsidize firms and employees that aren't competitive then you get.. less productivity and earnings. God damn communists. How about instead you let people work it out in the marketplace. Those that can't keep up will fail and move on to other things. Yes, that temporary situation sucks for the people involved. It's Schumpeter's creative destruction in action.
