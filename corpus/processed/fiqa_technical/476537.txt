The people who share our tastes are not watching most TV channels anymore. People who have a TV and spare money are subscribed to the premium cable channels and mostly watch those shows. Young people watch TV on their computers and don't see the ads. As a result, the rest of the TV channels have to cater to the vast population of Ghost Hunters fans and Survivor addicts.
