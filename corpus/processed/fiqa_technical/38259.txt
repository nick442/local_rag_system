If Bigot Bobby's Bar refuses to serve, say Jews, NO ONE LOSES ANY NATURAL RIGHTS. No one is harmed thereby. When Bigot Bobby is FORCED to serve anyone against his will, HIS natural rights to property, privacy, and association are violated. If you don't think so, then why don't you insist on equality rules for private dinner parties or club membership? By your reasoning, churches ought to be forced to do things on direct violation of their beliefs. Oh, wait, Obama has already done that.. Yours is a digusting worldview based on force.
