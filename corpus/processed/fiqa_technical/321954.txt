Gas stations have existed for 100 years. Automobile ownership has not increased by 10% year over year since before JFK was President. EVs are growing so next summer when 1000s of Model 3s take summer road trips to Yellowstone or another popular destinations there will be dozens of gas stations able to service cars at 5 min per pump all day long. The Model 3s will overwhelm the superchargers and need 30 or more minutes per charger. Same for NFL stadiums that draw fans from 100 miles away so a game-time charge is desired. Road trips 2017 are going to be Hell on Earth and the S and X owners used to infrequent Mike inconveniences are going to freak out. Workplaces such as hospitals could install 3 chargers and handle the doctors and VPs needs. Now staff will roll up in 3s and park just like the doctors clogging up the charger all shift. Pop up some corn while the infrastructure catches up.
