Remote Deposit usually means a scanner and some software and has a monthly fee associated with it (so it only makes sense for businesses, and even then only some businesses). Chase and USAA allow you to make deposits via your iPhone which is aimed at consumers and has some deposit limits associated with it (checks have to be less than some $$). I've used both. Remote Deposit is super easy, the software usually sucks, but it's too expensive for personal users ($60/month at citibank). Chase deposits have worked on my iPhone usually after 2 or 3 tries but that did save me from walking to the bank.
