As a 19 year old if she can get SSDI instead of SSI her benefit amount will be calculated by her parents' contributions .. if either parent is deceased or over 62 then she qualifies for SSDI instead of SSI and I believe she would receive the full benefit amount. I'd guess that would be something in the $1400+ range. I see no reason why you couldn't get married either way .. at least not from a financial perspective. I'd be worried about being on the hook for her medical expenses. Therapy, meds, hospital visits, side-effects, etc .. that's a good way to spend the rest of your life owing millions.
