The success of a free market economy requires constant growth in production of goods and services. Doesn't this contradict the entire point of economics in that there are scarce resources to distribute? How can you have never ending growth in production when there are limited physical resources? Population growth is one of the major factors sustaining this continued growth but the planet can only sustain a certain amount of people, what happens when we hit that? We're already overpopulated and this only ends one way - famine and wars over resources where huge numbers of the population will die. Maybe this is just our nature, maybe this IS nature; destruction and then rebirth. Does anyone think it's possible to develop a different type of free market economy that doesn't rely on constant growth in production ?
