In my opinion, We can't trust wholy on internet as well as social media. There are a lot of hackers that can ruin all of us based on destroying all the systems. We should be careful about our private information, don't show them on your facebook if you don't want anyone can see them, even though it is only for you. It is not safe for you. Just keep in your mind or your note book.
