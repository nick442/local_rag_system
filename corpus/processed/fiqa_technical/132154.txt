Kind of gate to say it but I definitely have the persuasion and people skill part down. Spent 8 years in the therapy field in the military. Definitely interested in tips! I've been watching whatever I can on YouTube that I run across and have watched a few things on vet benefits for government contracts and different things like that but not sure I want to work too much with the government or even have that much of a chance where I'm at. Probably looking more towards construction inspection or land survey stuff. Would absolutely love to get info search and rescue work if I could and do some good if I could
