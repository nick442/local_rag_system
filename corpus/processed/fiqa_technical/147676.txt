"Huh. I don't like the idea of being ""starved"" into compliance either, but the fact is we're in a global economy. Either this opinion will have to change, or we're ""going to get hurt real bad"". I guess we can always switch back to extreme nationalism and xenophobia, and close off foreign trade. Though I think that would technically work (by forcing the US to become independent of foreign manufactures) I don't think it will happen anytime soon."
