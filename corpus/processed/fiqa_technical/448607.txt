"Just saying: I'm not a big earner, but I was able to live quite comfortably on one income with my g/f and our eldest girl. We had a reather cheap rent (house wasn't ""modern"", but central heating + warm water + clean is all one needs, right?) and we didn't have a car (so no big payments on that). I'm Belgian as well, btw. We were able to live a very good life, without having to cut back on food or drink (I used to go out once a week even!). But well, we didn't have a bigscreen TV. And no twice a year going to Spain or anywhere on holiday: we'd take the train to go to the Belgian coast or the zoo or whatever. As said: no car, but everything we needed was either in walking distance, or public transport, or bike. No car = lots of cash that would go to gas, insurance, taxes otherwise. But even with the one income (1500-1800 euro after taxes per month, depending on how many nightshifts), we lived a nice life. I smoked (still do) without moneyproblems. We saved a little each month. My little girl never lacked anything she could ever want. Not even toys, which aren't exactly a necessity.. Now that my g/f works as well, we were able to buy a nice house, and we're able to save most of what she earns. TL;DR: Living on one income is possible, you just need to sacrifice some things you don't really need. Or be lucky."
