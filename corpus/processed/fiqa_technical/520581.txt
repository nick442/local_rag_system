I was in the next town over and we weren't too familiar with the restaurants and decided to eat at BWW for maybe the second or third time in years. Frankly, the food, especially the wings, were mediocre at best. The catch is, if you're young, there are literally dozens of better places like bars to get wings. If I wanted wings and a sports bar atmosphere, I'd go to a local pub.
