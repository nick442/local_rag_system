> ..without spending more than 30% income on rent. Makes sense to me. There is a whole lot more to buy. > Check rent.com for 2BR prices in Tennessee and Arkansas. They start in the lower $500s. Well, right. Minimum wage is $7.50 which averages to 30/7x40x$7.50 = $1285 per month. $500 of $1285 is 39% of your income which has been defined as unaffordable. > (On minimum wage)..you don't owe a dime of Federal income tax. I understand the right considers paying no income tax as unfair but it is that way to try to correct unfair wages. Support policies that get a minimum wage household to a modest lifestyle that includes education, shelter, health care, recreation, and retirement and I will support taxing their income.
