Really it's two categories: target kids and non-targets. Targets (Harvard, Princeton, etc. depending on the bank) comprise the majority of the front office and have a simpler recruiting process. Non-targets (good regional schools and some flagship state schools) fill out the rest of the front office and have a much more difficult process to stand a chance. Networking is key unless you're a target.
