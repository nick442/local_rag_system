The universal and common regulation of thumb for windsocks is as follows â€“ sloping in the direction of the wind: 3 knots, half way extended: 7.5 knots and completely unmitigated: 15 knots or more. It is designed in bright and in colorful patterns. These are not predominantly efficient and more often than not for adornment, on the other hand they can be executed as a fundamental funnel to wind direction and speed.
