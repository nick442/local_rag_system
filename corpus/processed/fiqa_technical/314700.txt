That's what I was thinking right near the end. I didn't want him to essentially sell his business for $150,000, when he could easily walk away from there with $0 and get his investment from an outside source. I still think it's risky to accept the royalties in exchange for full equity, but I'm glad he didn't give up any more than 30%!
