Interesting thought but I don't think it's going to play out like that. In city centers, you'll see a lot of automated cars, even mostly automated cars. But the suburbs and rural areas are still going to have plenty of gasoline vehicles with drivers for at least a few decades. There's too many interests propping up oil for them to just give up. EVs are and will continue to be more efficient but there's still capital costs involved. An old machine that's paid for will usually generate more profit than a financed new machine that's efficient.
