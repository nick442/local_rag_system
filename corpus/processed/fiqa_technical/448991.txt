The real folly is in believing that somehow 'regulators' are going to be able to prevent crashes, or even if this is desirable. Usually the idea that regulators can prevent crashes relies on regulators being issued a retroactive time machine. Crashes. Happen. If regulators had more power and more authority prior to 2008, the housing market crash would have been worse and more severe than it actually was, because regulators were like everyone else - they believed house prices would never go down, and were focussing their efforts on regulating banks to lend *more* money to *riskier* borrowers.
