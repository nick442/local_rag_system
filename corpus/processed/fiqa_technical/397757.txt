"I actually think it's you who are missing a grasp of economics. Don't confuse investments in existing companies with investments that actually boost the economy. If I drop $100,000 into Microsoft stock, and someone else sells it, I am just putting money into their pocket. It doesn't boost the economy. If we all dump our money into the stock market it just increases the prices and ""value"" of the stocks. The only real investors (as in contributing directly to economic growth and productivity) are angel investors, entrepreneurs, and people who invest in IPOs."
