What's the future value of money given: M = initial investment R = additional monthly investment P = interest rate earned per month t = number of months This is the result of 2 formulas. 1. How much is the initial investment worth at the end + 2. How much are the additional contributions worth at the end. FutureValue[M] = M * (1+P)^t FutureValue[R] = annuity calculation = R*((1+P)^t-1)/P) So the future value of your initial investment with regular additions, all earning the same return monthly at the end of t months will be: M * (1+P)^t + R*((1+P)^t-1)/P)
