If you sell counterfeit goods by claiming that they are real, you're no better than people that just straight up steal money without the pretense of 'business' If you sell counterfeit goods and acknowledge that they are counterfeit, you're in ethically better territory.. but you're still taking an enormous legal risk that can't possibly be worth your middling profits.
