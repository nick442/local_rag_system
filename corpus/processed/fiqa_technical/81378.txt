"I never put race into it, but ok.. I hear lots of interesting stories about teaching. The most recent involves an experimental program where the teacher performance isn't graded on student outcomes but how well they're following the narrative defined by the program. Every few years teachers are handed new programs that the district curriculum people bought and told ""you're going to teach $subject using this program now!"" (sometimes those programs work better for different groups of students - the ones that it was evaluated with do great, the ones in different neighborhoods are failed by the program) The programs are implemented district wide and the teachers are told not to deviate from the programs. Sometimes you get a superintendent into a district who decides that ""no child left behind"" means ""no child can be held back"" and so you get children hitting second or third grade without being able to identify the letters in the alphabet, let alone read.
