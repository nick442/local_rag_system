Wow, your experience is definitely not unique. A close friend of 8 years complained about his medium sized company struggling to gain market share. The company I worked for at that time had a product that could dovetail with his product with some effort. I told him about this idea, and the ball was set rolling. I had set up a small company to act as supplier of the integration service between these two companies, with all effort on my side being done at own cost, and the continuous integration cost being carried by my company. The friend found a way to steal most of my source code, and got a developer to complete the integration system, while cancelling the contract with me on ungrounded accusations. I realised that warnings from other friends about this guy's integrity proved accurate, and I decided to cut all ties since no money had been made. If this had happened after I had quit my full-time job as was the plan and started depending on this business for income my family would have lost everything we had. OP has the core truth of it: > you may feel that your company is different from all of those other companies that have problems or interpersonal differences. Don't assume that. Trust your partners, have high standards for your performance and the performance of each individual in the group, but pay attention to protecting yourself along the way. Verbal agreements or goodwill may mean something to you but don't count on everybody else holding themselves to that standard.
