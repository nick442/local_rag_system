you are exactly right. people keep going on about how facebook and their ipo is a failure etc, they are totally wrong. all of this was done for one reason only - the insiders who had all these crazy valuations and forecasts etc on paper that were not actually worth anything IRL, could cash out and get some money off the back of fools. the fb ipo was a huge success for mark zuckerburg and others - not so much a success in the real world though. sadly, this whole model and 'social networking' bubble should have 'popped' long before it got to this stage, myspace should have signaled that.
