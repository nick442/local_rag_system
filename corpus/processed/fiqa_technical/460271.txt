"To explain why you have to be 18: If you are not 18, then any contract that you sign can be voided (made invalid) by either you or your parents. So it would be completely legal for you to go to the bank, ask for a $1000 loan, and for the bank to give you the loan. But then you could spend the money, and tell the bank ""sorry, I changed my mind, I don't want that loan, and sorry again, but the money is gone"". At that point, there would be nothing the bank could do to get their money back. Obviously, banks don't like this, so they won't lend you money."
