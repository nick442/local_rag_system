In the united states qualified institutions of higher education should give the student a 1098-t. This form breaks down all money received/billed and for tuition and scholarships. It would not include items such as books and room and board. The 1098 would constitute proof of attendance and proof of expenses. If a 529 plan was used to pay for part or all of the tuition it should also be sent to you or the student depending on where the funds were sent. If the student can't find the 1098-t it is likely that the college had an electronic copy sent to the students official email, or it can be downloaded from the student's account where tuition bills care paid. Note: a confusing part of the 1098-T is that many universities include the spring semester numbers in the form for the previous year. For Example: The 1098-T will tell you if they have done that.
