LOL!! So again, it's Trump and only Trump's fault. Are you serious? The ACA did not have serious issues in November before Trump was elected? Even Bernie Sanders does not like the ACA. Anyway, back to Trump: he's clearly for a National Health Care system. Am I right? Yes or no? And he clearly wants to fix ObamaCare, am I right? Yes or no? And he clearly could not and did not do anything about the ObamaCare because of traitors withing the Republican parties, am I right? Yes or no?
