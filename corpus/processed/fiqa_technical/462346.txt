"Private Selection isn't even Kroger's ""brand that has the cheap price."" They are a midrange product, costing only slightly less than mainstream national brands while being of comparable or even better quality. Kroger even offers multiple store brands in some product categories.. for example, in pasta sauces you will see (in increasing order of cost) Kroger brand, Private Selection, and Simple Truth Organic. N.B. the Private Selection marinara is really good!"
