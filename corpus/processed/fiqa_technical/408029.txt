"While JoeTaxpayer gave a very insightful answer, and clearly the best answer, let me break it down really simple for you. Talk with a good to great property management company. Given that you will be out of state, you will need one anyway. A good one is worth their cost, a great one even better. They will tell you what the ""market will bear"" on renting your place and the expected costs. From there you can make an intelligent decision. Have you had any experience in running rental properties? I am going to assume not, and as such you should have professionals as part of your team. More than likely you will have to put money in to sustain this property as a rental. It is just how the numbers tend to work out."
