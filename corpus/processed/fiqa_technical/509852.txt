DRM is not to blame. The publishers should have come together and built their own store (with or without DRM). Hulu is a good example of content creators/publishers working together to publish their content online. I admit that the only shows I download now are House (since it is release a week later) and NCIS (because CBS' video player sucks). Everything else I watch on Hulu. As a customer I applaud Amazon (and iTunes, in the case of music) for making the decision easier for me and others. Yes, I may be giving up the freedom to switch to another vendor; but, I have yet to find another vendor worth buying from so this really is a non-issue. Amazon, Apple, and Hulu do one thing very well: focus on the customer experience. The print publishers would be wise to learn from them and build their own store if they are so worried about profits. However, they too will use DRM.
