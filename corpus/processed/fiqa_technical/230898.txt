"I remember once using a buzzword on an interviewer and he said something like ""great what do you mean by that"". And I strung together a meaningless line of words and that was the end of that. There is a lot of risk in pretending to know more than you do--particularly if you are not already in the top of the management structure. You had also better know how to deal with someone who doesn't give a fuck and challenges you on every meaningless buzzphrase."
