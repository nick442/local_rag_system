If you think we're moving from cable tv to internet tv, you could try things like Comcast (CMCSA) or Time Warner Cable (TWC). You'll have to pay their dividends, however. Also note that they have the potential to cost-shift by charging more for your internet. In fact the whole industry can do some cost-shifting in such a shift, and probably would try. I doubt it would work because there's a lot of potential for cost-cutting in the salaries they pay these people - media stars and executives are going to take a pretty steep price hike when the monopolistic cable distribution system finally breaks down.
