Ugh. The problem is, we let corporations and money lobby. They spread misinformation in their favor, the ill informed congress doesn’t have a chance to verify all the information they face, there is no “Devil’s Advocate” in place, and we get stupid bills passed. Just instituting a “Devil’s Advocate” group that opposes all bills would relieve a lot of the issues.
