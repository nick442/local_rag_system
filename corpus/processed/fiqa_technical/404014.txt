"(Really a comment on JoeTaxpayer's answer but it's too long) There's one big factor that for some people tips things strongly in favor of the Roth: While the limits on paper for traditional and Roth are the same, in practice they are not--you can contribute more to a Roth than you can to a traditional. While the contribution limits are the ""same"" in both cases, the Roth holds after-tax dollars and an after-tax dollar is worth more than a pre-tax dollar. If you're not maxing your contribution this is completely irrelevant, but if you are maxing your contributions and would like to contribute more this is a big push in the Roth direction. Illustration: You're in the 25% bracket, you have $100k in a traditional IRA. What's it really worth? $75k--because the IRS will take $25k as you pull it out. You have the same $100k in a Roth, it's really worth $100k as the IRA won't take anything."
