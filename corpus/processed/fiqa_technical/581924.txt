"> Yea that's all fine and dandy if you have the resources to afford not having a reliable income while you take the risk of being entrepreneurial. Start small. No one said you need to rent out a floor of an office building in Manhattan and hire 25 people right off the bat. Check out this [20 year old's story](http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/2ahuun/how_i_started_my_business_now_im_moving_on/) in /r/smallbusiness. He started a janitorial company with $500 and sold for $670k a few year later. Instead of just *clearly* being jealous of the rich, why not create something? This kid was obviously tired of being told ""find a job"" and he went out a created his own empire. This is what we should be teaching kids in school. Instead of telling them to go pay $200k for a worthless degree in liberal arts then telling him to cross his fingers to find a ""job"". Fuck that mindset. Fuck finding a ""job"". Go make jobs."
