"If you are hard-working Japanese or German, it takes less than 10 years. This is with little investment from outside. Actually, think about it this way: before the devastation, Japan and Germany were thriving economies to begin with. In comparison, no matter how much money you throw at Afghanistan, Iraq, or ""Palestinians"", they will not have proper infrastructure and economy, before and after the devastation, DESPITE no need for outside investment because they have plenty of oil and minerals to sell."
