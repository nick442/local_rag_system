ParkAir Meet and Greet collects your vehicle at the London Heathrow Terminal 2 Short Stay Car Park Level 2 Zone A and B (Off airport parking bays are marked in black and white board). After handing in your vehicle to our Valet all you have to do is to make the less than 2 mins walk straight into the Depature Terminal to Check In.
