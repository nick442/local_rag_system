"How many HVAC firms exist in your area? If it's more than 1 or 2, it's unusual for them to be able to collude. If you feel underpaid, go interview. You might find that you can get an offer for more $$$ elsewhere. Don't reveal how much you currently make, if asked (this will distort the amount of the job offer). At that point ask your current employer if they're willing to match. If not, then move to the new company. Some employees feel uncomfortable doing this. You want to say, ""I like working here, but it doesn't make business sense for me to work for less than market rates."" Also share your offer with your coworkers, at least the ones you like. This will help equalize the market. Employees can easily punish a stingy company with several departures."
