"No it's not. High frequency trading specifically aims to take a profit without speculating on the movement of price, using technological advantages and exploiting arbitrage opportunities rather than anything else. Big firm trading I agree to an extent (that's why I made the comment that markets may or may not be efficient), but I think it's more nuanced than ""run a projection and see if the price goes up."" And as I say, traders at big trading firms generally have access to information and tools that we don't at home, so if you want to invest in something invest in it - don't try and guess where the price is going to go because people do that professionally and often still get it wrong."
