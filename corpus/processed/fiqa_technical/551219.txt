Nothing in the US is ever determined to be safe for consumption. That isn't how this works, and for good reason. It's neigh impossible to say that anything is definitively safe. Instead, we call out things when they're not safe. If there's no reason whatsoever to believe something isn't safe, then it's allowed for sale. Not sure what you think the alternative is. No food for anyone?
