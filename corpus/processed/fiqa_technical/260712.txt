"[Here you go](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240150767/Facebook-shareholders-sue-over-misleading-IPO) It's a classic case of ""the worst thing you can do is give them an actual reason to go after you."" The real reason folks are hating on the Facebook IPO is, as others have indicated, that they just want to dislike Zuckerberg and the IPO wasn't the instant gold everyone wants to think that IPOs are. But this (honestly minor) information fuckup is going to be the rope that is needed to hang Facebook and Morgan Stanley. It's like Al Capone terrorizing and murdering all across central America, but getting sent to jail on tax fraud."
