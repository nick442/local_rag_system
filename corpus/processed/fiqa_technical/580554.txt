I agree with that if you say it is both a variable amount to reward/punish service quality *and* a base form of compensation. That is why I rarely go below 10% (once at a dennys where my waiter went on a smoke break for our whole meal and I had to rummage for silverware and water refills myself..i think the cook even brought out our food that day)
