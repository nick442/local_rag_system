The clusterfuck you mention was a real estate bubble built with the full backing of bankers. The problem is that real estate bubbles are very profitable to selected few, so there is a huge incentive in building them. I do wish some economist would be able to come up with new way of doing business in which we would not always build these bubbles that inevitably will burst. I do feel bad for all the bagholders in spain who were no longer able to sell the real estate they bought for higher amount of money as all the others before them. It is ridicilous that after all the bubbles in history we still do business like this.
