"In the presence of a central bank, fractional reserve doesn't mean very much. In practice, the central bank bank supplies reserves, at some cost, in whatever quantity is demanded by the system. Reserves are just a cost of doing business for a bank, not something they'll run out of in any ""ponzi"" sense. I don't believe it's a case of people being duped. I think sustainability is threatened not by fractional reserve and central banking but by the degree to which narrow banking has been mingled with more speculative finance."
