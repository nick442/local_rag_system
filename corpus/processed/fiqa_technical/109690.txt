Apple's strategy in India has been bad over the years. Initially, their official launches of their phones was nearly 1 year late. So people who wanted those phones either got them by going overseas or getting it through someone. Or black markets, without official warranties. Then they tried to do the same kind of marketing like in US, of carrier-specific phones which are not even subsidised, totally ignoring the norms of the Indian markets (most phones are sold separately from the mobile plans). Why would anyone in the right mind buy a full priced phone and still get stuck with one company's overpriced iphone specific plan only? or buy an older iphone with subsidised mobile plan? Apple strategy has to take the primary blame.
