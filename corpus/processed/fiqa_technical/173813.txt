To be clear on my comment, I am not anti union. I have issues with some unions, their crazy high rates, and how they intimidate and push people around. Unions have done a good job of protecting workers rights, ensuring that benefits are available (even if crazy expensive), and ensuring worker safety. If all companies could be trusted to do that on their own then there would be no need for unions, but history has repeatedly shown otherwise.
