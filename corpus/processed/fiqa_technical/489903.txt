I was 24 when I bought my first piece of furniture, a rocking chair at a flea market. It was $12. I shopped at Sally's aka the Salvation Army and flea markets. Both my mid-20s nieces have fully furnished homes and their mother and I aren't even dead yet. Both of us have way more STUFF than our relatively well-off parents ever had. I never thought about us being part of a larger issue, but yeah lots of fully furnished houses will be left to kids who already have fully furnished houses.
