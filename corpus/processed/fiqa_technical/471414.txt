529 Plans vs Coverdell ESA is a question where I provided a brief answer of the difference of these two accounts. For your situation, I'd add that the 529 offers you a layer of protection, in that the account can remain your property with the children as beneficiaries. In other words, should your brother's fortunes change, or should the kids get full scholarships, you can change the beneficiary back to yourself, and withdraw the money (Tax and penalty, but the money is still yours.)
