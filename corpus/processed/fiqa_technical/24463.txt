Yes. As a general case, insurance proceeds are repaying you for the damage that you have already incurred, not specifically for fixing anything. Since you have the legal right to sell the house as-is, without fixing it up at all, then you have the legal right to spend the insurance proceeds how you see fit. You can upgrade, downgrade, alter or replace your deck in any reasonable way.. or do nothing. You should call your agent and make sure that there is nothing unusual in your policy, but this kind of homeowner decision - what materials or methods to fix damage to a home.. is very normal and unremarkable, so your agent will probably reassure you and end the conversation without a second's thought.
