"By law, if the account was a ""minor by"", also called a ""custodian"" account, it automatically transfers to you once you reach the age of majority in your state, which I gather from your post is 18. Once you turn 18, all you should need to withdraw money is a state or federal government issued photo-ID, like a drivers license or a military ID, same as you would need for any other bank withdrawal at a teller. Or, an ATM card & PIN if you wanted to use an ATM."
