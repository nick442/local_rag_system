>I want a president who is going to look out for the little guys. Obama certainly wouldn't be your man then. Consider his insurance, and wall street ties; he's not for the little guy; he may say he is, but his actions and policy are obviously not for them. Also, consider that you can be a CEO of a one man shop, and in fact, alot of start-ups begin this way. What about them? Are they not 'little guys' - the ones willing to take the risk, spend their own money, and create jobs in local economies, or must we be dependent on the government for everything from regulating how much soda we drink to what healthcare plans we can or cannot use?
