It's really hard to explain until you've been inside one. There's one here in San Jose and it was a magical experience. Shit you not. In other bookstores you'll be lucky to find a recommended book section, and even rarer to find some kind of context about why the book is good (say a blurb or review). All the books in the front have a blurb from Amazon reviews and average star rating. At another end of the store there are recommendations based on other popular books. It's as if Amazon made a bookstore for people who actually like reading books.
