He is the absolute outlier there, then. Investment banks like Goldman are notorious for everyone who works there putting in 100+ hour weeks. That work may not all be intellectually challenging, but I don't know what your friend expected from an entry level role. They're not going to be entrusting an entry level trading analyst to be doing anything important at all. Your friend probably made slide decks for 80-120 hours a week. Not intellectually challenging at that level, but physically brutal. An intern literally died a few years ago from being overworked. The intellectual challenge likely does not come until you reach a higher rung in the company, which I guarantee he did not do in 2 years. But ask him about the hours he put in at Goldman.
