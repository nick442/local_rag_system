These bids are always up to the judgement of the Public Utilities Commission of Texas, and one of their bigger hangups over the NextEra bid was that NextEra essentially wanted almost complete control of Oncor. Berkshire Hathaway's bid includes keeping Oncor's board and allowing Oncor to operate itself, so the thought is that the PUC will be more in favor of that.
