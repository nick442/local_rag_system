It wasn't just a mortgage crisis. It was debit crisis. Everyone was impacted. If you want to focus of just the housing market, people who owned a home and had a steady job with equity in the house didn't get hit as hard as others because they had time to wait for the rebound. People who put down 3% on a home they couldn't afford with a unsteady job are probably still not recovered and never will be.
