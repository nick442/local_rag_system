"Okay. Let me elaborate. The statement from Uganda is perfectly sound because while they aspire to improve in certain areas that Spain has at this point an advantage, they are not ""Spanish"" qualities. One cannot define development indicators as Spanish qualities. You might as well bring up the football scores. Uganda has a unique cultural and ethnical identity and Ugandans can want to improve their quality of life and industrial potential without wanting to be in the slightest bit like Spain. This is also discussing specific economic performance in recent years. Uganda is in the middle of a boom so if you take that to logical conclusion, the statement can be said to have additional meaning. Spain's principal problem was over-extention of sovereign debt. Uganda perhaps wants to avoid giving off the impression that they are at all like Spain given that there may already be rumors of similar scenarios in Uganda's future economy. Their exchange went up 5% in one day yesterday. 10x higher than any of their neighbors in East and South Africa. Who knows.. personally I think it was just a fucking joke and he put in a good counter-shot at what was a needless international stab at a country that's picking itself up by it's bootstraps slowly but surely."
