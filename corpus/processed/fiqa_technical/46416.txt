If Capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, *rather than by the state*, then the South Sea Bill was an example of trade and industry controlled by the State through State sponsored enterprise. It is more a closely a description of State Socialism, with a large topping of Kleptocracy.
