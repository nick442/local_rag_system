Consider also setting up a CD ladder. CD rates are often better than savings account rates. You have a 12-month CD that you purchase in January with a twelfth of your money, then another small one in February, then another in March.. then, when January comes around again, you a little more money to the first CD, and the ladder is complete. The idea is that you have more access to your money than one big CD, since you'll always have a CD maturing next month that you can get to in case of an emergency, and you can get better rates on a 1-year CD than on something else (with less risk of being locked into a bad interest rate). And you'll be less tempted to tap it all at once to buy some fancy car or what-not because you can't get at it all at once (without a penalty). And in a major emergency, losing a few percent of your interest for early withdrawals is likely the least of your problems.
