"This is a great question, considering that all of your expenses including PITA, Maintenance, etc. are paid by a tenant, your cash flow is $0. Most people would stop and assume your investment is not performing and your only chance at making money is through appreciation. Your question eliminates appreciation so here are the returns you would get on your investment. The math will probably surprise many that you are actually earning a return on your money. Annual Return = [((Future Value)/(Initial Investment))^((Periods per Year)/(Number of Periods) -1]*100 % 5.51% = [($200,000/$40,000)^(12/360)-1]*100 % As Chris Rea commented: The subtlety that some would miss is that while ""income covers expenses exactly"", embedded in the ""expenses"" is actually a repayment of the loan principal (and technically, that's not an ""expense"") so not all of the income is ""lost"" covering the ""expenses"". That repayment of principal portion of the rental income constitutes the return on the original capital invested."
