Monetizing mobile is just the one thing your regular investor can think of. FB can create their own customer web browser. FB-phone. They're moving into Skype's market with video conferencing and chat. Their data mining alone is worth a fortune. They know everything about you plus every site you visit. In-line newsfeed adverts. **Now I agree with everything you say**, but their earning potential is huge if they're creative. For some reason, people think that throwing ads on their mobile is going to be their next big cash cow, when I think it'll be minimal. The biggest thing to FB's potential success is not driving the user base away. I'd go long at $22 pretty comfortably.
