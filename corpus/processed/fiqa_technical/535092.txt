I don't - there's bound to be a lag. That's a natural part of the business cycle. And even in instances where one industry is losing jobs but another industry is growing, workers still have to re-skill and this takes time. I don't have a problem with menial jobs going away. However this puts a burden on the worker and on society to have an ever more-educated workforce. Which is not a bad thing.
