specifically for YouTube, children have become one of the most lucrative niches to be in. Ad revenue for child marketed videos are huge because they know lots of kids tune in and they know children have great conversion rates. Especially in tandem with tech like Amazon, a child sees some amazing product and nags their parents to get it, but instead of having to drive to the store, they log onto Amazon and 1 click order it. Lots of tech evolving but the idea is as simple as it was with the advent of TV. Kids like things, parents spoil their kids, toys are bought with huge mark up, money is made. Adults are hard to market to because they are educated and have self control. Kids see a flashy new toy and that's all they talk about for the next two weeks..until they see the next flashy toy.
