Amazon Prime members and Peapod users. Love shopping for grocery online and will try Amazon Fresh. What shocks me is how WalMart and Meijers (MPerk user) have let us leave w/o a fight. 4 kids and we spent ~$200 - 350 a week on groceries. Never heard anything from the brick and mortar stores. Bizare to me.
