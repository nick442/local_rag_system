Technical expertise does not translate to domain expertise. I'm definitely not going to employ someone with specific skills in Excel, R, whatever; if they have no idea about the underlying algorithms and how to implement them in other languages. I'll employ the dude who understands the algorithms (and can correctly explain with pseudo code or verbally) over someone who is regurgitating a lecture and can only provide textbook answers.
