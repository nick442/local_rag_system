ok, former background is in b2b sales. mostly tech related. if it was me personally, I'd focus as much (if not more) on making as many friends as you can in the logistics / transport world. Tech or executives. Buy them coffees. Ask for their opinion. Make friends. Make friends with their friends. Get into as many industry / trade events and ask what people think. follow up with them regularly. Just get to know as many people as possible that might be interested in what you do and get interested in what they do. Marketing is awesome, but IMHO friends can get you further. Especially in a smaller industry. Get a few on a really solid beta, get some friends loving it, then marketing is much easier.. an other thing to consider is selling the service through a company that already has a lot of those relationships in place. So instead of trying to run your own marketing / advertising campaign, you pay out a commission to some company that already has salespeople and relationships in almost every business. An example is a company called EFI (http://w3.efi.com/) they make really good graphics controllers for high end graphic arts printers (like you'd find in a print shop). But they try to sell to print shops directly, instead they focus most of their marketing on having the salespeople at Xerox, Ricoh, Canon, Konica-Minolta, and other print-related companies sell their products for them / with their own products. Different than what you're doing but hopefully it's a parallel example. Just an example. Hope it helps.
