Lack of taxes are a symptom, but not the root cause. It's a vicious cycle where the more money that accumulates in a few people's hands, the more they can use it to manipulate politics and the media in order to get the system further changed to let them take more and more, then use it for influence, etc. This is the inevitable consequence of capitalism, but can be kept in check by a well regulated market and economy. Which it was. Reagen took care of that though.
