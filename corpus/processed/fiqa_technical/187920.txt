"If the only jobs you have around you are manual labor, dead-end employment where there are no skills to be garnered, if you have other options you will take them. That is the problem with the current state of this country. Instead of being thankful for the job you have and taking advantage of opportunities, it is okay for an individual to just ""sit it out"" and sponge of the rest of society. It is to easy and to lucrative now to just do nothing."
