We don't really have much to work with. I'm not going to recommend some advanced marketing strategies for you. Hell none for that matter. I think a very simple, doable, and effective strategy for you is to make yourself stand out. Remember people do business with people, not corporations. Kind of lol. But interact with your customers as if they're more than customers. Be genuine, try and see things from their point of view. All of that goes a long way. I don't know how similar your industry is, but when I look for somewhere to get a haircut I look at 3 things in order: Quality -> Friendliness -> Price. If you're a good barber, and you're easy and fun to talk to, I won't mind paying however much you charge.
