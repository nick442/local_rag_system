In a nutshell..in order to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, the city or county first has to actually be insolvent, the state has to give authorization for the city or county to file, and the city or county must have made an attempt to negotiate with creditors (bondholders, pensioners etc). Once those conditions are met, and they must be specifically met, the city or county files the bankruptcy petition and the automatic stay typically goes into effect shortly after. This stay basically allows the municipality to stop making payments on some of their obligations throughout the course of the bankruptcy case. Chapter 9 bankruptcies are usually very protracted, and very expensive. So fast forward a year or two, the creditors that are owed money have all been assigned to different classes by the bankruptcy court, with each class getting a specific recovery based on the type of creditor. The city or county has the sole right to propose a plan of reorganization. Some debts, such as a bond backed specifically by revenues generated by a sales tax, are usually considered special revenues and secured..those bondholders will have first priority on those revenues pledged to them throughout the bankruptcy process and are usually unimpaired. Other creditors, such as general obligation bondholders or employee pension plans, are usually considered unsecured and will not receive their contractually obligated payments during the bankruptcy process, and will likely have to take a haircut on the principal amount they are owed by the city or county. The municipality must be solvent in order to advance the plan of reorganization and exit the bankruptcy process, so quite often employee contracts are adjusted, services will be reduced, pension and OPEB promises to retired workers will be curtailed, and bonded debt is reduced to a manageable level. It's not pretty, and it is very expensive.
