I have lived in communal houses. Most people don't want roommates. Especially if that means having several kids. I feel like your arguments are practical, I suppose, but not realistic. If I had 3 kids right now, if anything I would probably be earning less money because my flexibility would be much less. I couldn't pursue an education to earn more money because I would still have bills to pay for my kids. My parents are poor, and they live in an area that my job options would be about 3, and none would pay much more than minimum wage. I am 26, but I have known plenty of 19 year old single moms who just aren't able to get a job that pays well enough to support them, and again, they have few options to develop new skills. I guess you can say it is their fault, but we can hardly say that subway shouldn't have to pay them overtime or what is really less than a living wage. Economists and reality have shown us time and time again that more wages overall means a healthier economy. Every state that has raised wages in the past few years is better off because of it. Every state that has done so has seen their economy grow, and joblessness go down.
