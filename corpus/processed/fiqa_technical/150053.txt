I sold my car on Craigslist for 2K and received cash. I bought a car from Craigslist with $4K cash. For larger amounts where the buyer doesn't want to pocket such large quantities of money, meet them at their bank and have the banker do a draw on their account. Hustle that check to your bank and be done.
