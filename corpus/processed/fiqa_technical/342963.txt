I'm telling you *my* experience, which I know well. I say I drive through occasionally, meaning 2 to 3 times a week depending on traffic on my commute to work. In no way did I attempt to explain *your* experience. The sidewalks are great were I live. The city I live in has a great public transportation system and goes to great lengths to provide and encourage the public to use it. This means that cross walks are abundant, sidewalks are clean (on the specific area I am talking about), and it isn't littered with garbage or broken glass. The way in which the public chooses to ignore this luxury is insane and risky. In order to shave a few minutes off of their walk they choose to risk their life and put their own bodies health in the hands of the several drivers around them. Their kids also do this, although kids aren't the best at personal awareness, which is why adult supervision is necessary and lacking in this area. I am speaking about my personal experience with this issue. I should have clarified that I don't mean to generalize for all areas in the US, however, I am sure my experience is not necessarily unique.
