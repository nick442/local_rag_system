If the fees to keep the account open are reasonable then it's worth keeping it open for now. It streamlines things if you need to visit or otherwise have business transactions (e.g. order things from online stores) with France or other EU countries. If you are not yet even in university, I think it is far too early to predict where you will end up spending your time in life.
