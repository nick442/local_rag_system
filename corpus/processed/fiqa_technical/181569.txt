Have you spent any time in Singapore? Yeah, they have a strong economy, but for people to exist in it they have to really push it to the limit. Entire families living in a 2 bedroom apartment, for example. IDK, it didn't seem like the ideal place for anyone who doesn't have a professional career or isn't making lots of money in finance and business. Also, the culture is sucky. No good culture for people who want a rooted feel to the community. In fact, not much community at all. I would never want to live there, only visit.
