"The simple rule of thumb should be that you never loan money to people you don't know, especially people who seemingly find you out of the blue and have the most amazing stories like this one! (chuckle) This is a scam almost as old as the internet itself, and there's no guidebook for anyone to read that can tell them how to avoid such silliness. It all comes down to simple common sense and gut instinct. This is someone you met online (you didn't say how, but that doesn't really matter), and shortly afterward they come up with a crazy tale that involves money transfers and bank account passwords..and you're really going to even contemplate doing it? I think yo know better, but you're probably a kindhearted person who has a tough time saying ""no"". You're exactly the kind of person these scams target. Give yourself some credit for being smarter than this, end the online friendship, and wish them luck in their endeavors. Good luck!"
