Finance at the PhD level requires a pretty complete understanding of linear algebra, multivariate calc (cIII), vector calc, stochastic calc, diff eq, and numerical analysis. As someone who had math for one of his majors for undergrad, it's not about the intuitive understanding but the abstract as well. Most of the finance professors that I had and researched under were originally undergrad for math. Very few of them actually started out in business roles/degrees..
