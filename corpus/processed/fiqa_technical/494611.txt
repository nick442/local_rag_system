FOX news can join CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ect and drop off the face of the earth. They are just as bad a mouth piece as the other major networks. The media never treated Obama even half as bad. I voted for Obama during his first run, I just think the media has been very unfair and do not deserve special privileges.
