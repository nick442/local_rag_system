"The entire purpose of it. They already had an online store and presence and have a far superior network of DC's and shipping. Not to mention a huge network of actual ""brick and mortar"" stores. Walmart's DC's and their ability to be extremely efficient in supplying their stores is next to none. Not to mention they can use the same DC's they already have to fill online orders which far exceed what Amazon has let alone any other company in the same field. Hell Meijer as a larger physical presence than most in the midwest/eastern side of the states. People also discount company's such as Menards which I am actually confused how why they have not expanded more than they have. I just feel like a lot of the ""Amazon is taking over the world"" is complete horse shit much like how Kmart was going to back in the day. Amazon stock is the single most inflated and bloated pile I have ever seen and it will catch up to them. It made little to no real sense. They did not need Jet.com to push what they were trying to do with online orders."
