"I know plenty of guys out of college looking to get a start. There's a common problem: ""Hey? Know anyone looking for work?"" Me: ""Do you need experience?"" Them: ""Um.. yeah.."" Some of them are very good developers Microsoft is one of the better companies, though they have other issues. Most of them won't even bother if you are right out of college. I wish more invested in training programs to find those star workers to get them into coding and out of McDonalds. I'm finding consulting companies are starting to take the place of this, and that's how I got my start Microsoft did interview me a few times when I got out of college, but my communication skills were lacking then. Nowadays, after I got my start, people are starting to come to me."
