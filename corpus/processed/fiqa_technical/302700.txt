You're just making that up. Over the last five years, food prices are up 15%. That's a lot. Still, 10x lower than your claim. Reference: http://metricmash.com/inflation.aspx?code=SAF11 Another: http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40545.pdf Food inflation in 2012 is about 2.0, above overall inflation of about 1.7%. It has been similar in the last four years. Mind you, you wrote that inflation was 20% overall because food prices were going up *even higher than that.* You're not just wrong. You are *wildly* wrong, possibly in a paranoid way, about a topic that is very easy to get objective data on. Any response that doesn't acknowledge that will be ignored.
