I think another problem is that even when information does come out, it is not presented in a way that most people can understand. Many Kardashians followers don't know what a hedge fund is, what impact their management has on the markets, what different products exist on what markets, how all of this impacts the economy and the price of a 3d TV to see Kim's boobs in life size - or the price of food that is unaffordable to the down and out guy who's going to break into their middle class homes to steal their 3d TV.
