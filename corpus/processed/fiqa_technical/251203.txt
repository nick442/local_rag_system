https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service > [The Postal Service] has continuously failed to manage its budget properly, to the tune of $5 to $10 billion dollar deficiets every year with a total mail volume that has declined 29% between 1998 and 2008. Problem -- the government is offering a service at great expense that people do not want and other private entities can do much faster and more efficiently at orders of magnitude less cost to their customers. The obvious solution -- privatize The governments solution -- placate the gov employees union and continue to fund the postal service as it repells customers and posts 5 to 10 billion dollar deficiets. For me, this is not a question of what solutions can be found within the government. Government itself is the problem, this is merely a case study as to why I do not feel it can be trusted with greater authority over the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy.
