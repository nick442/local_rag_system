Has any country in their existence, paid their debt in full? To me it seems that every country is in debt and it will just keep growing. It's like they know that the debt is impossible to pay and they just play along so that they get their paycheck and pass the debt to the other guy/gal who wins the office. Do we just want to believe that one day everybody would receive so much money that everybody would pay off their debt?
