"Normally, I'd say that because of the ""magic of compound interest"", balances of high rate cards shoot up rapidly, so pay off the high rate cards one by one until they're all zero. In this case, though, 23%, 20% & 19% are close enough that I'd pay off the card with the highest balance, then 2nd highest, then 3rd and leave the 13.24% card for last. Note that -- sooner than you think -- other card companies will send you low-rate balance transfer. Take one ASAP and pay it down as much as possible so that when the low introductory rate is over, the balance on your now-high-rate card is low. Bottom line: balances on high interest rate card accumulate incredibly quickly, so kill them first one at a time."
