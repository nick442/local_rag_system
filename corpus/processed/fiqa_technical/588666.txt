Try doing a few local markets and events to see if there's a demand for what you want to sell. Walk around your city if you want to open a store and find locations you're interested in. Talk to as many people as possible about pricing, location, products etc, - getting to know your potential customers has been essential for my business. Being flexible and incorporating what they want has been key for me. Some of my best selling products have been created because so many customers have asked for a certain thing (I make jewellery and lots of people asked for giraffe necklaces - I made one and it's a huge hit!). And use your age as an advantage, I was 20 when I started my business and people are happy to support a young person with a big idea and loads of passion.
