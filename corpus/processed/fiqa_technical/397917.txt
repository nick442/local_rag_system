Unfortunately there is no universal answer to this question. Each mortgage servicing company will handle it differently according to their own policies. The best way to handle this problem is to talk to your mortgage servicing company and specify that you want all of your over-payments to be applied to principle (assuming that is indeed what you want). Most companies will be willing to work according to your stated preferences, but there may be some companies that have a specific procedure for how to make sure that preference is applied. Unfortunately there is very little you can do about it if you ended up with one of the less friendly mortgage servicing companies out there. Maybe threaten a lawsuit. Good luck.
