The investment in the highway system in the USA, the MOST EXPENSIVE investment ever(!) done by the USA, and then people drive on them for FREE(!), had a proven idea behind it: it develops the country and promote the economy, trade, etc. Huge long term benefits in so many areas with huge benefits compared to the investment. Same with space exploration! Absolutely ZERO return on investment, but wait for the future.. Investment in this factory will at least bring money back to the state. People will work instead of living off welfare. But beyond that: if there's a factory, there need to be supplies, supplier, R&D, sales, production management, and technology being used here in the USA that can be used for making other products. Based on what you said, we should not have invested in the highway system or space program.
