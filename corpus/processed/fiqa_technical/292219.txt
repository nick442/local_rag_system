"Since you have something of a background in econ, I'd check out the iTunes University ""Financial Theory"" course provided by Yale University. http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/financial-theory-video/id428500350 It starts off with the basics (time value of money, general equilibrium) and gets into some pretty topical issues -- dynamic hedging, mortgage backed securities, and so on. It's definitely an economics-focused course though, so there isn't going to be much coverage of more mathsy topics such as martingale pricing theory."
