That makes sense though since I live in a small town with few tech jobs available, and glassdoor is a good deciding factor when the very little that is available offer little return compared to bigger cities. I am not comfortable moving to the big city just yet since i haven't established myself in the field and competing in a big industrialized city doesn't assure that I will find a job easy peasy lemon squeezy from where I am just yet, therefore it's good to stick around and find something to build experience. I am just hoping to do it before the tech market saturates and these jobs either become scarce, or aren't very profitable anymore since public schools and community efforts offer coding classes and seminars in several cities and communities in hopes of retraining people, when this specialized skill becomes that common it might become as valuable as fast food cashiers since everyone wants to learn. I don't want to compete in a market in that state, it's all very scary (but there are several people on the internet convincing people to not go to college, I live in a town that takes this advice and I know there are several hundred more like it so I have that going for me). Anyway, Glassdoor does effect smaller businesses that have no benefits, and just a non-standardized work cultures. Basically, it's a bit of a toss up on how you will be treated in a small company since, unlike google, don't list their terms and conditions, plus their policies on their website (if they have one and if they bother). I know big corporations might not need to worry about glassdoor reviews (unless they work in chapters rather than having a huge HQ in one place that hires thousands). I would imagine a small business has more to be afraid of when it comes to glass door brand wise.
