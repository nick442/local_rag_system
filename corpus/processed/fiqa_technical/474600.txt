There was an NPR (I think) story a couple of years ago about the cost of college. They found that while sticker prices were going up, the price most people paid wasn't actually rising that fast. This was at least true in top tier schools. I think some state schools have other issues, like the state cutting back on funding so raising tuitions and/or cutting back on scholarships and grants. The weird thing I learned from the piece was that raising prices was a way to appear more attractive to top students. Apparently the psychological factors around getting a $10k scholarship to a $15k school or a $30k scholarship to a $35k school make the more expensive one look better.
