"Just an add-on that I would argue CDO's were created much earlier, in the late 1960's, by newly created Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae, and eventually Freddie MAc in some of the original mortgage bundling programs. There were no private-label MBS's at the time, but the practice had already started well before the 80's. Not trying to be a dick, but I think it's historically significant. edit: To maybe double back a bit, I know that they were passing through mortgages, but I'm actually not sure how the securitization actually worked, (if they were technically ""collaterialized."")."
