The state of Massachusetts, for one. If you get divorced there you have to pay child support until the kid is twenty two. The custodial parent, usually the mother, can decide to send the kid to an Ivy League school if the kid is accepted there and the other parent has to pay for at least half the cost, if not more. I'm not complaining. I didn't get divorced there. But I knew a couple that did and that's where I learned this strange fact.
