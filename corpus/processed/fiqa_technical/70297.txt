">The Port Authority receives no tax money and funds itself through tolls, rents, surcharges on airline tickets and other fees. It collects taxes, but they are not called ""taxes."" What the fuck do you think a surcharge is? How about alcohol tax? Why not just call it alcohol surcharge? Same shit, different wrapper. Point again -- if we call the person a cop, then we talk about a public servant. If it's a private employee, it's called a guard, a security specialist or any number of terms."
