My lines word for word: >**Increasing** military spending more than where it is just widens our lead in a dick measuring contest we've already won by a good margin. In a later comment, also my lines word for word: > I think increasing social spending does more good than **increasing** military spending at this point. Your other point: >First you say redirect spending to social services then you say redirect money to infrastructure. Those are two very different things. Not according to the [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/socialexp/social-spending.htm): >Social expenditure comprises cash benefits, direct in-kind **provision of goods and services**, and tax breaks with social purposes. Benefits may be targeted at low-income households, the elderly, disabled, sick, unemployed, or young persons.
