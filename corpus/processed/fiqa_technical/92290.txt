Earned income is earned income. You can put your bonus in a tax-advantaged account, or not, just like you can put your salary in a tax-advantaged account, or not. If you don't, it's taxed as ordinary income. Now, it may look like they're taking a ton out of your paycheck, but part of what may be happening is that, for that paycheck, it looks like you're making a whole lot more, so they're withholding a whole lot more based on a probably conservative formula that will make sure you (and they) don't get in trouble with the IRS for underwithholding. So, if they're taking out too much with this paycheck, you'll get it back when you file your taxes. Or, you can change your withholding yourself to account for this.
