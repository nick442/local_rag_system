well you are applying your own personal experience and saying it isn't worth it.. at 40k debt that's an amount I believe most could swallow vs going to Europe AND to a specific degree that isn't recognized in the US. Yeah I agree.. not really worth it.. TO YOU. I'm talking about the people out there with 100/200k in debt that could go for degrees that you can bring back to the US. Business, maths, even medicine. I'm not going to waste my time doing research for you but education in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark (?) and Finland is free. All else being equal, you could probably go abroad and save yourself 40k to invest in whatever you want. But of course, owing thousands of dollars out of school is so ingrained in the US culture that it became the status quo.
