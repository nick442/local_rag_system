"You sound like Mayor Bloomberg crying to Occupiers not to ""be so hard"" on the banks, because they're ""job creators"". If they're a crappy company, we don't need their crappy jobs. Think of all the unfortunate hedge fund managers who lost their jobs in 2008. Shed any tears for them? I couldn't name you half a dozen people that would shed even one."
