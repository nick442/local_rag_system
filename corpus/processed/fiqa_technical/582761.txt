"One way to possibly disambiguate it from a tip is to receive it outside of your service context. If there really is a relationship, and they want to show appreciation or help you out financially, the ""gift"" could be given outside of the restaurant. Otherwise, I agree that it seems like tax evasion. The purpose of the money was to compensate for services rendered, which is income, not a gift. If it's just a random stranger, then I'd have a hard time arguing that the purpose was pure altruism versus socially-mandated tipping. Why can't I just have my employer just give me a ""gift"" every Christmas instead of a bonus? Or just reduce by salary by $18k and give me a $1,500 ""gift"" every month?"
