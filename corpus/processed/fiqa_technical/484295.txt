Imagine an internet where the best content was behind a pay wall while the buzzfeed, gawker, and even yahoo were free. You can get your standard journalism plus clickbait for free, but you could also support the greatest content on the web while providing it greater power by generating it revenue. All by choice, of course. If you don't want a premium product, the best journalism and well constructed opinion pieces, don't pay for it. Of course freemium, such as the way the economist is currently, i.e. 3 free articles a week (or something like that), is the best way to attract new customers. But I strongly feel that the best journalism is worth more than the clickbait garbage despite that I won't click an irrelevant ad simple because I feel the article is better crafted. This, I would be willing to pay more for it even on the internet.
