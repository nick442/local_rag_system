I'm not kidding. Maybe there is a problem there. I'm really not trying to be a jerk. My husband could use mood stabilizers. His neurologist put him on an antidepressant which helped a lot. I, of course, got yelled at for suggesting it. You absolutely raged at me right out of the gate. I'm VERY familiar with that behavior. You really should see a therapist. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I am not backing down from my initial statement. 50% of working age men who are not in the work force are addicted to opiates. It's not because they are in pain. They would be better off smoking cannabis. Everyone is fooling themselves if they think the choice between getting high and not is simply a matter of them just quitting. If they could do that they would. At least cannabis is basically harmless and not physically addictive. Go ahead, tell me I'm an asshole again. I don't care. Trust me. I have thick skin after 22 years of abuse.
