To be fair, Inland Revenue has options here. They don't have to accept this transfer pricing scheme Starbucks has come up with to funnel their profits to, almost certainly, some overseas tax haven. I work with the Treasury team at a large British multinational pharma company in Japan. There are constant disputes between Inland Revenue and the IRS and the Japanese NTA and the British, Japanese and U.S. companies over what is an appropriate or inappropriate level of royalty for patents and trademarks owned by the three and licensed back and forth.
