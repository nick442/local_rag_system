"Which Rabbinical school of the Orthodox sect believes in a ""modern"" setting for the role of the woman in the family? Which Rabbinical school allows teaching of modern concepts (and actually teaches the children Math)? I'm not saying all but most Orthodox sects of Judaism that I know are hell bent on prescribing to the texts of the Talmud and defying modern ways of civilizations progressivism. That being said, they don't proselytize but they're still far too inclusive in this day and age. I feel like you can be a man or woman of your religion without the elitism or condemnation of others. Orthodox Jews even think Jews outside their own sects are beneath them. It's tribalism at best."
