He can buy at 69.95 or 69.70 or whatever because he already has all the shares. The HFT bought at a cheaper price earlier. The HFT has all the shares. Now he's testing the guy who won't go above 70.00 with small orders. When he sees that this guy is willing to buy 10 at 70.00 the HFT makes a limit order of all the shares in the market at 70.00 when he got them all already at 69.95. Whatever doesn't get bought up goes back into the market at the price the HFT originally bought at. The HFT was in line ahead of the guy who won't go above 70.00 as soon as he saw him buying. Like at the horse race, remember?
