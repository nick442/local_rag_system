If you literally know almost nothing? I suggest: 1) learn financial terms, such as going through a glossary 2) learn how to read financial statements (balance, income, and cash flow sheets) edit: If you mean just in terms of a job? I have no advice other than to keep your mind open, adapt, and be proactive/enthusiastic.
