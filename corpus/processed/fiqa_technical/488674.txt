Windows 8 may or may not be awesome, what matters is when people don't like it. I've had to reinstall the CEO's laptop because he refused to use it. He didn't like Windows 8 and didn't want to learn it. I'd say at least 80-90% of the people that I know to have used it, hate it. One of the execs has a Win8 laptop his kids refuse to use, they all fight over the other laptop instead. (he also asked me to reinstall it) That's anecdotal, but from what I've seen it's not getting the greatest reception.
