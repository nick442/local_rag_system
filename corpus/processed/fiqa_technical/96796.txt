That's a simplified, layman's argument that you have minunderstood. Inflation has nothing to do with prices of goods, but rather the purchasing power of the money itself. It sounds like the same thing, but the subtle difference is crucial to understanding monetary policy. Look at the counterexample: in places with super high inflation, like Venezuela, people spend their entire paycheck the minute they get it, because it's value is declining. If you don't know that gasoline is an inelastic product, I really can't help you without devoting significant amounts of time to helping you understand a subject that is frequently counterintuitive and hard to understand. You should probably take an economics class. It's fascinating stuff. Suffice to say, literally everyone who studies this stuff agrees that a small amount of controlled inflation is beneficial to keeping money moving rapidly around the economy, spurring growth and activity in production of goods and services. High inflation is very bad. Hyperinflation is worse. Deflation is the worst, though it sounds great to people who don't know what they are talking about. Econ 101. Take it. Love it.
