I must humbly disagree with your analysis. These politicians want to help out their fossil fuel buddies because they know once they leave office they can then work as lobbyists for the industry. They do not need to be misled or lied to. 3 former mayors of my city now work as Investment Bankers getting paid at least $2,000,000 a year to help companies get contracts from the city they were mayors of.
