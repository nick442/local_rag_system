"The ends justify the means? Do you even understand that phrase? Obviously the end is our open-faced sandwiches. So you're saying the means are..abuse? ""Means"" must be something *necessary*. Abuse is not a necessity. The means are the things required to make the animal grow to an edible size. Also, the ends can change. In Korea, pet theft for food does occur. By your logic, if someone stole your dog on Tuesday (when it would be morally reprehensible to abuse it) by Wednesday--when its end has been determined by the thieves as food--it's open season for beatings. Same dog, but a different situation (which it had no say in, obviously) makes it OK to abuse. Have fun with that argument in social situations. Don't forget to bring up your defense of gall-bladder draining and, I'm assuming, gorilla poaching."
