Congratulations on completing the GSoC. I think the short answer is No, and you ought to just hang on to the card and gradually spend it down on your day-to-day expenses: you can spend money off a US prepaid card in Australia, or with online US merchants. That will probably be a better deal than trying to cash it out, unless you really desperately need the cash.
