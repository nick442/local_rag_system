For one coin flip, the expectation is 0.5,the standard deviation is 0.5, and the variance is 0.25. Variance and expectation are additive, so for 100 coins the mean is 50 and the variance is 25, so the standard deviation is 5. 60 coin flips is a 2 standard deviation outlier. You get 2 standard deviation events about 4.5% of the time. Notice that this outcome is two standard deviations on only one side, so you'll see the result only about 2% of the time. I implicitly used the facts that binomial distribution is approximately normal and that the coin flips are independent.
