Assuming you have a good head on your shoulders, start looking into organizations with missions that align with what you believe in. After you've found a couple that are within driving distance, reach out and volunteer to serve on a Board or two. There are tons of non-profit, and for-profit, entities that cannot afford to pay a salary, or generally even a stipend, to the Board members. These organizations need good people to work on the Board for free and who aren't seeking a Board position to merely enhance their resume.
