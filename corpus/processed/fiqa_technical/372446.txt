I don't know how you're not understanding where you're in the wrong here. I really don't. You've already admitted that the things I said about not everyone having equal opportunity are correct. Yet here you are, still pretending that that didn't happen, still dead set in your views that everyone should just find a better job that pays them more money. You've said that you agree that not everyone can just up and get a better job, but yet you still are spouting nonsense saying that they should. You have yet to mention what happens to those who CAN'T do that (whom you have already admitted exist). I don't know if you have a reading comprehension issue or what your deal is, but you really need to just go away. What have you said that isn't factually correct? How about EVERYTHING that you've said? None of your opinion is based even a little bit in reality.
