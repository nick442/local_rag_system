His credit is likely impacted already for the fact it's in collection. My real concern is that he be 100% certain the debt collector actually has ownership of the debt. At first glance this sounds like it may be a scam, but if the debt was written off, it may have been sold for pennies on the dollar. So to the collector 20% of face value is a tidy profit.
