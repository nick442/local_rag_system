I am a CFA Charterholder. Sitting for the exams was a great foot in the door for me to the world of investment research. Today, it is the lasting educational experience and development of mental frameworks on how to conduct financial analysis that help me in the field. There are three exams in the CFA Program; moreover, to earn the CFA Charter, you need four years of financial industry work experience. I found Level II to be the hardest, and Level I the easiest. Having the CFA Charter or simply stating you are a CFA Candidate sitting for a future exam goes a long way in your career early on. It is a great signaling mechanism for prospective employers as it shows you are committed and willing to put in hours to go above and beyond. The body of knowledge you learn in the program will tremendously help you in your career as it will teach you the language of finance. Overall, **it is a rigorous self-study program.** I can not stress the last sentence enough. You will need to be self-disciplined about doing the required reading, and preparing for the exam.

Again, the exam is not hard per-se, you just have to sit down and study.

Edit: Most financial industry employers will pay for the cost of the exams and study materials.
