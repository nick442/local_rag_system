I think the key here is 'at any age'. Yes it's not surprising that for demographics who have been in the workforce for a while, $100k won't get you near the top (i.e. Ages 30+). However, what can be surprising is that even at age 25, $100k isn't enough to get you in the top 1%. So what more of the masses that don't earn anywhere near that number?
