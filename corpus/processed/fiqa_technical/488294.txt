Turns out the verge isn't a good source. NYC bans rentals for short stays unless physical requirements are met within the building itself. Again, not out right ban. You're a very dumb person. Also, regulation has still crushed supply in NYC so my point, despite your whining and moving the goalposts to help yourself out, still remains.
