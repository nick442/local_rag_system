I said the point is to create value. For a growth company, the best way to create value is to reinvest cash in the business and grow the company so that they can have larger earnings and therefore larger dividends in the future. For a company like Apple, which is no longer a growth company, they should be distributing earnings instead of hoarding them and essentially buying treasuries on their shareholders' behalf.
