The store near me really sucks. I'll admit I haven't been to many other Best Buys in a few years as it's not really the area of retail real estate I've been involved in, but the two in my area are always a disaster. I've had Dynex cables fail three times on me when they're basically plugged in once and and never moved, and the stores near me never have any cheap phone cables in stock, only 2/20 and it's the exorbitantly expensive 3rd party ones that nobody wants. It's not a slight against you but all of the major big box retailers are like this. Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Fry's Electronics (great deals but the worst customer service) etc
