I'm not suggesting the constitution is perfect, I'm saying a democracy without a constitution would be a risky thing. This has been noted since Aristotle's Politics. To put it simply, what if the majority in America today, decided to round up Muslim Americans in concentration camps? The only thing protecting them is the constitutional right of due process. It's not perfect in practice, but imagine if it didn't exist at all. Guantanamo Bay and the Japanese camps during WW2 were both failures of this protection, but it's the constitution that gives civil rights advocates a leg to stand on in opposing such practices. If not for that, there would be no recourse for a persecuted minority.
