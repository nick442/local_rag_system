Well I guess I'm going to throw a curveball from what others have said so far. I have an entry level FP&A job at a medium-ish ($600M rev) size company. I use SQL all. the. time. We get a lot of data requests, and instead of shoveling them over to our tiny IT team who is more focused on development, we ourselves have to create and validate loads of SQL queries. For any recurring data requests, we throw the queries into a Power BI dashboard and do analytics off of it. My intuition is that smaller companies' FP&A departments are going to overlap more with IT when it comes to data due to less rigidly defined internal structure, so knowing some of the tools IT uses can certainly help. Just knowing how to query company databases (if you can get access) saves days of waiting + back and forth with IT. If you use SQL and Excel, you'll become familiar with power query, which is a useful timesaver for automatically transforming raw data. A natural extension to SQL would then be analytical software or programming like R. Companies like the one I work for are trying to figure out business intelligence, and we've implemented suites of PBI dashboards, which requires an understanding of Dax (which is only different enough from VB to be annoying IMO). Be a wizard at Excel, which I'm sure you already know. Know how to apply conditional formatting 46 different ways, know how to quickly create and manipulate pivot charts in addition to being a god of pivot table manipulation. Know how to automate repetitive tasks. A big one (for me) is know how to do reconciliation quickly using Excel (FP&A does a lot of recon at my work). Knowing how to cleverly apply and manipulate pivot tables and v-lookups can be the difference between spending 4 and 40 hours doing recon. Note that these suggestions come from my experience alone.
