Good time to mention the US is also the only country (besides Eritrea) to tax citizens on their worldwide income *regardless of their residency.* And yes, this is very strongly enforced against Average Joes who happen to have dual citizenship but have lived in Canada or UK or what not for the past 30 years. Through FATCA they've coerced global banks to hand them account data on all US citizens. Who knew a country borne out of a tax protest against an empire would become the most imperialist tax regime in the world?
