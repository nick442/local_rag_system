">The offending passage from his New York Times piece (link) reiterates the economic truism that debt is “money that we owe ourselves.” >This is misdirection through aggregation, conflating corporate and government debt owned by pension funds and charitable organizations with underwater mortgages, student loans and sub-prime auto loans in their economic effects. And within his own economics, disaggregating the “we” renders far different results than he suggests. I have always felt that anyone quoting that phrase ""debt is [just] money that we owe ourselves"" to be a total ASS or a consummate con-artist. They are either truly ignorant (and just regurgitating an indoctrinated dogma in a rote fashion like a trained dog); OR they are being disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. It is NOT an ""economic truism"", it is an utterly useless, rhetorical, tautological *inanity* (well, useless UNLESS your purpose is to obfuscate, mislead, and misdirect and confuse people)."
