(Also posted in r/FinancialCareers) Hello all, For the past few months I've been deciding on what I want to do with my career and how to progress in my chosen field. After a lot of thought, I want to get into Finance, most likely corporate finance with the end goal of Controller or CFO. Right now, I am an accounting analyst at a small company just a few years out of a B1G school with a BS in Economics. I feel that my work experience is relevant enough to land an entry level or lower level job as an analyst somewhere. My other option is to go back to school and get a MFin. I'm leaning towards focusing most of my effort on the job search option. So, I have a couple of questions: 1. Does it make sense to focus on the job search or should I add skills via grad school? 2. If you feel searching for jobs is the best route, how do I best position myself as a non business graduate to get a new role? 3. Any other advice is appreciated. Thanks!
