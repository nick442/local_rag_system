In a healthy society automation should be welcomed. Because ideally everything should be automated except leisure. But in our society we cannot share. We are greedy. In our society automation instead of the joy that it should be, causes grief. The proceeds of automation should go to every human equally and not exclusively to the owners of the machines. It's because only the owners benefit that there is so much strife right now. In the end, we don't need that many machines and there will be very very few owners of the few machines. What about the rest? Should they just lay down and die? If that's the attitude of the machine owners toward the population, then there is no reason to be peaceful and to just die peacefully.
