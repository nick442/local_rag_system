Gwarsh goofy . .what are you talking about now, who is buying US treasuries or what is the National Debt, either way in your fucked up money printing economy where you cant even pay off your student loans or cover your insurance, what to talk of house loans and fancy financial instruments, that were based on those, which went into default and the Fed bought up, that required the Fed to give the banks an unlimited credit line as a back stop. You see shit head . .all those trillions and trillions of dollars of bad loans and bank bailouts now sits on the Feds balance sheet as $4.5 trillion, leveraged many many many many . . . many . many times so the banks look like they are capitally adequate on paper. Thats what it means when you nationalize public debt Understand shit wit? Incidentally thats what the Fed is trying to unwind and some fucking moron like you will buy and then go bankrupt and ask for a bailout and get more debt from the Fed. Its a good thing your generation grew up sucking Chinese toys, the lead in the paint did its job well, otherwise you might have actually learnt something . . .Gwarsh!
