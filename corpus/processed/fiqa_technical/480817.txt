"Depth of analysis IS my strong suit. You just showed one level in your example. I grew up in Florida by Sea Ray and watched my friends lies jobs when Clinton started ""punishing the rich"" with luxury taxes. They sure didn't care that the rich were getting theirs. They were concerned that their boat building/selling/painting/whatever job had just let them go. But you have to dig down to understand that. ;-)"
