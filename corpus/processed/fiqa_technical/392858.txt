I used to assume that but now I have price check most things elsewhere. Also, the labeling/pricing practices of sellers have gotten out of control. I recently bought tea on amazon and I'm not joking when I say that the exact same products would be listed at vastly different prices from different sellers - in one case, at the same time, the same item was priced at $6, $8, $23 and $29 from different sellers. You may think (as I first did) that the differences are due to size, quantity, shipping, or slight feature differences - nope. There's no unit standardization, so it's hard to compare the prices of the same product from different sellers. IDK why amazon allows that crap. It can't make much money relative to the costs of teaching users that they have to doublecheck everything on amazon.
