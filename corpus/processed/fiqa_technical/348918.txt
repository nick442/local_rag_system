The reason is bc to be profitable they have to keep the majority of their cars rented out at any given moment. What you see on the lot is less than 10% of their fleet. They really do try to keep your class of vehicle reserved, but the logistics get complicated, quickly. They employ drivers who's job is to try to get the right class of vehicle to the right location at the right time. This further complicates things tho because that means one store just lost a vehicle from their fleet, while another gained one. It is very hard to predict at any given moment what a location's fleet will be composed of. Edit: also, pro tip: don't reserve a convertible. They're going to stick you with whatever convertible they have on the lot (might be shit). But if you reserve a luxury class vehicle, and when you get to the lot you see a nice convertible you want, ask to switch to that. If you don't get your nice convertible you'll at least have a guaranteed nice car.
