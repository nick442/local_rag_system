This guy whines like a stepped on puppy. While all his friends were out partying, he was having no fun building his business. After all his workers go home and whoop it up, he's all alone at the office signing paychecks. He sounds like some miserable SOB. I own a business, I try to have fun doing it. Obama's not going to stop me! Actually, I try not to base decisions on growing the business on Washington, DC. That'd truly be stupid. I can make all the stupid decisions I need on my own.
