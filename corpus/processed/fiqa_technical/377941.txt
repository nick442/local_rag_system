"I'm a contractor, and I usually throw in a extra few hours for free during the week. A lot of us do. You want the employer to know that you're willing to put in the effort to help them succeed. On the other hand, if they asked me to work a specific amount of OT a week, I'd get time and a half. And most companies aren't going to work you 7 days a week,, 10 hours a day. Maybe around crunch time, but the rest of the time work is pretty normal. When my company's gearing up for a new project, I usually have a few weeks where work is minimal, and I have very little to do. I figure it balances out. Although I thought the end of the article was pretty funny. Like it was a high school guy saying ""Oh, yeah, well I knew a guy who worked so hard he dropped dead. So there!."""
