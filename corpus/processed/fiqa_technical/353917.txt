No. Supply takes 5yrs to come on line from planting to harvesting. The issue on the supply side has been twofold: 1) vanilla bean prices have been falling for some time so many farmers switched to other crops, 2) 50%+ of all vanilla bean is grown in Madasgar, which experienced a typhoon, which damaged a bunch of the existing crop. On the demand side, people are switching from artificial flavoring to more natural ingredients, which actually taste much better too. So, there's a significant demand/supply imbalance which will utilitmately correct but it could take a long time to do so. My problem is figuring out a viable shorting mechanism as the commodity is not publicly traded and the timeframe is long
