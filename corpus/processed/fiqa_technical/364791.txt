At the end of Dodgeball, Vince Vaughn's character is supposed to be in the final with his team, who beat expectations to get there. Instead he gets scared and hesitant about it all and ends up a nearby bar sitting on stool by himself. Then Lance Armstrong walks up just passing by to buy a bottle of water from the bar and notices Vaughn's character and tells him he's a big fan who has been following them on ESPN 8 the Ocho. He then asks why he wasn't in gear and ready for the final. Vaughn basically tells him he quit and doesn't have it in him. Lance then says, in a casual manner, I felt like that once, I had cancer that almost killed me, but I kept moving forward and won the Tour De France 5 times in a row. Of course this strikes a cord with Vaughn's character who realizes that he has no idea what real struggle is and he needs to man up like Lance did and head to the final, which he does. This is all so funny now because Lance Armstrong cheated his way to those championships and then lied to everyone about doing it. He became a symbol of hope, rode that symbol to infamy, all the while, he was lying, cheating, and misleading those around him. So advice from him at the end of the Dodgeball now seems fucking hilarious. Sorry for the extensive write up -- I'm on adderall.
