"> This emphasis on time drops away completely under Results Only Work Environment (ROWE) arrangements, but that leads directly to legal issues because we treat time as sacred no mater how much is spent at the desk or water cooler. Well no. The problem is that we treat time asymmetrically. Time under 40 hours is treated as ""rightfully"" the employer's time, and more work should be piled on to reach 40 hours. Time over 40 hours is treated as negotiable and subject to necessity and desire. A *real* ROWE fully allows for negotiating in the direction of working 20-30 hours/week."
