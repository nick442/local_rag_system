"You gotta stop using that ""overhears"" argument. It's ridiculous. First of all it doesn't work like that because most trades get filled internally or through dark pools and secondly the HFT is taking risk for that 2 cents. Also, they don't hold it, they gotta offload it, so the price will go back down. Finally, this only affects people making huge orders and this is pennies to them. This is not a free lunch for HFT since those 2 cents have risks associated. Think of it another way: some HFT dudes have some programs that run really fast, and they make some minuscule amounts of money; think maybe a few k a day. But, they do do something useful: they let you enter/exit positions at a better price by reducing spreads."
