For now it could possibly happen, assuming there are that many people wanting to offload their coins and recent charts are showing that trading volume is pretty damn low right now, even with prices being so high. I'm going to guess most people with Bitcoin plan to hold onto it for a while. Considering bitcoin can only be divisible to 8 decimal points (1 bitcoin = 1^8 satoshis), prices will start to skyrocket once supply cedes and (if) demand continues to rise. Or so it should, if it ever reaches that point. Most naysayers believe it'll die before it reaches that point.
