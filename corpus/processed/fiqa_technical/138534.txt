I use Yelp occasionally. I still haven't seen the problem. Typically I read the good and bad reviews. I understand that there are many instances of apparent abuse but honestly, I've never run into them when looking a place up. So yeah, it sucks that this happens but I still don't see it as a big deal overall.
