You can replace Ciscos products with those of any other networking company. There's plenty of multibillion players in the space and I'm sure there's lots of tiny ones most folks have never heard of. Even if you copied FB verbatim, you'd have to convince a few hundred million (billion?) people to use it so you'd have that level of captive network effect. Unless they do something dumb, they're the go-to for social networks for the foreseeable future, just like Google killed off Alta Vista, Ask and all the other search engines.
