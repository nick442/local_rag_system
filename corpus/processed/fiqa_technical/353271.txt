"Well, to be fair, it certainly wasn't a priority for the government to oversee account-opening operations at the branch level, and I'm sure if they did there would be deafening noise about overreach. I'm sure that there could be some productive changes made to the CFPB, but as is a theme among the GOP these days, all they want to do is negate every regulation made since 2008 out of spite--or at least that's what it seems like to me. This bill goes way too far in the opposite direction and is a danger to the economy--particularly among those of us who chose to leave big banks for smaller banks, who now have carte blanche to gamble in order to ""compete"" with the big guys. Looks to me like a strategy to discredit smaller banks in the end."
