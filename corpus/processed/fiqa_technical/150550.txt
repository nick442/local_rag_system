"You completely missed the point. There _are_ healthier options available today, so you're assuming people buy unhealthy processed foods simply because they want to (or are uninformed), neither of which l believe is the case for a majority of families that make up their main demographic. For the single mom raising two kids on a modest (and yet still firmly ""middle class"") salary, it's already difficult enough to make ends meet. She doesn't buy organic simply because she doesn't want to, but _because she can't afford to_. Eliminating the cheap processed foods may be a good thing overall and longer term for society, but you're just going to make her situation even worse."
