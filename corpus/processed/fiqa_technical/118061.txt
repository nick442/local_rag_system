I did read a bit of current economics before commenting on the this topic. Name of the countries do not matter - from what I see I have referred to them quite clearly. Maybe I hit the truth chord somewhere there hence your off-bitter mark. It is nothing to do with economics and more politics (read ego and power play) than anything else. Of course, Truth always sucks.
