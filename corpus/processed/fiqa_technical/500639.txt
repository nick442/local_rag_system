"That a threat? I'm happy to show you my qualifications.MBA + CFA. You have provided ZERO backup..you keep insisting that I must be in the wrong (plus all those that downvote citing that they are retards and probably garbage men). You don't like being challenged. You have provided exactly ZERO support for your bold claims citing an immeasurable ""get in touch with current trends"" - which is the equivalent of ""JUST GOOGLE IT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE"" because you are in fact unable to support your position through objective evidence. I also believe you are the one that has resorted to name calling..not the other way around. People get them after they gain experience..which is then what helps them stand out..no where did I ever suggest not to get one, I'm attacking your advice of going right after undergrad and have zero experience. Wonder what the people over at r/MBA would have to say about it or the countless number of recruiters or the countless number of hiring managers. You are setting this kid up for disappointment."
