"I tried to read a couple of articles, most are behind a paywall. Hopefully you'll forgive me for thinking the whole page looked like a bunch of corporate propaganda- an entire page of ""here's why everyone is wrong about us"" with formatting from the early 2010s. Maybe you can walk me through this. You've got thousands of mathematicians and engineers who could be designing something useful instead spending time accomplishing nothing except for fractionally beating each other at trading ""paper"" assets. Similarly you have construction crews that could be expanding internet capability, instead laying cable some guys can signal trades sooner than other guys. The positions HFTs hold are so short, they can't possibly be benefiting from the actual overall change in value of the underlying assets, which happens over the course of months, not microseconds. So the only possible returns come from ""taking"" someone else's value. I'm not making a moral judgement, here I'm pointing out that there's no net benefits to society."
