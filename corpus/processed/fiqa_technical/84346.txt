Prison in the US has nothing to do with an economic context. White collar crimes will always be sentenced less harshly than violent crimes. I don't expect to see Madoff on the street anytime soon. So the original premise doesn't hold across the board. The system is fucked up though. What can you do. People like Corzine are ingrained in our government and financial institutions.
