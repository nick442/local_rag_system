Well people aren't going to travel across the country to a casino. The issue though is that Pennsylvania in paricular created new ones that are stealing business from AC. New Jersey has legalized onlline gambling to try to give them an edge to avoid bankruptcy. that is helping slightly and expected to help some break even by the end of the year. However, I seriously doubt a large number will survive. Three will have closed by the end of the year as it is.
