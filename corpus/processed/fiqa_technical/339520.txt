"Not going to pretend to know what any of that actually means mate, haha! But if it involves Brownian Motion/Ito then you might find something relatable in that paper. Plenty of stuff outside that, but most not as ""mathematically clean"" (ie will involve hacks to fit observed data), or on the flipside closer to philosophical stuff like Mandelbrot and (sigh) Taleb, who more or less do a great job of explaining why the gospel models are all crap (which is reasonable), and that real world markets can't be bunged into a nice cookie-cutter model."
