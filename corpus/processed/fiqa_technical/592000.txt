"Organic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers are often just as dangerous as their inorganic counterparts. Some organic farms operate with only safe practices, but unless you're buying directly from a farm you know, there is no way to be sure. Before you even get to the ""organic is better for you"" argument, you have to get past ""what kind of organic is this"". The label alone doesn't mean much as far as safety or being ""pasture raised""."
