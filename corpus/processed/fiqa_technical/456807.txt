"No its not what's happening because trump is cutting federal support which was defined when the ACA was passed. He is actively trying to raise premiums so it will fail. This is a fact. Why on earth would I think that? Hmm could it be.. - effectively de funding the ACA to cause premiums to skyrocket that Americans can't afford so that you all can claim ""Obamacare failed""? - pushing a ""repeal now, replace later"" agenda which would have an immediate and dramatic impact on the well being of millions? - consistently wanting to remove the pre existing conditions clause / replace it with something which has been proven to be dangerous and ineffective (high risk pools) There's nothing dramatic about it. I'm dealing in the world of facts. I'm not sure where you're getting your information from. Probably Russia? Idk"
