[it was 15 to 1 before the SEC decided that big banks needed to be able to risk more.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_capital_rule) it also started teh distrust between banks. With 15 to 1 you were pretty sure that another bank you were dealing with was leveraged exactly 15 to 1. WHen he removed that requirement, then banks had a much harder time judging the health of other banks they were dealing with. you just didnt know if they were 20 to 1 or 30 to 1 or higher, without going through all their books. This was one of the main reasons the recession was so large in scope. Housing would have exploded eventually, but without the leverage regulations they were able to make it hurt far far far far far far worse. several times worse.
