">A bee can live outside of the hive. If I destroy the hive, the bee survives. No, it doesn't. It dies within a day or so. Go ask any beekeeper. >Name me one accomplishment that man, on his own, can do that would surpass what man, together, have done. You miss the points I am making entirely (you have to let go of your dogmatic mindset -- I mean do you WANT a conversation here? Or just another typical Reddit ""pissing"" match?) The social interaction of humans is a ""middle of the road"" thing, with ditches on both sides. To little interaction & interdependence (the ""ditch"" to one side of the road) and yes, humans lead only a bare minimal ""survival"" existence (but unlike bees, humans CAN survive). Too much interdependence (the ditch on the opposite side) and human progress stagnates, and inevitably, invariably, the society implodes (Cf basically all of human history). Libertarians are generally pulling towards the one ditch; Socialists want to pull everyone into the other ditch."
