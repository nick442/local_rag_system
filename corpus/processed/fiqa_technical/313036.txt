Most big commercial brokerage houses are always hiring and more often than not you will be able to at least score an interview to work in their research/marketing department. Once in the door, it would be much easier to network from the inside as you get to know brokers and their teams. Companies like CBRE, HFF, Marcus & Millichap, JLL, Berkadia, & Cushman & Wakefield would all be good places to look. The fact you have some hospitality management experience is a plus. These company's are hungry for talent that show initiative and interest in the field. Lead with your strengths.
