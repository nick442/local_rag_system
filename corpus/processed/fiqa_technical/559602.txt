I don't agree he should be fired, but this was a huge fuck up by leadership. Google is already getting sued by women employees. They have a bad rep among women and even among some minorities. There were rumors Google didn't like conservatives, now they basically showed it. He is going to sue for wrongful termination. They're going to settle. Googles reputation has been hurt. There is talk of busting them up. This guy now has a growing twitter population and anti Google stuff is all over Silicon Valley and the internet. The thing is there were better options if they wanted to get rid of him. It was a very stupid business decision.
