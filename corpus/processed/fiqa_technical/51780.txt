To be fair early in my career I did request significant raises as the job duties expanded. I provided justification and showed that I was worth it, the company agreed. My company is also in a growth phase so it made sense to them. So you may want to consider a jump or two to maximize your base salary. However if you are happy somewhere, and they company is happy with you, you may want to just speak to your manager and find out what your options are. Do some homework on the market for someone in your position and show just cause.
