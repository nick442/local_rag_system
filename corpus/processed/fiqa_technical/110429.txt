So yes, changing the industry this dramaticallyAnd that would be great if they could get a car in they sub 20k class, and assuming the government continued to give energy credits for ev. Trump could shut that down (although why pick a fight with US auto makers?) That said, the point of these announcements is to set the stage for infrastructure. Let the oil companies know that in 10 years they will lose half their auto market, so they need to migrate their investments to fleet and jet fuels, chemicals and power generation, diversify assets and investments, etc. Sucks but definitely survivable, but yes, they will fight so 2023 will be more like 2033. Next of course is electronic filling stations, which is where the oil companies really need to invest in, as well as gain investment in the power grid (which will also need to be ramped up, especially in rural areas, many of which were not even prepared for air conditioning in all residences). and of course you have battery technology, which requires lithium and other rare earth metals (or ideally new organic based alternatives) and the concerns with crash/explosion/fire and toxic spills.. Gas is the devil we know, batteries on a mammoth scale and the environmental impact with the number of serious crashes we have.. So yes, don't get excited about what they are gonna do, but understand the implications of such an announcement.
