> This allows companies like FedEx ground to not have to show an IT cost. 1) Doesn't the cost show up for the parent company? 2) Are the increased profits mostly due to tax savings? So, 3) If say, taco bell losses a little money while kfc makes a killing, parent company yum brands still gets a tax saving on its taco bell division even though over all the parent company did quite well? 4) Thanks for explaining this stuff by the way. Very interesting.
