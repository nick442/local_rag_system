"Why does the yield go up if the country is economically unstable? The yield will rise when instability increases because the risk of default increases. If the case of Greece, the instability of government finances resulted in a 50% ""haircut"" for bond holders in 2011. In other words, bond holders suffered a 50% write down in the nominal value of their bonds. This means that holding these bonds until maturity will mean they will only receive half of the original nominal value of the bond, and that is assuming no further write downs occur. Why does selling a bond drive up the yield? Significant selling of bonds means that sellers are worried about future prospects. Sellers will outnumber buyers, so sellers will have to reduce their offer price in order to attract new buyers. So if you think Greece is not going to default as it's highly likely a country would completely default, wouldn't it make sense to hold onto the bonds? If you think that it is highly unlikely that Greece will default and the prices and yields are attractive, then Greek bonds may look like an attractive investment. However, keep in mind the fate of bond holders in 2011. They were attracted to Greek bonds by the price and yield, but they suffered a 50% haircut."
