"Corporations aren't required to uphold your civil rights. A business can kick you out for hate speech, for any speech, or for carrying a gun, or whatever other reason they want. They can't do it on the basis of inclusion in a protected class, and I'm fine with that being the line. Who said I want to start a fight with you? I merely responded to your points. Corporations should be able to ""oppress"" as much as they want except against people in a protected class based on their inclusion in that class. (Ie, if you don't want to bake a gay wedding cake for John because he's gay, that's not okay. If you don't want to bake a gay wedding cake for John because he's being a dick to your staff, that's fine.)"
