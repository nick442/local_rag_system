They're not fully opposing SOPA, that's an error in the title of this post. They still assert that SOPA is an attempt to fix something that's broken, their problem (according to the press releases) seems to be with some of the minutae in the bill. While they've backed down somewhat, it's just not accurate to say they're in 'full SOPA opposition'.
