"Yes, some of my family actually worked at Arthur Anderson (thankfully they were able to jump-ship before the whole fiasco). You make some good points, but from my personal experience and conversations (family working at Big 4 and another a partner at a regional firm), it seems that accounting firms will go to great lengths to keep their big clients. I've also heard that they are extremely reluctant to give unqualified opinions, much like analysts are reluctant to issue ""sell"" ratings. I know this is completely anecdotal, but I think it makes sense given the incentive structure."
