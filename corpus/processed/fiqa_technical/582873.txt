"The office = the entire floor or shared space. It's a common term used by Americans to describe their company as a whole. Ie; ""I have to be in the office for meetings tomorrow, I can't work from home"" No offices = personal private offices within ""the office"" (above). Ie; ""I have a corner office with a view which is nice for conducting private matters with new clients"" Kinda confusing how they mean different things for the same word."
