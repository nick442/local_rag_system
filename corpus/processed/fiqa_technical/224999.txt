"You're missing the point. A ""skilled"" adult (however you want to define that) shouldn't have to compete with a teeneger. But I get it. Econ 101 supply and demand. The problem is ""economists"" are now saying that the supply side is the only one that maters and that if you just pump up supply demand will follow and thus we now have flippant idoitic policy! Resolve THAT. Please."
