"I don't recommend balance transfers. Like many credit card things, they distract you with shiny (""0 percent interest!"") and ream you on a 'balance transfer fee'. If you have a decent credit score and working relationship, talk to banks about opening what's called a 'signature loan,' and use that to shift the debt to a lower rate. A local credit union advertises rates 'as low as' 9.75 percent. Which is itself a shiny that you may not qualify for. The really low loans rates you see are secured loans; if you don't pay, they can take the collateral."
