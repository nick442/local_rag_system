Second time this has come up this week, but I'd recommend spending a bit of time test-driving [FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com). It might take a bit of time to set up the way you want to use it, but you should be able to figure out whether it'll meet your needs with about 3 or 4 hours of focused testing. Their support people are awesome, too: they can help you figure out which way's up, and I can tell you from experience: they like having happy customers, so they won't try to sell you something that's not really a good fit for your business.
