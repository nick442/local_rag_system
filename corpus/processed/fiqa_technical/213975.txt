>means less demand for absurdly priced homes which means prices will drop to affordable levels. Rent and home prices are obviously variable but in my area home prices are pretty aligned with rents. Assuming both home prices and rent goes up with inflation and accounting for insurance, taxes, tax advantages, maintenance and a list of other issues the prices are comparable. If you have the capital for a down payment and plan to stay in one house (or aparment) for 5 years you are probably better off buying. To say home prices are absurd you need to be comparing it to what you consider it's true worth but how are you determining that? Edit: Perhaps both rent and home prices will go down as more people live with their parents and room mates but I haven't seen that trend start yet and vacancy rates aren't that high (as far as I know) so I don't see it starting soon. If that trend did start I imagine new construction would be the first ones to go but housing developments are going strong around me.
