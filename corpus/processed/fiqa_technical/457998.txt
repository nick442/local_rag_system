Congrats! :) And yes, I have never personally seen a rich person criticize RDPD - they know the book is solid, and plus they're too busy enjoying their success. On the other hand, someone who failed now has plenty of free time and an incentive to point fingers at others. Little do they know that if they spent less time complaining and criticizing and more time trying to succeed over and over and over, eventually they too would become too successful to waste their time blaming others. :-)
