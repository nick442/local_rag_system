Oh it definitely makes sense on a state level and from my experience working taxes I would say it is much more prevalent to the extent I would have to bet every Fortune 1000 company does it. You can completely eliminate State Income Tax in many states (although states are rapidly closing the loopholes) which at corporate tax rates for most states between 6 and 8% this turns into a lot of money.
