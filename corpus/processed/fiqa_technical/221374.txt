If I have an iPhone for work purposes only (paid for by IBM through voucher or whatever) then I don't give a fuck what they tell me to do. If all I can do is run the phone app then fine, it's their money, I can always get my own phone. But if I have my own iPhone and I volunteer to use it (instead of being out of communication from 5pm - 8am) and they turn around and tell me that a device that I bought and use for personal reasons is limited to whatever they decide to allow me to use, well forget that. Edit: Also, this article points out that IBM is behind the times again. It blows my mind that a technology company didn't have a well thought out and communicate an external technology policy prohibiting the use of software like dropbox or gmail for work stuff. Really the policy hasn't been updated in 2 years? Did it only cover MegaUpload before? And now the cats out of the bag so they have to be heavy handed in their approach. I can also see why some of the outrage exists over the 'no cloud but ours'. Having been forced to work in a LotusNotes and Sametime office I can only imagine how awful IBMs corporate cloud offering is. You probably need a TN3270 emulator to access your files :D
