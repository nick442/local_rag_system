What are you complaining about? Do you want ILLEGAL alien workers to work as slaves for less-than-minimum pay to pick the crops? That the USA does not issue temporary visas for migrant workers to come in fields? That farmers do not pay enough for people to work in the fields, except slave migrants? That Americans rather be on welfare than work in the fields? That the welfare system pays able-bodied people too lazy to work in the fields? What exactly do you propose to do?
