The two things are materially different. Point number 1. With a credit card, the bank (and card network) earn a fee every time you spend on your card. You swipe a $100 dinner, the credit card company makes about $3. You pay it back, they may not make any interest but they've made their $3. Additionally, if you have a $1,000,000 credit limit, you've only actually borrowed $100; which brings me to point number 2. Point number 2. A credit limit of $X is not in any way the same as a loan for $X. When you seek a personal loan, the lender hands you money in equal amount to your loan, less any origination fees that may apply. Your loan for $8,000 results in $8,000 being wired to your account. Your credit limit is only a loan when you actually charge something. Until then its a simple (adjustable) risk limit set by the bank's underwriters. Point number 3. Your credit report contains no income information. It's up to the lender to determine what sort of risk they're willing to take. Some personal lenders are just fine with stated income and employer contact information. Some lenders want to see some pay-stubs. Some lenders will lend $X on stated income but won't lend $X+1 without income verification. Some will lend the money at a lower interest rate if you do prove your income and employment. It's all lender specific. Credit card issuers are clearly lax on the income verification piece of the equation because of points number 1 and 2. Point number 4. If you're getting a loan for your required mortgage down-payment you are a much bigger repayment risk than you realize.
