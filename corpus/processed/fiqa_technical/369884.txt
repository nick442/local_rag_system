They aren't too big to fail. They are in the process of failing right now and have been for the past 2 years. If something doesn't change they are going to be bankrupt very soon. I don't know much about Instagram as I've never used it but I imagine they aren't making money either if all they're doing is hosting images for free. However they probably have some kind of premium plans with more storage options that keeps them afloat. A media storing service can sell that, micro-blogging is worthless tho.
