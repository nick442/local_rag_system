"Ironically, the financially disadvantaged (who are butthurt downvoting you so hard right now) also tend to believe in luck when it comes to lottery tickets and other forms of gambling. They would, on the whole, find themselves far more ""lucky"" if they could stop spending what money they have on gambling, drugs, cigarettes and alcohol. Every single one of my unemployed friends eats out *every day*, smokes cigarettes and drinks at the bar on Friday and Saturday nights. Most smoke weed, too. Funny how that works out. I've also noticed a prevailing attitude among my peers that getting a good job equals ""I don't have to work any more!"" So many of them who are ""lucky"" enough to get a good job end up losing it a short while later. Shitty ""luck."""
