"Sure, but it doesn't revolve around facebook or reddit, it doesn't revolve around twitter or snapchat or instagram stories... the truth is all of these ""techies"" generally don't actually know a thing themselves about coding or computers, they just know how to touch screens and get results from algorithms the rich created. That skill of doing basically nothing replaced a ton of real human capital that got things done."
