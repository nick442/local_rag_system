You still haven't explained it. I'm actually a theoretical physicist and many things (in fact, many more than in the financial world) can be done with pen and paper. Also, I have a friend who works in risks management for a bank and the things he describes can't be done with pencil and paper. Everyone in his department uses either matlab or C. Not a single person uses spreadsheets. So unless you can give me a specific example of anything meaningful that in this day and age can be done with spreadsheets, you haven't contributed anything to a conversation that had nothing to do with you.
