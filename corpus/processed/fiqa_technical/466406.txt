Exactly, accounting for fat tails would already hugely improve the models. Something like a fractal distribution as argued by Taleb and Mandelbrot would be a step in the right direction. Sadly using those models would undoubtedly identify (correctly) that banks have much more value at risk than they now estimate, so that basically it won't happen, because it would be costly for the bank.
