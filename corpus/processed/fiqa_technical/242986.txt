"Apple's share of the US smartphone market is 34%. It is consistently #1 or 2 in most markets, shy of Asia that has super competitive smartphone options. Apple is also sitting on stacks, and stacks, and yet more stacks of cash. Believe me, I love Tesla and hope to see them do well. At this point they are riddled with debt, yet to turn a profit, have a paltry market share and are leveraging all of this yet again with another round of debt funding. Their entire business model is built on government subsidies. Sorry, Tesla hasn't proven a damn thing in terms of establishing them as an automotive power and they have a LONG way to go. Neat ideas, pretty good execution, but seriously enough with saying we should just ""make new metrics"" for a company because they continually under-perform."
