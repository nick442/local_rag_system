And how are these people supposed to get out of poverty when all their jobs are being shipped to China by wealthy businessmen tired of paying living wages here in America? Also, trying to blame Obama for something that's completely controlled by congress is tiresome. This country makes me sick lately. Anyone who's ever been poor knows what a horrible trap it is, and how hard to escape it is. They need all the help they can get.
