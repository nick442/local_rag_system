Rich people do have money just lying around. Give a rich person money and it will, what? Go into savings of some sort. The wealthy ideally put their money into rent-creating things, which is awesome for them and less awesome for the rest of us, as it gives them money without producing anythig else for the rest of us. The ultimate rentier is someone like Mitt Romney, that stripped corporations of their assets and stripped future pensioners of their pensions all to put money in his and his investors' pockets. All these cool bubbles, also driven by too large of pools of money lying around. Currently, we're witnessing the popping of the latest oil bubble. But, commodity speculation of all types has been something of a major problem lately because of exactly this. Too much money in too few hands.
