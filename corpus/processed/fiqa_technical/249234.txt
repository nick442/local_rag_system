No. Consider any professional sports team. Just because a salary seems large doesn't mean it's large enough. Especially when you look at the financials of the companies involved. Are google, microsoft and apple hurting for capital? Is there not enough venture capital to sufficiently seed new business development? Don't shakedown other less profitable industries to subsidize industries that are overflowing with cash. That's a big part of the problem in America's economy. Taking money from everyone to give it to preferred industries, that in many cases don't need it.
