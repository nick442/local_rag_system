ZeroHedge is the best, although it appeals to a particular audience (highly educated economics/business folks with a very negative view of government). They pull articles from all over the web, so you get a really good aggregator with maybe 20 articles/day of high quality work. Bloomberg I read if there's a good topic. That pops up on facebook for me and I read probably 10/day. Wall Street Journal is great if you want mainstream (read: delayed) business news. Most of the things that are truly news are long-term in nature and you'd read about them on ZeroHedge far before the WSJ. I used to read Dealbook a lot, although I've gotten away from it lately due to the lack of mergers & acquisitions activity. Lastly, I used to have a blogroll of maybe 5-10 investment blogs with truly great writers/thinkers, but alas, most have stopped writing now. sorry about the delay. forgot I saw your question.
