I would prioritize paying off the heloc first. Paying off the heloc has a guaranteed rate of return and will reduce the size of savings cushion you'll need in the future. However, you shouldn't assume your heloc funds will remain available indefinitely. If you read your fine print, you are not guaranteed access to your unused credit by the bank. If you lose your job or your home value significantly declines, the bank could refuse to let you take more money out on your heloc. Recently, I've seen people's available credit be reset to 0 on open helocs by banks trying to reduce their exposure. Planning on the future of available credit via a heloc is not a good safety net.
