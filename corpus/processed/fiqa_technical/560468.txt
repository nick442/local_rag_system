"Businesses need websites. Especially businesses in the labor field -- when we renovated our old home, the very first place we checked was Google. ""Colorado Springs plumbers""; ""Colorado Springs electrician"" -- I was shocked at how few actually had websites. It's worth the money for a simple, but informative site with contact info, prices, etc. Oh, and also, social media. Get on the Twitter! And everywhere else online that people are gathering."
