If you do it on your own, it doesn't mean you'll be able to create a commercially viable product. It takes a lot of capital to create systems, technology, and business models to help you with your start up. You need resources such as talent and software applications to help build your business. These help you compete with established corporations and competitors to differentiate your product from the rest. It's not easy and so what if VCs own a part of of your business. That's for insurance reasons when te business fails and assets are needed to counter the investment liability. You still get control of your start up and the product your offering.
