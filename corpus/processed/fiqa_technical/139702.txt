This website is dedicated to shitting on him, justified or not. The politics subs will upvote anything as long as it talks trash about the guy, including defensible decisions and stuff thats just made up whole-cloth. There are multiple subs dedicated solely to trying to find dirt on him. At some point he turned into reddits white whale. No real dirt so theyve settled for a steady drumbeat of negative op-eds as a substitute. Sorry you missed the pattern but it looks like you fell for it. And in the process you sacrified both credibilty and anyones obligation to take your claims without evidence. Since your grand contribution to this thread seems to be lashing out at people and insulting them in lieu of any kind of reasoning, its especially dubious that anyone should take what you say seriously.
