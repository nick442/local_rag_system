"Everything I have read here sounds good except for one small detail. My bank does indeed identify ATM rebates as taxable income. They, in fact, seemed to have begun this practice several years ago but somehow forgot to send 1099's to their own customers despite sending them to the IRS. This ended up costing me nearly $2,000 in back taxes to cover 2012, 2013 and 2014. My bank sent a letter of apology and will cover any penalties and interest accrued ""due to their error"". No one from the bank ever told me that these rebates could be taxable when I signed on for this special checking account for which I pay a fee each month to continue. So what is the truth, is it taxable income or not? I have now paid for the 2012 and 2013 tax years for something I still say is not income. I am about to pay the 2014 tax bill and will have to pay another $850 or so due to this ruling by my bank. How can this be right??"
