"Take as many practice exams as possible. Get used to testing your sanity, sitting for an extended period of time. I just passed last month using Kaplan. The class instructor will give you tips. Remember them and practice writing down your ""dump sheet."" Which is any formulas or diagrams that might help you. I included the bond inverse relationship, the options chart, and balance sheet. When I took the test there were a ton of questions on bonds, options and annuities. Though yours could be very different. I didn't have too much math. Most importantly, focus on the actual concepts more so than memorizing the correct answers to the practice tests. Maybe check out Series 7 for Dummies. It helped me understand options overnight. Relax, you got this."
