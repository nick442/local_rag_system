"I'm in a similar situation, but I live in a state that doesn't allow mortgagees to ""walk away"" without recourse. I would consider a short sale or otherwise abandoning the property if: At the end of the day, real estate is an investment, and you don't realize gains or losses until you close the position. The ""ra, ra"" crowd that thought that real estate was going to boom forever in 2006 was just as wrong as the ""bad news bears"" crowd that thinks that real estate will never recover either. Investments rise and fall. Many people who bought houses in the 1980's boom (recall the S&L crisis) were underwater for years until prices started rising in the mid-90's. You haven't lost money until you realize that loss."
