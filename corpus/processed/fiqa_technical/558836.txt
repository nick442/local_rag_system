"Let's imagine an economy where 100% of wealth creation comes from existing financial assets and 0% comes from new wealth creation. That would essentially be a dead economy. I don't think it matters what your philosophy on economics is--that's a bad outcome. If you don't agree with that point we'll stop here. Note, if you don't think it's bad for this to keep going higher, Japan is at about 80% and we know how they're doing. If you agree 100% would be bad then we're 70% of the way there in the US. Trump's tax plan, if enacted, would push us even further. The question we should be asking is what is a reasonable way to encourage NEW wealth creation rather than protect and preserve existing wealth. For starters, it makes little sense to have a preferential tax rate for capital gains/dividends/estates as compared to earned income. Even if you just hate taxes and want them all to be gone I think it's fairly easy to say IF we're going to have taxes they should not favor income/transfer from existing financial assets as compared to earned income. A much more reasonable way to approach this is to say, we have a lot of concentration of financial assets in the top decile of wealth spectrum. Let's just level the tax rate so that income from financial assets is taxes at a similar rate to income from work. That's not even an ""eat the rich"" proposal, it's just a ""eat everyone equally"" proposal. All it would do is tax the very substantial gains in stocks at the same rate as the very meagre (median) gains from working. The fact that taxing income from financial assets at the same rate as work is a controversial idea is, to me, emblematic of a government completely captured by wealthy interests."
