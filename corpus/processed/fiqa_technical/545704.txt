"I don't know much beyond super simple HTML, so I can't give too much specific advice about which languages to learn, but I would suggest looking at the kind of jobs that interest you and seeing what the requirements are. I know Ruby on Rails is used a lot at my current company, and I would guess that you can't go wrong with Javascript, though I'm sure there are other subreddits where you could get better advice. I personally enjoyed going through a few courses at Codeacademy.com. As far as Excel goes, if you get a really good grasp of vlookups and pivot tables, that will put you ahead of most people that use Excel regularly. Also macros can be fun, and can make you a lot of friends if you can automate repetitive tasks that you and your coworkers have to do. ""Saved 2 hours per week by automating routine tasks in Excel and trained 4 coworkers to do the same"" looks pretty good on a resume."
