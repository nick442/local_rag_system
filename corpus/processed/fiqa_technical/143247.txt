">But I also believe that if you had a ""full equalizer day"" and redistributed all the wealth in the US so that each of us had the same amount of money (we'd each roughly have $255,000 if my math is correct), then within 1 generation you'd already see a similar wealth distribution to what we have now. Most would consume more- rather than invest- and it would only be a temporary fix. This is what I am saying. >It's a rarity to find people advocating for changing the system that creates inequality (the Fed currently being the biggest perp) instead of simply trying to redistribute the results of that system. What would you change the Fed to? I'm arguing that it's more a fact of an economy than a fact of the current type of economy that economic inequality exists. You can do some things with cryptocurrency, potentially taking some of the middlemen out of the business, but that won't fundamentally change economic inequality. The people currently invested in banks will invest in other things. I think economics will equal out when the machines of production become cheaper. At some point, maybe every community can own their own production machines. Then, communism/anarchism (same thing) will return to the world."
