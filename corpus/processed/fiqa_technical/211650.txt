That's a completely false statement. You really should read something for yourself instead of parroting misinformation. Per the US Energy Information Administration's 2015 report, more than 50% of all subsidy money ($15 billion of just less than $30 billion) is for renewables while producing less than 15% of energy with solar accounting for a whopping 0.005% (rounded up). https://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/pdf/subsidy.pdf By contrast, liquid petroleum and coal received only ~$3.4 billion in subsidies produced 66% (rounded down) of energy. The moral of the story is: just because you want something to be true really badly doesn't mean it is.
