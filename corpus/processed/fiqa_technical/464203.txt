"I worked at a Best Buy for a summer. I worked in merch (basically I was a stock boy) and we ""sold"" something greater than 80% of the product if I remember correctly. People mostly don't want/need a person to help them. That said, even though I wasn't really supposed to talk to customers I still really enjoyed helping them. I even sent a few home to the internet to order basic computer hardware because our store prices were stupid expensive (50%-100% more than a similar product online). I wasn't ranked on how many stupid extended warranties I sold though because I was merch and not sales. That shit was stupid. Most of the products they sell at Best Buy are disposable. Even the more expensive items will probably last longer than is worth trying to get them fixed. But that shit gets pushed on employees and if they want to get raises they push it on customers. Margins are shit on lots of the stuff they sell though. Except car audio. Car audio has a massive mark-up."
