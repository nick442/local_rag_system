Corporations exist to generate profit and reduce risk for investors. This is a socially good and useful function that benefits us all. A corporation that didn't seek to lower its tax bill to the lowest legally allowed would be breaking the law. Rather than show up unannounced at random times and ransacking/pillaging whatever they could grab ahold of, governments have discovered (through trail and error) that having clear consistent rules about how much they demand nets them more revenue. Thus tax law and why it is important. Over time governments have used tax law for social engineering purposes, and as a mechanism for attempting to control their local economy. Because of this tax law has tended towards higher and higher complexity. Throw territorial rivalry into the mix and tax law can be also used as a sort of economic weapon. All of this yields a monstrously complex tax code, which mandates that businesses pay more and more attention to following it's arcane rules if they want to remain in business. 'Gaming the system' isn't morally wrong, it is what governments expect businesses to do, otherwise they wouldn't spend so much time setting up such complex rules for business to follow. I suspect that there will be public outcry for more rules, making the tax system even more complex, because evil businesses are attempting to follow the rules. In a sane world governments would step back, refrain from social and economic manipulation (which they have shown themselves to be incompetent at anyway) and create as simple a tax code as possible. So that the tax code is no longer where businesses seek to gain advantage, but rather focus their time and energy into creating better products/services (every dollar spent on tax-lawyers/accountants is a dollar not spent on making the business better). Creating more rules to punish people for following the rules is insanity.
