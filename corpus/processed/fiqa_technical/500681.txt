Honestly, with the hours, it all comes down to wording. While doing your degree, you had group projects right? Especially in micro/macro, marketing etc. That is leading and directing a team to get a finished project (the assignment) or anything you did as an intern. There are tons of resources as to how to properly articulate your hours. Checkout out USAjobs.gov and type in budget analyst, financial analyst and see where it takes you. Look for jobs that are for all US citizens because you won't fall into the other categories.
