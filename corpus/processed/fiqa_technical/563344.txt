This is where you're wrong. We have a very crappy labeling of what is in food products because of lobbyists for these industries. Sure, you say don't like it then don't buy it but when a company tells you something is made from 100% chicken and you only get 50%, they didn't lie or break the law. They started with 100% chicken and added 100% soy and what you ended up with is a 50% chicken and 50% soy. They claim it's made from 100% with extra ingredients but do not tell you at the time of purchase, or label it anywhere, you aren't buying 100% chicken.
