Dude, where do you live? Do you read the newspaper? Do you watch the news? Nothing in this country is done for our (consumers) benefit, especially not now with Trump in office. I love this country and it's my home, but we've been totally fucked for several generations by corporate lobbyists who push legislation that benefits companies, not people. I'll give you calorie counts on menus. That's for the benefit of the consumer.
