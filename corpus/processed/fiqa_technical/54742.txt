"and part of the point of this article is to get that kind of information out there, so that people can say ""oo well maybe that law is needed"" or ""oh I read that article on reddit and maybe I wont shop there"" not sure if anyone is claiming they are breaking the law. But it should also be noted that many very large businesses like costco and starbucks and ben and jerries, dont cut employee costs to the bone. And while what walmart is doing is legal, there is nothing wrong with calling them greedy pricks, when society has shown that businesses can succeed in american without being greedy pricks. otherwise I agree with your comment"
