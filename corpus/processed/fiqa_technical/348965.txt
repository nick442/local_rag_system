Its late for summers yeah, but I think SocGen are open now for off-cycle internships - the others will be open soon. I decided late into my masters that I wanted to do banking, so had to cold call botiques until one caved and is taking me for the summer while I do my thesis, so don't be afraid to cold call. WSO is also probably your best bet for help you'd actually recieve alot of feedback.
