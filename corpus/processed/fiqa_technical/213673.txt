"Opinions vary but I've always thought that an ""emergency fund"" is just that.. for emergencies.. NOT investment. While it ""hurts"" not to have your emergency money making more money.. its MORE IMPORTANT to have quick access to it. As long as the interest rate keeps up with the rate of inflation leave it alone. Fill up your emergency fund with 3-6 mos salary and then INVEST your money beyond that however you see fit. Dave Ramsey's ""Financial Peace University"" is a very good audiobook and I would recommend it to anyone asking questions such as this one."
