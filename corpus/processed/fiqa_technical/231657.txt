Zero ice breakers. When I go to these things, and there's an ice breaker, I internally roll my eyes and start playing with my phone or get up and leave if I can. If you have one hour, get to the point. That's not a lot of time, and don't waste their time. Being a CFO is next to impossible from a time management perspective, so don't wreck their day.
