Luck doesn't exist, any more than God or faeries. A full time class load at my university was 7-10 credit hours per semester. I averaged 25 credit hours and finished a 4 year program in 2. All while working 40+ hours a week at four part time jobs. My days began at 5:00 a.m. and ended well after 10:00 p.m., six days a week. I wouldn't have got the interview without *networking*, which for me involved joining a service club and serving as communications officer for a local professional association related to my industry. The president of the service club ended up being the stock broker of my future boss. The president of the professional association was in touch with the industry and was able to give me a lead on an internship weeks before it opened. Neither reference would have done me a damn bit of good if I hadn't *proven* to them that I was an outstanding candidate, something that's become obvious to me as I am now in the position to provide people with references myself. That's not luck, my intention at joining both organizations was to network and it's exactly what I did. If you're looking for a job and you aren't networking you're doing it wrong. EDIT: Oh man the butthurt on this thread is *sooooo* strong. **EDIT: SCUMBAG REDDIT. HATES RELIGION ALL DAY EVERY DAY, STILL BELIEVES IN LUCK**
