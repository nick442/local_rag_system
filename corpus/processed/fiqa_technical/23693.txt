No, it doesn't matter how powerful the machines are that do the mining. The system balances it out (increases the difficulty) so that one block is mined every 10 minutes, regardless of whether there's 500 miners in the world or 50 million, it will always be around 10 minutes (sometimes 9 and sometimes 11 though). And one block used to be 50BTC, but every 4 years this halves and so in 100 years the supply increase will be almost 0, miners will still get the transaction fees though. This means bitcoin is limited to a supply of less than 21 million. Which creates the scarcity. There's possibly a problem though. Quantum computing might not increase the supply but it could potentially decrypt the encryption, but if that happens the whole internet and digital world will be in trouble and not just bitcoin.
