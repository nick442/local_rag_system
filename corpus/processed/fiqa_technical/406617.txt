It is my perspective that white-majority nations seem to be 'nicer' than black-majority nations. But it isn't sufficient information to conclude that either: * Races are distinct and important or * Racial traits are reason that the 'niceness' of nations divide along racial lines. Your evidence cannot prove that one race is better at anything, it's just confirmation bias. Edit: just to be clear, it's a 'yes' answer.
