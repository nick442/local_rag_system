Yes! This has bothered me for years because it's really obvious on the level of small businesses. Any material/service cost goes up- ugh fine I guess we have to pay to stay in business... Can't find anyone to break their backs for $9/hr? They'll do literally anything rather than pay more. They will fuck up their business for years trying to find a way to pay the same labor costs.
