Whenever you're not sure, you can always contact the regulatory agency in the location of the lender and see if they are registered. Organizations that lend out money tend to get oversight and have reporting obligations. Reputable banks in the United States will be a member of the FDIC. However, without even looking anything up, I can already tell this is a scam. An actual lender would be required to identify who you are beyond a doubt (this is called KYC), and in addition would have to report your loan to some sort of tax authority. That means they must ask you for a tax identifier number of some kind, and would probably want your full date of birth instead of just your age.
