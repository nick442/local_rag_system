We've all seen Reddit do some amazing things. Is there a place that this can be cross-posted to? (I'm new, and using my phone). Somewhere that will get a little more front page attention than r/business I'm thinking get Florida residents to know about this. Reddit has changed the votes of politicians, changed the minds of large companies (go daddy), and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for pet causes out of sympathy. Surely we can help these folks. How hard can it be to get a small insurance company to lose its reputation and more importantly, a vast majority of its customers. If you didn't read the whole article, read it. If you're not pissed, I'd be surprised. Let's do it for what's right, for the little guy, for books > insurance companies. Help this family maintain what's theirs. Upvote, x-post, share, and stop this injustice. Nothing is impossible.
