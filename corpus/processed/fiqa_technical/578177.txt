I'm a Senior Engineer at the top tech company in the world.. I've been here since I graduated in 2010. I still cannot afford to buy a decent house in any neighborhood within 20 miles of my workplace. It's kind of disheartening imagining the kind of situation people who aren't as lucky as me job wise must be in.
