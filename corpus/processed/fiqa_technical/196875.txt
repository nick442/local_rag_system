I think you misunderstand me: the EITC is not objectionable. But reducing the taxation burden on low-income people, or reducing barriers to paying it out are something Republicans are just as opposed to as they are to increases in the minimum wage. Because they don't give a fuck about poor people. Leftists don't complain about the EITC being corporate welfare either. They might oppose it because it puts an undue administrative burden on poor workers. Whereas a minimum wage gives more money to poor people by giving them more money.
