I think PA is probably the biggest factor. All the older PA residents that used to go there just go to PA casinos. They don't care about the beach. If they want to go to a beach, they go to a nice beach. For most of the younger gamblers, the extra drive isn't worth the time to go to a slum with a shitty beach when you don't have to. Also did they say no smoking in NJ casinos? WTF that's just stupid. I don't smoke but i do love it when I gamble
