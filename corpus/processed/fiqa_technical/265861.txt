This answer applies only to corporation tax, not income tax. Different things, income tax is much higher. 12.5% is the low rate for corporation tax. The standard rate is 25%. Or if you're Apple 0%. Like many countries Ireland will only consider you eligible for the low rate of corporation tax if you (your Irish company) can demonstrably prove yourself resident in Ireland. This is more than just address, and you must be able to evidence that your staff work there, your directors are both European Economic Area citizens and have their board meetings in Ireland, and most importantly that they run the company from Ireland, etc. If you're a one man corporation, unless you want to live in Ireland, it's not going to work. Referring to the Irish government's website: The term 'residence' was not, until recently, defined in law. The general rule was that companies, whose 'central management and control' was exercised in the State, were treated as resident here. This rule or test emerged as a result of judicial decisions set down in case law. Factors to be taken into account in establishing where the company's central management and control lie include, for example, where the important questions of company policy are determined, where the majority of directors reside, where the negotiation of major contracts is undertaken and where the company's head office is located. Long story short: An Irish incorporated company is not treated as Irish resident for tax purposes if it is a 'relevant company' .. A Relevant Company is a company that .. is ultimately controlled by persons resident in the EU or in a country with which Ireland has concluded a double taxation treaty
