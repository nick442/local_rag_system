You will owe tax on all deductible contributions, and on any gains from those. You will not owe taxes on any non-deductible contribution, but on any gains from those. Non-deductible contributions are called 'basis', and this is tracked on form 8606. As you didn't get a tax break when you contributed them (that's why they are called non-deductable), you don't pay tax now; they came from already taxed money. Everything else is money that was so far tax-free, so you have to pay taxes on it when you roll it to a Roth. Note that if the filing of form 8606 was neglected in the past (needed for non-deductible contributions only), you hurt yourself, as you will effectively pay tax again on that money. You can file adjustements to your taxes for the last three years to correct this, though.
