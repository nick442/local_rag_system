I'd take a look at some graphs and chart the price of bitcoins and its value. You'll be surprised that it follows basically any other vehicle for money. There were several times where the price of bitcoin dropped drastically and ontop of that, there is a wide margin of error that could cost you your entire wallet with no equivalent to a FDIC insurance or possibility of government/federal intervention in the event of theft.
