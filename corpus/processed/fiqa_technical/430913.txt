gr33nss - Unfortunately, you are 100% correct. The way most companies avoid having to pay overtime is by putting you on salary. I try to stay focused on promotions and bonuses as a way to justify all the extra work hours above the typical 40-hour work week. It sounds like you'll have to put some extra hours in but it will reflect positively if you don't rush to get home as soon as your 8 hours/day are up. Just my two cents..
