It's not really a new idea, or even from this administration. Every time this is brought up, the crazies on the extreme ends of the political spectrum start losing their shit about government tracking, national ID, jack-booted thugs, and so on, and the idea gets quietly swept under a rug. Maybe this time, the crazies on the right will shut up and pretend it's a great idea 'cause Trump is involved? I'm not above using the crazies to get useful things done.
