"That's the point that has been routinely missed throughout the entirety of the ""uber/lyft is killing NYC taxis debate."" Before uber/lyft even entered the city the number of medallions were being artificially deflated, which caused the cost per medallion to sore, but also caused massive consolidation. Thereby most medallions in the city were owned by people who didn't drive and owned many medallions, thereby essentially acting no different than a technologically impaired Uber while competing in a government sanctioned oligopoly. Uber, for the most part, isn't killing these small time entrepreneurs in NYC, it's disrupting mid size LLCs that were previously without real competition."
