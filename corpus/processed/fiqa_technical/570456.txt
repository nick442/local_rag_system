I don't think it'll have too much impact on the businesses, beyond needing to upgrade card terminals. There is a large impact on the consumer: banks consider all transactions authorized by the chip and PIN to have been made by the cardholder; there is much less fraud protection, and chip and PIN is not infallible (a few flaws have been found in it, and it makes it possible for a mugger to verify that you have given them the correct PIN for the card in a readily-available handheld device).
