> if you went somewhat into debt, say $30k, for a major with good job prospects and a high salary, it will probably be a good decision. Which is exactly what I did, and it worked out very well for me. There is still the opportunity cost I mentioned though. The average person makes $30K out of high school, so that is more than a million dollars in opportunity costs if you go to school for four years instead of going to work. Far more than that if you can earn more than $30K, which there is a good chance you can if you have the talent to get into college. Additionally, if a career has good job prospects and high salaries, employers aren't really going to be concerned about your education save where the law mandates it (you cannot be a doctor without the education by law, for instance). It is the lack of capable workers that drives the salaries up and it is that same lack of capable workers that force employers to consider just about anyone. There may be an argument to be made that an education can help as a signal in jobs where competition of fierce, but that same competition will drive the market rate of the job way down, which doesn't exactly seem like a win to me. That's awesome that it worked out for you, I'm just not sure it should be considered a safe or even good investment. While the returns can be there in some cases, it seems like the stakes are pretty high.
