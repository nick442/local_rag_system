You don't work in the corporate world, do you? At least not in a place where decisions are made. > If they followed standard best practices and were hacked, then would you still want them put out of business? The answer to this is always yes. Someone has to be blamed. That person or persons is nailed to the wall. If they aren't, you are. > Should airlines fold if one of their planes crashes? Someone will take the blame, and that person or persons could be jailed. The corporations responsible would be sued into bankruptcy. In the real world, this translates to corporations shutting down and starting up under another name, or some combination such as firings, fines, etc. In corrupt areas, those fines may come in the form of lobbying. > Now if they were negligent, that's another story. You can read my other comment down the thread but shutting down Equifax is only going to hurt innocent people who had no say in the matter. Personally I don't think that is going to do the most good after the fact. You can't give a corporation immunity because you're afraid of hurting individuals who work for that corporation. The corporation is not afraid to hurt them, and that will only cause more harm as other corporations realize their power. A corporation exists for one and only one purpose. That is to make money. It's not to make a product. It's not to employ people. It's not to change the world. It's to make money for itself and its shareholders. The minute you let something like this slide, you've suddenly lost power with every single corporation out there. Everyone will do it because it's now more profitable than not. Those that don't cut this corner will not be able to compete. Heads must roll on something this large or you're going to hurt every citizen of your nation.
