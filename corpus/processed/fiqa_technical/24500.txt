Because nothing ever is so simple. There is a lot we don't know and its a learning process. I will never blindly assume something is true because it seems true or it is convenient for it to be true. I hear your kind of argument from politicians all the time, just because something is true for them they assume it should be true for everyone. That's why we have doctors, researchers and engineers and economists, they tell you stuff you might not know. So you can either rub a leaf on your stomach for your illness or you can take the pill scientists worked on for years..same argument. I don't assume to know everything, when some one with more experience says something is not, I will consider it. Instead of blindly following my own beliefs.
