Exactly. Newer sets are both better and cheaper than in the past. The basic airport + airlplane set has doubled in pieces and slightly reduced in price, (when adjusted for inflation) since the 80'ies. The reason people think it's more expensive now is because now we are adults and paying for it ourselves. When we were kids our parents bought our LEGO and we had no concept of exactly how much money they were pouring into our toy collections.
