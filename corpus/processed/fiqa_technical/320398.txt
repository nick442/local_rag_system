>Again what you said is irrelevant. I literally explained to you why a certain individual might not be hired due to laws you proposed. That seems quite relevant. > People need to be able to provide for themselves. You're still not getting the point. If you imagine yourself as an employer and you're told you must pay a certain base wage, you will not hire certain individuals because those individuals do not merit that wage. The higher the wage you must pay, the more people you do not consider for the position because they lack the skills/experience/education for that wage. >I can google too. OK. What makes you think an individual that is unskilled, uneducated with no work experience will be hired for a job that pays $15/hr when that employer can find people that *are* skilled/educated/with work experience for that wage?
