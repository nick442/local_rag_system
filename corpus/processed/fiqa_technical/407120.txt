In the US .. In Europe we act as if workers are people not a commodity to be prices as low as possible. We remember one of the reasons states exist is to promote the welfare of its citizens. Which implies good medical care, plentiful paid vacation, maternity leave, etc. Humans are not there to serve Capitalism, but the other way around. The US definitely forgot this.
