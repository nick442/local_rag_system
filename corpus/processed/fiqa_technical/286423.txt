All the best to your sister's business. That being said, if she doesn't have a lot of these things (or at least a team that does) by now she may not want to open the restaurant just yet. There's lots of great cooks, but it's a different beast when they have to run the whole show. The success failure ratio for new restaurants is pretty staggering. Again though, best of luck to her. With hard work and proper marketing you can make it.
