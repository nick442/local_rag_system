It really depends on the tasks and how things are going. Well allocated work probably takes less than 40 hours a week most of the time, but might take a lot more than that sometimes. It really depends. Being in a really small company leaves little room for maneuvering, and then there is ambition. Do you really want to dominate your industry? Then there is the kind of work. Truly creative work might be so intense that it tops out around 20 hours a week and everything above that is chaff. That was what I meant by not fitting neatly into standard arrangements. It also has a lot to do what else there is in your life competing. It might be necessary to leave earlier than most to make time for afternoon activities or time with children. Defining desirable intervals outside work may be the most important part of knowing what work hours make sense. Ultimately it is necessary to understand that balancing work and life is complicated and may have no good answers. Sometimes work may be life and other times it may compete vigorously with good living. Simply saying anything over a standard 40 hour work week is too much might be a good place to draw the line, or that might be a way of avoiding really thinking through where you want to be since that arrangement is only going to be idea for a subset of people. Maybe for some 45 is the breaking point and for others 35 is right or maybe just winging it and leaving after a certain number of things are done is right. This emphasis on time drops away completely under Results Only Work Environment (ROWE) arrangements, but that leads directly to legal issues because we treat time as sacred no mater how much is spent at the desk or water cooler.
