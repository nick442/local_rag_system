Agree 100% with every post you made in this thread, with a caveat. The traditional internet consumer-advertiser-provider model is heading to an existential crisis. We have total information overload, most people don't even use facebook ads ONCE through their whole facebook career. Google the originator of the model has outgrown its adwords roots. I don't think we'll actually pay for shows, we're way too cheap to do that. But advertising is going to need to be revolutionized if it can maintain the status quo. Zergboss completely misses the point. It's not about computer screens vs. tv's. It's not tv vs internet. The fundamental conflict is in the changing revenue flow in shows and movies. I don't care for season premieres if hulu has them tomorrow when I have more time. Because these shows are paid for by advertisers, providers must change their source of revenue or come up with new ways to entice consumers
