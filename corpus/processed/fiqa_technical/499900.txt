It's probably too far gone at this point, and the world has moved on from their business model..that said, here's what I would do. 1.) Sears is going to go back to being a hardware store first and foremost. Craftsman tools used to enjoy a reputation as the premier brand of tools. Made in the U.S., highest quality you could get without spending 40 bucks on a pair of needle-nose pliers, wouldn't break for 3 generations, and if they did, you could take it back to Sears and walk out with a new one, no questions asked. We're going back to that. If nothing else, Sears is where you go for tools. No tools that are not made in the U.S., and nothing that isn't Craftsman unless absolutely necessary. 2.) Second to that is going to be appliances. I'd need a good team of analysts to tell me if it's remotely viable, but I'd like to adapt a little of the Craftsman mentality to appliances. Take your pick of any appliance at Sears, it will be of the highest quality, and if it breaks within X years, we'll have tech at your house in 24 hours to fix it, and you'll never see a bill. 4.) For everything else, we're going full Amazon, + local pickup. Free next day or same day delivery. Order your new wrench set from your phone, pull up to the store on your way home from work, and we'll drop the box in your trunk faster than McDonald's hands you your burgers. 5.) Our retail stores are going to get a complete overhaul. No more dingy shops with checkout computers from the early 90s. No more staff that looks and acts more beaten down than fast food workers. I want people working there who know the store and what it sells, and can at least pretend to be happy to help. Yes, I know I'll have to pay for it, that's fine. This place is supposed to sell the best tools available on a household budget, it shouldn't be a shittier shopping experience than fucking Harbor Freight.
