No..it is not. The markets are never certain. The price of oil often fluctuates and you have to take into account inflation. See the year 1980 here. http://inflationdata.com/inflation/inflation_rate/historical_oil_prices_table.asp At this moment, many analysts concur that the price has dropped because demand is not high. It is not because of a Global Financial Crisis. Political Trouble in Europe and current low demand and high stockpiles in the USA..yes.
