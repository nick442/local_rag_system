The right answer is use it, but use it responsibly. The point of the credit report is to prove to potential creditors that you are a responsible person who pays their bills on time. If you don't use the new credit card, you can't prove that. However, of course there is a limit. If you max out the card, you have only proven that you are irresponsible with credit. Try to stay around 50% of your max limit. More is O.K., but never go over 89%. Always pay your bills on time. Always. Not just this new credit card, but all bills. The best way to ruin your credit is not paying your bills. Even if you are having a dispute with a company, pay the bill anyway to save your credit and then dispute the situation and try to get your money back. Prove to creditors that they can trust you and you'll have an excellent credit score.
