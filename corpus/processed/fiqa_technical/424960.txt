Yeah, the party isn't going to last!.. People are going to stop eating and buying useless shit. They aren't going to live in houses and apartments, instead choosing to live off the land in mud-huts. Women aren't going to wear jewelry or get their hair done or buy fancy shoes any more. Just as men will stop buying fast cars and electronics..
