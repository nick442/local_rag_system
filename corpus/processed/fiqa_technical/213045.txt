It would be worthwhile reading into 'guarantor mortgages' or 'family offset mortgages' to achieve the same outcome. Ideally you are wanting the wealth of your parents to help make a mortgage more accessible to you. The first thought is to merely transfer money physically. However, for the reasons listed in the other posts, this carries potential problems. A guarantor mortgage will mean your parents agree to pay the portion about 75% LTV if you stop paying. You may take out a 95% LTV mortgage and therefore only have to find 5% deposit but benefit from the interest rates of a 75% loan. (Personally the chances of causing a family rift if things go pear-shaped would steer me away from this one. Each to their own though.) A family offset mortgage involves money rather than a guarantee. It will allow for the parents to dedicate some of their money to a third-party (ie. the bank or building society) so that you can achieve a mortgage. In practice, parents deposit money in a dedicated savings account. The bank adds that amount to whatever deposit you may have, and the combined amount is treated as the deposit towards the mortgage. Once your LTV reduces over time (by repayments and house value rises), your parents have their money returned and you carry on as normal. Here's an independent Which article: http://www.which.co.uk/money/mortgages-and-property/guides/first-time-buyer-mortgages/parent-mortgages/ I'd also read a couple of provider's pages to get a feel for the idea: https://www.barclays.co.uk/Mortgages/FamilySpringboardMortgage/P1242627640100 or http://www.scottishbs.co.uk/mortgages/guarantor-mortgage-for-first-time-buyers.html or http://www.mhbs.co.uk/family_deposit_mortgage_1_50_discount_for_term.aspx Not endorsements obviously, just a way to understand the concept and get a feel for the language they use. In short, using the money indirectly is much cleaner than your parents actually just giving you such a large sum and then you having to pay it back.
