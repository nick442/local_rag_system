Keep in mind there are some examples of combination medications that have improved outcomes. I'm thinking specifically of HIV meds, HEP C medications, and other combo meds for infectious disease. Truvada for example. It's one pill. Emtricitibine and tenofovir. Taken alone emtricitibine and tenofovir have complex and tedious pill regimens (like most other HIV meds regimens) but for patients to be able to take one pill, once a day has made their compliance with the med regimen much better. Lower viral load, higher cd4 counts, and improved management of their HIV. I'm not saying the absurd price hikes of these other meds are warranted. They're not. But when dealing with public health issues, and infectious disease in a population that has a difficult time being compliant with their meds, combo meds are worth the cost.
