Well, then, nice to meet you. I was offered a such a job. The hirer didn't even know what I get paid but was willing to offer that much more. I didn't take it and instead got a friend with similar skills hired. The job lasted 6 months and then the money ran out. Still very happy working a fun job with a great boss and friendly co-workers for the past 17 years.
