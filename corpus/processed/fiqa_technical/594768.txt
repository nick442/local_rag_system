Oh look YET ANOTHER POST ABOUT THIS. There have been probably around a half dozen posts about this start up that I have seen and I don't see everything that gets posted on Reddit. This particular article is about a month old and has been submitted [eight other times](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fthis-28-year-old-is-making-sure-credit-cards-wont-exist-in-the-next-few-years-2011-11). There are numerous other sources that have been linked too. This isn't going to kill credit cards. It isn't moving $350 million it is projected to reach that point. The amount of posts about Dwolla is at the level of spam.
