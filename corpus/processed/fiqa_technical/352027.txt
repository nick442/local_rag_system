If the car loan has 0% interest for 5 years, then paying off the student loan is cheaper. No matter when you pay off the car, you will pay the exact same amount (as long as its within 5 years). You could spend $20,000 right now to pay off the car loan or slowly spend $20,000 over the next 5 years. The gross amount paid for the car loan does not change. On the contrary, the longer you wait to pay off the student loans, the more you will end up paying for them. So why not get the student loans out of the way before they rack up more interest and pay the car loan over time? Update: I forgot to add, as Ben Miller said, congratulations on paying off the $40,000!
