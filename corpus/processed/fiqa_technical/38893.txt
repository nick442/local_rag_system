I had great difficulty buying my $17,000 truck for cash. One TD Canada Trust branch only let me have $5,000, the other branch down the street only $3,000. They both said they were low on cash. They kept trying to convince me to use a bank draft, but I didn't have a name or total amount as I was still shopping around. I don't think banks carry much cash and it wouldn't take much to clean them out.
