"I disagree. If nobody got their health insurance through their employer, then everyone would go out on the market and acquire them. This would create a more dynamic health insurance market which would, over time, drive down the cost of getting health insurance. I don't follow your logic about how ""wages wouldn't keep up"" 10 or 20 years down the road. If anything, not having to worry about benefits in a particular job would give employees more job mobility, causing the job market to be more competitive. In other words, it would be more likely to cause wages to up. Also, ancillary benefits of getting employers out of the health insurance/benefit dynamic would be to create more efficiencies within those businesses (reduce staff spent on coordinating plans and such), make small businesses more competitive (they are at a disadvantage now with regard to big companies with pools of employees), and get more people to acquire at least some form of insurance (health coverage goes up). I, for one, welcome a world in which our employers have absolutely nothing to do with our benefits choices and we choose them at our own discretion, just as I do with my car insurance."
