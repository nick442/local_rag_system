I agree, it's probably a good moment to buy. I like Chipotle but you gotta agree there is an elevated risk of contamination if you don't use any pesticides/herbicides/antiobiotics on your products. It can be managed but the risk is higher. I'll put that risk in my mouth and chew it up most times rather than eat at a lot of other resautrants.
