"If any one thing says ""big move,"" it's that' AAPL is approaching $100 (approximately a split and dividend adjusted all-time high). Stocks act weird around big numbers - but if you could count on just a few things in trading, it's that if AAPL moves past $100, it won't just move a couple more bucks - it will move convincingly higher."
