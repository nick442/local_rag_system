The standard customer is actually pretty satisified with BofA because he gets access to the large number of branches for free. But that money has to come from somewhere, that service isn't free. BofA gets it from those who are less responsible with their money. Alternatively, BofA can just charge everybody evenly across the board. Due to low interest rates, deposits are not very profitable, they cannot lower the interest on your savings account any more. Banks are actually losing money on most of their depositors because the stuff involved with maintaining an account costs money. That's why some banks are actively doing things to push some depositors away (some banks even charge you money to store money in the bank). Logically, it makes sense for me to bank at a place where the profits are not squeezed from me. So as someone who doesn't get hit with fees, I'm happy with BofA. That might sound weird, but logic dictates that I go to where I get the best value.
