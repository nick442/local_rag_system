"Ill give you two bits of advice.. 1. Word of mouth is the best marketing tool for this particular business. That's because people dont get excited about plumbing, rather they only need it when they have a problem. Providing the best customer service and following up months after your service was completed (letters, personalized e-mails, gifts, etc), will make your customers refer others. 3. Make sure your website is SEO friendly. When people need plumbing done, they will often do a google search as follows: ""Plumbing (Town, State)"", Let me know if you want to learn more about SEO and ill give you a few resources. Although it is an effective marketing technique it is also very easy to get scammed by so called ""SEO Professionals""."
