Right. Well drones are part 1 of 2 of their strategy. They drop off the shampoo and/or underwear you just ordered. That desk you bought is going to come via automated trucking with a guy in the back to drop it off at your door. Who knows what that looks like by 2030 when it's completely automated and a robot climbs out of the back, drops the box off at your door, climbs back in, and the truck drives off. This isn't science fiction, it's happening in real time.
