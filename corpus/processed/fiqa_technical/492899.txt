Person significantly over 40 here (me, 55). What. I like my work much better now than I did twenty years ago, and I'm able to successfully put more time into it. More, a lot of other things are less interesting to me - video games, trash TV - and really only work is satisfying. Of course, I'm very lucky to be in an interesting field (software) and lucky also to be (I perceive :-) ) at the top of my game.
