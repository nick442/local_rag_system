When all you have is a hammer.. It's not the marketers fault that the margins on their industry have been pushed to the point that cheesy planned obsolescence, 'value size' repackaging and other gimmicks are the go-to fads embraced by the product management teams. They've no choice but to polish and rack the consumer-mindset-exploiting turds they're paid to shill. What gets me is the generational divide in response to advertising. The older generation can't help but trust it it seems. Whereas, most younger folk I know simply cannot conceive why anyone would trust a product marketed to them- all the incentives seem fundamentally geared towards rip-off and exploitation. Why play a rigged game if you can avoid it?
