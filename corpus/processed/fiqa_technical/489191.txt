Wendy's never served bits of Tim, so this doesn't bode well. (According to Wikipedia I'm out of touch and Wendy's hasn't own Tim Hortons in quite a while, so maybe BK can serve Timbits.) I like BK, but every time I go to one I feel that the store is poorly run and the quality is garbage, although this may be a local problem. Tims, on the other hand, are spotless and have workers who always seem so professional. I'd hate for BK's culture to rub off on Tims, even if it means Timbits at BK.
