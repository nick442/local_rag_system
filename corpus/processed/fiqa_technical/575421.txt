I would consult a tax professional for specific help. On my own research, I believe that you could. I know that when I made payments when I was in school for my undergraduate, I made payments on the interest. I believe that I was even told by my financial aid office that I could deduct the interest that I paid. I made not much money so I wasn't anywhere close to the MAGI >75k, but I believe you still could. Not only that but one other thing to consider is that if you have an unsubisidized loan, the interest still accrues when you are in school. In that case, it might be better to make at least some payments. It would save you from the total loan amount ballooning so much while you are in school.
