This sounds to me like a very nice little job for a computer. This assumes that you have some experience of programming a computer, which I believe you do. A program like this does not require a lot of programming experience; a beginner in any simple scripting language could implement it, which is why I think it is a fairly general answer. You can set up a small simulation with either your real loans, or the examples you have given. Then have the computer work through the situation at a monthly time step until the debt is paid, and have it output all the interesting information per month. Then you set it up with your different payment scenarios: each paying proportionally, each paying their own debt separately, paying them in different orders etc. When you have these graphs, it should be possible to answer your main questions: The more information you add to this simulation, the more effective it gets. For example, I'm sure there are various tax deductions that you can make, depending on how much each of you pay, that depends on all sorts of things (location, income, age?).
