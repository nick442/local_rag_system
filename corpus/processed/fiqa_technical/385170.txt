"Not true. Replace ""Ivy League"" with ""target school,"" and you'll be far more accurate. When I started my BB front-office job, I had gone to a target school but not an Ivy League. Two other classmates attended target schools in the south, but far from Ivy league. One of those two is now one of Goldman's youngest partners. PS Don't count on starting in the back office and moving up - it's about as common as a blue lobster."
