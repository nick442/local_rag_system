I'm confused.. Berkshire is entirely independent from AIG. Are you saying that Berkshire would have gone bankrupt had AIG gone under? That doesn't make any sense.. AIG and Berkshire were performing the same function during the financial crisis - they were market makers for CDS/CDO's. AIG needed the money. Berkshire didn't. Please explain.
