But the US has a higher rate than any other OECD country. So you are still taxing profits from money that wasn't made in the US. Obviously way more complicated, but it's pretty insane. It can be even worse for an individual. Oh, and imagine you'd like to start a sole propietorship overseas as a US citizen. You either renounce or have insane compliance costs.
