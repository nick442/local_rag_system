We're in DotCom Bubble 2. Groupon's release is a great example that despite all the smoke surrounding these technology companies and all the analysts suggesting they're not worth these amounts, people are ready to buy it anyway. But keep in mind profits are made on these turds whether the price goes up OR down. Savvy investors know these stocks are shit. They'll make huge profits on the inevitable price decline after it goes public. Those are the guys you want managing your retirement funds and nest eggs. We've been down this path a decade ago and millions of investors choose to ignore it. Let them buy this garbage up. The smart will profit massively off those failures. They were warned before, they're warned now, so fuck 'em when they're wiped out. They earned it.
