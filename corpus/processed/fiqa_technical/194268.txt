â€¢According to this website: If NRI return to India with the intention of permanently residing in India, the assets brought by him will be exempt. Also, the money and the assets acquired from the money, brought by NRI within one year after his return, will be exempt. This exemption is available to NRI for a period of seven years after his return to India. [Sec. 5(1)(v)] I think you have got the essense. If you are returning for good, you can bring all your money earned outside of India into India tax free. The time period is 7 years. Post this whatever amount you bring in will be taxable. There is nothing specific in Indian Tax laws on the treatment to Retirement funds outside of India. If the amounts are large, its best if you consult a CA for advise.
