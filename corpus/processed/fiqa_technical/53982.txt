"I think you just sum up the program,..""TONS of smart people who simply lack the training ""..they lack the training because they just are not driven. In the age of the web and free content and courses for everything imaginable, why don't these ""TONS"" train themselves? contribute to F/OSS projects? sharpen their coding chops? They ain't 5 year olds to be spoon-fed by MS or any company. If you are not self-starter and not driven, you likely aren't suited for the hyper competitive world of software."
