I know that you're a recent college graduate who newly entered an MBA program, which means it's not a very good one. I know that you aspire to be in finance which, as a result of your poor choices regarding school, means that you will never be more than a ScottTrade broker. But as of right now you're just a student lying on the Internet about his portfolio, trying to feel like a finance big shot. I gave you an opportunity to prove you're not full of shit and you blew it, and somehow thought I wouldn't see right through it.
