To be fair the data in sports is more transparent. You know every single detail of every team, player, coach, owner, the regulation boards make sure that player trade deals have to be announced etc. I can't say I buy into the idea that big S&P500 firms are actually publishing accounting records that are 100% legit. Makes statistical analysis much easier when you have more faith in the numbers.
