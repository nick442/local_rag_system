> First off, there's the literal secret - the special alloy of copper, tin, and silver that gives the Zildjian cymbals their world-renowned sound. I'm curious - how could it still be such a secret? Couldn't you just, I dunno, buy one, melt it down, and test the alloy? Alternatively it seems like it would be easy enough to do a few hundred tests to narrow in on the specific ratios. Not the kind of thing someone would do in their basement overnight, but easily the kind of thing someone could spend a few million bucks to pull off.
