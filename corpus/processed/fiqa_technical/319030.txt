"Slightly higher wages (as paid by Costco, Starbucks, Ben&Jerry's, etc) only work for certain business models. This is like first year business school stuff, man. Walmart is what's called a ""low cost leader"", and their success is absolutely dependent on their ability to keep their costs low, so that their prices will be lower than all of their competition. Low prices are pretty much the only reason they are competitive. If they paid a higher wage, they would lose this advantage, and could eventually fail."
