What you are describing does not sound like an investment; it sounds like a loan. An investment involves you putting up a stake and sharing in the profits or losses of the business - there is no guarantee you will get your money back. A loan involves you putting up money for which you will receive interest and principal repayment in accordance with an agreed schedule - you get this irrespective of how the business is performing. Also, is the arrangement with your friend or his company? They are different legal entities and your risk profile is different in both cases. Whatever the arrangement you need to sign a contract which details all the terms and conditions - how much you will pay, to whom and when; how much you will get back, from whom and when; a method for resolving disputes; what happens in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy; what happens if someone breaks the terms of the contract; if your payout depends on the value of the business at some future date, how it is to be valued; etc. etc. Two points: I am not a lawyer, I am not your lawyer.
