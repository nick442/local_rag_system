We're going through this at my company right now. The billing/accounts receivable office near us has largely been automated and they are trying to find positions for all of the displaced employees. There are a few open positions in my office and if these employees can pass a skills test/interview, they will get to take one of our spots and stay with the company. If they are unable to pass the skills test (Excel and basic accounting concepts), they will be laid off. Some of these people have worked for our company for over 20 years but since they didn't bother to upgrade their skill sets over the years, many of them will be out of work. My coworkers think I'm crazy for continuing to obtain certifications and take classes but I'm thinking towards the future.
