"I like these charts but I wish they went back further to show when Obama took office. If you looked at the progression of these charts from when Obama came into office you would be forced to assume Obama was only just short of the messiah. That was a combination of luck and some decent policies and a *very* helpful Fed. Trump actually has a somewhat ""steady state"" economy to work with. We've been muddling along in the current economic milieu since about 2012. Where we go from here can, i think, be safely attributed to policies Trump enacts. Obama faced gridlock for so long that nothing got done after Obamacare."
