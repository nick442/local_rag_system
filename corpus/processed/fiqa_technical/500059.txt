OK to be upfront, I hate Bankerella too and think that post was quite idiotic of her. Considering that though, One of the top things any interviewer will/should consider is whether the want to work with the person they are interviewing. In this case, she simply gave the person a pass to the final round, she didn't actually give a job offer and didn't take any slots away from anyone else. The candidate is very likely to be the person working with her if she gets the job so of course she is going to choose a candidate based on personality.
