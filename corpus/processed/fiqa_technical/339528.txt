what's unrealistic? applying a DCF model to the two possible options? i didn't claim my description of the situation was comprehensive, didn't ask for input as to whether or not i was considering all possible factors. why couldn't i use a DCF for a personal choice? any why would i use a RFR if the undertaking requires a risk premium? (or at least doesn't have the same risk level)
