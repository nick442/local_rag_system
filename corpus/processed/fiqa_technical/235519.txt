I'm an old-school Cyberpunk and Shadowrun fan, so I start thinking in those terms, but for now, I'd settle for eyes that can see better than 20/20 and ears that can hear better than normal if I want to buy them. I have an eye disorder and what I have to go through to get 20/30 vision is fairly difficult for me, but I'm not bad enough that the doctors want to try any more-permanent solution, so I'm stuck with what I've got. If I could pay $20,000 and have a set of 20/15 eyeballs installed that never get old, I'd start saving up for them today.
