You're a god damn idiot. Anyone who actually read a little about the debt knows it doesn't even matter. Our debt shows a strong economy and dollar. It shows value and investment worthy. Anyone can buy treasury bonds. You. me.. apple.. you think our debt is at 20t because it's all we can get invested? Fuck no people are waiting in line to buy new treasury bonds. They're solid investments for people who don't want to worry about stock trading and know for a fact in 30 years they get their money and interest. But somehow you think the Jews were able to pool enough money to lend out 20t but not have the ability to increase the debt and lend out 5t a year and not 600b. Hah..
