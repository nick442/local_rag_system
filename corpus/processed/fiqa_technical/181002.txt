> You know whats more effective then drug tests at work? Intelligence testing. Not much of a reason to take the risk when we have an abundance of applicants in MOST fields. Maybe not the one the article talks about, but there is absolutely no reason to take that risk as a business. > Maybe calm yourself down and then stop to think about what would be more important at work, having a clean drug test or intelligence? You do realize there are people who are intelligent that don't smoke weed daily, right? And there are other factors like motivation and being happy. Weed smokers almost always lack motivation and wouldn't be smoking if they were truly happy There is no shortage of applicants in most fields. No need to hire these people and take an unnecessary risk.
