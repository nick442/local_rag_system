"In many ways their business model wasn't different than Keurig (and I'm sure that's how this was pitched: ""We're going to be the K-Pods of Juice and make Billions!""), it's just all timing and execution. If you look at any of the many YouTube teardowns of the Juicero it was pretty obvious that they were if anything _losing_ money on each juicer sale. The industrial design of the machine itself was executed in such a way that it was just incredibly expensive to manufacture. Beyond that we certainly seem to be in the midst of a large scale shift in eating habits. Where low carb diets were once pretty faddish, it's becoming more and more predominant and it doesn't get much more tall glass of carbs than juice."
