> One night I was invited to a dinner Who invited him? Isn't that important? What were the circumstances that led to him a) being invited and b) being the kind of person that would make the wife beg for her husband to hire him? If you choose to hang out with people that run in those kinds of circles, you're more than likely going to end up talking to some big wig. How is that luck?
