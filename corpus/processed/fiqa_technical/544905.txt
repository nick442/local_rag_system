Oh, completely the opposite. I am highlighting the government as a human entity which unappologetically wastes my money on wildly excessive and burdensome pension liabilities, employes people to take on no functional, need driven role, funds infrastructure projects with no public need, lines the pockets of unionized contracting firms that're paid to sit idle on their job sites for months, sometimes years, and in general does not have my best interests at heart as a taxpayer in the slightest. I am highlighting the government as a human entity easily capable and already culpable for massive theft since it has begun to grow well past the publics ability to control it. Any quack who tells me the government is the answer to all of my problems would do well to study the plight of Native Americans.
