I show you the evidence and you ignore it and act like you know better. You don’t know better. If you want to act like child then I’ll treat you like one. If you want to stay ignorant then get out of politics. It’s not my job to inform you. You should be able to do that yourself, and if you can’t then you should stop acting like you can participate. You don’t know what you’re talking about. You can’t participate in the conversation. The only thing you know how to do is deny and ignore inconvenient information. It’s your job not to be a retard, it’s not my job to help you. I don’t want to waste more of my time talking to ignorant trumptards because having a conversation with you idiots is like talking to a brick wall.
