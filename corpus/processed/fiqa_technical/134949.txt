It will be super expensive and a complete failure. Everyone now wants their own streaming service and DON'T realize they are just trying to turn this into other more expensive form of cable. I already have to many apps as is for shows and movies I don't need other and don't care enough about Disney to pay for a app. Unless of course they put ALL there content and that includes Pixar flims then it could turn me around on the subject. But like you said it will most likely be limited runs on the good stuff like one or two a month and a shit ton of crap NO one wanted to watch to begin with.
