Btw, BE CAREFUL, you dont get suckered into some Northwestern Mutual job where they sell your family and drop you a day later. Like I said in my earlier posts, a series 7 is a SELL SIDE cert dude. This means selling something, investments, insurance, trading, etc. Know what you are going to get into before you do it.
