There is an element of, hiring a new person is expensive to do, and involves various commitments with respect to that person (space for them to work, equipment, healthcare, etc.) - which can make it more sensible to pay employees overtime instead of hiring extra staff. On the other hand, if it really is running like that for years, someone's an idiot.
