I believe the pizza business will help you set in and running into business faster than the welding business. You have a lifetime experience, a working brand name and original owner's trust, technical and financial support for the future available to help you as well. Having said that, the pizza business may not make you as much money as the welding business in the long run, but it's a safer start. You can start the welding business on the side once the pizza business starts running in the auto mode.
