Are we still discussing Amazon? Their net income has hovered around $1 billion per year for the past three years. If that's profit-free, sign me up. They do have very thin margins, but it's clearly by design. And you really do have to take into account the massive volume of sales they do. Still, like you, I'm curious to see if they'll ever turn into a mature, dividend-paying company. For example, it's been interesting to see Microsoft hike their dividend to a fairly competitive level while Yahoo resists being seen as anything other than a growth story.
