Oh yes! My policy is 5 stars unless something awful happened then detract based on how I feel. For example, a driver who was 10 minutes away to 35 minutes to get to me and called me a liar over the phone because I was at 1st ave N and not 1st ave W like he thought because he only knew W. He got 1 star..
