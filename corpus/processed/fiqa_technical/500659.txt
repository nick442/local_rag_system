Have you *seen* a Model S? Driven one? The car is beautiful even if it was gas. Once they reach production levels I believe it will sell like no other. And do you think Tesla is lacking demand? They have over 6000 PRE-ORDERS (they require a $5000 deposit, too). If this car was available non-preorder, I know multiple people that would be in the market for one (My father, for example, even said he would trade in his 110g+ AMG Mercedes for one, and he lives in Texas! The big oil state!). Not only that, they have drivetrain deals with Toyota and Daimler (maker of mercedes, etc). Who wouldn't get a Model S when the technology in it is far superior to a 5 series or 911 that's just electric. I don't even think electric is the main selling point, but that it's a vastly superior car (speed, handling, technology) than any others in it's price range. Also, a Boxster over a Model S? Really? And do you really think porsche, BMW or GM can catch up to 10 years of research and development by silicon valley engineers by the time they make the Model S and Model X fully available? Be realistic.. developing a completely new kind of car takes many many years of development no matter how much money the company has. Everyone has doubted Tesla from day 1 and here we are ~10 years later and they are actually doing it.
