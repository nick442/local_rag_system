I'd also like to address you're ridiculous implication that more liberal countries ie Sweden denmark etc etc are more innovative. That's a fallacy and I'll prove it. The United States has more Nobel prize winners than any other country by a long shot. We have arguably (in spite of the fda) the best medical services in the world. Switzerland is also arguably the most innovative country in the world it's not because of basic needs being taken care of its because of surplus capital in the private sector. Look at how space x can launch a shuttle for 300 million less than NASA can. The free market does everything cheaper and more efficiently than the government can.
