The thing is Spain really isn't like Greece and their financial crises are fundamentally different but unfortunately interconnected. Greece's issue is too much sovereign debt and a banking sector that lent far too heavily to their own government. Spain's problems derive from a private banking sector crisis as they over lent particularly to fund an insane property boom that went really really bad really quick. The root cause is far more akin to the US crisis than the Greek one, however being caught up in the Eurozone and having banks exposed to the debt of other nations has really fucked them over in terms of borrowing and debt to gdp ratio. Spain was one of the few Eurozone nations that stuck to the max 3% og GDP borrowing rule, not even Germany stuck to that, they were fiscally responsible. Then having to provide a huge bailouts to a financial sector, as the economy was tanking from the global recession amd the bubble bursting and a crisis emerging in other EU nations (and a lack of a central bank) has been their ruin.
