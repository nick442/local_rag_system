I have to ask, are you a student? Or perhaps a recent grad? Are you concerned with the plight of the poor students because you are one, or were recently one (and are thus paying your loans)? Because if so, this question is a damning condemnation of the educational system, that you ask such a stupid fucking question, when the answer to that question was very clearly outlined in the article.
