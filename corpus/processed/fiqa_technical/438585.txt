Yep. Elliot has appointed several Board members to Arconics BoD and really fought hard to get the CEO out. To be fair, the former CEO (Kleinfeld) hung himself on that one. Elliot is trying to get their guy (Lawson) selected to be the new CEO of Arconic. I didn't really trust Oak Hill Financial when they owned Firth Rixson. I didn't trust Alcoa leadership when they bought Firth Rixson because the first thing they did was come in and reduced head count by 20% without first looking at why the organization was structured the way it was. Now that we're Arconic, I'm growing more and more leery about Elliots increasing control over the company. They're a vulture fund.
