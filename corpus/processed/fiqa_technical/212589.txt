One point that I don't see covered in the other answers yet: How does this affect the months that have 5 weeks. Do we actually lose two weeks a year? I get paid every two weeks, and pay day is always a Friday. Some months, I get paid 3 times - which is always great. If you live within your means, it's like an extra paycheck. All other months, I get paid two times. How many months a year do I get paid 3 times? 2. It will always be two, because there are 12 months. If you get paid twice a month, that's 24 pay checks, which is 2 shy of 26 pay checks - what we would expect if we were paid every two weeks. That means those 2 extra pay checks need to fall somewhere, and they will be on the months where your pay day is hit 5 times. For example, in 2014, there are 4 months with 5 Fridays: Jan May Aug Oct I got paid the second Friday of January, so I only got 2 checks in January. I will be paid on the first Friday of May, which means I will get 3 checks in May. My other triple-check month this year is October, so of course I am only going to be paid twice in August.
