>Most doctors also have a very poor understanding of statistics -- Says the man who thinks we have increased food/acre over 100x, that India has more people than China, and that most people pay self employment tax. And all those claims were in the last few days. The average doctor probably has a far better understanding of statstics than the average American, so is certainly better qualified to interpret the evidence than a barber. Most certainly better than you based on the claims you've made recently. And none of this is evidence for or against the claim that the benefits of aspirin outweigh the risks. As usual, do you have *any* evidence? Or just opinion and name calling?
