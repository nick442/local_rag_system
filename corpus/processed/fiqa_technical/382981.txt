As fennec mentioned, it is about your tax rate today vs your tax rate when you retire. One of the big issues is whether you have a lot of tax deductions today that will disappear when you retire, which is likely. These include dependents (aka kids) and your home mortgage. For a person with kids and a mortgage, it seems likely that the Roth would be beneficial. If you do not have a lot of deductions, you might be ok with the regular 401k to help reduce your tax burden today.
