As a former Amazonian, I can tell you that employees are really, really encouraged to get patents. Doesn't matter what for, if your patent application is formally submitted, you get a clear plastic puzzle peace (i have one). If it actually becomes a patent, you get a blue one's My point is, the fact that they're applying for a patent in X doesn't mean they want to do X, it means that some employee came up with the idea and submitted it to the IP folks who thought, maybe we can patent this thing. Every company wants a war chest of patents they can use against companies suing them for patent infringement.
