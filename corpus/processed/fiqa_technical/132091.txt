It all depends on how much you want to change your phone. Android phone makers do a lot of customization to start with (and include their own crapware). This gives us phones with extra control buttons, more or fewer options (Near Field Communication, wireless charging, etc), and so on. After that, you have options. New keyboard, special favorite Reddit app, etc. I don't see too many missing holes in the iOS apps, but some of my android widgets are missing or missing features (free, good, logging bar code reader that can email a list?).
