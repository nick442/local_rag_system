In the short term, this question is pretty simple: Are occasional use grid-scale natural gas plants economically viable compared to distributed gas generators? Home solar is an amazingly good deal now. Economically, the question isn't whether it'll take over most home power generation, it's how fast that will happen. Currently - at least where I live - the grid is still a good deal for backup power. If that changes, then people will stop using it. You can get a gas generator to cover a normal sized home installed for ~$4000. In places with piped gas, the price for running the generator looks comparable to grid power per kWh. So no, I wouldn't pay triple the price for grid power or buy a ton of extra storage. I'd get a natural gas generator and handle solar downtime locally.
