Except the ads before a movie are not the primary revenue source, and just because data can be gathered, doesn't mean it is worth anything. Unless they have some incredibly obtuse and far reaching method of finding all kinds interconnecting phenomena, their data isn't going to be much better than what theaters or a service like Fandango probably already offer. There's an endless web of attributes that can make or break a movie, and studios have been refining prediction, measurement, and testing for decades. I don't think a movie ticket app is going to have any game changing insights that tells them who to cast, how to write, or who to market to. It isn't that hard to work out demos and viewing habits of their audience, in fact it's probably among the easiest data they already collect.
