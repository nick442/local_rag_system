That's actually pretty close to what the original goal for arbitration was. Arbitration was envisioned as a way to resolve disputes between two businesses in a niche industry by an expert in that industry, rather than by an inexpert court. The idea being that someone in the chicken processing industry, for example, would know more about a chicken processing-related dispute than a judge would. But then somewhere along the way, the courts and Congress got a hard on for arbitration clauses and started allowing them everywhere. Somehow they continue to overlook the fact that letting an industry expert resolve a dispute between someone else in the industry and an unaffiliated customer is profoundly unfair. And that's how arbitration became yet another good idea that got perverted.
