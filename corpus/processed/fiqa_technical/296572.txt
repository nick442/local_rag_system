Try asking in r/entrepreneur my friend did a pop-up fashion store to test the water before opening one full time. It was for 3-4 weeks each time and did really well. The store was in between long term leases and my friend was able to get a good deal on it. An escape room would have much higher setup costs and would need to be open longer term to make a decent return. Depends how easily you can setup and promote.
