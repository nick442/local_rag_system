A series of negative experiences across multiple stores and levels of employees/management, ending with getting the BBB involved. They were still shady/poor even after the BBB case. (In short, they lost my laptop I'd sent in for repair, didn't tell me and sent me something similar with my data on it, and when I sent it back, they continued not to tell me much of anything. Lies and rude people all around.) I refuse to use them even for showrooming, I stay outside when my friends go in. I couldn't tell you the last time I went in, and it was by force.
