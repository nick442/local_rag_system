"This has been my technique for negotiating salary for a new job. I simply tell the company/recruiter, ""I don't negotiate. Give me an offer. If I like it, I'll take it. If I don't, I'll leave, no hard feelings, and look for another job. No second chances, no back and forth."" Has worked -very- well for me."
