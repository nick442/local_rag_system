I wouldn't say were in a Dotcom Bubble 2. For example, Groupon doesn't have a moat, there are already 1 million copycats, and its stock did not skyrocket, it is tanking. Facebook has hundreds of millions of devoted users. However, I believe I saw some stats regarding daily and weekly usage. They did look good for Facebook. Anyway, if you want steady long-term growth you will put your money into Coca-Cola or McDonald's until China, India, Russia, and Brazil are saturated. Still a lot of growth potential there. But don't listen to me, I liquidated everything one day before this past week's run-up.
