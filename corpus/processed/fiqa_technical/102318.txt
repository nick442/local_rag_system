Ah! The old “Taxes are stealing” rhetoric that fails to account for social contracts, the need for a consistent and uniform infrastructure, and the realization that most of what you rely on is based on the belief that people should work together “for the common good”, rather than exist as small bands of financial “bandits”, stealing from anyone they can for access to the resources they guard. You call the government a thief, yet you strive to turn everyone into thieves. The hypocracy is palpable.
