I think you should wait to see if he actually gets 80k a year. Also depending on where you live your taxes will vary. With your current expenses, you should be ok as it is under 3K but it doesn't leave too much left over for savings. If you start a family with his single income. I don't think you'll make it. I'd suggest holding off on starting a family as you are both very young. You have plenty of time to focus on getting your education and him developing a career.
