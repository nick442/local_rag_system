Social contract is what makes a society work. I don't see how it is rooted in theft. If an individual doesn't want to honor it, I suppose the proper thing to do is to leave and find a place that better suits them. One story I've read of people renouncing their US citizenship was about expatriates who can't afford to pay US taxes on top of local taxes. I can empathize with a situation like that. At least they're not trying to have it both ways by not paying taxes and remain US citizens.
