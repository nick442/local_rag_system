The more I read of these articles about Uber/Lyft etc. and the superior service that they are offering over taxi companies, the more I think about the increasingly strong links between Uber and the Google self-driving car. When self-driving vehicles are available the service will be even better - where the service provider will be embarrassed about, and probably offering discounts to, anyone waiting more than 10 minutes. Once self-driving vehicles are available then all of these confrontations over Uber vs the taxi industry become moot. If regulations won't allow me to use Uber, and I don't want to wait for a taxi, then I can just order a self-driving vehicle from a car rental company. It will essentially offer me exactly the same chauffeur(less) service, but without the regulations hampering delivery of the vehicle. If, as can be expected, extra regulations are put in the way of car rental companies, then I will join a car sharing company and order a self-driving one to deliver itself to me. It will essentially offer me exactly the same chauffeur(less) service, but without the regulations hampering delivery of the vehicle. TL;DR - The writing is on the wall for taxi companies - Uber is the start, but the arrival of self-driving cars will signal their demise.
