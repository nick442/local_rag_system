because thats not how insurance works. Yes, they make a profit, but the only reason any single person can get a policy is because there is a pool of people large enough to spread the risk. That means there needs to be healthy people too. The bigger the pool, the lower the cost. If you're still pissy at that point that it's expensive it's not the insurance company at that point, its the actual costs of medical care that are expensive and require a policy as expensive as it is to cover those costs.
