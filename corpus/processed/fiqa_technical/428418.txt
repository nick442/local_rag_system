"That's true, but that is what that means. That seems like fair usage. If I have meatballs labeled ""made with 100% chicken"" then obviously they include non-chicken ingredients. Besides, there are ingredient listings, and while there are things that can be left off, they must be in extremely low concentrations. If it's got soy in it, then that's stated in the ingredients (and in this example, called out yet again because it's a common allergen)."
