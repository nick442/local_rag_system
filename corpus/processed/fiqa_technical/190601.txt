'What' you have won't sell. 'Why' you do what you do and what you 'believe' is what will sell. Don't sell a product, sell an idea. As someone earlier said; we buy on emotions. You want: Why - How - What Not: What you have - How it can benefit - Why it's great Hit home with someone and they'll buy into your passion, share your emotion, and trust your enthusiasm. Posiyivity is also key. No-one wants to think about negatives or be around a negative person. Trigger positive thoughts and emotions in people with your marketing and when you speak to them and they'll be more inclined to listen. And as someone else mentioned; arrogance. Don't be that person as no customer likes dealing with arrogance. Your product may be too good to you but put yourself in a customers' shoes that doesn't understand your product. Think of how it would baffle them and why.
