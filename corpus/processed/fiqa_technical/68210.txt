Interesting. See I thought that it was just me that didn't go to McDonald's and that many other people (the majority) still go. But, no. The reason I don't go is because of the unhealthiness. Now I will go if it's a last resort. After all, I actually like the food! It's good old fast food. I'm noticing all these top comments about the food being terrible and nasty, but I love it. Even though the quality is very poor.
