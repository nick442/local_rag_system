"One of the things that make internet companies so profitable is that there is no additional costs to ""sell another widget"". With something like EBay, there is no additional cost to add another auction/sale. While this is true for a single auction, it eventually becomes untrue. If you add one million auctions, the company may pay additional bandwidth, storage fees, system engineering fees, and even development fees to make the site able to handle that much volume. Sorry that I am unfamiliar with GoodGuide but I am sure you can extrapolate."
