The irony endures: business supports Republican intransigence on stimulus and regulation as business lobbies like the Chamber of Commerce fight every effort to spur growth. Yet the markets, funded by these self-same businesses, demand further government intervention and spurn stimulus efforts they deem insufficiently robust. At some point one would hope this inherent contradiction between what businesses are doing politically and economically would become apparent to a wider audience but the mainstream media remains too frightened to report anything for which they could be 'Rather-ed.'
