Lol that's what you think buddy, my portfolio is flawless. It's doesn't take a scientist to be a good broker but someone who has information, I have nothing to prove to you because you are no one, just someone on reddit. It's nice you read my post, guess I got you pretty upset. It's funny because you don't know what I have available for myself in the finance industry. You read post about me that seem like idk what I'm doing that's because I'm thinking 2 steps ahead while you stand still. Like I said you are no one, even if I showed you my portfolio and proved you wrong everything would still be the same so why share stuff that I know that you don't? If you do not get where I'm coming from then you are a very bad businessman. Oh and another thing because I got into mba program right out of college, that makes it a bad one? Didn't know pace university was a bad mba program lol. You gave me a opportunity to prove myself? Dude. It's reddit not a interview.
