"A big part of the answer depends on how ""beaten down"" the stock is, how long it will take to recover from the drop, and your taste for risk. If you honestly believe the drop is a temporary aberration then averaging down can be a good strategy to lower your dollar-cost average in the stock. But this is a huge risk if you're wrong, because now you're going to magnify your losses by piling on more stock that isn't going anywhere to the shares you already own at a higher cost. As @Mindwin pointed out correctly, the problem for most investors following an ""average down"" strategy is that it makes them much less likely to cut their losses when the stock doesn't recover. They basically become ""married"" to the stock because they've actualized their belief the stock will bounce back when maybe it never will or worse, drops even more."
