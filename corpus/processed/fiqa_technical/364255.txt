I'm not gonna act like I invest in real estate, but I'm relatively well read on the subject and have family who invest as well. I think of a house like a stock, sort of. Say you get a mortgage, fix up the place, and rent it out for 1500. These renters will be covering the mortgage payments each month, plus possibly a little bit more. You're not making bank on the $100 profit each month on the rent after you pay the mortgage payment, you're making it on appreciation. Just like a stock, the appreciation isn't realized until you sell it. The fastest way to make money in real estate (depending on who you ask) is to buy a house below market value, fix it up a bit, rent it out while it appreciates, and hopefully sell high. There's 100's of other ways to make money in real estate, but that's the gist of how a lot of people do it. Hope this helps!
