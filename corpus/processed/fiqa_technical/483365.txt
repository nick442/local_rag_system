I have mine at Ally also. I've been transitioning about 75% of it in to a ladder of 18x 18 month CDs rather than leaving it in the regular savings. The early withdrawal penalty is so low, at just a portion of accrued interest, that the funds are essentially liquid. It was the safest way I could find an additional 0.25%. Additionally, Ally gives a rate bump when you renew a CD. The bump is currently 0.05% but it's been as high as 0.25%. When I was building the ladder I started by buying 6, 9, 12, 18 month CDs every month, so the shorter duration CDs would generate the renewal bump on renewal.
