>Also, if you follow economic theory, the cheapest way to provide healthcare is to have a large amount of people paying into the same pool That logic only applies if those taking advantage of the healthcare opportunity contribute towards its payments, in this case, via taxation. If 46% of the population isn't paying Federal Income tax ([According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., 46% of tax filers will owe no federal income tax this year](http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/story/2011-10-06/income-tax-nonpayment/50676912/1)), the 54% are forced to support the entire group's cost. Even worse, much of the 54% will elect to use their own private healthcare because it is superior to the public option.
