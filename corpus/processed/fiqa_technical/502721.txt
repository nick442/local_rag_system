Consumers who have been forced into Obamacare are still clearly being asked in some cases to pay virtually unlimited out of pocket costs for drugs. This was an example from the past which is still allowed, some people can be asked to pay an extra $24k a year (for the rest of 2014) or perhaps even more. This system is broken and there is no desire to fix it, just cover it up with astroturfers who shout down anybody who points out the madness of this race to the bottom. http://www.nationalhealthcouncil.org/NHC_Files/Pdf_Files/NHC_MOOP_letter.pdf
