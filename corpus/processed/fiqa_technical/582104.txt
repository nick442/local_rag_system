"Payroll is a huge part of these companies' costs. The notion that payroll could be doubled or tripled and prices would only rise ""a few cents"" is wild hyperbole fit for /r/politics, not /r/business. We expect better than Alternet here. But regardless, it's not about damage to the consumer via higher prices. In my opinion, the fact that something costs the consumer more is almost totally irrelevant to this discussion. The point is that businesses that operate by employing teens and college students are under no obligation to raise their wages just because the broader economy is crap and adults are filtering into the positions."
