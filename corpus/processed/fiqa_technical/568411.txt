Here in Denver, which is clearly in the midst of an economic boom, the city's premiere shopping center (Cherry Creek Mall) is struggling despite the presence of high-end shops like Nieman Marcus and Restoration Hardware, among many others. The adjacent business district (Cherry Creek North) is awash in new high-rises, office buildings and stand-alone retail stores, but the city council is in the pocket of developers so they've approved all this growth while eliminating the need to provide adequate parking. Since so many non-shoppers were leaving their cars in mall garages all day long, mall officials instituted paid parking. Now, you can park for free if you're staying for less than an hour, but beginning with the 61st minute you're being charged. This has had a detrimental effect on many of the smaller stores in the mall, most of which relied on strolling visitors for a large share of their business. With the limited free parking, people are running their planned errands and then getting the hell out of there before the hour is up. It seems like a pretty stupid way to run a business, especially since several suburban malls have the same stores and unlimited parking.
