What rules are being violated? What specific rule changes do you propose? The reason I ask is, because rule changes put into effect to prevent certain activities often have unintended and unforseen consequences. Several exchanges are enacting fees that will curb this activity. Essentially if you send over X number of quotes today, and get filled on less than Y% of them, you will be charged a fee of Z for each quote sent over X. The number of quotes X is in the six figure range, the fill rate Y is around 80%, and the fee is a mil or so. This effectively curbs behavior like this.
