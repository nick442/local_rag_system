"Back in the day, I frequented the [now defunct](http://fuckedcompany.com/) 'Fucked Company' blog. There were all kinds of horror stories posted on that site. Leaked company internal e-mails, lavish money wasting parties and even tales of employees arriving to their office only to find they can't even get in the building because the leadership simply locked the doors and walked away. (Ex)Employees took matters into their own hands and smashed the windows claiming ""we needed to collect personal items from our cubes"" but it quickly devolved into stealing computers, laptops, monitors, phones, etc. or anything that wasn't chained down. It was a crazy time."
