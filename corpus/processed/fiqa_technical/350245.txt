Japan has huge current account, trade surplus and shrinking population/consumption, Unless they print money, Yen will shoot up, creating problem with their export economy. Japan can only wish the rest of the planet dump their currency, lowering yen and enhancing export. Yen is not a major reserve currency. So there is that. Does it apply to US? probably not, US is deficit and debt economy. Dollar is reserve currency, creating artificial demand and pumping US economy. Once that privilege is gone, dollar global purchasing power will tank. So toying with dollar credibility like Japan printing Yen is not really an option.
