You find a man in his 50s that hasn't said something bad about women..secoud the backbone of the country voted for him, the police, fire, military, veterans. All you libtards that want to ban guns and open borders, you aren't paying attention to all the problems in Europe, weekly terror attacks.. so did you vote for Bernie, a communist, because communism is so successful, look at Cuba they finally got the Internet. Or Hilary who lied on TV about sending classified material, then the FBI, or should say ex fbi director say that she did. And don't forget Aberdeen, her top assistant who supports sharia law (which basically it's ok to treat women like slaves) and her husband that got in trouble for sexting a 14 year old.
