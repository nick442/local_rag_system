H1B visas are not terrible, and I am not against all H1B visas. However, it is a bald faced lie to suggest the number 1, if not only, reason companies use them is to cut labor costs. These companies are not advertising they could have hired local talent, but chose to provide the job to someone from a poorer region. I think whatever city everybody in the world wants to work or go to school, like Tokyo or London or Paris or Boston, that is going to have the world's best talent. Also, if those people go back to their homelands, they don't bring with them the ideas from the city they worked or matriculated, but rather the best ideas from all over the world. That isn't at all what is happening in technology. There are plenty of computer science and electrical engineer majors in the USA out of work, and some making six figures with a BS degree and 3 years experience, but so many are out of work. Many of those jobs were outsourced, but the talent used was so poor, the cost to upkeep or update was so expensive, that many companies brought back the jobs to the USA. Those companies still want to hire the same low cost workers, but want them working in the USA for reasons I will spare, here. The USA talent pool is so full, and jobs so scarce, it drives down wages; not actually, because what really happens in the company is toxic to work for, and demands 16 hour days, 7 days a week, for the same great salary that may have once been 40 hours a week with fun puzzles and entertainment and space and a gym on site, etc. Stopping H1B visas would force companies to bring back their on site gyms, large break rooms, increase work life balance, etc. Stopping H1B visas mean a lot of billion dollar tech companies would have to pay their shareholders and executives *less* this year than last year, which is outrageous in the **race to the bottom**
