>But when share repurchases replace a companyâ€™s research-and-development spending, that indicates its management is unable or unwilling to spend on innovation that could generate future earnings to shareholders. I disagree. If we look at buybacks and r&d purely as investments, a shorter term investment is lower in risk and return, while a longer term one is higher in risk. Of course, the same goes for respective returns. Knowing that research-to-market time for a drug is 5-12 years, and that buybacks are almost immediate returns, the 11% difference over ten years seems generous, not greedy. I've read the same being said about marketing budgets being more than r&d. Again, if the market doesn't have perfect flow of information, marketing become a need to survive. A smart CEO would never spend more on marketing than is necessary. It's the last cost a company bears on a product before booking a sale, and it's the last bite out of the profit.
