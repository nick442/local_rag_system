I can only give you advice on what I would do if I was in this situation: As mbbhunter mentions above, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much time do you want to spend to manage your money? The more money you have, the more money you can possibly make by becoming educated in investing (e.g. if you can increase your return on investment (ROI) on $500,000 1%, it does a lot more than increasing your ROI on $50,000 by 1%. If I was you, I would either track my investments myself or ask an accountant (or a fee-only financial advisor) to determine 3 things: At the very least I would spend some serious time getting educated about your newfound wealth. Good luck and if you find a need for additional computer programmers at your company dont hesitate to let me know ;-)
