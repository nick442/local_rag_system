No, and that's my point. In the absence of totally cost-ineffective daily urine testing, it's not readily evident whether someone coming into work is high via marijuana, so they could operate machinery while impaired. On the other hand, being drunk has much more consistent physical symptoms and can be discovered before the person operates heavy machinery. If you're talking about other drugs, like meth and heroin, the way those are handled now are with semi-frequent random drug tests. I work for a refining company and our operators are tested on an irregular basis several times a year.
