LOL!! The stock market is reaching new heights only just because of confidence with Trump. And the economy is doing great and improving under Trump. Remember, one wrong move or one wrong saying from Trump and the stock market goes down. But, what goes up, must come down, and I am sure it will not be because of Trump. It would be some messy corporate dysfunction (e.g. Saving and Loans in the past, Car companies facing bankruptcy in the past, tech bubble in the past, subprime loans, and other irresponsible economic mishandling not due to the president). In any case, it will be a correction and not a crash, because the economy is good and improving, and will improve due to Trump.
