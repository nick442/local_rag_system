"I think in part we should admit that many if not most of those artists who produce QUALITY work have some expectation of benefiting directly from those videos, or at the very least being presented the opportunity to work in/for The Industry. So they would actually hate to see Hollywood completely buried by Piracy. Honestly, I don't ever see that happening. Piracy gets you into the habit of consuming entertainment, which means you're actually *more* likely to impulse buy that DVD rather than if you don't pirate any content. It's only when you completely remove Movies and Television from your daily habit that you look at a DVD and think..""Do I really want to waste 2 hours of my life sitting on a couch?"". If it's literally been months or even years since you've done it you'll likely not break the norm AND lose out on money to do it. How do we as a society get the best of both worlds? Libraries. I love books; hell, I double majored in English. But, for the life of me I don't understand why today's Libraries aren't COMPLETELY STOCKED with DVD's and CD's. I understand that they are easy to backup and can violate copyright that way, but that doesn't mean taxpayers who have enabled those works get to escape their eventual path to being ""free"". I can't believe that most libraries' Media department is sparse except for casette tapes, VHS's, and educational DVD's. It's not just so that consumers can get to the product for a very low price/""free"", it's that the art should continue to exist for generations in an unadulterated form. Public libraries do just that."
