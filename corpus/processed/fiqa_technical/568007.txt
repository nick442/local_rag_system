Currencies today are mostly just paper with perceived value. Gold and silver aren’t the same as modern monies because there is an actual finite amount in the world. Paper money is technically infinite and can be used to control the value of it to that end such as quantitative easing. The question is is Bitcoin like paper currency? In which case things that affect paper money would effect it with some exceptions. Or is it like gold and silver in that there is a finite amount? That’s for people who know more about it than me but I have heard terms like mining bitcoin and stuff.. I was thinking about investing in bitcoins too.
