"This is exactly what I feel. Having doing tech support for offices, friends and family, it dawned on me that they had no one else to call. If Grandma calls ""Sony"" because she can't find her email, well then they tell her to call Microsoft. Then she calls Microsoft and it seems it's a hardware issue, they send her back to Sony. In the end, the customer doesn't fully understand why they are being sent back and forth, they just want it fixed, or a reason. Apple is almost completely vertically integrated, they can solve most of the problems or at least provide the illusion that the customer is being helped."
