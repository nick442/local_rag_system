I doubt it. Securitizations refer to deals that issue tranched bonds backed by a specific cash flow asset. That asset can be mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, syndicated loans, aircraft loans, trade finance..pretty much any type of loan. - MBS refers to any securitization backed by mortgages. - CLO refers to any securitization backed by syndicated loans. - CMS refers to any securitization backed by commercial mortgage debt. - ABS refers to the rest (car loans, credit cards, airplanes, etc) CDO refers to a securitization of other securitizations. The underlying securitizations could be MBS, CLO, CMS, ABS, whatever. Most common CDOs are securitizations of MBS or CLO, with the vast majority being MBS from the go-go years '05-'07. And don't even get me started on synthetic structures. To my knowledge (and again I could be wrong here, please let me know if you've seen otherwise) the market for CDOs has been firmly dead since '07. ABS is still very active, although less than in the mid-oughts, and CLO is around still too. These two proved the best application of the concepts behind securitization: their underlying loans were truly diversified, so a general economic downturn hurt them less then the national collapse in the housing market. MBS issuance that does not involve Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie is rare but still exists. The lack of non-prime issuance of MBS is a huge reason for why the average American can't refi or take out a mortgage: there's no MBS issuance to package the loan into! Edit: typos
