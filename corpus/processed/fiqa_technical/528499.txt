You can buy a real tablet and a real laptop for the same price as a surface, and both will work better in their respective tasks. The problem was price. They thought they could charge apple money, but the reality is you need that captive dumb audience to get away with those margins (and even apple is heading towards market irrelevance). Oh, and attempting to charge over $100 extra for the required keyboard was the final knife in the back. If windows 9 isn't a rip roaring success, I think their fate will be sealed - you're almost just waiting for google or apple to finish them off in that circumstance with an attack on business space.
