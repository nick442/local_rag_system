Everyone has failures. Failures are how we learn as humans. We literally have to fail over and over again in order to learn how to walk. Yes Steve Jobs had failures in business, and those failures ultimately led to him forever changing the world. I don't know him personally, so I can't say how he was with other people or his family. However, I did read in Ed Catmull's book Creativity that he developed into a great leader with compassion for others as the years went on. Other than that, I totally agree with you about what true leadership means.
