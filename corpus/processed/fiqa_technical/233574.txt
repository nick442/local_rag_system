10,000 dollars more, on average, across 12million employees, bro. That adds up. You consume and benefit from products made by corporations, and call them rent seekers. I consume and benefit from public goods and services made by the government and call them rent seekers. Whats the diff? What makes one person greedy for offering a product/service that many people want, and another person not at all greedy for straight up jacking money off my pay check before it ever reaches my hands?
