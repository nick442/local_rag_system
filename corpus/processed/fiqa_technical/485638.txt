You are not seeing what I aim to explore. Firstly, I am looking into whether or not CEO-charisma has any influence on consumers in their decision making process. Secondly I want to see if their decision making process will differ between industries of certainty and industries of uncertainty. That is why I chose a stable industry (bottled water) and an uncertain industry (computers). In this survey I am using the Conger-Kanungo scale, which only has been used on internal analysis of the organisation so far. I want to see if the scale can be adapted to the external environment with the same results. Edit: I just saw your second point. It does not matter who the CEO of Coke or Pepsi is. I took a hypothetical approach to reduce any bias in the survey.
