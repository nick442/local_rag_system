Sorry, but obeying the law is ethical. You're silly symbols are wrong.. you probably meant: legal != ethical Here is a thought experiment for you: So the speed limit is 60 Mph. You drive 15 Mph in that area, that is ethical driving, because there is no law governing the minimum rate of speed. It's like that.. You might be an asshole for driving too slow, but you're not breaking the law. Tax is like that..
