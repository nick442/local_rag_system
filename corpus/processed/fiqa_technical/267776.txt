On what basis are you not employee? You should probably get some tax/legal advice, but generally J1 internship is by definition employment. You should also check the tax treaty between the US and Ireland, if there's one, and check what it says about training related income. You may find a pleasant surprise there. Most universities have support for international students/visiting scholars, check the international students' office at your school.
