"The Craftsman brand is the only thing that Sears has that is worth anything. Despite Sears' many woes, the Craftsman name is still about as close to ""golden"" as you can get in the tool world. Sears still know knows how to source and purchase top-notch product. Sears is one of the few companies out there that still has an in-house, staffed, top tier professional testing lab that doesn't just drop the tool on the floor to see if it breaks. Alas, that isn't the whole story. Everyone else is in the private labeling gig as well. Home Depot has Husky. Lowes has Kobalt. Problem is that those ""other guys"" ARE sourcing mediocre warez from China at a much lower cost. We all know how much Americans like cheap shit. 90% of the weekend warriors want to buy a ""pretty good"" tool. They don't want to pay 2x or 3x the price for something of superior quality that will last a VERY long time (such as the Craftsman brand of yesteryear). Even though that Craftsman tool was of superior quality, they were losing sales left and right to the ""pretty good"" stuff at other stores that cost half the price. Sears had no chance but to cut costs and quality in order to stay competitive. Having the best quality stuff on the market is no longer enough to stay in business. The DIY hardware/tool market doesn't support that angle any more. Walk inside of a Harbor Freight. Some of that stuff is borderline junk. However, it's good enough for many people that only need a tool or two to get them through a quick fix. This is the new consumer market - ""Just good enough for today and maybe tomorrow""."
