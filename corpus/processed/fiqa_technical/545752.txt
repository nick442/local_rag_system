If your concern is scams, we should be talking about counterparties, not bitcoin itself. Unless you think the protocol itself is a scam, which imo it most certainly is not. You're conflating the trustworthiness of counterparties with the trustworthiness of the underlying protocol, which imo is not a very good model to operate by. You'll understand the situation better of you look at them independently. Bitcoin isn't trying to be a credit agency or the better business bureau, it's just trying to be digital money. Don't expect it to protect you from scams any more than cash will. That's not its job, and does not affect its trustworthiness as money.
