Minimizing tracking error and offering good redemption liquidity is the priority. A few concerns off the top of my head are entrants and exits of the S&P 500. Vanguard needs to dump a good amount of one stock quickly and purchase another big stake simultaneously. Everyone also knows that the large orders are coming so trying to do it efficiently is one challenge. When a company in the S&P 500 spins off a stock as a dividend, you could be holding on to a bunch of shares in a new stock that you need to get rid off. Again, a lot of selling at once, need to keep costs of that low.
