"I am no business expert, but I know that their branding and licensing is good because it makes kids demand it ""because frozen"" but parents are reluctant to buy the same old ""one big piece with some bolt on blocks"" sets where you aren't *really* building anything. It lacks the creativity since they made it more difficult to just buy a tub of blocks. I struggled to find legos one year where it wasn't some smartly branded yet completely cold and bland set."
