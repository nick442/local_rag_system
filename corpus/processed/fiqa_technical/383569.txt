Good to hear you didn't lose everything and learned something. I made similar mistakes during the dot com boom, when I first started *playing* around with my 401K and decided to get on the high tech bandwagon that everyone except Warren Buffet was recommending. I should have listened to him! Now, I stay off the make money fast train, and stick to index funds. I don't really like spending time buying stocks that somehow suddenly go broke right after I buy. :)
