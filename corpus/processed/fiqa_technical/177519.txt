People who did it != what the requirements are. You're still shrieking and whining while still being wrong. The fact that few people take advantage of it doesn't mean it isn't possible. In fact, the fact that 17 people did it makes it demonstrably possible. Also, starting a comment with 'Nope' then being provably wrong by a basic cursory google search is kinda the definition of being both condescending AND wrong.
