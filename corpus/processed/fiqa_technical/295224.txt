Like I said - I can't directly comment on exec and partner salaries, as I'm not (yet) at those heights. (what is an Accenture Director/VP? Do you mean Senior Exec?) But we weren't discussing where the better pay is - we were discussing IPOs and competition. I'm in the IT security & risk management space and every second bid sees Accenture going up against Deloitte and IBM, and normally a few boutique firms. Things may be different in both the pure management consulting space and the outsourcing/full service space, but in technology consulting there's certainly competition in a meaningful sense.
