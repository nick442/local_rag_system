No one is protesting BK either. I used to work at BK. The customers are: Groups of teenage boys People with demanding, manual labor jobs (probably the only way to get enough calories for that kind of work -- none of them were fat) Families with little or no English, or where the kids speak English and order for the parents. Obese people I don't really see how any substantial segment of any of these people is really going to care about protesting BK's tax stuff, or even be aware of it.
