Lets be realistic here 95% of people that go to sea world don't give a shit about anything but seeing some guys doing tricks on jet ski's, the dolphin shows, and sitting in the splash zone for Shamu's show. They are brain dead consumers trying to shut up their children and seaworld offers a slightly more educational experience that makes them feel like better parents. Seaworld is like the fruit loops of the cereal section, it's still basically candy but it kind of looks like cheerios and has fruit in the name so parents feel better about buying it than Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
