I'd like to recommend that people watch [The Queen of Versailles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen_of_Versailles), because it's an amazing look inside the home (in more than one way) of this man, David Siegel, and his family. But if you're anything like me, this movie will make you angry and depressed that people like this not only exist, but have been so amazingly rewarded for their avarice. Frankly, I'm not entirely sure that kind of poison is a good thing. In any case, let me just share this little tidbit from the film. Near the beginning of the film, Siegel claims that he was responsible for winning the state of Florida for George W. Bush in 2000, which in turn won GW the presidential election. When asked what he did, he smirks, and replies that he won't say, because he doesn't think it was legal.
