"That is false that Amazon loses money with ""predatory pricing"". They are making a bucket load of money. They are just a hell of a lot more efficient than the department stores that are being replaced by Internet sales and advanced logistics. You might point out an example of a product sold below cost. When a department store is running a loss years on year or running a clearance at a loss, isn't that predatory against Amazon? Retail is a brutal business."
