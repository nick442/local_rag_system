Easier said than done. Take a movie theater, for example: the vast majority of the employees are high school and college students. Most of the staff get churned through at a rapid pace - usually no more than 6 months and they've moved on to somewhere else. But a significant portion of them will stay for extended periods. Someone who starts working in their Junior year of high school and keeps working there straight through college, for example. It's not an apprenticeship. It's also not the kind of job that you can support yourself on. Time limits would severely impact people like the one I described - making them ineligible to keep working - while simultaneously doing nothing to impact the employer because they churn through most people in 6 months anyway and won't trigger the apprenticeship time limits.
