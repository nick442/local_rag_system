I worked for a major shoe retailer's e-commerce division. Our return rate on shoes was nearly 70%. Shoe manufacturers do not size consistently, at almost any price point. Customers had no idea what their size was and would often order a size up and a size down, 3 pairs of shoes, and return all three. They were unable to measure their feet, because there are really no standard measurements for feet. We thought about a 3D scanner from feet, but customers would have to come into the store for that, then we'd have to scan every shoe. Shoes can be high margin, but they are extremely expensive to sell online. There really is no silver bullet here - Foot Locker has nice stores and a great selection. They are cash positive and EBITDA profitable. If AMZN cuts into any body's shoe business, my guess would be Walmart, Target, or TJMaxx. IMO the biggest threat to Footlocker is just general death of the mall..but whatever model replaces malls could just as well have a FL. I think the market has dramatically overreacted - this isn't sears. It's a profitable business that's missed earnings a couple quarters. I bought in and I am long.
