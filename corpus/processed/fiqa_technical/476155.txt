I'm gonna drop 50 on Conor, because I don't trust either of them to not rig the fight. Floyd needs the money, it's not out of the realm that he'd dive to milk a second and third fight. It's a far shot, but if Floyd is far enough in debt, he'll do it. Worst that happens is I lose 50 and go about my day.
