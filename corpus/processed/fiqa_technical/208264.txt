"Nope. Sorry. Trump has been too hypocritical in his dealings, and has behaved poorly. He isn't a man of honor, and he isn't a studious business man with a clean reputation. He represents none of the things I look for in leadership. I want to solve problems, and Trump and Hillary have both shown a proclivity for creating problems. I voted for neither, as I don't want either of them in office. That aside, I'd like to find an adequate solution to the issues at hand, not a reason to announce sides to an already divided country. We shouldn't be saying ""Join Trump"" or ""Hate Trump"". We should be saying, ""Let's fix all these issues in a reasonable fashion, that helps and works for all of us, leaving not even the smallest or weakest American out."
