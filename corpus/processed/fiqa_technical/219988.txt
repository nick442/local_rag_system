The article is so wrong. Steam powered plants weren't necessary dark and dirty, when the power was transferred from outside. After the steam engine, petrol engines took over, because they were cheaper and could replace a steam engine without reorganizing production. The usage of electricity needs trust into the vendor. Electricity in the beginning had no isolated cables. Wires were mounted on the wall and hold by ceramic isolators, which wasn't very good for production. Even with the availability of electric motors, planning a single step of a production process is expensive. At that time it was often cheaper not to follow up the newest technologies. And Ford didn't automate much, but organized labor much more efficient, which resulted into a massive exhaustion of workers.
