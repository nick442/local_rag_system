"Yea, but the market has almost built up an immunity to the ""back and forth"" of this thought over the past couple months. There's essentially too much talk and not enough action. BUT, It will be interesting to see the effect this Mueller investigation news has over the next couple days, cause I'm assuming the media will push the story. Although the Dow broke new highs today it was essentially flat. Personally I think the markets being propped up. Also, The dollar is being artificially pushed down (because the fed needs it weak for inflation rises). But who knows, it's just a thought and I will keep trading with the trends!!"
