"People should be asked what they want and allowances made to get them what they want. I prefer a ""home away from home"" permanent private office, where I can stash my stuff and put some personal belongings in. Some people would rather have a temporary desk and be more mobile. Some people are fine with hotseating and working from home some days during the week."
