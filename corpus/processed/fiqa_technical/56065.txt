Cool! Financial IT is fun. Banks wouldn't run without us :). I'm doing a Master's while working part time in IT in an investment bank. I'm kind of on the fence of if I should go for a more technical profile (software development) or business profile (IT business analysis). It's quite the different career tracks..
