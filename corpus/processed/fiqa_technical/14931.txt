This depends very much on why A is making massive losses and how big they are in relation to B. If the group has a history of successfully launching profitable brands, and A is a new brand that has high expenses (production, marketing, etc.) but not yet generating much revenue, then despite the current losses it can be seen as a source of future profits. Or A might be established but currently undergoing an expensive remodelling that promises future success. Or B might simply be a huge cash cow that funds the losses of A out of petty cash.
