The thing about airlines though is you don't have THAT many options. If you need a flight from Airport A to Airport B departing before 9am on Tuesday and only Airline X is offering a flight in your budget you'll probably book that flight regardless of how you feel about them. I may be wrong but I don't think the United scandal really hurt them that much. Most people probably care less about IT systems.
