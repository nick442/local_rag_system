I should also add that the 7/63 won't do much for you. If you're really interested in finance, you have a few options. 1) Sales - in which case the 7/63 is about all you need. The rest is just time and practice. 2) A job as an analyst. Your best bet here is to pursue the CFA charter. 3) A financial planner/advisor. This job is kind of a subcategory of #1. I always like to say that an advisor's primary job is to sell, giving meaningful advice is secondary. Nonetheless, a CFP is helpful here. 4) A trader. CFA charter is helpful here as with #2. 5) High Frequency Trading - Masters/PhD in math or a quant discipline and C++ is a must.
