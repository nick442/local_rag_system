> Most businesses operate at a loss for the first year or two, and reinvest all the profits for expansion for a few years after that. So higher income taxes won't affect them one bit. Yes, but tariffs, licenses, excise taxes, payroll taxes, and the like do. I say this as a business owner. I agree that the personal margin income tax brackets should go higher, I was just making a comment about how you form a healthy ecosystem for businesses. It takes tax friendly policies on the corporate level. > Half of all incomes goes to the top 10%. They have more than enough money.. Well, if we open it up to the top 10% now instead of only 1% (which is what I was referencing with the whole Occupy movement), we are starting to get somewhere. They already pay the largest proportion of taxes, obviously raising taxes would impact them the most no matter how you look at it. I have no disagreement with doing that, in fact I encourage it. > (Note: I intentionally ommitted health care because money alone won't fix that mess.) I would say education fits within that category too. Per capita we spend more than any other country on our children already. But yes, raising taxes will be necessary to fund what we need to fund, but I'd like to start with cutting government spending, reforming the fucked up programs, and creating a real economic / jobs plan for the next 50 years and then, at that point, we can determine who pays what taxes rather than asking the wealthy to pay more so we can fund useless wars.
