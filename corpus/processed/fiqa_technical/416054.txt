"> integration (everyone wants their own closed ecosystem so they can collect data or charge for services, which is the opposite of what consumers want.) This is the most infuriating result of the past decade. We *were* moving to a world of internetworked services and APIs, so data and functionality could be surfaced where you want it. Then everyone let Facebook get all ""This is my stuff - fuck off!"" with their data and APIs and then followed suit, which fucked us all. Outlook had a connector framework so that your contacts could all automagically update with pics and info from Facebook, LinkedIn, G+. and a few other social networks. It died with Facebook and LinkedIn walled in their data feeds because fuck you. It was an amazing feature with a pretty neat ""art of the future"" about it (if you spend a lot of time in Outlook, that is) and it's just fucking gone because Zuckerberg had to build a wall around his castle."
