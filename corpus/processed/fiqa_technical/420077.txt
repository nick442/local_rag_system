>. The store has to match the price. They don't have a choice. Here in Canada we have a book store called Chapters. They won't price match their own online prices in store. I haven't shopped there in 10 years. If Best Buy is smart, they'll stop the price match. If you want instant gratification for your purchases, you should pay for it. If you go in and the TV is priced at X, you pay X. If you go home and see it's a different price online, buyer beware. I think that'd be a brilliant move. Make the brick and mortars charge more for the luxury of shopping in a store. It's sleazy, but honestly not a bad business model. \
