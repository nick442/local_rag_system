Outsourcing/offshoring. The idea is that you give away all work that is not core to cheaper staff who do not work for you. Sure, they are cheaper but it means that the basic knowhow is sitting outside your company making it much more difficult to build up the expertise and management background for tomorrow. I work as an independent consultant in trading systems. Companies use me because they do not want to build and retain in-house knowhow. Some of the bigger consultancies will be pleased to take the juniors that you trained and to sell them back to you at 5x the price when they become senior.
