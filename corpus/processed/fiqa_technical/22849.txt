"The SEC regulation on insider trading is ""engage in the purchase and sale of any security on the basis of material non public information"". The case I remember off the top of my head is Kodak developing an instant photo camera in the 1970s, and about 4 months before Kodak made this knowledge public, the CBOE had to close options trading on Polaroid because they had an excessive buildup of uncovered short positions."
