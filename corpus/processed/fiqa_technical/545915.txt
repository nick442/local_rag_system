i forget which one, but one of the two majors (S&P, Moodys), for a time, was not paid by issuers, but solely by subscribers. no surprise here, but at that time the issuer had, on average, lower ratings than the other service. after the service switched to subscriber-paid, within a year its ratings were on par with the other service.
