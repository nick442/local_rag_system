"> I don't have a lot of time to keep going back and forth. It seems like we differ on a bunch of things. Okay, I'll try to respect your time and just point out where I think we disagree factually and then end with a general question. > That makes sense as the electric company does not own the utility poles.. The utility poles and municipal electrical delivery infrastructure is generally owned by the electric company. (Who do you see repairing it when it breaks?) [It was 1996 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that requires the electric companies to share it like a public resource](https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order888.asp). > No one would by a coffee pot if there was a known fire-starting issue with those coffee pots. I think this is a key difference of opinion between us. I would be a lot more pro-free-market if I believed that the consumer could always make a complete, informed decision. I am certain an individual cannot. The manufacturer is certainly not going to tell potential customers that their product is dangerous and neither consumers nor stores have the tools to confirm a faulty product or the voice to inform the world. Consider the quintessential example of the health effects of smoking. [It was 1950 when there was strong evidence that smoking was correlated to lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2038856/). The tobacco companies when on a huge, successful, disinformation campaign that was so good [after almost twenty years only one-third of doctors believed cigarettes to be dangerous](http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/21/2/87). [In 1965 the US Government added warning labels to cigarette packages but in 1981 the FTC found this was of poor effectiveness of informing consumers](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2000/highlights/labels/index.htm). It wasn't until [the US Government went on a media campaign of it's own that the message started to get out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Cigarette_Smoking_Act). ""Okay,"" you might say, ""but that was then and it's different now. We have the Internet now and people are smarter."" Nope. Tobacco use is on the decline in the US but [it is booming globally and manufactures continue to use the exact same misinformation campaigns to sell its products](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-world-is-losing-the-war-on-the-tobacco-industry-2016-11). These companies are exploiting people, selling them something they know to be addictive and toxic, and we know that here mainly thanks to the US government. > Taxing people as a way to redistribute wealth is wrong. Imposing mandates so people buy a product/service is just straight up wrong. Your principled stand here rings hollow to me. I hear you making a moral stand on mandates and wealth redistribution taxes but in so much of our other discussion you have suggested the ends justify the means. It is okay if a few coffee pots explode as long as everyone gets a free market. Jobs fleeing the country is fine as long as we all get cheap iPhones. On one hand you think it is a travesty that a health plan won't replace an 80-year-old knee but say almost nothing about leaving people with no health care at all. You have demonstrated that you have no problem breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, so claiming that breaking these particular eggs is ""wrong"" just doesn't add up especially when you say you're good with it for ""true welfare"" cases. That leaves me with two theories about your position: 1) You don't actually have a problem with taking wealth from the rich. You have a problem with giving wealth to people who are poor by choice. 2) You don't actually have a problem making people pay for a service they won't use. You have a problem with giving a service to non-hard-luck cases for free. What do you think? Do either of my theories hold water? Have a great weekend!"
