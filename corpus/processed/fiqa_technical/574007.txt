You are mistaken about a Roth IRA. You can take out your contributions at any time with no penalty as long as you don't touch the gains. Also, if the money has been in for 5 years you can withdraw for a first time home purchase. Your concerns about locking up the money are troublesome. You need discipline to save for retirement. That is a known massive expense you will have and it takes a LONG time of saving up to prepare. Be sure to account for the taxes you may owe on the winnings before you start spending the money. Before you sink the money into a down payment on a house, make sure you have several (preferrably) six months of living expenses in savings. If you don't have investment experience, steer away from individual stocks. Invest in index funds with low expense ratios and don't actively trade.
