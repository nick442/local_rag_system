Nothing you posted addressed anything I wrote. We can't know the future warming without knowing climate sensitivity (the multiplier factor) We don't even know if that is positive or negative. Here is a direct quote from the last IPCC report: Page 11:16 “No best estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity can now be given because of a lack of agreement on values across assessed lines of evidence and studies.” Does that sound like 97% consensus? Does that sound like settled science upon which we should act?
