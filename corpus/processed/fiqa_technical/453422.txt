> The essential reason for this is that rising premiums in silver plans would trigger an increase in tax credits for low-income individuals whose premium-paying responsibilities are limited by the ACA. So if I'm understanding this correctly, a reduction in subsidies for silver plan recipients would result in higher premiums overall, which would result in low-income individuals losing enough income to qualify for other tax benefit programs that would cancel out these higher premiums. If that is the case, what an odd take on that scenario. It's finding the one silver lining in a very, very bad situation. The case described would push a lot of people off the cliff of self-sufficiency, and the headline makes that sound like a good thing?
