You can take the money back out of a 529 plan if you end up not having enough educational expenses to use it on. The penalty is 10% of the earnings (you don't pay a penalty on the principal). You can also open a 529 in any state, not just the one where you reside. The minimums and fund selection for each state can vary widely, so it makes sense to look around and see if there's a state with a fund selection you like.
