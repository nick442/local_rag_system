"What do you ""better equipment than necessary""? If I want a car that runs 300 miles on a battery charge, I don't want to put a battery that actually runs for 400 miles. The only purpose of this ""trick"" by Tesla is to charge more money from consumers for what they already own and paid for. > The side effect is longer battery life and the option to upgrade without needing service. This my problem and choice as the car owner: if I ignore the warning from the car that I over-taxing the battery and will shorten it's life, then it's my choice. And ""upgrade without service"" is ridiculous. It better to say ""unlocking existing features in the car you already own""."
