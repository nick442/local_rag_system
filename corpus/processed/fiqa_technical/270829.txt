The collapse is truly stunning, and was completely avoidable. The executives drove that company into the ground, completely ignoring the iPhone when it came out. They were full of hubris. They were the kings of Wall Street, they could do no wrong and wasted cash like you wouldn't believe. Meanwhile, inside the company, there was no communication, no vision and no execution. Sad, really.
