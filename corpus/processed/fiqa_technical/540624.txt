"The words ""good"" and ""bad"" are evaluations and are the conclusions which you reach after a chain of thought. You look at the situation, you identify the problem, you think of a solution, and you offer an evaluation. So, when you call a policy ""good"", you jump over any analysis tied to context and facts straight to a conclusion. Absent the thinking which helped you reach the conclusion, the conclusion itself is worthless. So, statements like ""Taxing the rich more is a good policy"" are equivalent to saying [""Fire bad!""](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-segment---frankenstein/n10838?snl=1) Ultimately, they just tell us how you feel about the policy. We don't care how you feel about it, we care how you think."
