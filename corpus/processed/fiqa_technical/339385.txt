> Why do people generally get so mad about high executive pay yet celebrate (or at least not care about) very large professional athletes contracts for their services and endorsement deals? I think both are outlandish. That said, I think there is more justification for high athlete compensation. Here are several reasons, (1) being the biggest. 1) A star athlete has star power and fills stadium seats. The hiring of this person is directly correlated to sales. 2) A professional athlete's skills can be more directly tied to a team's performance than a CEO. 3) Most professional athletes have a short career. They are expected to retire around 35. 4) The compensation of an athlete is a negotiation between the player and the team management. CEO compensation is much more one-sided since it is decided by the CEO and the board of directors, many of whom are also CEOs.
