It's tough to make a million like Louie did, but it ain't tough to make a normal living. Go watch the documentary about Wilco. Even if you don't like their music, they dissect the problems with the old model music industry (which you could practically extrapolate to the rest of the entertainment industry). Even if they hadn't made enough off Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by selling themselves online, they could have still toured and made enough to recoup costs and pay living expenses. Bottom line is that the overnight superstar is over and has always been a fluke anyway. You gotta have talent and work ethic and if you get to the point where Louis CK is, then there's no reason (and never has been a reason) to involve a bunch of middle-men. Louis CK was just as happy to make ~30k a year touring shitty clubs as he is making $1 mil + self releasing a show. That's the way it should be.
