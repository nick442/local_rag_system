"Most comments here seem to be folks who didn't read the article, haven't been to a Taco Bel in awhile, or don't know what fast food ""healthy"" options are. If you go during breakfast, or build a meal in their app in later hours you can make a pretty damn balanced meal. I'll commonly order a wrap with rice, black beans, guacamole and grilled chicken. I'm not aware of anything near that balanced at mcdonalds, and it would likely be more expensive. My biggest complaint is that when they debuted their new app there were new coupons every week or so, but after a couple months there's hardly ever new offers, sometimes none at all. :-( Funny thing, the common offer I get is a discount off something like a $12 purchase.. but no one in the office wants Taco Bell, would rather get a Five Guys burger ""than eat something gross"". It seems Taco Bell has a lot to live down, I think they should advertise their fresco and vegatarian stuff more often and better."
