I only see Boston working outside of the city. But in that case Los Angeles would include Orange County and cities like Irvine. It really depends on what they're looking for. Proximity away from current HQ. Proximity to Customers. Infrastructure for internet, driverless cars or drones. Workforce. Etc. Without knowing their priorities we can only guess based on what we assume they need and want.
