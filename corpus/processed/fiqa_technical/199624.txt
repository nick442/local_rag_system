"Because cities are expensive as fuck. I always here my peers complaining about not being able to afford housing and whatnot. Here I am, 23, and the owner of a nice little 3 bedroom house. Just move somewhere smaller. My city is about 40k pop. And it's only a 45 minute drive to the center of the closest major city, and there are plenty of ""suburbs"" even closer with good job markets."
