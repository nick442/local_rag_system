>*The budget deficit in the U.S. this year will be wider than predicted four months ago as weaker-than-expected economic growth in the first half hurt tax revenue, the Congressional Budget Office said.* >*The projected shortfall will be $506 billion in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, compared with an April prediction for $492 billion, the nonpartisan CBO said today in a report. That would be 2.9 percent of gross domestic product, the smallest since 2007 as a share of the economy, compared with a gap of $680 billion, or 4.1 percent of GDP, last fiscal year, it said.* Cross-post from /r/MAConservative
