"Exactly. It is not possible to perform a ""study"" of basic income on any subset of a population. All such a study will ever achieve is a ""wealth effect"" relative to those not involved in the study. Therefore, these studies will always appear to work. (Which is the intent of those who conduct them). As you said, ""basic income"" given to a group within a population is another flavor of welfare. And we already know what it does in aggregate."
