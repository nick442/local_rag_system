"Compared to a lot of other parts of the country it most certainly is, specially near the coast. My old neighbors in NH just sold their 2200 sqft 20 year-old home on about an acre for $420k. 4 bed, 3 bath, pool, 2 car garage, nice driveway on a quiet cul-de-sac, updated inside, excellent school district and all that crap. Listed for $405k and sold in less than 2 days. That home is 15 mins from the MA state line and 30 mins West of Hampton Beach. Now I'm in San Diego and $420k would buy me a 1100 sqft 60 year-old home on maybe a 7-10k sqft lot out in East County (mountains and desert, not the CA most people think of). Still only 30 mins from the beach, which is nice, but if it was anything close to my neighbor's old house it would be $800k-$1M, so yeah, while maybe not ""cheap"", Southern NH is pretty affordable for what you get."
