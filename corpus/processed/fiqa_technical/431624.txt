You ever go in a Verizon store? Man, they're seedy, so it doesn't surprise me that they get commissions. But really, do the salespeople at Staples or Best Buy get commissions? That's a better comparison. If someone knows tech they would work for HP or Dell selling to corporate customers, not some mall store.
