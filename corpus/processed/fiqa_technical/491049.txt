**Why are we collecting emails?** The email is for two purposes. (1) so we can let you know when challenges become available, and (2) so that we can send your payment, and contact the raffle winner. The survey will also ask about: investment experience, portfolio size, and education. This is crucial to interpreting the results scientifically. All data will be stored on a secured server, and **your personal information will never be shared with anyone.** Any data made available during publication will be fully anonymized according to best practices.
