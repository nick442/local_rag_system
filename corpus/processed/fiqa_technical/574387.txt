Yeah, it sounds like people are mostly mad that housing and such has inflated. The thing about wage stagnation is it's stagnant, not slipping. So if minimum wage, relative to everything else, pays about the same as it used to, that's not really a problem in and of itself. Hell, basic cell phones and plans are even factored into CPI since they're so important. If people on minimum wage are struggling *more than they have historically*, it's likely got to do with something other than necessities.
