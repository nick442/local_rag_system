By encouraging electric vehicles, US not only put a huge dent to OPEC countries, but it is also leading the world in the next generation EV technologies. Guess what gets that? Exports. Cleaner air. Less money for terrorist countries. Continued dominance in newer technologies. So don't just look at what Tesla is getting. Look at what US is getting. Yeah, tesla being a beneficiary is just incidental. No one made those rules for tesla alone.
