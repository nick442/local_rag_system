Recently in my area a factory lost a lot of workers due to more strict immigration laws in my state. They had 1,000 opening and none of the Americans wanted to work there because they didn't want to lose their government entitlements.( The jobs were starting at nearly 12 bucks an hour at that) so they paid for some H1b's from Africa to come in and work those jobs.
