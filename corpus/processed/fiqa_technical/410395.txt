If I get a prepaid debit card for the money I make do I have to report my earnings? How do I go about doing this? Yes you must report this. It doesn't matter if they put it in your bank account, or on a debit card, or cash under the table. You have to report the income. You can count on your employer reporting the income to the IRS. What is the limit I can make when it comes to working while on social security? The Social Security Administration has all sort of info regarding working and receiving benefits. The exact answer depends on the type of benefit (retirement, disability, survivor) and your age (pre-full retirement age, the year you reach retirement age, post retirement age) I would look at their website: http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/whileworking.htm for examples: You can work while you receive Social Security retirement (or survivors) benefits. When you do, it could mean a higher benefit for you in the future. Each year we review the records for all working Social Security recipients. If your earnings for the prior year are higher than one of the years we used to compute your retirement benefit, we will recalculate your benefit amount. We pay the increase retroactive to January the year after you earned the money
