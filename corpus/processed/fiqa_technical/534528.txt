My least favorite thing about Wendy's hamburgers are their buns. They're so full of sugar. Not to say Burger King or McDonalds buns aren't, but Wendy's ruins a much better burger with the mediocre bun. Wendy's fries are probably the worst out of the three. Their chicken nuggets and chili can't be beat, and neither can the frosty. Most of my trips to Wendy's involve those 3 items. The edge McDonald's has over BK and Wendys: Many locations are either open late or open 24 hours, and they have a much larger menu.
