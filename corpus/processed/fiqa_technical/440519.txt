I understand your skepticism and only wanting to deal with cold hard facts. You are correct I never worked there. I was however scheduled to fly to Seattle and interview with them, had the airline ticket in hand. I cancelled the interview a couple days before I was scheduled to depart. A cursory search concerning their corporate environment indicated that working for them would an unfulfilling experience. The reviews by both current and ex employees paint a fairly consistent picture. Unlike, say Google where most people love to work, Amazon is consistently painted as an extremely stressful work environment.
