"She's also emotionally manipulating you. You'll put her in a bad spot if you quit? Tough shit! She only wants you to stay because she is too lazy to find someone else. Trust me, she does NOT care about your future career goals. Also, she said she would help you out ""if you do well"". What does that mean? Has she given you a benchmark for what ""well"" is? Two months is not very long. Keep looking for something else, and if you find something better, take it. If not, just suck it up and stay there."
