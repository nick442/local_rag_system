Venezuela is an interesting example, because one of the main drivers behind the crisis was a decade's long drought that caused the hydroelectric reservoirs to fall below critical intake levels. Not only was their agricultural industry crippled by drought, and not only were the city taps dry, but on top of that they had to cut the work week short and ration electricity. They couldn't even use oil to generate electricity, since they'd moved away from it in order to increase exports. In their case, diversifying from oil and heavily investing into hydroelectric power actually made the crisis far worse. Which is what is so scary about global warming.
