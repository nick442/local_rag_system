Inhibited Mono Ethylene Glycol Brine (Inhibited MEG) is used as an industrial coolant, antifreeze heat transfer fluid. The inhibitor package is designed to protect brass, copper, solder, steel, cast iron, aluminum and other metals commonly found in the industrial cooling and heating systems. The effectiveness of Inhibited Mono Ethylene Glycol Brine (Inhibited MEG) in preventing corrosion has been proven in extensive laboratory and in actual service tests. Using Inhibited Mono Ethylene Glycol Brine (Inhibited MEG) for heat transfer applications instead of brine solutions or un-inhibited ethylene glycol reduces maintenance costs and improves heat transfer efficiency.
