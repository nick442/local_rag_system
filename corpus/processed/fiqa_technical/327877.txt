I thought this was a very good write up. I don't work for a pay cheque, if I love my job, money is unimportant. Its not totally out of the way, I believe in a fair days pay for a fair days work. I've seen lots of different boss 'styles' and really I need to respect my boss or its very hard to stay in the job, even if I like the job. I love change and love to learn. I've had plenty of that in my short 9 months with my current organisation. I've been in the work force for 32 years and seen lots of changes. I've settled down and decided I want a happy environment to work in, no drama in the office and a boss who I can learn from and respect. Money is secondary to all this.
