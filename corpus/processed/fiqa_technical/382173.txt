An ACN Company Review: Is the ACN MLM Business Model a Success? As we take a moment to deem great companies or opportunities we will have to take a step back and make sure that the information we will be using is accurate and does not have a skewed viewpoint. Often times the people that write company reviews hold a motivation for writing these articles, as they may represent the corporation or know people within the organization. I guess that’s the case here… I just got involved with ACN about three months ago. I feel lucky that this residual income platform was introduced to me. My goal here is to provide a clear concise objective snapshot of the company that I’ve chosen to partner with.
