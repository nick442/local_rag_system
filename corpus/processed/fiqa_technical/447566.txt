I worked at a for-profit school, one associated with Full Sail University. I can say this from experience: -Most of the people receiving stipends (loan money from federal or private sources) are black and from low-income neighborhoods. -In SOME instances the people enrolled in the school were obviously mentally ill and very likely homeless. -Most of the people receiving stipends either drop out themselves or are dropped for poor academic progress and attendance. This is after a hefty debt is built up. -The school goes to extraordinary lengths to enroll military vets. I can't say anything about admission tactics other than they check to see if you have a high school degree. Personally I would never go to these type of schools.
