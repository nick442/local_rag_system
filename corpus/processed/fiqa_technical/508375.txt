I think it has more to do with Amazon Go than grocery delivery. Companies have been trying to make online grocery delivery services popular for decades now. However, it still only represents about 1-2% of the grocery sales. I am sure Amazon will do what they can to make delivery more popular, but Amazon Go and the Whole food purchase looks like Amazon has figured-out most people prefer to go to the grocery store.
