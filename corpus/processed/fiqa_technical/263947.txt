"In your example, no one has exchanged anything yet: > All we have up to this point are promises, but no one has done any work yet. When something goes wrong, no exchange has taken place so there is no direct economic impact, because no one is in debt. The farmer needs to get his barrel from somewhere else, but he has not lost anything other than time. However in otherwiseyep's example, the cobbler has exchanged a pair of shoes for the promissory note: >Tell you what: if you can write me a promise to pay twelve Loddars in October, I can give that to the shoe-maker."" When something goes wrong, there is a direct economic impact, because the farmer is in debt to the hunter, and the hunter is in debt to the cobbler.
