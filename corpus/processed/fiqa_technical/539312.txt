How do you know it doesn't bring anything new to the table if you refuse to give it a second chance since it launched 7 or so years ago? They've added public transportation to major cities, interactive 3D maps, restaurant reservations in-app via OpenTable (for restaurants that support it), they will bring indoor maps to malls and airports in iOS 11, and I'm sure there are other things I'm missing. Personally, I don't think I've ever really had issues using it, and has always gotten me to my destination.
