Jason McDowell not only breeds dogs, he also trains them to provide a puppy that is well behaved and friendly. Health of the puppy is very important for us and we ensure that each puppy has the shots and worming done before they are handed over to the new owner. If you need any information on dog and how to care for them, we can help you there.
