"Eh. A FICO change is more important than you think. Underwriting waterfalls almost always include **minimum** FICO scores. This only really becomes important when you get into securitization and the standards (both GSE and Private-Label) required for MBS issuance. Because -- of course -- an underwriter can originate a loan and then hold it it on the books (this is very prevalent in non-conforming Jumbo loans). That said, if you want to sell the whole loans to a GSE or private label, they have to meet underwriting requirements (Reps & Warranties). To your original answer: you're right that it probably won't make a difference but not because FICO doesn't matter. Moreso because there are only 9 million potential ""borrowers"" affected and that 9 million most likely doesn't constitute any real demand for mortgages. This also ignores the possibility that FICO requirements in underwriting standards adjust to FICO 9; but I really doubt that they will."
