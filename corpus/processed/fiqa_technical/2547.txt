You're 100% right! The IRR is the rate at which the project breaks even. You project cash flow/profitability metrics, and then you see what, under your projections, is the discount rate at which your project breaks even (the IRR). But remember, it breaks even today! So it's saying that you should make a worthwhile investment today because the return that you will obtain at points in the future are worth you putting your investment in today! You still make a healthy return overtime if you project a reasonable IRR, but your IRR is showing you whether it's at least as worth it today to put your money in today (whether, given what you'll make over the future, it's at least as worth it to put your money in today).
