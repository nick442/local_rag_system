"futility of your beliefs.. what are you, a supervillian? Don't write like that, it makes what you say sound ridiculous. It's not my ""dogma"" that makes me not want to discuss this issue with you, its that people with a libertarian mindset tend to have a zealous ideology that makes it impossible to talk to them about anything without them going into full on proselytize mode and say shit like, ""If you keep your head buried in the sand, you won't see the ocean creeping up to drown you."" No, Sir, I am aware of your set of beliefs and I don't agree with them. The end."
