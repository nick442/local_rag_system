They can't. It looks like they are using the average numbers per family for the cost of education, fire, police, and emergency services. It also says subsidized housing..but I can't confirm that non-citizens can get subsidized housing (without breaking any laws). Personally, I would rather our firefighters not have to check ID's before they do their job. Also, I would much rather have educated immigrants than denying them education and then dealing with all of the problems that come with lack of education.
