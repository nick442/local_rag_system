Yes, you can have a buy-to-let mortgage on a rental property at the same time as a residential mortgage on your own property. A lot of landlords do this. I wouldn't go expecting your rental property to contribute much to paying off your residential mortgage. Most of it will go on the various costs and fees of renting out a property (not least the buy-to-let mortgage!). The main financial benefit in the UK of owning a rental property with a substantial mortgage on it is that the value of the property goes up (in a rising market, which it normally seems to be).
