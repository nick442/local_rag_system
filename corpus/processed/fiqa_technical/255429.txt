Good. Supply and demand! Free markets. Yada Yada yada. Pay up. This reminds me of farmers that say they can't get americans to pick apples. They could if they paid $35 and hour. Of course then the argument goes 'no one will pay $15 for a bag of apples'. Great! Then the market has spoken and apples are not in demand enough to be marketed. Just like solid gold plumbing.
