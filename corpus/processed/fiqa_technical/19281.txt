Maybe so, that doesn't mean every new person is like that. I personally signed up to yelp to write a review. A national grocery store chain I visited for the first time, and thought it would be a good objective experience to write. I had a bad experience at the store, and described in detail the things why I felt that way. I also sent it to the store themselves, but decided to put it on Yelp also. I went back a few weeks later to see if anyone replied, and I see there is a new review there, saying how great the store was, while my review was gone. This was months ago, maybe even more than a year. I just went onto Yelp to see if they approved my review back, nope still hidden. Ok, found the review in my own profile, I posted it on 6/28/2011. I've read stories from businesses and consumers alike for years on how they swindle the reviews, and I also experienced it personally. Why would i want to be a regular user when they behave like shit? Fuck yelp.
