Good subs to research ICOs? I am all for cryptocurrencies and their usage, but I believe ICOs are an unfettered bubble. No one can raise millions in seconds from crowdfunded sources without it being a pump and dump scheme .. or a pretty well advertised product that everyone wants a piece (i.e. an IPO with a roadshow, but without the hassle of investment bankers or share placement or underwriting). Laying out my thoughts in case you see any glaring faults right there. If not, sources would be appreciated.
