If you are in the 15% marginal tax bracket, I'd agree, no harm in using Roth. If you are in the 25% bracket or above, it would take quite a bit of savings to retire in a higher bracket. I can't know your entire situation, but the average person is barely saving enough to be in the 15% bracket in retirement, let alone higher.
