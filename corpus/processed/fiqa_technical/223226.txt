thanks for the advice, I still have few weeks before my master course starts and would like to do more reading regarding trading, any books that you would recommend ? Also I always assume that modelling skill is not that important in sales and trading, is my assumption correct ? Modelling is probably one of my weak skills but if it is needed I would like to work further on it thank you
