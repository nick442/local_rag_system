As soon as you get some actual legal action you hire a lawyer, and that $23k is gone in a matter of weeks. They clearly let have another business to run - only a fool would bother chasing this. In terms of 'what legal trouble' - we'll as you must know (since you have experience right?) it's legal trouble as soon as someone else decides to spend the time and money making it so. Just because you think there is no issues doesn't stop them attempting to sue (claim copyright in the suit design for example) - they will have a lawyer on their side saying 'sure if course this is illegal let's go get em!'. If and when that happens you are in a bind because turning up to court with no representation is a non starter - so even if you are right you have to expose yourself to the bills to get to that point.
