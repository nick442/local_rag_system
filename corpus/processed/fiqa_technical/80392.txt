Not sure how your companies bonus structure is setup but bonuses are typically based on performance. Commission drives sales people to sell more but once you get to a certain threshold you may find that a sales person is earning enough to quench their hunger for more so their drive may diminish somewhat. Bonuses help bridge that gap e.g. you get $NN bonus at the end of the year if you sell $YY by the end of the year. This helps ensure the company to reach it's financial goals so the people who make the products can still get paid. EDIT: I don't agree that a company should make bonuses par for the course. If the company is not doing well, no-one should get bonuses.
