Original comment: >I'm a huge Spotify fan. In fact, I love it so much that I haven't purchased a song from iTunes in months. That alone should speak volumes about their position in the industry - I can't be alone here, and that means that for some significant portion of people, money has stopped going to Apple for music and now goes to Spotify. > >But here's the thing -- Spotify is too cheap. Their service is amazing and far, far too inexpensive relative to what they provide. They provide a bulk of their service for free, and people like me who want a bit more pay $10 a month. > >To get access to 5,000 songs via iTunes would cost me (roughly) $5000 -- and people are willing to pay it. That's 500 months of Spotify (42 years!) subscription to generate the same amount of revenue. > >So while I agree that music licensing costs, particular for radio-like services like Pandora, need to go down to be more in line with broadcast rates, I don't think that's what's hurting Spotify here. I think they're providing far too much value for what they get paid. ---- Internet justice, away!
