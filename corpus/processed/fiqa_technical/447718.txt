You realize there are digital checks? You don't need the paper book to make the same one time limited payment. I even pay directly from my online bank account, it's low effort and requires no trust. Only thing I have on auto draft is my car payment, which is from the same entity I bank with. But otherwise yah I agree screw auto debt, but that isn't what I was talking about anyway so chill with the attitude.
