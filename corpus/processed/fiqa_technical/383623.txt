The title accepts as fact the attempted smear campaign by Goldman against Smith. Only read the summary of the report over at Bloomberg (not the report itself) but the argument appears to be that Smith did not raise these concerns about Goldman at any time while employed there except at the very end just after he had written the NYT op-ed. Goldman is trying to pawn off Smith as a disgruntled former employee. However, the fact that Smith didn't get the raise he sought does not necessarily mean his assertions about the culture at Goldman are incorrect. The point being that Goldman has not proven Smith is a fraud. They have only proven he has an axe to grind.
