Walmart is the now the largest private employer on earth. They have a large monopoly on a market that was once served by many different companies small to large. As well, they use their size to heavily influence their supply chain and push them to lay off employees and make other cuts. There is no competition for labour they can pay them whatever they want, and they are only customer for many of their suppliers, so they can set whatever price they want. Walmart is a monopoly.
