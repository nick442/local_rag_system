Yes. Just like the supposed IT/programmer shortage in the 90s. A fabrication propagated by vested interests to stimulate a policy response that artificially drives up sectoral labor supply to drive down wages to reduce labor cost. Well worn trick. There is a difference between a shortage and simply not wanting to pay what people and their skills cost at the market rate and so impinging on government to influence the market in one's favor. Classic rent seeking, aka normal and expected behavior for profit maximizing actors.
