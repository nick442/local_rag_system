Ehh, everyone can forecast, even idiots and most people have conceptualized the consequences that could happen from that behavior and have decided to do it anyways. It makes sense if the job pays like shit and sucks to do. Hell, I'd do it if I had to go back to fast food and I'm great at thinking ahead (in my not so humble opinion)
