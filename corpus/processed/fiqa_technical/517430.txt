Stop acting like a petulant 1L. If you can't find consideration in a wedding contract then you can't read. The hotel will provide wedding services and leased space in exchange for money and certain promises. There you go, consideration. This isn't a 1st ammendment issue, and it sure as shit isn't a consideration issue. It *might* be a liquidated damages issues, maybe indefinite.
