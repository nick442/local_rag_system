This is bad advice OP. You get more bang for your buck with a PC and the shortcuts (which is what matters the most in excel) will be the same no matter what PC you use. Yes you can partition the drive and dual boot but that's a massive pain in the ass and the key board shortcuts are totally different. I know that doesn't sound like much but trying to relearn shortcuts is a massive pain in the ass.
