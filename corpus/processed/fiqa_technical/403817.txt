I'm not sure those are as directly correlated as you make it appear. Wouldn't capacity refer to the ability of solar panels to store energy, while production refer to how much is actually generated? If true, then generation could have extreme variance based on where it is installed (i.e. how much access the panels have to sunlight). A person installing a solar panel in Minnesota will have drastically different power generation than a person installing that same panel in the middle of an Arizona desert, but wouldn't their capacity for storage be equal?
