Yep. Look at Market Basket's current debacle as a prime example. On NPR someone's opinion was that it works (there's many family-owned/run companies), but there's family issues (power disputes, control, vision, etc.) which if aren't managed/sort well can bubble up, grow, and potentially harm the company.
