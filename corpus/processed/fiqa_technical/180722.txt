Thank you. Admittedly, I was being lazy in my first post, while on mobile, and could have waited to look up the proper terminology. However, I still propose that the analogy to trans-fats holds. A few decades ago, we all assumed that margarines were better for you since they were not from animals. Now we are assuming that Impossible Foods is better for you because it is not from animals. And margarine is not good for you, now that we have a better understanding. I suggest that there is a good reason that Impossible Foods chose to not go further down the path for FDA GRAS. Because they knew people will buy it and eat it anyway, and any finding from GRAS could only hurt them. So they pulled out of further GRAS evaluation.
