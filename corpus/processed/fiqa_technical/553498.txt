Yes. There's a long tradition of this going back to the Roman Empire. It's called the dispersal of power. It's the fundamental reason why democracies are the least worst form of government, just after everything else. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs Of course, actual equity and zero corruption would be ideal, but to be able to maintain the illusion of something like that, and have many wealthy interests compete for influence does a better job of dispersing power. EDIT: The Roman Republic was somewhat good at dispersing power, but things broke down into the Empire. However, throughout the history of Rome, there were powerful wealthy interests that also held power, and these patterns carried forward into the middle ages and Renaissance.
