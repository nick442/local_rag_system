SQL is specialized programming language for databases that looks nothing like what many so-called general purpose languages do. It's fairly easy to pick up the basics of SQL for querying databases though but mastering SQL requires a bit more effort since you need to learn a lot about relational databases. And if you don't your experience with SQL might seem a bit flat. If you can stomach it then pick up both a general purpose language like python and a bit of SQL. Later decide what to put more effort in, depending on what you want to do.
