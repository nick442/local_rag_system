Yes. If the deceased owned the policy, the proceeds are considered part of the estate. In the specific case where the estate is worth (this year 2011) more than $5M, there may be estate taxes due and the insurance would be prorated to pay its portion of that estate tax bill. Keep in mind, the estate tax itself is subject to change. I recall when it was a simple $1M exemption, and if I had a $1M policy and just say $100K in assets, there would have been tax due on the $100K. In general, if there's any concern that one's estate would have the potential to owe estate tax, it's best to have the insurance owned by the beneficiary and gift them the premium cost each year.
