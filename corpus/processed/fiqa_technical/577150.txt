"There are many different types of drugs. Some last longer in the system than others. The one Armstrong used doesn't last very long. Some idiots use drugs that last in the system longer and/or weren't smart enough to delay the tester. Tests are also different. Tests can catch some drugs in the system, but not others as. They develop new tests to catch the newer drugs, or to just be more effective at testing existing drugs. Armstrong used a combination of these techniques, he used a drug that doesn't last very long in the system, and delayed testers through various means so that they never ended up testing him in the period in which the drug was detectable. Is that too hard for you to understand? Also >Drug testing catches other dopers No Not always. There are undoubtably other dopers who weren't caught yet, and probably used the same system as Armstrong. They just weren't caught because there is much greater scrutiny on Armstrong as he's usually regarded as the best. If you think physical evidence is an absolute requirement, well, you're an idiot. If I kidnapped a person in broad day light yet there was no video recording of it and the only thing to go by was the testimonies of 26 witnesses, you think I should be let go just because they haven't found the kidnapped person yet and there was no ""physical"" evidence left behind? Anyway I'm done arguing with you because you genuinely are a fucking idiot."
