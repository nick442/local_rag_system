"In your example, you said if someone calls for a 75% decline in the market next year, and instead it happens in 3 years, it's still a good call in your book. This is what I, and I believe mjvcaj, disagree with. Without a time frame, or an incorrect time frame, you're essentially just making a blanket statement and hoping for the best. Otherwise anyone can ""predict"" what's going to happen, as long as you're vague about the details."
