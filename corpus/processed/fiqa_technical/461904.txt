CDS is the spread you pay in order to get protection in the event of a bond defaulting. I.e., eliminating your credit risk. Contrast this with ASW/OAS/Z-spread/Spread-to-bench which looks at the excess risk of a bond over the benchmark curve/yield. It's essentially looking at the same idea but derived differently. Theoretically they move in the same direction but divergence can be an opportunity. Look up CDS basis.
