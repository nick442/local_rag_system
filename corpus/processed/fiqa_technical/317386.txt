It's also bad to create skewed incentives that result in the best candidate not getting the job. Or should we have no feelings for the other candidates who apply? Edit: Hypothetical situation. My wife gets a job in another city, and I also need to relocate. I currently have a job. I am the best candidate for a new job, but don't get it because of the proposed tax credit. Not only have you created an incentive for the company to hire a second best candidate, which is bad for the company and its customers, but I am unable to relocate. Bad policy. Economic engineering that sounds good, but is not the most efficient means of allocating resources.
