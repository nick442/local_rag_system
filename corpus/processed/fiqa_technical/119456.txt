Are you saying that you did not tell your employer, more specifically, your payroll department, that you got married, via a W4? The W4 does not say '25%' bracket, but it asks for how many withholding allowances you plan to take. In effect, you are withholding at the single rate, but are married now. When you do your taxes for 2013, you'll see the full effect of what the W4 has on your withholding. I suggest you use this time to update the W4, and not lend money to Uncle Sam. Here's the current tax table from FairMark Publishing. 2013 gives a single a combined $10K in standard deduction and exemption, with a couple getting $20K. For a simple return, this is the info you need to figure out what you'll get back, and conversely, how much to pay next year. e.g. a gross of $50,000 - for single the tax is on $40,000. $5929. For a couple, $30K taxable is a tax of $3608. On a side note - I strongly recommend Roth accounts when in the 15% bracket and shift to Pre-Tax accounts as you get into the 25% bracket.
