Actually, it does make some sense. Returns are where you have a customer who is not satisfied, and the company's job is to redeem themselves. If you piss someone off when they're already unsatisfied with something, you risk alienating them permanently. Easy returns mean that you get the return knocked out quickly, and get them spending money again, in your store, and that generally outweighs the cost of the return.
