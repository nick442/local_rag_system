> K-12 teachers never make six figure sums. In the U.S. that seems true. I found [this from 2012](http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/high-school-teacher/salary) that puts the median high-school teacher's salary at $55,050, with the top ten percent making about $85k. (By the way, this [OECD chart from 2013](http://educationbythenumbers.org/content/us-teachers-6th-highest-paid-world_982/) shows that the U.S. ranks 6th in the world in pay for primary-school teachers. I was surprised when I found this out.) > Professors in universities sometimes do, but for every professor that makes a lot of money there are probably dozens of untenured faculty who are barely making enough to feed themselves and put gas in their cars. You may be interested in [this chart from 2011](http://chronicle.com/article/Average-Faculty-Salaries-by/126586/) that gives salaries for professors, associate professors, assistant professors, new assistant professors, and instructors--all broken down by field. The data are only for four-year colleges and universities, though; that excludes community colleges, but I'm not sure whether it includes business schools, medical schools, or other graduate institutions. Not surprisingly, law and engineering are the most lucrative fields. > The real reason the big corporate interests want to privatize US education is to use all those jobs as bargaining chips in globalization. Interesting. Can you explain how this is intended to work? And if it would make sense for American corporations to do this, would it make sense for corporations from other countries to do it too? Are they doing it? I don't know anything about GATS or TiSA. Edit: grammar
