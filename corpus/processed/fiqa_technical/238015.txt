Twice I went into Best Buy this summer and found items less than online. I finally bought a floor model Canon t2i for $500. I mentioned to the guy that this was less than a used one on eBay. He mentioned corporate had just hired a guy whose whole job is to browse the internet and make prices competitive, at least where they are able to.
