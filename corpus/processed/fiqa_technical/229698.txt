Because not everyone is a racist. I don't use the r-word here as an insult, but as a description. If you accept the thesis that White people are better nation builders than Black people you must accept the idea that White people and Black people are fundamentally different. This is the heart of what Racism is; a belief in race. The truth is, race categories are the debunked creation of old scientists that have no more meaning than zodiac symbols.
