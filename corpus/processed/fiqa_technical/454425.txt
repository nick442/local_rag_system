No problem and more than happy to help! Both posting locations I've indicated for you to browse and apply any helpful info. And to answer your question in your post: I think the Federal Trade Commission would address any regulatory concerns as internet does not seem to fall under the FCC for communications, but likely the FTC regarding advertising. I don't think you will have many obstacles, but in addition to the FTC link below, maybe check out privacy policies and legal links on other job sites for reference. Also posting your question in r/legaladvice etc. may get you good free feedback from legal redditors. Hope this helps and best of luck! https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/advertising-and-marketing
