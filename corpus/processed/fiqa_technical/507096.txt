Do you have any electronic devices with rechargable batteries? The science and understanding that lithium batteries degrade over time is very well known publicly. It's not some secret or some corporate gooney conspiracy. It's the limitations of the battery itself over time. There are new batteries which show promise not to have this limitation but they are still in the research and development phase.
