I have 1.5 years intern experience as a risk analyst doing programming work. Im a math major with a cs minor who can program fluently. I also understand basic finance terms and macro and micro economics. I applied to like 40 internships and got denied on all of them. Sitting here wondering how the fuck I get beat out by a cashier.
