If you are arguing that we need to regulate industries to promote competition, I completely agree. I would even go as far to say that reducing taxes on the worlds richest people has caused money to stagnate in the hands of the few effectively reducing the multiplier effect and truly creating this mess we are in today. When rich people have more money, they don't turn around and spend it in VC, they look for someone who needs to borrow it and who will give them a good return, thus why debts have all increased publicly and privately throughout the world.
