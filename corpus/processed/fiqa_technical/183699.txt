">those fossil free funds have been outperforming their fossilized index counterparts Why am I not surprised that over a 3 year or less time period, during the worst oil crash in at least 20 years, a fund the excludes that sector is performing better? What a misleading statement. Like saying in early 2000, ""oh my tech-free fund is outperforming the funds with tech stocks"" while ignoring the dot com bubble bursting having any effect, and implying that tech stocks will never recover."
