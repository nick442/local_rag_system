Here is what I did and what I sent to my daughter.. Here is how to freeze your credit with the three reporting companies. 1. TransUnion (easiest and free). Go to https://freeze.transunion.com. If the site is down, you may have to try later (like late at night). You will have to register on the site to do this. I think on this one you need to also give them your previous address. 2. Equifax (not so easy, but works online), costs $10 [note your cost may vary depending on your State]. Go to https://www.freeze.equifax.com. You will have to register. I think this the one does not require the previous address (because you have been in at our location for more than 2 years) even though there is a section for it. 3. Experian (toughest one to get done, website is currently broken), costs $10 [note your cost may vary depending on your State]. You will need to do it by phone (takes 12-15 mins to get through the menus). Call 888-397-3742. Note there are LONG silent periods, so do not hang up. If they do disconnect you, it should be right at the beginning, and you just have to call back. You will need to have your credit card number ready to enter at the end (and you need to key in the digits fairly quickly, do not pause once you start entering them), and it will ask for a four-digit expiration date (for example, Aug 2019 is 0819) on the card.
