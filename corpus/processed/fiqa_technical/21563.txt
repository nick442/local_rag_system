Well I'd argue both are sleezy and undesirable, but I'd much rather have the state do it than unregulated firms. The state sponsors anti-addiction campaigns paid for in part from lottery revenues, and excess profits can go towards education and healthcare. It's inefficient, especially with all the bloated bureaucracy, so we need to be vigilant towards state enterprises, but it's still better than the private sector running these sketchy markets.
