"> So depending upon location it can be incredibly inexpensive. Yeah, places where it isn't going to flood. I have something like $8k flood coverage with $5k deductible on an elevated condo unit, and it is about $450/year. As a city official told me, ""if that place gets flooded, we're all dead."" And yet here I am throwing away money due to shitty regulations."
