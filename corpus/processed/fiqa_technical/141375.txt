"Are you trying to say that when hiring a Chief Information Security Officer, people with IT degrees and background are less desirable than music majors? And, yes, there are people with un-related degrees who are ""experts"" in another field, but with 98% certainty, they learned their ""expertise"" from many gray real experts with IT degrees who work for them. In other words, those ""experts"" repeat and say things in a more presentable way than any real techie expert can say or present. Good example is Steve Job: terrible product ideas and design (Lisa, Newton, Macintosh, Next, etc) and all his success stories TOTALLY came from the hard work of others (Steve Wozniak with Apple II, iPod, iPhone, etc). But sure he can present and market things."
