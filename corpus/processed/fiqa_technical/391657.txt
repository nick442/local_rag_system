> To be honest we are probably wrong in trying to tax foreign earnings. [We only tax foreign earnings when the money is repatriated to the US](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work). You think businesses should be able to go to the Bahamas, sell vast property to another American, and return the profit to the US tax free? > The US should learn the get on with less. I'm all for discussing that idea. Cut the spending before you talk about cutting the taxes that fund it.
