Yup and it is a lot harder on 40k. The real difference is at 40k your kids babysitter might be grandma and a TV. At 100k+ you are looking at student/teacher ratios at the Montessori daycare. Sometimes lifestyle inflation doesn't feel like inflation because it is for something basic like a nice safe place for your kids while you work or healthy food and only when you literally can't afford it do you realize it isn't strictly speaking a necessity.
