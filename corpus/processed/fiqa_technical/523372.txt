What skill set does your wife have? Mlm businesses take a lot of hustle and it would be difficult to do with a child. From the sound of it, your wife isn't passionate/excited/motivated about doing it, so I'd explore other opportunities. Some stay at home moms I know run blogs and online forums and it does okay for them.
