"When you do this, you might be involved in online banking fraud - and you will be both perpetrator and victim! Hacking some online banking users is easy. There is a flourishing black market where any wannabe hacker can buy a banking trojan. Then the hacker just has to infect some random computers with said virus (through email spam, drive-by downloads exploiting a browser vulnerability, upload it concealed as other software on a piracy website, etc., etc.) and it will trick the user into sending money to accounts they don't want to send money to. However, what's not so easy for the hacker is holding on to the money, because sooner or later the victim will notice. In case of online banking fraud, the bank is usually legally required to pay back the money the customer lost. Banks will usually reverse the transaction when the customer reports that they were hacked. So what do the criminals do? They hire some gullible fools out for easy money as ""Mules"". The job they offer: ""We send money to your private account, you send it to another account we specify, minus your commission"". What happens next? So the actual victim in this scheme is the mule."
