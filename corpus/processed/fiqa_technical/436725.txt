I remember seeing a post forever ago about how millionaires arent investing and someone (a millionaire themselves) claimed it was because of the current economic/political climate made them unsure which then provoked this other person (assuming a millionaire) to come in and respond to them, talking about how Trump was going to cut taxes, concerns over student loan defaults were overblown, etc etc (basically saying to invest because it's going to be alright) None the less that stuck with me for some reason so it's interesting to see how it's all going to turn out because it's clear the millionaires aren't unified on what the future has in store and I take that more as a sign for troubled waters ahead than anything else
