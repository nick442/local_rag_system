".. so you don't want to know about a gas leak in a building if that leak hasn't caused the building to explode for the last 6 years? And when he is talking ""explosion"" he's not talking the once every 10 year recession. He's talking 1929, 1937, 1945 .. and specifically says bigger than, say, 1974 or 2008. Where are you getting the ""10 year"" crap? Seriously .. is that what you're saying? Or are you saying that you just don't believe there is a gas leak? I'm addressing the former. The ""ignition source"" will probably not be within the US (unless long term bond yields increase substantially). The ""ignition source"" will be from a recession in China or from Japanese yields increasing (from ""currency risk"" or ""default risk"") -- the Japanese crisis has been 20 years in the making ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/11/olivier-blanchard-eyes-ugly-end-game-for-japan-on-debt-spiral/ ). However, with the current Debt/GDP of Japan and the structure of Chinese total debt (govt + corporate + personal) .. and the recognition that these are the top two GDP's in the world .. the dangers for the world are undeniably larger than ever."
