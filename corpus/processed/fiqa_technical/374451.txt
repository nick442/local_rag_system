"This is pretty meaningless and somewhat misleading. They measured price increases mostly on things that were produced elsewhere and would not be expected to see price increases (e.g. gas). Most retail prices are not heavily impacted by local labor prices. For many goods, local retail labor costs would constitute less than 5% of the total cost. Plus, local retailers still have to compete with online retailers, as well as retailers outside the city limits, so they can't dramatically hike prices and be competitive. If the min wage increases did impact prices, it's more likely that local retailers would see their margins shrink and some of them would go out of business as a result. On the things that are produced locally, such as food from a restaurant, they found significant price increases. There's also been significant evidence showing that restaurant job creation lagged behind in Seattle versus the rest of Washington state. http://www.aei.org/publication/some-early-results-from-seattles-radical-experiment-with-a-15-an-hour-minimum-wage-fewer-jobs-fewer-hours/ https://www.aei.org/publication/minimum-wage-effect-seattle-area-restaurant-jobs-have-fallen-900-this-year-vs-6200-food-jobs-in-rest-of-state/ They also seem to have forgotten to mention substitution effects for labor; such as restaurants using more technology to eliminate labor. Overall, the articles reads like yet another ""rose colored classes"" spin on one of the most detrimental economic policies in the US. It's almost silly watching people try to find reasons how ""increasing the price of labor"" and ""destroying contractual freedom for unskilled laborers"" creates magical free lunches."
