Okay that makes sense, but even if you accept that, I don't see how that's the same as Moviepass. If people start going to the gym a lot more, PF can buy more equipment and facility space. It would be expensive, but their costs wouldn't rise dollar for dollar with the increase in usage. With Moviepass, they are paying the full ticket price for each movie that a customer wants to see; that means for each customer that sees more than one movie a month, they can't make a profit just from the subscription fee on that customer. Their costs rise in direct proportion to use, I consider some of those costs more fixed than variable though. The labor and equipment costs don't rise in direct proportion to the number of people who go to the gym. Sure, if the attendees jumped 30% they would likely need to buy more equipment but they aren't changing their labor or equipment costs for each person that comes in. It's fixed within a certain level of activity, and only becomes variable if the level of activity changes beyond that threshold.
