">How does ""doing business in"" something increase its value? By this logic, all businesses should be successful. When you work, you are creating value. Even if your business fails within the first year, there's still all the value you have created such as: hiring handypeople to fix up your businessplace, hiring people to work at your business, buying office supplies, etc. Just because you didn't profit off of your business doesn't mean that other people didn't. >you're basically saying ""Things are currently like X, therefore things should (and would) be like X under a different legal structure."" How do you think the concept of money came about? >I can't take this line of argument seriously, I'm sorry. Why not? This is the reason that hedge fund managers and CEOs pay so little in taxes..most / all of their compensation is in stocks and bonds, taxed as investment income.

I *accept* a fiat paper standard."
