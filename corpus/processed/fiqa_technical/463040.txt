People who smoke pot every day could certainly be effected at the workplace because they might start to realize how fucked up the world is and THAT will effect their performance on the job more than anything else. Happy pot smokers are totally capable and competent workers. I've seen it plenty of time first hand, and if you are going to suggest otherwise then you should bring some proof to back it up. Marijuana doesn't effect a person's competency, it makes them feel good. That is all it does. Other drugs certainly effect competency, Alcohol for example.
