I know your question is about your credit score, but practically speaking, you should pay of the debt with the highest interest rate first. Doing do will save you money, which is the same net effect as making more money. Your time frame to pay it all off is short (you said 6 month), but just in case it takes longer, take care of the expensive debt first.
