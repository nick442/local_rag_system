"Everyone has items that they consistently purchase. I don't really need to see a picture of JIF Peanut Butter in order to buy it. Also if all you do is make a list at your computer and then put it aside until you're ready to purchase, it can now be down w/ voice commands. Google has never hidden their desire to build Star Trek's ""Computer"" so all of this seems in-line w/ that."
