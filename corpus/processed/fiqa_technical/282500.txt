"Doing tl;dr* : Filed return in January. FOUR ""tax professionals"" (LOL) and a district supervisor later, the tax board says my refund was finally ""OKd for approval"" June 30. * The full story of how Block FUBAR'd my return? I'm pitching it to Netflix as an original series along the lines of ""Stranger Things."" Possible spin off series, ""Ambulatory Cadavers"", using actual HoRrible Block office staff."
