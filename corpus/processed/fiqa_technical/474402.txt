The highest paid finance role is a hedge fund manager at a top fund - but that's like winning the lotto so here's the most pragmatic way to make a lot of money: * First 2-3 years out of college: Investment Banking Analyst * Next 2-3 years: Switch to the buyside (Private Equity) You'll easily top $400k by the time you're 26-27. If you're promoted to VP you are golden. Most get forced out after their associate stint and go to a top MBA program, after which you'd go back into PE or do the CFO route. Not sure w/o a degree, to be honest.
