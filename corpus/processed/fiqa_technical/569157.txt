The regulatory environment here is the main driver. In Australia, where I spent 10 years developing software for lenders/banks you can operate the same way as described in the original question (overnight transfer to anyone) and cheques are not only never used, if you try, people will laugh at you. In Australia 4 banks control > 90% of the market, they realize that overnight transfers that involve them 0% is more efficient (read: costs less) for all of them. This will change in the next 1 - 2 years in the US I believe however, as pressures from technologies like bitcoin and technology providers like dwolla and venmo start to get a foothold and broader visibility.
