The chickens don't get a say in how KFC is run, they just turn up and are fed for a while. Quite morbid but that's the situation. Businesses are the people who decide to even use Equifax, and on this whole disaster no one has said anything or come out in support of your Congress sorting it out. I really do worry for America and the world, because unfortunately America seems to keep being on the forefront of these practices. What ever goes in America is soon hailed as success and fed to other countries. But it's madder still because you guys keep lobbying new gun laws so you can keep the right to bare arms against an oppressive state!
