In 2 days I am at 40 votes. I just have 210 more to go. The biggest reason people do not vote is because they loath sharing their contact information with the Mission: Small Business application. This privacy issue is considerable and understandable. The good news is you can disable the app after voting however LivingSocial and Chase bank are still going to have captured legally your email. Facebook, promises not to share your password. One can only hope that is the case.
