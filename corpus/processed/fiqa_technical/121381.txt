> We don't want to go back to the days when people carried 2 cell phones; one for work and one personal. Most people still do this, and it's a valuable strategy for work/life balance. As a security consultant, I feel an employee has no right to connect their own unsecured device to the corporate network. Your phone should be your phone, connected to your provider account and using your provider's 3g / H signal. The only thing on corporate networks should be hardware that has been audited and provided by the company. Not only is this easier to secure, it also protects the employee from legal action as it is the company that has responsibility for securing the phone and computer they provide. They also are responsible for all the bills the work use of that phone entails.
