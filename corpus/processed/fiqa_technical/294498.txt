Never even heard of Mo's Bows, but pushing this story to get PR? He isn't even doing anything, his mum is doing all of it for him. The guy who created Mrs Bow Tie (which, if you're into bow ties like me, is a way better place to shop) created that brand when he was undergoing chemo for Stage 4 cancer at the age of 21! I only know that because it's on their website. You don't see his sob story everywhere!
