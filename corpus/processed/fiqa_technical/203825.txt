My parents owned 5 bowling centers throughout my childhood. Summer is the toughest time for a bowling alley. Open play is down because people want to be outside. Leagues run August-May and the majority of league bowlers want to take the summer off. Leagues are guaranteed revenue week to week. Summer months were usually break-even. Does this center have a bar? That's a significant portion of revenue, especially in the summer.
