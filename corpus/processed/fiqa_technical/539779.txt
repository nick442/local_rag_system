As other have said though, the population of the EU is greater than that of the US market and so it is more profitable to take the fine, then pull out. The other issue also relates to capital invested in EU countries. By pulling out a full liquidation would be required, which is again a bad move for your (google's) businesses. Any corporation on a global level such as google have to operate within the legal structure of each jurisdiction they wish to provide products or sales. EU based compiles get fined in the US regularly and don't pull out. It's the nature of global business. I.e. 320/500 million potential consumers is fair superior than principles. I should also add that the EU institutions place a heavy emphasis on consumer protection, unlike the US, which I believe is the basis of the Anti Trust Regulations.
