Amazon should buy Best Buy. They are the best showroom after all.. Edit: Just think about it. You walk in, see the thing you want and order it there with your amazon account, and it shows up at your house in the next two days. You want to take it home right now? Okay, fine, that'll be +2% mark-up for an inventory fee. if you think about it, that's kind of what happens now, except you have to go home to put your order in.
