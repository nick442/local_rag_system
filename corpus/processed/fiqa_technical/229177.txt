As a tenured professor, has your SO done any grant or departmental budgeting? If so, perhaps you can ask how your SO managed that and can apply the same techniques to the household budget. If your SO plans to become Chair or move into administration, budgets will be necessary. Although this may frighten you SO and backfire, you should also speak about what might happen if you become ill or otherwise unable to manage the finances. Does your SO have any financially savvy friends or colleagues? A more independent voice may help.
