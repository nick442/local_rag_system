What are your alternatives? If you have something else lined up that is better than this internship, then yes, you should jump ship. Remember, you are your first priority. Don't worry about getting burned, and don't necessarily trust someone's promises. Many people in your life will overpromise and underdeliver. With that said, if you don't have something to fall back on (that can provide relevant experience that you're looking for), then stick it out. Selling (including cold-calling) is an extremely important skill to have; there will be many times in the future where you will have to sell something, whether it's yourself, or an idea, or some other product. Use this internship as an opportunity to improve your sales skills, your English, and overcome your shyness. Take time to learn as much as you can - whether it's about running a business, your boss's previous experience, or anything else that may come in handy in the future. Good luck!
