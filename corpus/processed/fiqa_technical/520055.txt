"> PayPal isn't even the largest, let alone the only processing company, You could say the same about any public utility. (except the one largest one, technically) > And Visa/Mastercard don't control the issuing of cards to individuals, banks do. My point was that VISA/MasterCard have stepped in to block on the merchant side, in the case of WikiLeaks. Are you saying they are unable, *both* contractually *and* technically, to affect the consumer side? But also by selectively quoting me you are (deliberately?) side-stepping what *actually happened* in the WikiLeaks case, to focus on the consumer side. > No one is denying legal use of money and PayPal is nowhere close to having a monopoly. You must buy things in different corners of the Internet than I do. The customer experience (to me) is that there is ""the store"" or you can pay with PayPal. Yes, ""the store"" is actually a payment processor but this is a quick slippery slope to ""what? You can just set up your own payment processor once they've all blocked your legal business""."
