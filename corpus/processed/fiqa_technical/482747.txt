I bought my last TV from them. Looked around online for the model I wanted for quite a while. Waited until bb had a clearance sale to get ready for the new models. They had 15% off, I talked with the sales rep and agreed to a 10% discount if I got any length of warranty with them. Talked with the manager for some more and he changed it to 25% total, instead of taking 15 off then 10. Used BB rewards card which gives back 4% in gift cards, paid on a credit card offering 5% cash back on electronics purchases at the time. Used the giftcards to buy a blu-ray player at a 30% discount that was dented. Dented one was broken so they swapped it with a new one the next day for no charge. Would the average person go through any of that trouble? Nope. The average customer wants a tv, walks into best buy, looks at the TVs and chooses the brightest one in their price range.
