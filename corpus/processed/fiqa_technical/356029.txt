">The contrary of course, is a socialist ""utopia""; a world of everyone being dependent on the government to provide them their basic income. This is not socialism. But it is a straw man that is typical of the modern libertarian mindset. >Instead, we would live in a world of infinite entrepreneurship, in which the means of production are nearly free for anyone, and people prosper by their ambition and drive. This is actual socialism, you understand that, right? Did you forget to read the part of socialism that defines it as workers controlling the means of production? >The amount of resources available to all would be incredible, and people would be free to do things they actually want to do. Ya, and this is also exactly socialism's end goal."
