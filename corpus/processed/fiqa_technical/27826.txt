"> My question then is why do you espouse such simplistic nonsense when you understand that the situation is much more complex? Is it because it is easier and more psychologically comfortable to ignore these injustices than to admit that your model does not have an effective way of dealing with them? I reject your assessment so it's impossible to answer your questions that assume it. The position that ""Jim selling to John has nothing to do with Bob"" and the position that ""a power plant pollutes collective air possibly entitling compensation"" are independent and have no conflict. Simply because there are cases of market failures, I do not therefore conclude that the market system is itself a failure. Baby with the bathwater, etc. It's not because this way of thinking is easier but because it is most accurate. I honestly don't know what you mean by > than to admit that your model does not have an effective way of dealing with them? so I don't know how to respond. I stated in what I thought was plain language that my model has no effective means of dealing with them, only I insist that we must caveat that assessment with the admission that neither does a non-market model. What you were supposed to take away was the realization that there are few market failures that could not more simply be described as systematic failures generally. That is, a collectivist system is inherently illogical (if you want to argue this point, the discussion is over - I have no time for true socialists), yet we share a planet's resources and must decide how to best use them. The free market's conclusion is that people will learn if their air is being abused by a power plant and they will take action to mend it. This to a large extent has been proven in the transition from an early industrialized society to modern industry."
