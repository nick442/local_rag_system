"I like to challenge my beliefs and was excited to see an article posted to reddit that wasnt so gung ho for obama and kenesian spending. Unfortunately this article starts with a strawman and then backs it up with a misleading statement like ""the keynesian multiplyer of less than 1 means less public sector growth"".. really? You need to back up a statement like that."
