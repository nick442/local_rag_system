The point i wanted to make is that you can't rule out war, countries conquered/stole from each other throughout all of history, the only reason we don't now is because of prosperity. Take that away and all bets are off. The great depression hit all corners of the globe, what's going to happen to the american debt? Whoever bought that is going to want their money back. Is china going to stay friends? What about north korea, when they see countries around them failing, they don't seem too friendly even now. Russia? We don't know enough about their culture to know what their intentions are, to them the americans are just the same, building their military same as everyone else. The wall-street crash of 1930s was based on speculation and stock investments, the amount of shit piled up, about to explode is so many times bigger. Also, people back then were more prepared for a depression, they were more self-sustainable and lived in communities. Really, when the economic collapse happens, a huge amount of people are going to die, people with disabilities, those needing medication, morbedly obese etc. They represent a large proportion of the population and they are going to die off within weeks of the collapse. Without a doubt it will be worse than the great depression. I don't care about the politics, i'm not even american for starters, survive through the shitstorm first.
