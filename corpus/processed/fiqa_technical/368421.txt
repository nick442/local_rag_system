"I haven't seen anyone mention it, but everyone here seems to be dumbfounded that Chipotle would start serving queso in the first place. Where I'm from, the main competitor to Chipotle is Qdoba. When I ask people why they prefer Qdoba, the answer has never not been ""queso"". I don't think that they are dropping chorizo in favor of queso, but rather they're making two separate competitive business decisions. Eliminate the opponent's advantage (queso) and mitigate a weakness (non-selling product)."
