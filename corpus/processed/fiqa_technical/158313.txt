They have a history of victimizing small business owners for profit. I have had personal dealings with the CEO, and he really is a bottom feeder. Seriously, he has absolutely no class. This is just one case: http://forums.roadbikereview.com/general-cycling-discussion/specialized-bullies-bike-shop-owner-changing-his-name-315155.html Sinyard, the CEO, flew out and apologized to the shop owner only after the story blew up in his face and he really had no other choice. Lots of other bike manufacturers build bikes as good as or better than Specialized. There's no reason to give them money.
