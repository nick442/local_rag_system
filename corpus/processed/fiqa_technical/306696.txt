I haven't been in /politics since the election where anyone that didn't support Hillary was either downvoted into oblivion or banned. Once CTR took over /politics, any posts supporting Bernie or criticizing Hillary's past were trashed. Maybe it's changed since then now that the election money has dried up and CTR doesn't have the funds to pay shills to full-time manage /politics.
