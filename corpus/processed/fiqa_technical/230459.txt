I don't think you thought this through. What ownership and profit motive will you assign to clean air/water, lead free paint/water/gasoline? What will privatizing and creating profit motive in such public goods look like? If private roads are so great, why didn't private institutions come up with the national highway system? If all roads become private, at what point does the supposed benefit of privatization get overtaken by decrease in network effect that public roads provided? Will you trust private security to enforce our laws? How will you privatize the justice system? In your view, what are the benefits of the profit motive behind private prisons?
