"Charging interest by non financial institutions is allowable. There is only one definition of illegal or criminal interest and this is regarding loan sharks. Section 347 of the Canadian Criminal Code makes it illegal to charge more than 60% annually. The biggest debate was whether or not ""pay day"" loan companies were breaking the law. The recent bill C-26 amends this section to exempt ""pay day"" loans from this definition."
