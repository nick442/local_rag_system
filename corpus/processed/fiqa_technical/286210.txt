"I have done Wal-Mart's in-store pickup exactly once and don't plan on doing it again. You'd think the item pickup would be at the Customer Service desk right next to the front door of the store. Wrong. It's at its own desk in the very back of the store next to the employee bathrooms/breakroom. The furthest it could possibly be from the front door. I wound up waiting longer for an attendant to mozy on back to the pick-up desk, dig out my items from the back, and ring me up than I would have taken getting the items myself. Seriously.. I rang the ""needs assistance"" buzzer at the pickup desk three times over the course of fifteen minutes and had to ask two employees having a chit chat ""break"" in the department directly outside of the pickup area to page someone before the employee responsible for minding the desk actually showed up. Turns out one of those employees having the chatting session was the person supposed to be helping us. Oh, and since the desk was right next to the employee bathrooms, several employees went back for breaks while we were waiting. Not one of them asked us if we were being helped (or really, spared us a glance in the first place.) And to top it all off..since I was wheeling a cart with bags of purchased merchandise and large boxes with electronics from the rear of the store instead of from the normal cash register area, *of course* I was eagerly interrogated by a receipt checker on the way out of the store. It was an exercise in extreme frustration. Never. Again."
