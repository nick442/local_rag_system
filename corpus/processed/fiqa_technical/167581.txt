Just short GS. http://www.google.com/finance?q=gs Much more fun. That list looks like a global macro short list. Shorting XOM, JNJ are systemic risk plays. The guys that stand out for specific risk: INTC AMZN ABT LMT BMY AMGN CMG AVB, I stopped reading after that. fundamentally I would long INTC as them and AMD are the market for CPU's. Maybe people are betting against pc's.. AMZN has a retardedly high facebook like P/E. I don't know enough about most of the risk.
