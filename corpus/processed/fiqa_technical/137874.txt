"> Asking people to travel less is silly, and punishing companies for CO2 emissions when there is no alternative is also silly, If the current science on climate change is true, and it certainly seems to be, then asking people to travel less or to produce less CO2 isn't ""silly"" , it's desperately important. It's really like a smoker with a nagging cough saying it's ""silly"" to consider stopping smoking. Don't get me wrong - I love to travel, I've been in dozens of countries. But I've cut back on my travel and even more been finding ways to travel with less footprint on the Earth (read: trains)."
