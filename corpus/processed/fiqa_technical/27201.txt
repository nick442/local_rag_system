If financial modelling, projections and market research were effective enough that they could predict with certainty what the price would do tomorrow, then everyone would use those techniques, buy now and make relatively risk-free profit tomorrow though, right? The point of an efficient market is that the price at any particular point in time incorporates all of the information available to the market at that moment. Given that, the price should be just as likely to go up tomorrow as go down. Whether it's reasonable to assume that the market is efficient is another question - at the very least though, I think it's reasonable to assume that people armchair investing at home don't have access to information that professional investors don't.
