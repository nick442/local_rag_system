It only changes things if Amazon throttles their speed or charges them a different rate to access AWS in a effort to stifle their competitive chances, which to my knowledge, Amazon doesn't do. But you know who does behave like that? The telecom companies that block municipal broadband companies from forming, or startup companies from accessing the fiber networks that they were subsidized with taxpayer money to build. Oh and they also have documented proof of throttling speeds to streaming services that compete with their broadcasting partners. THAT is monopolistic behavior and the kind of shit we need to be rallying against and calling for anti trust rulings. Not Amazon.
