Everyone seems to think Bezos is playing 3D chess but I could see this being like Google's brief Motorola Mobility purchase. They might see how unwieldy the whole thing is, maybe take a few things out of it, and sell it when the experiment is deemed a failure. I don't buy the whole, store as a delivery hub theory, as I don't see how their locations could realistically support any kind of mass delivery operation. I think it's mostly an effort to bring technology and Amazon branding to a physical footprint, and since food is hard to crack online, they figured they would do it via Whole Foods, especially since they have pretty high quality locations and aesthetically pleasing stores.
