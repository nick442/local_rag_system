Just my opinion.in Canada uni and college are different .college is much more practical and short term for example I can go learn HVaC (trade)in 6-8 months and have a job within a year or so) in college. I don't think there are courses more than 3 years in college (unless it's linked to university, but that college and uni usually have an agreement of some sort ) .it is also difficult to transfer credits from college to university (rather complex system up here) I went to college for nursing 3 years .my loans are under 18k total I'm set to make 50k minimum .college here is worth it to me. Now they've made it free to go to college if you make under 45k a year in the province of Ontario so now it's def worth it lol ðŸ˜‚ But I have many friends who are in the states, and they have terrible majors like global studies and some other nonsense I've never heard before, its clear that there is no job description for that and the institution is swindling students .seems that you have to be in the right field of study to be successful .just my two cents .depends on the country as well
