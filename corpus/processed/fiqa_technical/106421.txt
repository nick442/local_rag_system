Further evidence that the love of money is the root of all evil. Money is useless if not transformed into something material. Apparently Americans are duped by the wealth effect. If their portfolio has high numbers they feel rich and impoverish themselves by spending more of their income even though it is just ink and paper unless transformed into something tangible. Fools. The hoarders of money must be afraid they would run out, expose they have no usefull skills and have to do actual work for a living.
