Out of curiosity, why do you believe people will be all gung-ho for $35/hr. but not getting out of bed for $30? The bus idea is interesting, but it would be difficult to coordinate. Any given farm probably needs no more than one person, so you would have to find all the businesses in the general region needing workers (which may or may not be farms), and hope they too find suitable people in the same city. If you had a send a car for the person, you'd be paying more like $55/hr. when you factor in the perk offered.
