Thanks! > How do you believe it should be approached? Businesses should be more cognizant of the fact that they have enormous amounts of technical debt, or what will be considered to be debt, that will suddenly need to be solved. Infrastructure or applications that haven't seen a dime in 5+ years. Shadow IT that was stood up (e.g. hey we use this access database that everyone completely forgot about to meet this one specific need) and has somehow managed to survive. That's one of the most frequent issues that will grind consolidations to a halt. The business need to involve IT as early as possible in the M&A process. Cross-platform can usually be solved by some form of extraction, translaton, load processes. That's straightforward but it does take time. If you're a company that cares enough to have a disaster recovery team you should also have an IT M&A team that meets regularly to have a dry-run of an M&A that covers the processes from end to end for 2-3 worst-case-scenarios. New scenarios should be identified. If you do enough M&As you'll have compiled a fairly decent playbook of scenarios after the third or fourth. You'll have a well oiled machine that your investors can and should be proud of. For perspective the best M&A team I've seen was Microsoft's and even then shit regularly hits the fan for those guys when it comes to technical debt. That's something to keep in mind.
