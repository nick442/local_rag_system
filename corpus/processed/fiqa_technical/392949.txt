"Why would it being private be necessarily evil? And it is for profit, but it's not a business trying to maximize profits. It is trying to keep the banking system stable (among other uses), and a stable banking system benefits us all. Finally, the Fed is made of many branches, and they fight over policy, so it is not some monolithic entity trying to screw people. And it's private because history has shown giving politicians the power the Fed has turns out badly for economies, which is why most economies now structure ther central banking along similar lines. I actually started learning after reading ""The Creature from Jekyll Island"" which paint the Fed as a monster designed to rape the populace, and I was so outraged I wanted to help fight it. As I read through it's documents, read economic theory to understand, and read through historical boom and bust cycles, I learned that the Jekyll Island types vastly ignore large components of history and economics. The way I think of that book now is: if I only told you the cases where airbags killed poeple, you'd think airbags are horrible and should be banned, and I could list many details all of which could be true. But I'm ignoring many other needed facts. Without careful weighing of both sides including all data can you find that airbags are actually a very good thing, with some bad cases. The Fed to me is the same."
