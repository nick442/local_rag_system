A lot of the study numbers people put up also relate to your efficiency. I passed lvl1 straight out of undergrad with ~130 hours of actual study time. I kept a stop watch because I wanted to know how much time I actually spent eyes on book and figured out I spent close to 40% of my time in the library dicking around. so 150*.6 = 90 hours if you're able to focus.
