What concerns me is Japan's lost decade. They pulled the same shit the U.S. did 20 year earlier and they still haven't recovered. Now that our economy is global, Japan can't just start pushing exports to refuel their automotive sector, which in turn refuels their industrial sector etc etc. Once interest rates hit zero there's nothing left to be done. If this had happened to Japan 100 years ago perhaps they would have been able to introduce policies that would help a create a slower but steadier recovery. Now that our economy is global, Japan has no choice. They have to compete with the rest of the world. QE is our last chance. You can argue over whether it was the right call or not until the sun burns out. It's here now and if investors panic, that's it. There will be no reasonable investment, prompting no recovery. This is our only chance. It's nice that the market saw a huge run up when the Fed was flooding it with money. However, whether or not that decision will prompt a recovery is yet to be seen. Now that the Fed is easing we'll truly see what the last five years have all been for. edit: I mean, this is it. It will either work or it won't. This is where it all comes together or fails.
