"I laugh and say ""wouldn't you like to know!"" And then say ""no really, I'm not at liberty to discuss that."" I always go to chat up the competitors at their booths but ALWAYS keep it personal and neutral (like the weather or wow my feet hurt, etc.) You never know, you may be applying for a job there some day!"
