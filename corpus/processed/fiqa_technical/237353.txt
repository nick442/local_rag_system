Where was it reported that it was six figures per month? It isn't clear from the article what Mandiant's scope was that they were brought in under. I'm not even sure the way it reads that Mandiant found the Apache Struts-based breach while investigating the breach they were brought in for. Also, companies with an emphasis on IT like Equifax vary greatly in how they handle out-of-budget projects, and so far as I've read, it wasn't revealed how Mandiant's project was procured. Equifax is going to be a case study in business schools on the handling of this incident, and what not getting in front of a crisis looks like (for comparison, see how the Tylenol tampering was handled). Equifax should have reached out to all affected and said they automatically put a freeze on their records, and all affected now have an account created if they didn't already have an account, 7 years of free 100 freeze/unfreeze requests per year, 52 free credit report requests per year, and credit monitoring. If I was on the board, I would have told the CEO to make a generous offer to buy out LifeLock and put all affected onto their most comprehensive plan while working behind the scenes to revamp IT and information security, as well as rethink the industry. It would have been expensive as hell to do, but this is starting to grow into a Wells Fargo-scale career ending and industry-defining incident, and whatever cost savings they thought they got by cutting so many corners that enabled this breach and the weak response might get wiped out for the next 100 years of potential savings as odds increase weekly they'll be forced to adopt more regulatory oversight in the future. If they quietly get LifeLock's most comprehensive plan for all US federal and state legislators though, then they probably will escape real reform and might skate by on the weak response.
