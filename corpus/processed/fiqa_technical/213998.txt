It's not like there's a shortage of fiduciaries out there. If someone wants to pay a brokerage fee rather than a fiduciary fee, I don't see why they should be compelled to. A fiduciary duty is expensive, and will likely raise costs. If the problem is that people don't know whether advisors are fiduciaries, then it's a disclosure problem.
