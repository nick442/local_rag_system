"Microsoft still supports XP with security updates for large enterprise companies that are willing to pony up a few million for the support contracts because it's cheaper than upgrading existing infrastructure. I know at least 2 of the banks I've worked with are currently paying for extended XP support (although ironically, my understanding is that they're paying for desktop support so they have more time to migrate business critical legacy apps, rather than anything related to deployed ATM infrastructure) Most ATMs aren't ""online"" in any form that most people would associate with the internet. AFAIK most of the hacks against ATMs that don't require physical access are for stand-alone or retail based machines (Think of the unbranded ATMs you see in gas stations or stores that only take cash). Although if anyone happens to have details on a Major bank ATM exploit, I'd love to see the details."
