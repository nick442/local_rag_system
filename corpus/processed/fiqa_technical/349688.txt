You might want to [read this one too.. that talks about the bonuses paid out to execs while the company was going under](http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/17686). This wasn't just a well run company that went under temporarily. They had an awesome product and loads of cash and squandered it at the expense of the taxpayer. .. while the executives got rich. >In sum: The president of the United States, Michigan’s former governor, the state’s two U.S. senators and the U.S. Secretary of Energy promised thousands of jobs from a company that in a mere two years went bankrupt. Despite a bankruptcy or buyout predicted by outside observers, the company continued to reward its top executives while laying off most of its workforce. Defend that if you want. me, I'll go look at the few A123 cells that I have and be pissed off that the execs got a dime for failing with a great product.
