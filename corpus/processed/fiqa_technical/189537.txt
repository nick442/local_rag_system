> Net neutrality isn't about them having free connections to the Internet, it's about preventing Internet service providers from using their position of power to choose which traffic to let through. This is /r/business, so let me be clear: *It's just business.* Repeat that. *It's just business.* It isn't about people on the right not letting people on the left talk. It's about using pricing power (yes, gasp) to make a profit. If that's problematic for you, then /r/business might not be the best place for discussion. >When Comcast and Verizon have their own video services or products that compete with online entities like Netflix and Hulu, that neutrality is what stands between them and monopolistic blocking of competition. Using your competitive advantage to compete is literally the definition of business. How is this wrong? Why should Netflix and Hulu be able to free-ride off of a competitors fixed infrastructure? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here.
