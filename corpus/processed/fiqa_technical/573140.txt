Melodrama much? The only reason this hurts the franchise system is because it prevents the franchiser from profiting from labor violations at the franchise level. So, sure some franchises might not be viable anymore, but that might not be so bad for society as a whole, those jobs will just transition to other food joints. In terms of franchiser operational changes, its not going to change anything other than the cost of drafting up some company wide pay policies and reworking the franchise contracts to allow McDs to revoke franchise licenses in the event that they violate labor laws.
