I have shoes in 10, 10.5, and 11 in my closet right now. I think sizing between the same _types_ of shoes tends to be reasonably consistent (ex trainers from Nike and Adidas, though I did have an issue with that recently)- but you'll be different comparing say, boots to dress shoes to those trainers. FWIW I generally tend to size down 0.5-1 for boots depending on their last, actual size for dress shoes, and up half a size for athletics.
