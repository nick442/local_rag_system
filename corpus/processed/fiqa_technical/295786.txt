"My prediction: They are purposefully suppressing the price. Chinese crypto-exchanges will be temporarily closed at the end of this month. The Communist party leaders and PBoC insiders will have access to cheap bitcoin. After they are sufficiently happy with their bitcoin acquisition, they release a new statement that says exchanges can re-open. The supply has been significantly reduced because of insiders attaining bitcoin behind the scenes during the ""shut down"". Because of the low supply, the price skyrockets to $10k. They all make significant sums of money. So do you want to be on the sidelines during this, or do you want to join in on the fun? I know what I'll be doing :)"
