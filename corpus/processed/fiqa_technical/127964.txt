Well, you should have something that you are passionate about, but you don't necessarily need to choose a coverage right away. Many enter as generalists for IB, buy side and sell side. However, if you are going to create a buy side report, you should tailor it to what sectors or criteria the firm selects from. If the firm you are talking to invests in consumer staples, energy and financials, a tech buy side report makes little sense. At the same time, if they are interested in tech, try and narrow it down. Are they interested in tech mfg such as chips or electronics? Or are they interested in internet companies, service firms, BPOs, etc?
