Look, the fact is that Kyrie was never going to be the main guy. No matter what you do, when you're on a LeBron team, you are second fiddle. I know some people such as yourself will say that kyrie is ruining his legacy by leaving but without him, Cleveland aren't the heavy east favorites they were. Now, I am a sucker for D Rose, so this may be the first time I root for anybody in a Cleveland jersey but we'll get to see just how important kyrie was to that team this season.
