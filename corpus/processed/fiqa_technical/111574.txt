Not entirely true and depends who maintains the roads. At the state level, it depends on the state - some fund a large chunk out of gas taxes, some out of vehicle registration fees, and some fund more out of other taxes. Then you get down to the county level, and local level and it's even more varied. Things maintained by the municipal government are often funded more by property tax than by fuel tax. On top of that, there's a large chunk administered at the state and local level, but funded by federal dollars that came from income taxes or sources other than fuel taxes.
