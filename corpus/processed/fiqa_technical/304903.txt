Good for him that he is fascinated by actuarial science. I don't think I am fascinated, just mildly interesting. I feel I am making a grave mistake since I do not have this fascination. I feel it will get me into that world. Instead of being an employee at Citigroup I'll be an actuary. I want my life to be a spectacular adventure and I feel that being an actuary will help. Kind of like Frodo's journey to destroy the ring rather than solely living his life at the Shire.
