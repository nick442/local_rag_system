Nowhere does that say PV uses rare earths. It says some thin film cells use tellurium, but that's not a rare earth element. The only substantial use of an uncommon element in silicon PV cells (which comprise 90+% of the market) is silver for front contacts, and that's being replaced for cost reasons. And silver is also not a rare earth element.
