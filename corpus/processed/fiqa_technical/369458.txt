"Watching all the news about the Euro, I ""feel"" that maybe the British made the right choice about staying away. I would feel annoyed if I was in one of the other countries (e.g. Ireland) and the deal had been rammed through and imposed on me. The interesting thing for me - In Ireland's case they need to have a refurendum. I wonder if they will accept this? I am not an expert on european fiscal union or anything, but this new treaty has been a surprise to me - almost bolting the door after the horse has bolted"
