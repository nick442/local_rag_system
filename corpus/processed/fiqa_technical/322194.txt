Yes you will pay interest and youll have to ensure you dont have an early pay off penalty. Just say you cant make it in until later in the week. The time for the loan paperwork and the hit to your credit score (what happens if you dont get approved by some freak reason?) In myopinion its worth the wait because even with the loan youll most likely have to put aome money down and depending on where you live youll have loan setup fees or a percentage takwn out for loan origination fees.
