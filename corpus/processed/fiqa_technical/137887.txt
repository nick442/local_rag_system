">No system is going to be perfect, especially one that is totally inflexible. Certainly. But you come right back to the need for ""good/wise management"". And part of that is constructing a system that doesn't have OBVIOUS and BLATANT loopholes. >>But it is a lot easier to say no to someone when you can back it up by saying ""I think this is going to take 2,000 hours and the CEO has only granted you 1,000 hours. Figure out what you can live without and get back to me."" And you have just given an example of a very BAD/UNWISE management system, and likely entirely arbitrary budgets (does the CEO know his arse from a hole in the ground? Why was 1,000 hour budgeted? How many departments are going to be allocated 1,000 hours and yet have little or no use for them? {But of course, as will ALL ""budgeting"" systems, those hours are probably ""use it or lose it"" -- so the department head of dept A will be deprived because of the arbitrary/past-weighted allocations, and the head of dept B will end up wasting 1,000 hours on crap just to make sure he gets 1,000 hours again next year). Bad management tends to build management systems that are even WORSE than their original management. *And if you lived under your ""budgeted hours"" system for a couple of years.. you'd be back here bitching about how STUPID that system is.*"
