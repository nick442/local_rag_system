I'll mention the same thing I said to /u/jemacmillan, a family of three is dad, mom and kid, not dad, mom and three kids. A living wage to provide absolute necessities is different from a living wage + expendable income like many here seem to think. All anyone is asking is to be able to make enough, on minimum wage, to pay their rent and utilities, put food on the table for their kids and some clean clothes on their back. No one is asking for new iPhones, a Mercedes or any other luxury. People are asking to be able to _live_.
