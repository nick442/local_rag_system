You probably cant live in Manhattan on 1800 per month with such little savings. Try for Brooklyn or Queens with several room mates. Jersey City is likely out of your price range as well. It would be wise to leverage technology to help keep your budget and savings projections under control during this time and moving forward. Whether you use a spreadsheet or a tool like OnTrajectory.com or some other website -- you have to get everything out in front of you so you can make smarter decisions. Once you do that, then you will be able to get the most out of your savings and income. Good luck!
