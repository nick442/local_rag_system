This slave rents from slumlords now. They suck, but at least I was able to keep my dog. The 10 years that it will take to rebuild my credit is daunting, but it's not okay to artificially inflate the price of something, only to drop it back down to half of the original price in the span of 2 years. Nothing happened to that neighborhood. It was and still is quiet and lovely. But the schools there were abysmal, and I can't let my very gifted daughter think she's doing well when she's not working for the A that she gets.
