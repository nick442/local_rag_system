The best way to end the gaming of patents is to simplify the system. Just go back to the old rule of patents being good for one year after issuance. There are other issues like what should or shouldn't be patented, but just having the rule of patents being good for one year makes other issues relative minor ones when it comes to the monopolistic effect of patents. The more complex we make the system just increases the permutations for abuse.
