">It was a discussion about revenue recognition from the sales of iPhones, and whether it would be better for Apple if the regulation was changed to allow immediate recognition rather than deferring the income.. My argument is that it didn't matter one bit, because nothing is changing about how the company is actually run. Cash flow in and out of the company doesn't change.. The Accounting majors largely disagreed with me, while the Finance majors largely agreed. There are too many ways to ""buy"" an iPhone. While some assumptions could be made to make revenue recognition more uniform, cash flow could be wildly different and isn't guaranteed based on the number of units sold. If everyone paid in full with cash, this wouldn't be the case. However, the large majority of iPhone owners acquire their phones via carrier subsidy with another major group buying them on payment plans either from their carrier or directly from Apple."
