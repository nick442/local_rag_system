Isn't that the very definition of civilization - banding together and making choices for the betterment of *society*, even while possibly *not* the betterment of *every* individual? The truth is we all do this everyday. I guarantee that you inadvertently made a decision that pissed on some poor souls day yesterday, and you probably did it with the best intentions for you and yours.. And here is an example that I am sure you will be thrilled about: eminent domain. It almost always sucks for the land owner, but if done right can benefit society at large greatly.
