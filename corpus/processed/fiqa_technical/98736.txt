">Please explain who is being held down in this situation. An employment agreement is voluntary. Wages are set by supply and demand. Please study the history of the labor movement in the United States. There's a reason we're paid actual money and not ""company bucks."" Because businesses WILL find a way to pay employees nothing if they can. > So you want to violently intervene and kill off the livelihoods of people because they voluntarily work for a business you deem too unprofitable to exist? No. I want to ensure that the price paid for labor matches its real cost. Again, study the labor movement. >The jobs will be replaced by machines and the people whose jobs you killed now live 100% on the dole, likely forever. Most of the people affected will be minorities. I can't imagine a more heinous and racist act of economic violence. Sounds like the same fucking thing people (racists) said during the labor movement. > Individuals who would rather see perfectly able bodied people 100% on the dole rather than providing for themselves should be ashamed. Seriously, fuck you and fuck your violent and racist policies. People who don't study history are doomed to repeat it. Seriously, fuck you and your complete and total ignorance of history and complete lack of understanding about basic economic theory."
