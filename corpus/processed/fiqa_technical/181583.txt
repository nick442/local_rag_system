When they need more capital and it becomes cheaper to finance that capital through an IPO rather than taking out more debt. There certainly isn't a magic point at which they *should* go public. On the other hand, I have a feeling that Musk is probably more than content to not have to do IR for Spacex alongside Tesla, so I doubt we'd see it for quite some time.
