me personally, i couldnt care less about what people do, but when you see reports where drug rehab, for a family member that is not hired by the company, cost a company 1/4 mil, thats something to consider as a business owner. so yeah, the employee may not have a problem, but if its permissible in their lifestyle, and your company covers other people not hired by the company, theres a huge loss potential that the company can do nothing about, other than utterly ban such culture from the work place.
