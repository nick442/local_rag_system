"They aren't choosing winners and losers, if you want to use the game analogy then they are disqualifying assholes who flount an attitude of ""fuck you, I won't play by the rules"". Your statement is the equivalent of a soccer fan getting pissed at the refs for DQing a player for picking up the ball over their head and running it to the goal over and over."
