Rapid tooling is still the result of an additive manufacturing driven by CAM. The machining process is no difference with production tooling. It need CNC machining, EDM machining, wire-cut machining, grinding, polishing and fitting. The rapid tooling will be design as simple as possible but on the condition of the that the ultimate parts will meet appearance, finish and dimension tolerance requirements. But the speed of the rapid prototyping mould will be much quicker than production or pre-production tooling.
