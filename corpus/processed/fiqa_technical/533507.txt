"> If an employer sent this to me I'd seriously consider that a threat in regards against how I practice my political beliefs. Why? There's no way the boss can know who voted for who, and it doesn't sound like he's threatening to hire people Obama bumper stickers or anything like that. This looks to me more like an attempt to inform his employees about how public policy can affect the company. (Note that I'm not saying his representations of and predictions about Obama's policies are accurate, but if they are, this is a perfectly reasonable statement to make.) > It undermines my right to educate myself. I have no idea what you mean by that. Someone giving you information ""undermines your right"" to gather information from other sources?"
