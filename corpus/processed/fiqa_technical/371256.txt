Not at all. Whenever demand growth outstrips supply growth, prices rise, driving innovation, discovery, and economisation, allowing more of the population, if not the entire population, to sustain itself and eventually thrive, the very process which has held off the Malthusian problem for centuries. From that perspective, the headline is a bit hyperbolic because the answer is simple, even if not necessarily easy: adapt. Odds are Egypt will start seeking new trade deals with other countries in an effort to bolster growth in available necessities. This will drive food producers to become more efficient and more productive, which will have benefits for years to come. Assuming there are any, there's a good chance we'll see Egyptian tariffs start declining as a result; at first Egypt will probably seek bilateral free trade deals and, if those prove insufficient, they'll probably just cut/drop tariffs on their own.
