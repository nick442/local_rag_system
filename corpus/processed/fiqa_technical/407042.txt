I think the control freak stems from the fact he was kicked out of Tribe.net, a social networking site he founded in 2003, by the VC investors. He initially bootstrapped Zynga (with money from the 3 previous companies he founded) so he could maintain control after taking VC money. A special class of stock for the founder(s) in the tech world is not without precedent. Google is structured the same way.
