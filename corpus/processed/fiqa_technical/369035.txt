The free market will determine exchange rates. But only sort of. If anyone leaves the euro expect and immediate mother-of-all-bank-runs. Then the new currency will begin to trade both officially and unofficially and eventually a market clearing price will be set. Whether that lands on an officially pegged rate or at a discount to that rate is a total crapshoot and not even worth trying to predict.
