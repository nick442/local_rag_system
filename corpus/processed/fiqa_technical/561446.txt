no, it doesn't mean it's right at all. They probably sell them at a premium now boasting that they are 'all American made' New coke all over again? I live in a little town on the south west of Scotland called Kilmarnock. One of our last major manufacturers is in the final phases to pull out after being there since 1820. The name? Johnnie Walker - you may have heard of them. Another major manufacturing company left a skeleton crew a good number of years ago - there are still steam engines that were built there running in Africa even today. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Barclay_Sons_%26_Co. And one last company http://www.masseyferguson.com/EMEA/GB/about/242.aspx Do you know what ultimately killed these 3 companies in Kilmarnock? The workers, or at least - or - to be more precise the Unions. Not that I'm against unions - at least not the realistic ones. Johnnie Walker is the last large manufacturing giant to move out of Kilmarnock. A town that is now pretty much a ghost town with an incompetent council. All were high paid jobs - I'm sure we would all love $25 an hour to press an on off button and watch an emergency stop, how many do that here for less? Why should the above have been getting more? Because they could, they were so used to the high life (when things were good) that they would not settle for anything else, ultimately running the companies out of the area when machines and lesser workforce were more than capable. Diageo (JW owner) is pulling the line back to a generic factory in another Scottish location, cheaper to run, more modern and lesser wages. I'm glad to see manufacturing coming back and having worked in customer relations for a large conglomerate I think we are on the brink of change. It's still up hill and you'll be talking to Indians by the name of Frank for a few years yet to come - but it's impacting their bottom line and at the end of the day -- THAT is all that matters. It's the massive conglomerates we need to worry about - they'll destroy people and tradition to pad their wallets. Oh, yeah.. tradition - Cadbury - just came to mind. Why do we let them get so big? when just one slice and thousands of people and products are off the shelves for good .. even when they are profitable? http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/taxpayers-braced-for-1bn-blow-from-rbs-scandals-8002175.html http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2196043/RBS-blasted-3-2m-golden-hello-paid-new-retail-chief-Ross-McEwan.html It does sicken me that when austerity bites - the people at the top who cream the riches during the good never seem to suck up the piss during the bad. But going back on topic, if you are not willing to do the job for $15 dollars an hour that's fair enough -- but I'm sure there are still plenty of other Americans that would love that job and they know it.
