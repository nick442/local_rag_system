I did answer, and you not only misinterpreted my answers but presumed I hold opinions that I don't, then argued against those opinions I had never expressed, using arguments based on unsupported speculation rather than fact, and couching your response in personal attacks. You're being ridiculous, which is why I'm done attempting to discuss the topic with you.
