"The ""cannot be used for gift cards"" clause is part of a contract. Target agreed to this breach of contract by allowing customers to buy a gift card with a gift card. From a legal standpoint Target should have refused the purchases, but since it allowed the purchases to occur in plain site I doubt a judge would find a customer at fault."
