I don't look down on poor people at all. I've been there. I'm just trying to describe the correct attitude that will help one rise up out of poverty. Blaming others, blaming 'the system', blaming your parents, blaming minimum wage, blaming your boss, blaming social media, blaming the news, blaming the Russians, blaming immigrants ---- NONE of that shit is going to help YOU get out of poverty. Taking responsibility for your own life is the only way out. Luckily we live in a system that allows you do to that. There are other systems. You could have been assigned a job at birth, because that's what you father did. Do you like that system better? What are you even so worked up about? What have I said that is factually incorrect? What do you think should happen in Society? Should the wealthy just give money to the poor? Would that make you happy? Like, what are you even arguing for?
