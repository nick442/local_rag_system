"Fuck this ""I'm going to slave away for your bank for 18 hours a day because money"" mindset. It's so shortsighted. You can suck a banks dick for 18hours a day for ten years and maybe they'll grace you with partner, or you could shit out a couple iPhone games and build WordPress sites and pull in fatty bucks while working from home in silk underwear. EDIT: Yall mad that I'm challenging your work to death lifestyle huh? Don't be butthurt because you've been sucking bank cock for twenty years and it turns out a millennial can learn frontend in a couple months and instantly make what took you 10 years to get. I'm dumb as fuck and I swang it, it's the future, wake up. EDIT2: Downvote away, if you're an analyst, one of us is going to automate your job in about a decade. Good luck."
