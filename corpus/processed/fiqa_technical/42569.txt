Family has owned a gas stations for 10+ years. Gas is a bitch to own and most retailers make about 20Â¢ a gallon profit not including insurance/repairs. Hard to find gas station pump parts along with the high cost of repairing it if it breaks. It's mainly used to attract customers inside the store because that's where you make the profit.
