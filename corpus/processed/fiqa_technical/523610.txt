In most cases there is no debt attached to those properties, so there is no risk to financial institutions. So that leaves us with an increase in supply of houses most people can't afford at current prices, expect a short-term boost to construction while many are converted to duplex/apartment type properties and slight downward pressure on prices. Obviously these are wild generalisations and the effect will be massively different in most cities compared to rural or small-town areas.
