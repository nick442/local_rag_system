I'm a Canadian who regularly travels to US (9-10 times a year) and I hope I'm not offending anyone when I say that every airline within US is garbage - except for Alaska but that's west and I live on the east. It boggles my mind how poor the customer service is and how little you get for your money. My least favorite is United .. of the 20+ flights I've done with them 0 have departed on time or wasn't cancelled. I now try my best to only do Air Canada which isn't the best bang for your buck but at least it has slightly better legroom and interactive TVs for every seat.
