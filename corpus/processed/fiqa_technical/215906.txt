I went to a local college for 8k/yr while living at home. Since I didn't have to take any loans, I'm a lot better off than those people who went to 40k/yr schools and are up the river with loans. I think most local cheap school systems are good enough for majors that don't require the prestige of a major school system. It really makes 0 sense to spend 40k/yr if you're going to become a teacher and I think more and more people will start to realize this. Stay in state, don't live on campus = save moneys.
