FYI: This article is rife with errors/omissions/bends, including, but not limited to: * The date/time when these restaurants closed * the implied reason for their closing (consumer taste had little to do with it) * The idea that Evo Morales had anything to do with the shutdown of 8 restaurants This article is a bit amateurish and clearly contains an alarmist agenda. Nothing to see here.
