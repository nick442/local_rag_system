Retail is not in crisis.. In fact it in in a reinvention stage. You see the problem Sears is facing, and Wal-Mart will face is the fact that the digital transformation is proving to be a jobs engine therefore meaning it will not stop. Additionally you have the problem of selection.. Wal-Mart, Sears, KMart all use to work for busy busy Americans in a up swinging economy. Quick one stop shops that were often much cheaper then their local counter parts. This was achieved by using the same model that is now completely obsolete. That model paired large broad selection spanning multiple departments and categories. This model could never afford to display a full variety of products in any one category so it choose a selection of strong selling brands. It was all mass appeal. Today more and more consumers want a bigger selection, nicer cutting edge products, and knowledge. Additionally they want speed and convenience. Nothing about this describes a Wal-Mart which are usually located in-between residential areas, as opposed to strip malls which have crept into many suburban areas. Same with Sears. Malls scream traffic and time, and are usually located far away from main street and my street. Want a true prediction. The death of Sears is followed by a rapid decline in Wal-Mart as Kroger overtakes Wal-Mart in reach and scale. LIDL grows across the landscape capitalizing on excess retail space. Amazon splits into two; with grocery/pharmacy being a major piece of a new company and they continue to streamline your grocery visit. And last but not least, main street thrives. With The big department stores disappearing, their competition will fill the void. Best part of this scenario is the result in the economic market.
