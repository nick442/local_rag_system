First, it all depends on whether the wrong person actually goes bankrupt at all, which would be very unlikely if not impossible in an economic scenario of perfect competition (this is because a share of your market is practically guaranteed). Second, Securing new capital to keep things going would be relatively simple; At a new bond auction, people can put new measured capital in, and they get new bonds out, increasing their wallet size (if someone invests $500 of capital at a 5% interest rate for a one year bond, they immediately get back a note with the purchasing power of $525, which they can spend right away if they wish (if inflation is going to happen anyway, why not beat it to the punch?)). Third, it's not as if every single company in the whole territory is going to have their bonds zooming around as the money supply at one time; They might be as few as five at one time to twenty at another, depending on the diversity of peoples preferences for monetary activity, be it an easy or tight monetary policy (obviously the market would decide exchange rates, no one's arguing that) Fourth, even if they ever did go bankrupt, since you already used up your share of their bonds, the other firms can't blame you for that, because you honestly went about using them with no knowledge that the firm would go bankrupt ever. Think of the Schrodinger's cat assumption applying.
