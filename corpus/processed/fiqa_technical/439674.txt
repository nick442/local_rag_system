"You should brand that truck, definitely. Slogans.. ""Ever catch yourself saying, 'poop, I did it again'? Call now."" When you brand that truck, the number one, and I mean the only thing, you have to do is get peoples attention. No matter how odd. The potty truck Hurtinalbertan linked to is a great example of it. Marketing at its core is a simple principle, AIDA: Attention Interest Desire Action. Get the attention of the end-user (""poop I did it again,"" plays on the hasbeen of Brit Spears single), interest them with appealing facts or figures (99% of people wait until it's too late!), create a subconscious desire or urge (don't wait until it's too late), and direct them to how they act upon this desire (call NOW!)."
