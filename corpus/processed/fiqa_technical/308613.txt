"I agree with Hurler_Jones. No banker is a good banker, especially these people. You want me to feel bad for a ""big"" bank employee, the same people who have shit on the middle class and poor people for the last 30 years and singlehandedly destroyed the American economy. Anybody who works at a big bank should be ashamed of themselves and deserves at the very least to get fired."
