Some people cannot get bank accounts because they have been seized by a creditor or they're illegal. Some companies don't (or can't) deal with paper checks. Giving them a prepaid debit card and auto depositing it to the card is sometimes simpler or cheaper. Hell, when I was on unemployment the government tried to make me receive the funds on a debit card. It was a major pain just to get the money sent to my bank account.
