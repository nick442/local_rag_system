"If banks really controlled house prices, then why do banks now own a shitload of houses that are no longer being paid for? So many that they can't sell them now because that would drive prices down even more, and they'd lose more. Sigh.. go ahead and continue to blame ""them"" for everything. It's easier that way, because then you will never have to take responsibility for any of your mistakes."
