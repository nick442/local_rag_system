"You're right. We have only one historical example of successfully getting these types of policies changed, and that was by ""striking."" And not just symbolic, two-days-and-we're-back type stuff. These were serious challenges to the normal government monopoly on violence. Laws were passed trying to force workers back to their jobs and/or mandate free passage across the picket line by scab workers, which put the police in the position of having to try to enforce those laws, which resulted in armed conflict between police and strikers. People on both sides died. The result: Workplace safety laws, the end of child labor, the weekend, the 40-hour work week, and all the other stuff we now enjoy. (Or rather that Europeans enjoy, even though Americans fought just as hard and died just as much to achieve them.)"
