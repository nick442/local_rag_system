I’m pretty sure that’s what has happened / is happening everywhere. However, as a side effect, if I’m getting an 8 dollar burrito it is going to be Chipotle Quality, not Taco Bell. So the companies who’s model was “eat here, we are fast and cheap.” Got squeezed out of the market by companies who are able to be fast, marginally more expensive, but vastly better quality. Also, the cheapest fast food restaurants are inferior goods. Their failure is a sign of a strong economy. Plus, tastes change. For the same reason JC Penny and Sears were once booming models but are now shuttering left and right. In this case though it is often health preferences. Perhaps they just can’t afford employment because their business model is outdated and is now failing.
