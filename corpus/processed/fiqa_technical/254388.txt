It has everything to do with post-tax earnings. You can only contribute into a Roth IRA up to either $5500 or your taxable compensation (wages, salaries, self-employment income, commissions, etc.), whichever is less. So your contributions have already been taxed as income (either withheld or when you file your 1040 next year). Importantly, this means that you can't contribute gifts, previous savings, unearned income, or under-the-table earnings that you don't report* into a Roth (of course, this only is a factor if you report less than $5500 in income since money is fungible). *Note: I mention this for completeness, not as a recommendation, unreported income can get you into hot water, just ask Mr. Capone..
