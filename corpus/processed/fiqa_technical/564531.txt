I wonder that if one of us were going to start the next SoundCloud (even though many great independent artist streaming sites already exist), how would we succeed where they failed? was it an issue of not monetizing early? Charging for memberships? Getting in bed with the record companies from the jump? Buying hot startups in music like Genius? Expanding into video content game like Buzzfeed, or physical products like Majestic Casual? This would be a great case study. What would you guys think?
