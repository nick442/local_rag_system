That's the real tale of this story. It's not like it's hard for the owner to find an employee for subway. The employee worked in this arrangement for 2 years happily because it makes a whole lot more sense than working 2 jobs 25 to 30 hours a week. Some shit hit the fan that inevitably always will in low pay low skill jobs and the employee is gonna stick it to his boss. He has the right to do so and he'll win easily the owner was a dumb ass for doing the deal.
