">*Newly released Census data reveals nearly 110 million Americans – more than one-third of the country – are receiving government assistance of some kind.* >*The number counts people receiving what are known as “means-tested” federal benefits, or subsidies based on income. This includes welfare programs ranging from food stamps to subsidized housing to the program most commonly referred to as “welfare,” Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.* >*At the end of 2012, according to the stats, 51.5 million were on food stamps, while 83 million were collecting Medicaid – with some benefiting from multiple programs.* >*Though the programs were created to help those in need, some analysts worry that the way they’re designed is, increasingly, incentivizing people not to work. They note that when recipients combine several government assistance programs, in many cases they pay better than going to work.* >*The Cato Institute’s Michael Tanner said that in the eight most generous states, the benefits can be tantamount to a $20 minimum wage – which would exceed the $7.25 minimum wage in most states.* >*“So in many cases people could actually do better on welfare than they could in an entry level job,"" Tanner said.* Cross-post from /r/MAConservative"
