"We raise beef cattle. Over the last few years I've seen a growing number of farmers going back to rotational grazing and abandoning the large scale mowing of hay for winter feeding. We have always used a simple rotation, most farmers do, but simply adding one field more to the rotation has cut the amount of hay we need in half. Our results have been good, so we're going to do more in the future while increasing the size of the herd at the same time. We're likewise looking for ways to reduce petroleum based fertilizers via manure, plant species previously considered invasive or not of use, and someday I'll probably look into multispecies grazing seriously. This is a good article. The black or white duality is bullshit. There are plenty of ways to increase efficiency without the extremes of ""industrial ag"" or ""vegan hippy farm""."
