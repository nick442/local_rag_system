It is, even when we were bidding major projects we could pretty much guess who was going to get the contract before hand. We only put bids in on the ones we might not win because often times the major project would get broken up into several smaller ones because one manufacturer couldn't produce fast enough, or didn't have enough stock for the client's entire job. Our major projects guys had inconsistently difficult jobs, one month they would be in the office until midnight. The next month they would be playing golf at 2pm on a Wednesday.
