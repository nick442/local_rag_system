Bloomberg Commodity Index is one you check out. [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BCOM:IND) Oil does have a heavier weighting though (around 20% through Brent and WTI iirc) so while things like aluminium, gold, corn etc are up for the year BCOM is down YTD. Still a decent broad-based index for you to consider.
