Some people may be prosperous that live in a city, but there are few prosperous cities. Most cities in the US are hand to mouth on funding, many large and mid-sized cities are in or going to be in trouble over worker pensions/retirement funding. The infrastructure in most cities is in poor repair. The nearest one to me needs $1 billion+ to fix the water system, that doesn't include roads or bridges. The countryside is where resources are produced, be it food, timber, ore mining, etc.. that is where wealth is produced. A city with no resources is an empty city.
