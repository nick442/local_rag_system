It was literally run by college kids. It was closest to the college dorms to walk so every employee including the managers were college age kids. They didn't give a fuck. Got comped a meal and free drinks when there was a hair in our food. Thing was, it used to be good. However, incidents like the hair in the food happened all the time. Everyone in town knew to avoid it.
