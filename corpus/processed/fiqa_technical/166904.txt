It’s all about networking in this situation. I don’t mean the gauge business sense of building relationships. It’s about going around 24/7 with the how can I help people attitude. Same for social media. For instance write 15 articles (2000+ words) per month about various things you sell focusing on your area. Attend, as has been a aid, local conferences and volunteer to help at local community events, etc. Small local businesses are hard. Most of the time it’s not about getting one things right, but about getting a lot of little things right over a long period. That’s what made Walmart such a success. Good luck!
