"> She isn't asking for society to bear her burdens. She's asking for society to pay her a reasonable wage for her labor. Asking society to implement a policy that will ultimately serve to harm more people* > So you read the article, but then chose to ignore all the arguments showing that this would not, in fact, ruin the economy?

For the record, I would be in favor of a scaled negative income tax. > Tell me - when drug companies hike the prices of essential medicine, do you also argue that it would ""ruin our economy"" or ""cause a lot more suffering""? Or do you just shrug and go ""they're charging what the market will bear""? It would depend on the situation and why they were doing it, but generally speaking, I fucking hate the way that our drug industry is set up, for a whole host of reasons. I think it definitely harms more people than it helps. > Why is that for folks like you, it's always fine if companies raise prices; but if employees want a higher wage, it's an outrage? Because you have created a group in your head that you are against, then you lump anyone that doesn't agree with you on other issues into that group without actually having a conversation to find out if they really do believe what you assume they believe. You know how conservatives will sometimes go, ""stupid liberals""? Don't assume you're above making that same kind of generalization about other people. I understand why both sides do it, because it's entertaining to watch stupid people from the other side get interviewed and fail on issues that you agree with."
