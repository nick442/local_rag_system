Tax cuts do lead to economic growth, and why not? More money circulating in the private economy is good for everybody. Itâ€™s why the stock market is up big on the prospect for tax cuts. The problem is the rosy growth projections that accompany these plans. The growth will occur, but the pace of growth is a big question and very hard to model. So a prudent policy proposal would be to cut spending as well while the growth materializes. Then (hopefully) that spending cut becomes permanent as the economy grows so the private economy grows at the expense of the state.
