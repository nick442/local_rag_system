I would say that there are places where you are indeed a code monkey, and what you learn is easily transferred. i.e: If you know Java, or RoR, it's easy to get started at a new job where the apps are built with those languages. However, if you're able to get some, Murex, Kondor+ or Calypso training or exposure under your belt, your skills are much more highly sought after, and can get you a much higher salary than an ordinary code monkey. At the end of the day managing is managing, regardless of whether you're managing code monkeys or Murex developers.
