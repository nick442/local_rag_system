Economists are interested in incentives. Here, government set up incentives for banks to make bad loans. The banks share blame, but they were rationally responding to bad incentives. We can criticize the banks all we like, but if we'd rather fix problems than point fingers, we have to address the incentives. The incentives are the source of the problem, and government policies are the source of the incentives.
