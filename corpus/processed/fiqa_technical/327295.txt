My current strategy is long equity in blue chips with limited growth but large profits.. Some call that value investing. GM, AAPL, BRK.B have done very well for me. VZ is a notable straggler. Regardless, my overall positions have grown considerably :) Not a fan of shorting.. but TSLA would be my short of choice since it is very expensive to short SHLD.
