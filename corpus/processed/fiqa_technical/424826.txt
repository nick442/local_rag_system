If you want the flexibility to make additional payments you should favour a flexible ISA. Shop around on comparators and you should be able to find a few that responds to your minimum interest rates Fixed-term ISAs are comparable to a bond: money goes in on day one and then no more deposit are allowed. The rate is fixed for the period. Even though they have a fixed you would still be able to withdraw cash but this would cost you an interest penalty. Not being able to withdraw money is asking the banks to take responsibility on your behalf.. They won't do that
