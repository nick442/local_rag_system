By in large they are. I've worked in this industry. Inversions work because the US has CFC tax and the highest tax rate in the world, 35%. This means that any money made by the company in any part of the world is subject to US tax less tax paid locally. E.g. Burger king in Dublin pays 12.5% locally and 22.5% to the US. The company inverts to a country that doesn't have CFC then transfers all the non-US companies to the other jurisdiction. Now what also tends to happen is income stripping such as intra-group, inter-company loans with the interest stripping earnings. That or intellectual property. However a company can only do that where the new group is made up of 80% other co and 20% existing co, at a minimum. This doesn't happen too much.
