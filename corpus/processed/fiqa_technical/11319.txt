The smart phone platform vendors are missing out on a new niche that would make life easier for corporate workers and IT departments alike. The current problem is the 'BYOD' trend, of every office worker wanting to bring their own device, iPhone, tablet, whatever. This is a problem because this is an uncontrolled environment from an IT point of view. What if there was an app that ran on android/iOS/windows8/whatever that acted as a Virtual Phone that was encrypted and walled off from the rest of the users phone. And it is under complete control of corporate IT, so they are happy too. It would have its own number and act like a separate phone. However the user would only have one phone taking up pocket space, instead of classic situation of carrying their own phone and a 'work' phone. The best company placed for this is RIM. They have a lot of experience in integrating phones to corporate environments. IT departments already have experience with the blackberry platform. They still have a large amount of money to burn in a Hail Mary project such as this and they are (or were) desperate enough to try such a change in direction. They should exit the hardware business and make a virtual phone app that corporate IT can roll out to employees phones. Hell it would even be cheaper for companies than handsets alone. They would own this market outright and if executed well, most companies would be on board and RIM would be back with the massive profit margins software usually carries. Instead of the lower margin hardware usually has.
