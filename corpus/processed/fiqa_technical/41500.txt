"You need to go read a good history book (not Zinn). The problem prior to the CRA of 1965 is that the GOVERNMENT itself institutionalized bigotry. This is unacceptable because all citizens are supposed to be equal *before the law and their goverment*. The CRA overstepped its bounds, however, insofar as it attempted to enforce ""equality"" by some definition in the PRIVATE sector and this leads to no good endgame. It puts the revolting government bottom feeders into the position of deciding what is ""fair"" and who should get what. This ALWAYS leads to some people's rights being more important than others. None of us much likes, say, the KKK worldview, but a Klacker's rights should not be less defended just because they are bigots. Once you start picking and choosing whose rights are more important, you open a door that leads to really harmful things. In this case, a person with a particular faith traditition may be forced by their own government to support someone who's worldview they object to strenuously. tl;dr You're still supporting slaverly, the slaves just now just the people whose point of view you do not support. This is tyranny."
