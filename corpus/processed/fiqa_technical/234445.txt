My girlfriend works at The Honest Company and I've been very impressed with many aspects of the company since she started earlier this year. Our entire home is stocked with Honest products and I disagree with the other redditor who said the products suck. While I do feel like some of the cleaners may not be as powerful as the other more potent chemical based products, many of their products are great. We have just started using their new shave oil and I'm not sure if I will ever want to use shaving cream again! The soap bars are great for showering too. Other than the products, the office space is incredible and Jessica is very much involved with the operations of the business. It is an open work environment and Jessica is seated at a desk right in the middle of everyone. I'm predicting the Honest Company will do big things.
