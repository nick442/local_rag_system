> yeah.. thats a little hard to believe Why? What's harder to believe is that Equifax *would* tell all their officers. The way to keep a secret is to tell no one, and Equifax desperately needed to keep it a secret while they investigated, applied bandaids, and thought up a moving-forward strategy. (I don't like how long they waited, but announcing it immediately would be even worse from a security standpoint.) > I dont think a single person buys that these guys all just decided to sell stock at the same time right before a story hits that will tank the value of the company That's a very disengenuous account. They sold at different times, not immediately before the story hit, and officers of major companies sell shares all the time. It's the equivalent of me thinking it's suspicious that you put 10% of your credit line on your credit card *just one month* before someone stole your identity. People do use credit cards. One month before isn't that close. It might be fraud, but it's just not that clear. It's not even likely, given how small the amounts were.
