Gartner, Forester, etc., data and analysis are not worth shit. I learned that from 20+ years as a financial analyst: my wild ass guess was no worse than their wild ass guess on anything but my wild ass guess was a lot cheaper. Its a pity so many investment decisions and strategic plans are based on the garbage cranked out by industry analysts.
