I understand you are trying to remain neutral here, as any cautious person should be. However, facts are facts, and to falsely blame both sides when it is quantifiably provable that one side is primarily to blame only punishes the less guilty party and rewards the party creating the worst situation. Yes, there is a bit of momentum that carries over from one president to the next. For instance, Clinton left a booming economy and a budgetary surplus to W Bush, who left the Great Recession, 2 unfunded wars, and massive tax cuts (mostly for the rich) to Obama. Overall however, the article (and [the study it cites](http://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/papers/Presidents_Blinder_Watson_July2014.pdf)) actually address this point. It is important to recognize that.
