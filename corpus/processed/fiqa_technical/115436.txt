"I believe they manage a bit over 500 million. He is still the founder and probably has control of the company but he is not the ceo. He has probably gotten the company to a stable position and wants to move on to other things.. big deal. If tradeworx is stable and making money it is not a big deal if narang doesn't want to micro manage people and run day to day shit, someone else can handle that while he can go explore other things. Just like De shaw did.. de shaw got his fund up and running, make a ton on money, left to do research and the fund still makes money.

Tradeworx accounts for about 5 to 6 percent of daily U.S. equity market volume, sources say. There was no immediate response from Tradeworx management. Narang has not decided on a future venture, but he said he is likely to remain in the financial services industry, is talking to people and is looking closely at the options market. “I have a whole lot of ideas that I‘m excited about that I’ve been wanting to pursue, so now is the time to figure out which of those ideas I’d like to pursue,” Narang told Reuters. “I‘m particularly interested in options trading, I have been for some time, that’s something Tradeworx doesn’t do. Many of my ideas are in that space,” said Narang, 45, who has degrees in computer science and mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."" edit- This all really has nothing to do with the original post about actuallyserious65 comment regarding hft."
