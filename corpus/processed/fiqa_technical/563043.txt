The problem is that when the mortgages were securitized they did it in such a way as to make checking them impossible. The security wasn't based on one mortgage or even dozens of them, but hundreds of them. Good and bad, all mixed together. Making matters worse, each security wasn't even dealing with whole mortgages, just fragments of them. It was a true nightmare.
