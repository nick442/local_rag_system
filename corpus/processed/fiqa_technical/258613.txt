There are many tasks required in a project. In order to complete the project, what steps and in what order are required to complete the project in the shortest possible period of time? Those steps are on the critical path. E.g. if you have a project to design and assemble a new sandwich for your restaurant, buying supplies and putting them together are on the critical path, while deciding on a menu name or price are not. This is because you cant even begin to assemble your sandwich until you've bought bread, but picking out a price and name can happen at any point in this process without holding anything up.
