"But you are oversimplifying economics. 1) Not everyone can be a geneticist, but most people are capable of being manufacturers, carpenters, electricians, etc. with the proper technical training. America is failing on this in two fronts: (a) we are not making it worth it for companies to keep manufacturing here in the States and (b) we are not giving our workforce the technical skills necessary. So many manufacturers are asking the question ""who is going to take over our retiring workforce of skilled blue collar jobs?"". 2) Even if we can get 40% of our work force into skilled blue collar, white collar, or professional jobs that means the other 60% are easily employable in what's called the non-basic sector, basically jobs like retail, services, residential real estate, etc, etc. The more we focus on how America can generate many higher tech jobs to compete globally (green technology anyone?) the higher the standard of living, the more luxuries we can afford that generate more jobs. Nobody has to be dead weight except: (a) people who choose not to work, in which case they have no business receiving anything but basic food and shelter from society, (b) people who have disabilities, for which we should have programs in place. We had full employment for many years even as our population grew. The only reason unemployment is so bad today is because America is losing many jobs to technology and globalization and not finding ways to compete and our work force can't handle many of the new jobs anyways."
