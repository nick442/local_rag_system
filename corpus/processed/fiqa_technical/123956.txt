> Vouchers pay the private schools what the public school would have received in the first place. The public school doesn't pay as much in taxes, and has a government supported administration that cuts waste at every chance. So the private schools collect all the voucher money, figure out they can't turn a profit, and go bankrupt. Sending all the kids they had enrolled back to the public schools or forcing another issuance of another voucher. Costing the school system double to triple for every kid that gets screwed that way. Which means the public school system doesn't have that money in their budget either, forcing further cuts. I have never considered this before. I can see the issue with it. You've changed my view on vouchers being a good system. >Secondarily it also causes self segregation at the schools, because all the affluent parent can afford to drive their kids to another school, poor kids need a bus that's not covered by a voucher. So we end up with schools that are 90% black/hispanic with only 50% speaking english in a county that is 66% white. While around the corner is a 90% white school where only 5% speak spanish when over 25% of the population does. And that's just the racial demographics that are immediately obvious. The poverty levels are harder to get data on. I don't consider this is necessarily a bad thing though. If schools are self segregated, it allows for teachers to teach in a certain way that is better for their demographic. >Either school security officer Bob on a power trip, or the delinquent in the hall, the problem is the same. Fearing for safety when there really shouldn't be a problem. You don't get either of those at schools where there is almost no poverty. You will have the same problem in Canada if you move to a school district that has a significant amount of poverty. >And I get the feeling you don't live near a population center. I don't live in a big city, but I live in a suburban area.
