MySpace was terrible, it was in its name why it was terrible, it was literally your save that you could customise to be completely nonfunctional and crash the browser as it was filled with junk. Facebook came a long and said, this is the layout, this is the colour, you can send messages and add pictures and they go here. Next to no customisation at all so you always know where what you want is on every profile. And it works.
