>Vice Media LLC is a North American digital media and broadcasting company. Like I said they are a media company. >I have repeatedly acknowledged their faults Even tho you have not. You actually barely done any such thing. >Because your sampling is very limited You seem to have a habit of making assumptions and bullshit claims, should really address that. My sampling is far from limited here. I know enough to say with absolute certainty Vice journalism is on par of Buzzfeed, and has a noticeable liberal bias. If I wanted fluff pieces to read I would go to Vice and that matter Buzzfeed. But if I want actual investigative journalism I go elsewhere. >versus my analysis which is objective lol. Your analysis is no more subjective than mine is. Claiming your analysis is objective is outright laughable.
