no this is just a problem with the police union. They are incredibly corrupt and in bed with their corrupt political class who all like to have motorcades and be seen heading a small team of heavily armed thugs on their photo-ops. no mayor can fight the police unions and guarantee their personal safety or public trust when cop unions can and will deliberately sabotage law and order in the city to make a point. Certain jobs can't be safely unionized. A military union would just as fucking crazy to imagine. Public servants ought to be public servants.. It's not just another job and they need to be respected and taken care of.
