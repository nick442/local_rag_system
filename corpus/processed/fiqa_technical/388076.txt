You can dial the phone systems of the credit reporting agencies directly to put a freeze on your credit report account. The phone systems require quick responses or the systems will fail you out, but **this work is relatively quick** and probably easier than trying to do this on the websites that try to re-direct you to buying credit monitoring services. Here are the phone entries you will make as a guide for the phone menu of each of the credit reporting agencies: **Transunion** 888-909-8872: enter zip code press 3 to add freeze enter social security number enter date-of-birth as 8 digits MMDDYYYY enter house number from street address then # key choose a 6 digit security code credit card number for $10 charge 4 digit expiration date of credit card MMYY **Equifax** 800-685-1111: press 3 to select freezes press 1 to continue say your state then 1 to confirm enter social security number then 1 to confirm enter house number from street address then # key, then 1 to confirm press 1 to select a freeze there will be a long pause at this point but when the bot comes back it goes very fast.
