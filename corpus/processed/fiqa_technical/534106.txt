"Oh yeah. exactly. That's why I said ""depending on what you buy"". there some stuff at whole foods that is crazy expensive, but some that is fairly priced. The thing about WF is you're paying more the variety of products. there is a much lower turnover rate on products than in sprouts or especially in, let's say Costco. And for that reason they have to hike their prices a bit and keep less of a given item in stock. It's a low stocked, but high variety selection."
