I know an old retired Asian couple that each have 2 pensions. They worked from their teens and worked their asses off. The wife still works as a part time consultant because her second job was so specialized and she gets bored at home very easy. I saw their finances once and its just on a level I've never seen before or since. It's like they planned ~6 decades of their lives as teens and they stuck with the plan
