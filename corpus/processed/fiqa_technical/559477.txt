Recent grads from Berkeley's program are reporting 100-150k/yr. If you look at job postings you'll find offers up to 300k/yr and in a few rare instances I've seen 500k+. The key though for those really high paying jobs is that you must have a PhD and must be an expert programmer. Look at it more like they're giving you the capital to build an HFT system that makes the money - you're practically a business partner.
