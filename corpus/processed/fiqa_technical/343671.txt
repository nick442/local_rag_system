"I wish colleges would stop letting incoming freshmen pick majors. Almost no one ends up studying what they thought they would at first. I also went to a state school when I couldn't afford the ""elite"" universities. I started as an English major, went through 3 other majors before settling on finance, and now I work for a top corporate/investment bank. Just try out some classes in different departments. See what you like and where you excel, and let the jobs come later. If you're set on finance though, you need to realize that coming from a ""non-target"" school (I hate that term), it's all about building your network. Yes, you're at a disadvantage because you didn't go to Harvard. But you can find a way to meet and make connections with people that will help you way more than any degree. You're in Chicago, easily one of the top 5 cities in the country for finance..are you trying to tell me that no commodities firms recruit from UIC? Be personable, be persistent, and be damn good at math/statistics/Excel, and you'll have no problem finding a job in finance."
