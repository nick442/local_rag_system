>If a road is not profitable, it won't be built, right? So all of those roads in the country, that go up mountains, that I love to travel on won't exist? If enough people want it and are willing to pay to use it, it will be built. If not, why should I subsidize your hobby with my tax dollars? >These corporations have the right to decide who gets to use the roads, right? You're all about the free market, but what if the guy who owns the road to my house jacks up the price or does a crappy job maintaining it? I just have to move? Yes, although I would argue that basic infrastructure such as roads should have some level of price control. Not a completely free market but still better than what we have now. >It will also be for-profit, which means it will cost more. You're willing to pay more to use a road because it's your choice as opposed to less for that road because someone made you pay for it? (as in, it will have to continue to turn a profit, even after it's been paid for.) Not necessarily true. If private corporations can be more efficient than government, it doesn't have to cost more.
