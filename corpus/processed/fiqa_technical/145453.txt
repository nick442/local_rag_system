The difference is you were left with a better future than the previous generation. This isn't true for millennials. We never had a chance to stop massive deficit spending, growing entitlements like medicare and social security than we will bear the burden of, and insane tuition increases that leave us in massive debt the day we graduate. Boomers reached into the future to get theirs and it looks like we will be the ones to suffer for it. Until there is a change in age demographics we will keep getting screwed.
