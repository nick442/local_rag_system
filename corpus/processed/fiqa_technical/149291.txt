Depends on the type and scope of your business. I am very strongly considering starting my own mobile app business while unemployed to fill the employment gap. The odds of turning a decent profit are probably low, but my overhead is so low that my risk is virtually zero. Just as long as it helps me get work later on, I will have accomplished my goals.
