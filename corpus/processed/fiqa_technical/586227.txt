"While it is true that protectionist policies can be met with WTO penalties, the International regime disproportionately benefits the US, so I don't see it going out of its way to displease the US. Furthermore, the international regime are for the most part non binding contracts and it does not act as a true authoritative figure. The WTO can say one thing, but countries don't have to follow because there is no real mechanism of enforcing these international ""laws"". The US will be fine."
