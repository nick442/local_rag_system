GiveDirectly works substantially better than you'd imagine, and is money well spent in terms of unlimited problems and limited resources. But it probably isn't as close to perfect as reports like this make it seem. As a general idea, financial efficiency is super important but you still need to analyze that the approach the organization takes is effective. Part of the downside of GiveDirectly is based on the fact that your average joe won't always spend money in the perfect manner. This article is a pretty good critique and links to a more formal study - https://ssir.org/articles/entry/givedirectly_not_so_fast Think it's a great organization but the flowery praise may be a bit too optimistic. I sure as shit don't know. Depends on the mission but quantifying the efficacy of charities and benefit per dollar spent is very difficult. The most economically efficient charity ever is probably a smaller organization that approaches a very concrete simple problem, and has minimal overhead. Best guess would be a food bank run by a convent/monastery.
