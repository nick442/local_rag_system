Generally by limiting imports, you are forcing increased production in your own economy that is not as efficient as just buying it from outside. May make sense if it were actual war, but as an economic punnishment, it just makes Russia more inefficient. Germany can just lower production or find new buyers for the long term. TTIP could move forward a bit faster and Germany wouldn't even notice. This is stupid for Russia, but Putin is just riding on nationalism more than any particular policy at this point.
