Not a good idea. When you form a partnership with someone that creates a legal connection between you two. What if he racks up $50,000 on the company credit card? Do you want to be responsible for that debt? A better way to do this would be to either charge your clients $X for IT work and pay him half of $X which would get you the same 50% or simply have him agree to share 50% of any income he gets from people referred by you. This can be done in a simple contract or agreement without force you both into a partnership.
