> Why not take out some loans? If you can get into a good school and get a good job, its worth it. I already have about $20k in student debt, and know I'll be adding more. The big issue is living expenses. I have a son and I know if I moved without him, my husband would use the chance to file for divorce and full custody under abandonment, but I don't see a way of doing school, working, and caring for him properly (he is smart as hell, but has autism and some other issues, so he needs counseling and extra support). I had a scholarship offer at Duke (in state & some ties to the school from a program they have to recruit middle- and high-school students and send us to summer camps) for undergrad and he started the whole divorce threat and just generally freaking out, so I had to turn it down. > Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner or possibly a Physician's Assistant. > Both good options. > I wish you luck :) Thanks. These seem like the best for what I'm passionate about, and most easy for finishing school without a huge amount of loans. I'm thinking local ADN program to get my RN, then online courses to bridge it over into a BSN, and hopefully find a hospital that will help pay for the NP. Otherwise, if I can continue getting in shape, I'm strongly considering the military as an option to pay for it. They have a program where you commission as an officer, with that salary, and they cover school.
