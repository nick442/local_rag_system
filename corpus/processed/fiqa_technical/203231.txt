"Global banks are without a doubt the new evil empires. They're buying debt for pennies on the dollar, because they know the risk of default/bankruptcy, yet they expect the IMF to do for international debt what W did for student loans. Wasn't Argentina also the country that had a vulture fund ""seize"" one of their naval vessels? Soon banks will have their own standing armies and naval fleets to exact asset forfeiture."
