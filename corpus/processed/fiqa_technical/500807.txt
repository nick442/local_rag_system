"It is if you want apps. The platform is stuck in a Catch-22, where people won't buy the phone because it has no apps, and devs won't make apps for it because no one is buying the phone. Windows 8 will probably ease the problem with its app store and presumed port channel, but given how MS has handled potential devs so far, the future is not bright. They should have been pursuing aggressively and digging into their massive warchest to basically throw money at devs to get hem on board and kick-start the ecosystem. I personally couldn't give a crap about apps, as I just want my phone to make and take calls, guide me with map directions, and let me Google quick bits of information on-demand. It's not a ""platform"" to me. It's a tool. But I'm apparently in the minority."
