"You really don't get the point? You see no issues here? So let me tell you that I am an IT executive with a bachelor and master's in computer science. Many people work for me. **If was hired by the NY Philharmonic Orchestra to be their Chief Music Composer, there's no way in the world that I could do any beneficial work for them in that role!** Do you agree with that? Do you think there's a chance I will be able to compose music just based on my choice for degrees? If she chose as her main interest in life, for a bachelor and master's degree, to study Music Composition, there's no way she is suitable or beneficial for a role of Chief Security Officer. No way! This is not a ""general manager"" title. This is a very specialized technical area. She could be, with her music degree, a Manager of corporate affair, of Manager of customer service, or Manager of sales. That's jsut fine. But she can't be Chief Security officer, or head of Cardiology in a hospital, of even Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In your case, you have a bachelor degree in music and work in IT, but let me guess: you are not a Chief or even a top Manager. Actually, if you work for the company that hired after you got you music degree, you are probably doing some technical work that can be easily explained and understood. Am I right?"
