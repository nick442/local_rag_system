There is no problem with a non-profit hospital, but there is a problem that a Christian non-profit hospital is tax exempt while a non-religious non-profit hospital is not. That is the case in Italy. Also, some people *do* take a lot of crap for being athiest. Many people lose jobs even families over it.
