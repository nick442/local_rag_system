> Posted tax rates vs actual effective rates differ, but you know that. Yeah, but correct me if I'm wrong here, but aren't the allowable deductions which can drag the actual rate down only applicable for stuff that happens inside the US? Therefore, wouldn't any foreign sourced income always be taxed at the marginal rate? Also, the US still has high actual rates too. [It's not exactly like other countries don't have the concept of deductions as well.](http://taxfoundation.org/sites/default/files/docs/sr195.pdf)
