Call them back and insist on speaking only with a supervisor and politely ask for their License Number and NAIC Number. When asked why reply that you are going to contact your state's insurance division and find out what recourse, if any, you might have. Merely asking for the numbers will let them know that you intend to escalate this matter; chances are that yet another supervisor will be required to rectify this situation. Companies DO NOT empower the initial representatives to resolve serious issues. It can be a tortuous path to a resolution but you must persevere. It is difficult to remove yourself and be objective but your anger will defeat you. Your agent should be on your side.
