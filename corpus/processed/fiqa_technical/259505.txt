Yeah it's obviously a bit draconian..Seems like you could do some pretty cool stuff too. Correlating physical time spent at desk with productivity, for one. You could map out points of diminishing return for work effort for each department, floor, desk, even employee. Pretty cool stuff. Of course that's assuming HR isn't compromised of morons..
