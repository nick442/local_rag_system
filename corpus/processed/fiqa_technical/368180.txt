But why not call it economic hardship, cause that is what it is. Using strong negative words loosely (like slavery, racist (don't want to get into the 'racist' debate but it still serves as a good example)) as if you do they loose the strength of their definitions. She CAN change her life in a positive way, slaves couldn't. It'll be hard but doable. And if she chooses to work at a dead-end job that it HER choice. If she likes it more power to her, I'm not one to judge what makes her happy, but don't you dare come asking for help when you can change. Show me the progress you're making and I'd gladly help. You don't help a druggie who continuously shoots up, you help the ones who help themselves get better, not continue to swim in the mess they made.
