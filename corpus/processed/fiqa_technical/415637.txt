"I once was praised by a manager during my review for using the word ""proactive"" on my resume. That was back in the nineties. How little has changed. This is the same manager who admitted to me and half a dozen other employees under his wing that the only reason he was a manager was because of his ass-kissing ability. And it didn't bother him one bit. We were dumbstruck. So, ridiculous as these cliches may seem to people who like to make sense, in the business world it holds some truth."
