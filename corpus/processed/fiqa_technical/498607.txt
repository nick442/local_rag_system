From the article: *counterfeiters' profits are often enormous because they haven't had to fund the R&D work undertaken by the pharma companies* No. R&D amounts to about ~~5%~~ 10% (NSF has it at less than 10%) of the average pharmaceutical company's budget. Most pharmaceutical companies spend more on advertising than they do on R&D. The huge profit margin in counterfeiting in-patent drugs is due to the huge profit margin that pharmaceutical companies make on in-patent drugs. I'm not saying this is good or bad; I'm making no value judgement at all. It is simply not true that the cost of in-patent drugs is driven by R&D costs. The issue is much more complex than that.
