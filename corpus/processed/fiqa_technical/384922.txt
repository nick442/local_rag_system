"This. This is what a world class newspaper is supposed to do. You get a story fitting perfectly into the current narrative of evil banks. You don't swallow it for the headline value, instead you do the dirty detail work and try to get facts about all allegations, and you write up precisely what you found. And if it contradicts the current mainstream narrative, then fuck it, facts trump sentiment, you rip apart the claims. This is the best news article I've read online in a long time, and it makes me feeling I should donate quite some money to the NYT for being there and delivering such quality information for free on the net.
