No, I'd prefer a healthcare environment where prices are so reasonable you don't need outlandish insurance and trillion dollar government programs. But no, the government refuses to negotiate. Why? Because the almost all healthcare legislation is created to enrich the industry itself. Obamacare is nice in theory, but what it really does is give the insurance industry 30 million new customers without so much as a token discount. Medicare has a provision that specifically prohibits negotiation of prices on drugs. So you tell me, should the role of the government be to enrich the companies by feeding them more customers, err.. I mean enrolling more citizens. Or should the role of government be to keep regulation in check to where it doesn't cost $80 for a single pair of latex gloves.
