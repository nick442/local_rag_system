Just got out of a wonderful seven-course dinner with two very qualified individuals: one is a former trade minister of a large ASEAN nation, and the other a retired Goldman Sachs partner. I'm not trying to name-drop here, just emphasize how these are some of the savviest investors I know. They spent the entire evening waxing on about click-and-collect and how Amazon is finally gaining a one-up on trad. retailers like Walmart who are expanding their online segments, by actually staking out some good PP&E. As avid shoppers of Whole Foods and Amazon we are very excited to see where this goes.
