"Oowwww . . . .I am afraid I am going to have to disagree with you on that one and suggest you stop fiddling with your dick and blow some shit up or you will pay a high price, because the time is soon coming when America is going to have to attack some one because the idiot in the white house is going to think it makes him look presidential. He is going to want a nice easy win, because he has looked like the biggest asshole that America has produced since Kennedy tried to catch one with his teeth and it isn't easy with all of Israel forever yammering about how every body wants to destroy them and nethanyahu digging a furrow in Trumps ass like a frenzied poodle, because his wife is a little heavy on the government spending . .ya huh? So when decision time comes and Mr. Brain wave in the White house asks him self ""Should we attack the country with nuclear weapons or the one with out?"" You are going to wish you had spent less time fiddling with your dick and spent more time blowing shit up."
