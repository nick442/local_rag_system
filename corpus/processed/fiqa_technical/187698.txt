It's the Apple approach: sell your own product at the price you want it to be set at, then sell it wholesale to other retailers at a price so close to that they can't undercut you without having zero margin. That's why you never see discounts worth anything on a lot of electronic products. The manufacturers have effectively captured the entire margin by competing against the retailers via direct sale options.
