"I wasn't thinking in absolutes - that's specifically why I said ""barring unusual circumstances."" Being 6'6'' is **literally** an unusual circumstance (in airline customer heights). In your case, upgrading to a seat that you can sit in with a ""normal"" level of comfort is so obviously appropriate that I'm surprised that you thought my comment, in the context of this post (which is predominantly centered on creature comforts rather than actual needs) was even applicable to you. Frankly, I think that you should be automatically bumped up for free because economy seats are designed in a way that makes them physically unsuitable for very tall people - a deliberate choice by the airlines that imposes an additional burden on you through no fault of your own. Though I'd be happiest if airlines would just design *all* seats to accommodate people 6'6"" tall. :)"
