"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23371) reduced by 72%. (I'm a bot) ***** > NBER Working Paper No. 23371Issued in April 2017NBER Program(s): AG DAE ED EFG HE LS PR. Using panel data on individual labor income histories from 1957 to 2013, we document two empirical facts about the distribution of lifetime income in the United States. > For women, median lifetime income increased by 22%-33% from the 1957 to the 1983 cohort, but these gains were relative to very low lifetime income for the earliest cohort. > Partial life-cycle profiles of income observed for cohorts that are currently in the labor market indicate that the stagnation of lifetime incomes is unlikely to reverse. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6ltobr/lifetime_incomes_in_the_united_states_over_six/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~161478 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **income**^#1 **lifetime**^#2 **cohort**^#3 **inequality**^#4 **labor**^#5"
