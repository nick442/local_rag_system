"Consider it this way: ***EVERYONE*** has one or more of those ""lucky events"" in their lives. Every single person overheard the right conversation, or was in the right place at the right time, or had that spontaneous collision of thoughts resulting in a ""eureka"" moment. The people that are successful are the ones who had the wisdom, intelligence, and/or drive to capitalize on that moment."
