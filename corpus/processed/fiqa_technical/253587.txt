Well people get excited all the time and try everything they can to get on the train that they think it will make them millioner, no matter what the consequences are. It is a natural things. thats why we do have laws. If the people who were in charge of making sure that the right people get the right amount of loan, even with all the excitement, none of those sub-prime loans would be issued and we wouldn't have this problem. So if you ask me I would say fraud caused free cheap money flooding the system, which increased the prices rapidly, created more excitements, which again caused more fraud, until the point that there were no money!
