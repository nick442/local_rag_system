>How is the government paid for these things? How is this handled without taxes? Are you suggesting that the people pay for all of this because they supposedly derive all the benefit while the businesses supposedly derive none from infrastructure. I'm not advocating no taxes whatsoever. >Yes public roads may not be restricted by entities except in safety measures and compliance with DOT regulations. It is illegal for company A to blockade or otherwise make unavailable a public road to keep company B or the general public from using it. These type of rules also apply to communication lines and power infrastructure and are designed to decrease duplication and ensure that selected infrastructure is appropriate for the area. I think you misunderstood what I was trying to say. I'm trying to say, you don't have a right to a paved road wherever you want to go. That's not a government protected right.
