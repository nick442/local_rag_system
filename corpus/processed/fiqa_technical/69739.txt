I don't think it's hard but definitely not easy either. It is very time consuming. The hardest things is about how to apply the abstract strategies as example link building. You will learn the difference between links, how to get a backlink and etc. The problem is that you need most of the times to be creative and make your own strategy because sometimes that same strategy that you learn won't work in this case. So because of that I believe you need a good amount of knowledge to know how to adapt and always make the most efficient strategy for that case. Digital marketing have a lot to learn and different niches. I would suggest you to pick one (SEO, SMM, PPC, SEM, email marketing, content marketing, video producing, Youtube marketing, influencer marketing, reputation management and more.) Those one are some of the most popular but we have way more and many niches inside them. What I suggest is to choose one of them and found a good source of knowledge to learn. The problem to learn by yourself is that it will take time to filter what is good and what is not. And mostly people will give you a bad but baiting content in order to sell you something in this market. So be careful with scammers. Hope it helped.
