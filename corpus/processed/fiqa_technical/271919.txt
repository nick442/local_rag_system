its not against the rules anymore, ever since uber lost one of its many lawsuits, i think it was deemed to be in violation of certain state laws. With that said, it was a concession to drivers especially after uber cut rates to bare bones and drivers weren't making any money at all. really, tips just subsidize drivers lost income from rate cuts that uber used to kill competition over the years, drivers arent making anywhere near what they made using uber in 13/14/15 and the promises of increased ridership never panned out, not to mention the disasters that were uber pool, uber driverless (compounded by a rate cut at the same time making it look like an intimidation tactic to drivers), etc. I drove for both only until i got the bonuses, job sucks, still find glitter in my car (its been 2 fucking years), and my cynicism was reaffirmed by the experience, I wouldn't mind if uber died and left lyft to pick at its decaying corpse. Hell, I wouldnt mind if Travis kal-whatever got hit by an ex uberdriver and left for buzzards to pick at his decaying corpse, guys a douche.
