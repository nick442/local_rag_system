"Open standards need to be put in place by the open source community (including business interests), codified into a self-hosted option as a first class citizen *by law*, with a final sugar coated offering of hosted options managed by private enterprise. They can use the open source model as much or as little as they want. With the Equifax scandal, we have little option but to include a ""nerd friendly"" secure version of this software that's available on the government's dime. And by government I mean ""we the people"", not ""big government""."
