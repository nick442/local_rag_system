Well actually you need a lot of things. Engine alone is not directly related to towing capacity, for example. You need the proper suspension, frame strength, etc. Actually you don't need a big engine to tow, you need torque. You need the right transmission, differential, gearing, etc. Generally speaking, the bigger the thing you want to tow, the bigger the truck you need to tow it. Otherwise, wouldn't Semi trucks be small, but with a big engine?
