It's not so much too big to fail as that's just a bad policy, you are overpenalizing Walmart. Not to mention would this be reset every so many years or would it be permanent. It's pretty conceivable that Walmart is going to live on for ages and ages right now so there could be unintended consequences of this, much like the three strikes and you're out policy works in real life.
