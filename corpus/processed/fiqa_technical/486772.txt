Sorry, you're wrong. Last year, they posted just the base options pricing that everyone knew about, and a few videos were posted of people taking test drives in the prototype Model 3's. A few design changes were made between the prototypes last year and the production models unveiled last night. Further, no professional photos were posted of the interior, nor details on range and interior options. Source: I'm a Tesla owner and Model 3 reservation holder.
