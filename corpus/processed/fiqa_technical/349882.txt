Historically there weren't really high barriers to get in, but I find nowadays that banks are looking for quant backgrounds (MQF, ME, MFin) even though it isn't really required unless you're working in modeling. Maybe pursuing a master's program would help. Another route considering your BA experience, you could try to get involved in regulatory projects at a bank. It's a bit of a longshot since they tend to use consulting firms. Get involved with that and you'll interact with risk reporting teams and could work from there. Other than that, get a lucky break haha, knowing someone definitely helps.
