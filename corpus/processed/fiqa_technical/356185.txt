"Yeah, so in other words, democracy is a sham because voters are stupid enough that the amount spent on a campaign actually can change voter opinion sufficient to sway elections. The alternative is to end political democracy and replace it with an entirely voluntary-funded democracy, where you vote with your money. This system already exists, the arch nemesis to politics, and its leaders are ""elected"" by their ability to provide customers with better value, leaders like Bill Gates, Sam Walton, Steve Jobs, Warren Buffet, Elon Musk (tesla), Sergey Brin and Larry Page (google), Jeff Bezos (amazon). In political democracy, everyone can be forced to fund the choices that only 25% of adults actually supported. Obama, for instance, won just 25% of adult votes. In most elections it's similar low % of actual support. In the economic democracy, you buy what you want and that doesn't hamper someone else's ability to buy what they want. Multiple service providers can exist together. All we need to do is privatize and distribute ownership of roads to property owners who have paid for them all of this time, privatize schools so kids learn actual skills that others will pay them for, private police and let each property owner establish their own rules to be enforced on their own property.. let others then ostracize and avoid those with stupid rules. The move to a completely voluntary society is a worthwhile goal, though nothing can possibly end wealth inequality, since every time something new is invented the inventor becomes wealthy through voluntary trade, at no loss to others."
