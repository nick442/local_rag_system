There have been machines around for about 10 years now that can typeset, print and bind a book in about 10 minutes. I'm surprised Amazon isn't making use of these. Keep bestsellers in stock, and if you want something more obscure, look it up in their kiosk, put in the order, wait around for 10 minutes and you can have a copy in your hands.
