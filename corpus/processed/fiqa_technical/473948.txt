I'm not sure it's a great idea to help spread ideas about that way of thinking by putting that whole ideology in a Reddit title and then upvoting it. I know the idea is presumable supposed to be to shame Marc Fabor, but if I was a racist who wanted to help spread this kind of vision of America, I would also upvote it because it's helping to promote a racist philosophy.
