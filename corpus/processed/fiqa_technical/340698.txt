> intelligent agile approach beep beep beep! Bullshit alert. Tracking one's individual medical data in the absence of disease is not beneficial for that person or his or her healthcare provider. So most people will see no personal benefit in doing this, and good luck getting a consumer to fork over this data for monetizable purposes (even for cheaper insurance rates, because the logical argument is won't I be charged more if the healthy are charged less?). The fervor around Google or FB ads is large enough. Also, technically speaking, HealthKit is a way to surface and centralize data. Apple will never let an arbitrary app funnel out a user's data to some other database.
