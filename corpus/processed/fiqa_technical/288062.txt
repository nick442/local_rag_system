The US has, I believe, the largest refinery capacity in the world, and is the world's largest exporter of chemicals. Sure Iran and Kuwait has a lot of raw crude, but if you want that made into jet fuel, tires, and plastic bags you need expensive refineries. The US, China, and Russia import a great majority of the oil and just export the refined products. It's easy money being the middle man. Import a barrel of oil for $100, turn it around and sell the refined products back for twice that cost.
