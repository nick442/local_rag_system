Most of the responses to your networking question are posed in a negative light. Flip it on it's head- be positive about your potential connections. I have personally gotten in touch with some of my billionaire heroes by doing something simple. Not easy, but simple. I added **value** for them. How can you add value for a billionaire? Put yourself in their shoes. The ones I reached out to are professional investors- what I also enjoy- and so I went about looking through the investments they own, etc. and found ways to add value. Hope that helps.
