The legalization of Cannabis will drastically alter supply and demand of cannabis and hemp. The distribution channels that work well for hemp may or may not work well for cannabis and may or may not continue to work well once cannabis is widely available. Companies may have avoided sponsoring hemp products because of it's association with marijuana. If Marijuana is made legal, that stigma may or may not go away, changing which companies are interested in distribution. I don't believe that legalizing cannabis will create a great investing opportunity into existing hemp producers.
