"So, you think people who disagree with you and don't think that the government should have a role in providing such things don't *want* such things to even exist? And *I'm* the one who is being myopic? Surely you cannot be serious. I'm not conservative, I'm liberal, in the true sense of the word. I'm actually in the industry as well, and I take great offense to those who think they can vote my rights away on the premise that ""might makes right."" We should rather be a country of principles, not whims of the dumb masses. Government is in no way truly an advocate for its citizens, that is nothing but a glorified bumper sticker slogan, so let's not base our beginning assumptions on outright falsehoods."
