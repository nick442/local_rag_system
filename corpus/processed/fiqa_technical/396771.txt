>What's unfair about it? It's not fair to exclude job candidates because they choose to engage in a harmless recreational activity in their personal time. If there were some reason to think that they were likely to imbibe at work or that their marijuana use would otherwise impair their ability to perform their job effectivity, that would be another story. But there's no way to tell that from urinalysis and hair tests. >A weed smoker is lying if they tell you they only smoke weekends. That's just not true. I smoke *maybe* once a month, and know lots of other people who smoke only on rare occasions. >Most smoke fault and they aren't fit for the job. That's not a sentence, but if you're trying to communicate a theory that pot smokers are mostly incompetent, you are mistaken. There are many successful, intelligent, effective people who use marijuana.
