"Some people will drone on about ""maintaining power"" or ""projecting power."" The money we're wasted over the last 2 decades on wars in the middle east (and elsewhere) have absolutely *nothing* to do with power projection and everything to do with profits. The most effective form of power projection accomplishes its goals without firing a shot, but that doesn't put dollars in pockets. Whether it's a data center in Utah, or drone strikes in Somalia, National Security is not the purpose: Money is."
