"Better financial analyst on paper or to improve your own ability? In my opinion what makes a good analyst is a thorough understanding of macro and financial statements, intellectual curiosity and ability to think independently. To be able to look at a dataset and come to your own conclusions without outside bias. To not just want to learn ""how"" but also why. You can't improve if you don't question the status quo. Everyone lists Excel as a skill on their resume but it is amazing how few people really know it. More employable, what I would want to see is experience in Bloomberg, Factset and Thomson Reuters. And how you have utilized the tools. I want to see that you can think independently. Show me you are capable of completing a task just by being given the starting point and the ending point without needed to be told every step in between. As I said previously, everyone claims to be Excel experts, show me that you really do have advanced knowledge."
