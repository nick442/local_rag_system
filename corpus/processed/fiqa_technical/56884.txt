Average weekday boardings were ~66,000. Your assumption only kinda makes sense if all of these people were driving cars before the light rail, none of them are taking multiple trips a day even a round trip, and all of them pay their full fare making the light rail perhaps worth the money (all of which are not possible). Even with the light rail, Seattle public transit sucks. I canâ€™t believe that is even a conversation.
