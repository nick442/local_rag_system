No, in my opinion, a company exists to accomplish the goals of it's owner(s). If the owners want to be willing to give up some of the bottom line to help people in their community then that is fine. If however the owners are primarily concerned with maximizing profit, then they should do whatever is necessary to maximize profit. In the case of a publicly traded company like Wal-Mart, I would assume that the shareholders are primarily concerned with the company profits and as such, management should take whatever steps necessary to maximize those profits. Additionally, don't forget that for that American that lost his/her job, a person from China gained a job. Are Chinese people less important than American people?
