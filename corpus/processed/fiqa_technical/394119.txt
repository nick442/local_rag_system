All they care about right now is market share. The profit will come later (see Facebook for example). Or better yet, read about the marshmallow experiment (wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment). The same rationale is why Uber, Lyft, Tesla and all of these other tech companies are valued so high. That being said, I do not know that Snap, Inc. will be a success. I'm just saying that it's naive to say that Evan is a fool. For all we know, he's creating the next AR (insert buzzword) technology. We don't know.
