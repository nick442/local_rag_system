Aside from all the pop culture bias against the big chains, a Whopper is actually a damn good hamburger, and a Big Mac is also good in it's own way. But Americans eat too much unhealthy fast food in general, so it's good to see that fast food as a whole is declining in popularity. It should be enjoyed as an occasional splurge, not for everyday meals.
