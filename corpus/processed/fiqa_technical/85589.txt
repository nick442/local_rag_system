> IMHO the best model would be to allow students to access resources in isolation then arrange a catch-up class with a facilitator to encourage discussion. Yes, more or less. Back to the original topic: in other areas, the use of robots must be restricted, or not allowed, or taxed, or must be always supervised by a human. Examples: 1. No robot allowed: customer service (talking and handling customer requests and inquiries), medicine (a human doctor must see you), teaching in class. 2. Robot must be supervised: robotic soldiers in the army, robotic repair crews, robotic maintenance crews, robotic construction crews, etc. 3. Robot must be taxed: manufacturing, menial work 4. Restrictions: Robots can cook and serve in restaurants, but cannot handle the management of the restaurant.
