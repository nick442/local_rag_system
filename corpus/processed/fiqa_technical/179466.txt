Summarized article: Electronics manufacturer Foxconn announced that an internal investigation at its factory in Yantai, China, found underage interns between ages 14 and 16. China's minimum legal working age is 16. Foxconn has an internship program that has vocational students work for 3 to 6 months in its factories to gain industry experience. About 2.7% of the company's workforce are interns. The company said those identified as underage have been sent back to their schools but have not said how many were found. Foxconn's announcement came shortly after labor rights group China Labor Watch released its findings that underage interns were found at the Yantai factory. Recently, Foxconn faced a complaint that interns were being forced to work in its factories, however, the company cited the Fair Labor Association's report in saying there was no evidence of such claims. In August, the Fair Labor Association, hired by Apple to audit labor conditions at Foxconn, said Foxconn has made a majority of the recommended improvements but must address remaining concerns by next year. * For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit
