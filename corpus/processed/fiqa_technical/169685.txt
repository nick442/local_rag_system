Honestly it just seems like you never put enough work into any one thing, or a bunch of things, dabbled a little in everything and hoped you would be recognized. That's not how it works. You gotta love do something with the goal of being the best at it in your whole city, and then success will come to you. And maybe it won't, because such is life. But what stays with you and what should make you happy is the fact that you're really good at what you do. Your problem is the exact same as every creative person I've met. Yeah, I know all of you hate being painted with the same brush, but I will always say the same thing hoping that I get through to one of you. You guys think you're talented, and you are talented, but you NEVER match the talent with hard work. So many of you walk around pissed off with the world that you didn't get what you deserve, but none of you accept that nobody deserves anything. There isn't an international council that awards success. You just gotta love what life is, do your best, and always remain optimistic. Success is never assured.. but the surest and only way to get there is to hack away at one thing for always.
