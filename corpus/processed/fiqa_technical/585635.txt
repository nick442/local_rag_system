Seriuosly? I had to stop at slide 20 because it was just the typical crap from the crapiest of the economical web pages, bussiness insider. He says that regulations are not the problem and then goes to say that corporate profits are very high. How is not that the fault of regulations? Regulations produce benefits for the big companies and stop competition, therefore is normal that because of regulations the richer are getting richer and the poor poorer.
