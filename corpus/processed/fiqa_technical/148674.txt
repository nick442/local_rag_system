"I think you're projecting a little bit there when you say it's in my head. From the Wikipedia article on [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism), it says that they ""sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the 'common good' and accept political interests as the main priority of economic organization."" That sounds pretty well like socialism to me. I'm sorry that the bad men you don't like pointed it out, but that doesn't make it not true."
