Grantham is far more well known, has a very good record, and he manages over $100B. He has been accused of being a perma bear, and he's not calling a top yet for at least another year. He's one the only managers who had the 2008 crash coming and going - that is he is on record saying to get out well before the crash, and he said to get back in at the march, 2009 lows. Everyone has biases. Grantham, iirc, got back out after the 2009 rally too soon. That's *his* style. Regarding 2012, Grantham has mentioned election year rallies many times in the past, and that sure helped with 2012 HARP relief for homeowners. Plus you had the incredibly high equity premium, with very low stock prices. This Levy fellow seems way too bearish. I feel way more comfortable listening to Grantham or Gary Schilling, who are more reasonable bearish leaning advisors. > In addition, Grantham backs his prior call that the bull market probably wonâ€™t end for a year or two, not before the S&P 500 rallies past the 2,250 level. http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/07/21/yellen-encourages-fully-fledged-equity-bubble-says-jeremy-grantham/
