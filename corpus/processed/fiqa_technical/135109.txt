It sounds like you're drastically oversimplifying basic business economics, and implying that any company is just as well off breaking even (zero profit) as it is with turning a big profit. This is blatantly incorrect and naive. For one thing, it is certainly be easier to justify expansion or attract new investments if your company is profitable.
