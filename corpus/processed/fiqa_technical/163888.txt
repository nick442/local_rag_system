The QuikTrip business model is an interesting one, I'm looking forward to seeing its long term stability. Every business has to offer value to its customers and it needs to bring unique value in order to take off at QuikTrip's rate. IMO QuikTrip's value is their large footprint combined with clean, organized stores carrying a wide variety of products. This value is only unique in comparison to the general shittiness of their primarily regional competition. Most convenience store chains are regional on a city by city basis and they generally do a poor job of ensuring consistency in the areas I listed for QuikTrip. That's the general trend including good chains, there are plenty of bad ones where you would have to be insane to try one of the hotdogs or tex-mex tube things that have sat on the rollers for 3 months. The problem is that maintaining a convenience store isn't hard, it requires competent management and employees who give a half-ass effort. QuikTrip can afford to pay for excellent management and employees who give a whole-ass effort because their geographic footprint affords another unique advantage. How long will that remain unique? I know of several equally decent, growing chains that offer better prices and if the market is large enough we're likely to see oil companies giving a shit about the convenience store side again like they did in the 90's after the rise of 7-11. I'm more than likely wrong somewhere in my analysis of QuikTrip's list of advantages. However, if I'm on the right track I'd be hesitant to call them a long term winner when they operate a high cost operation in a heavily price sensitive market.
