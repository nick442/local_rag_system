"Well centralization hasn't failed so much as we've swung way to heavily to the centralization side. Just like we'll probably swing to far the other way in response to this because most people can't be bothered to parse out issues on a case by case basis. Instead they'd rather cling to some narrow set of political beliefs as if its the answers to all the myriad problems life could throw at you. ""The Master Narrative Nobody Dares Admit"" is the worlds a complex place and there is no ideology that's ever going to be proven 'right' because there is no ideology that has all the answers. Rampant kneejerk overuse of centralization is just as bad as rampant kneejerk overuse of privatization or decentralization or anything else. And we're all worse off for it when everyone wan't to play these petty games of who's socioeconomic and political religion is best. Some things in life are better left decentralized. Some things are better left centralized. Some things are better privatized. Some things are better left as a 'public good'. There's no magic answer. People should stop trying to scrabble from one ideology (and I'm not even talking only political ideologies here) to another and just educate yourselves as much as possible and take things on a case by case basis."
