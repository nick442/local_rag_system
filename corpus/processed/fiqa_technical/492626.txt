"The entire time you've talked about cost. Changing incomes matters little if the cost scales with it. Me thinks you don't understand how a market works, even a semi-planned one. If more people make more money, the price of most goods goes up. This isn't due to real actual demand, its due to something called inflation. When the amount of money in circulation increases, we have inflation. Lets say I make 35k a year as a store clerk. Is my labor being undervalued compared to the income of a store clerk in the past? Or is the price of goods scaling faster than my income has scaled? Simply adding more money doesn't fix anything. The price of the good or service is what matters the most. While everyone having more money is good, you can't just magically give everyone more money without the cost of goods and services rising. I imagine that if everyone suddenly were at least a millionaire, the price of a laptop would sky rocket. The cost of the laptop in parts wouldn't be that much more, but since most people would have disposable income beyond their needs some goods would then get more expensive. Once that happens, the inflation of prices starts to spread until its effects are seen across the market. I don't think the ""fruit of my labor"" is being stolen by the ""upper class"". If anything, the fruit of my labor gets taken more and more by my own government and transferred to the lower classes more and more. I'm not rich, not even close. But I know I've had at least 15k of my income in the last 5 years taken and distributed through taxes ON my income to people that are generally unable to earn enough on their own. If these people are the upper class, then I must be Marie Antoinette!"
