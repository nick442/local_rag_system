"I sent myself an Tangerine email money transfer. They sent me an email which took me to a website. After I entered the secret answer, they asked me for the destination bank account's details. They asked me to enter the transit number once, the institution number once, and the account number twice. They also showed a bold warning message: ""Please ensure that the details of your Canadian Bank Account (account number and bank information) are entered correctly."" Asking for the account number twice isn't a perfect safeguard, but it's better than nothing. In some countries, bank account numbers include a ""check digit"" for typo prevention, but I was unable to find any evidence online that this is true in Canada. Tangerine's system isn't 100% mistake-proof, but it's good enough that I think I'm going to use it."
