> I never said she should abstain from sex if she didn't want to get pregnant. You misunderstood what I said. If you are in a situation like her, you should either take extra precautions when having sex or just avoid having it until you get to a better place. She obviously wasn't responsible enough to have sex safely so yes, I think it would have been wise for her to abstained from sex until she got her life in a better place. So we should punish her?
