At least Fry's offers some ridiculous sales if you're willing to wait for them. I haven't used them myself for any major purchases because I'm originally from the east coast, and now I'd rather just pay a bit more at Amazon to be guaranteed a hassle-free experience. That being said, I've *still* been tempted once or twice.
