Nope. Fed buys bonds, banks get money, banks reinvest money in equities. DJIA went from 6,626.94 in March 6, 2009 to 17,100.18 in July 18, 2014. That's nearly a 200% increase in 5 years. The economy, on the other hand, has not reflected this rise. So where is this money coming from? QE. This is also why the biggest equities market drops in the past year and a half coincided with Fed announcements about QE tapering.
