"If you have a big pocket there are quite a few. not sure if they take us clients though. Vcap, Barclays, Icap, Fixi, Fc Stone, Ikon. Then there are probably a few banks that have x options also but i don't know if a private investor can trade them. A few im not sure if they have fx options or if they are ""good"": GFTFOREX, Gain capital, XTB, hmslux, Ifx Markets, Alpari, us.etrade.com Betonmarkets might be something if you are interested in ""exotic options"" maybe?"
