Thanks - i doubt they'll throw the CEO guy in jail as long as they appear to want to stop the illegal distribution of goods. It's an interesting dilemma though - would you want to stop the facilitation of illegal goods if it was core to your business becoming successful? Probably not, I'd say. In the run up to the IPO, I'd expect lots of PR RE: safe guards, checks and trust. Lots of hot air in other words.
