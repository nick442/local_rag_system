No, I was only partially sarcastic. The new stock sale goes to FB, not paid out to stockholders, at this point. Whether the stock is price right depends on how that investment is spent. People forget that stock is sold to generate investment capital, not to get a short-tem bump, and see who is left holding the bag. Was FB overpriced? It depends.
