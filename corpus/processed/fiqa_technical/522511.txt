Since there are no details (rightfully so). You need to know how it will make money, period. Snap chat sounded like a weird idea, but it got super popular and is valued very high. But guess what - it doesn't know how to make money. Which is why the value has been so volatile and going down. You need to know how your idea will *very specifically* make money. Details about your target audience, how many people does it include, how you will attract them, why they would want your product or service over someone else's, how you will give it to them, how much they would pay, how often would it be needed. And you need to know how much money it will cost you to make that money so figure out the costs you need to know the exact resources that you will need, how much they will cost, how long it will take to even begin execution, and how long you expect it will be until you are cash flow positive. There's a lot more but hopefully that's a starting point for you since you seem to not any real research done
