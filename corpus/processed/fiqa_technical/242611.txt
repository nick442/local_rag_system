"Not sure about specific French laws. Assuming its not a political party receiving such donations, and it an normal individual .. General common sense answer would be; but it could very well be a generous donation from someone in the Caimans or Germany The onus would be on you to prove it is a generous donation. What is the threshold between ""this money looks like money-laundering"" and ""this money looks like a generous donation""? There is no threshold. By default if you don't know the source; it is money-laundering. In particular: is it up to me to explain where the money comes from, or is it the sender's problem? You have to explain the source of money. That the Bank in Germany may have to do its own due-diligence is separate from your having to explain the source of funds."
