>We still limit product sold to Costco because we don't like to ruin our relationships with the thousands of other retailers by price gouging their wares. That makes zero sense. >So yeah, fuck costco, they do the same thing as walmart but just put a nice front up for their own employees and continue fucking everyone else. Yes how dare Costco tries to get the best deal they can get. You are only fooling yourself if your company is no different with its own suppliers.
