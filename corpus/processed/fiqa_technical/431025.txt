"And what about ""peanut butter"" or ""apple butter"" or ""milk of magnesia"" or ""coconut milk""? So what if people have been using those terms for 50 or more years, it cannot stand! I'll tell you what, get ""peanut butter"" banned and called something like ""masticated peanut spread"" and we can talk about having ""oat milk"" or ""soy milk"" renamed to ""soy beverage"" or whatever. Deal?"
