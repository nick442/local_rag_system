You are correct that the price fixed when the contract is made is set and maybe there are a few institutions that don't actually bother to track the future after they initiate the contract. But most parties likely track the contracts fairly carefully for a number of reasons. The big deal is that while the price the contract is set, and if you did a perfect hedge maybe the value of the contract and the thing you are hedging is then fixed, the value of that futures contract by itself changes and this is important. The biggest reason is as JB mentions above most futures contracts settle up on a daily basis as the price of the underlying changes. This happens to limit the losses when for large price changes and one party owes a bunch of money on a futures contract and (for that reason or a different one) goes bankrupt. If the other party is using the contract to hedge a sale or asset maybe this risk is minimal but maybe that expected sale doesn't happen or maybe the party is using futures for speculation. There is no way to know built into the contract if a party is really hedging or not so people naturally want to limit this default risk. There are many other reasons to track profit and loss as well: There are likely even more reasons as well that I'm missing but hopefully that gives you an idea.
