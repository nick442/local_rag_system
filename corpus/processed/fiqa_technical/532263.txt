Uhm, you *do* realize that they are distributed for free in a number of places, right? It hasn't reduced the rate of single motherhood afaik. And even if they weren't already distributed for free, can poor people really not afford $0.50 for a condom? What is $0.50 when compared to the cost of raising a child? Not to mention STD's.. Would *you* play Russian Roulette? All the evidence supports my position. What evidence supports yours? Wishful thinking?
