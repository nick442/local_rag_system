[A level grades are less than 35% of the grading distribution at Princeton](https://odoc.princeton.edu/faculty-staff/grading-princeton). And, [0.4% of people attending college attend an Ivy league school](https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/the-college-solution/2011/09/06/20-surprising-higher-education-facts). We'll round that up to 1% to take into account schools like Stanford, Duke, etc. that are close to Ivy League level but aren't called Ivy League. So, 35% of 1% is 0.35%. Goldman is recruiting from literally the top 1%. There's nothing special about making a 3.5. There *is* something special about being in the top third of a university that accepts the top 1% of applicants. To suggest otherwise is to bleed ignorance.
