>so it's a pretty useless and obvious observation. Well, if you're trying to figure out what the difference is between 1920 and today, I think that it's important to know that there's a whole lot more debt being taken out, and that debt service is transferring a lot of money from people without money who want stuff *now* to people with money who want to lend it. Here's a graph of [public debt in the US from 1920 to today](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/07/chart-of-the-day-americans-income-and-the-us-debt/241463/) that I mentioned further down. Inflation-adjusted and per-capita. Every time that line inches up, it means more taxes or fewer services in the long run, as wealth is constantly siphoned over to lenders. It's gone up by an tremendous factor since the time of our great grandfathers.
