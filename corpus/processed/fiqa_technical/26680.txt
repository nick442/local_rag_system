"If you look at a diffusion of innovations curve, the early adopters are different demographic than the others. When Reddit had less click traffic, less users, it was early adopters. Maybe some subs were echo chambers for views on unlimited free speech, but by and large, there were no echo chambers. People would make meta comments whenever they noticed an unpopular opinion being downvoted, saying things like, ""are you downvoting because you disagree, or because the comment is baseless?"" and the hive was willing to admit fault and correct behavior within that thread. In theory, people could argue about Bernie or Jeb Bush being better a stronger POTUS candidate, and up/down votes would be given based on how many links / sources were provided, not which candidate was proselytized. If some nut job mentioned Trump winning, it would be up-voted for visibility, so that intelligent discourse could commence about the outrageous notion, maybe links to previous stabs at a campaign, not a circlejerk with one video and dozens of photos of Trump admitting he'd sleep with his daughter and holding her on his lap inappropriately. That's what happens when early adopters of ~~Reddit~~ innovation lose their platform to the masses. People exploring new frontiers appreciate their liberty, and likely respect other people's liberty, as well. The public is conditioned that the custom and habit of their tribe are the laws of nature. There never has been free speech, and there never should be, and if you try, they will intentionally misbehave for negative attention or because the end justifies the means."
