Yes, you are generally allowed to make contributions yourself to your HSA, even if your employer also made contributions. Let me explain further. The contribution limit for tax year 2015 is $3350 for individual coverage. (It is higher for family coverage, or for account holders age 55+.) The limit is for everything contributed to the HSA, whether it is an employer contribution or an account holder contribution. (In other words, if your limit is $3350, and your employer contributed $3000, you can only contribute $350.) As far as the IRS is concerned, anything that your employer sends in is considered an employer contribution. This might be money from the company as part of a benefit, or it might be money deducted from your salary as part of a voluntary contribution on your part. Either way, if the employer sends it in, it is an employer contribution. None of this employer contribution shows up on your W-2 as taxable income, so you don't get to deduct it on your tax return. It has already been taken off of your income. Money that you send in yourself with your after-tax dollars is your account holder contribution. This is money that you can deduct on your tax return, so that you aren't paying tax on this money. So here is what you need to do: Determine your total HSA contribution limit for tax year 2015. Find out how much your employer has already contributed for 2015. The difference is how much you can still contribute for 2015. Contact your HSA provider and find out how to make a 2015 contribution. Don't just send money in, because there is probably a form they want you to fill out to make a prior year contribution. Get all this done by April 15, the deadline for making a prior year contribution. Actually, get it done before April 15, because often there will be some sort of delay of a day or two that will prevent you from doing this on the last day.
