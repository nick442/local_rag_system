"Yeah, I saw a similar article back in 1976 (and several times since). But then they used the correct word ""exponential"" to refer to growth. Ironically the author may end up being correct by using ""parabolic"" -- which is the type of curve you see with ""bubbles"", as the slow towards the peak and then begin descending with increased rapidity on the other side. And (alas) solar electric power generation placements are very likely to follow THAT curve -- as the investments fail to pay off, people begin to realize that (despite the claims) it is *not* a viable long-term base of power-generation, and so begin to not only reduce investment, but to abandon and even scrap projects as the long term costs mount."
