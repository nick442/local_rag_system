Layman with a question: the financial world is commonly depicted and regarded as being incsanely hard-driving. High pressure with very challenging work, and absolutely life-consuming. IRL, I've ever heard a few stories second-hand about things like fairly regular 18 hour work days and such. Finance is certainly a broad field with many facets; but generally how true is this? I have to assume it at the least doesn't quite meet popular perception, because people would have nervous breakdowns..
