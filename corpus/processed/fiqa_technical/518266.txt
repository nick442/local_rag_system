FASFA financial aid formulas determine 'expected family contribution'. For example my alma mater now has a 'list price of over $65k/year. The average student today actually pays $42k/year after grants. Students with rich parents pay more than that. Students with poor parents pay less than that. Lets say list prices for my kids colleges average $110k/year while they are in school. If we 'only' make $200k then based on our income alone, EFC would start in the low $50ks per year. If we have $1M saved in taxable accounts, 529s, rental properties, etc, then we also have to pay 5.64% of the value of those every year for the eight years my kids will be attending - an *extra* $56.4k/year every year for 8 years. If that $1M is in assets that don't count such as retirement accounts and equity in primary residence, then it doesn't increase the price my kids are billed. That's a pretty big incentive to put everything I can in home equity, Roth IRA, Spousal Roth IRA, traditional 401k, after-tax 401k, and HSA. If I could afford to save more I'd switch from traditional to Roth 401k and pre-pay retirement taxes at a higher marginal rate rather than have the savings on the side subjected to the college wealth/income taxes which are effectively a much higher difference between the 25% (now) and 15% (later) federal tax brackets. Profile and consensus formulas have slightly different percentages and count some home equity if you have an expensive house, but the general idea is the same.
