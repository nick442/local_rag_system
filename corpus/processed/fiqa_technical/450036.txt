EDIT: This answer is outdated and is no longer valid due to that all new & existing accounts in Jersey must be owned by a resident from Guernsey or Jersey due to anti-tax-dodging laws. Link Open an offshore account in a Bank in Jersey. Mime is with lloydstsb-offshore.com. It will cost you £70 a year, but for that price you can get 3 accounts: one in $, one in £ and one in €. You can move money between the accounts without any cost and you can have a chip and pin card on both the Euro and the £ accounts. And there is no residency restrictions. Downsides: The anti laundering checks are annoying. Don't forget to tell the IRS about every single cent you get in interest and religiously pay your tax on it. The revenue service doesn't like people with off-shore accounts..
