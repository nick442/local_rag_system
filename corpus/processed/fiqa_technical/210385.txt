"Yes it is. The most effective form of honesty is to properly set expectations up front, and get good at delivering on those promises over time. Don't confuse ""Building the best product"" with honesty. Building the product that people want, the product that people can trust is often better than waiting for ""the best."" Dependability is often more valuable."
