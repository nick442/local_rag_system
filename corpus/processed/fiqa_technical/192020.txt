I mean some people are trying to climb in the caste system; Others are pushing down trying to prevent those people from climbing up and joining them. India is a very complex socioeconomic landscape. Currently, Indian IT workers will quit as soon as they find a better offer having produced little in the current/previous role. These are the social climbers. Those that are trying to prevent the lower castes (who have affirmative action benefits) from having the same opportunities because this makes their own livelihood more competitive. They must now complete harder where before it was easy to get a managerial position for them. Much like racism in the US.
