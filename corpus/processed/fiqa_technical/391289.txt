"Let's say - someone who gives you vague direction, gets upset when you ""do it wrong,"" then gives you the impression you're free to do it as you see fit, then two hours later comes in and starts micromanaging. When you ask for clarification by email, it goes unanswered, and when you ask in person you get a sixty minute discussion about some other subject that nets you more work. Or how about a boss that's passive-aggressive? So when you take two days off to take your kids to college, he comments that there was a meeting that you really should've been at, because you would've been really helpful. And he finds ways to bring this up several times over the next few days. What about a boss that asks you to take care of the network in addition to your primary duties, then asks you to leave the hours off your time sheet because it affects the customer's billing. Then a year later during promotion reviews, recorded hours are part of the input and said boss just sits there and doesn't say a word as their team is fucked? Any of those suit you?"
