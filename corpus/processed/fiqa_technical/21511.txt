I will be general. It's more fun. If everyone in auto manufacturing labor was replaced by a cheap robot tomorrow, then cars would be cheaper. Those of us who buy cars at 50% less could spend that on video games and facelifts. All the auto laborers could make more money doing less labor in the video game and plastic surgery business, robot manufacturing, and robot programming. Others could tailor the robots for other industries, making money there. If there is less menial labor to be done, then more meaningful and productive work can be done in its place. In other words, when the cheap, undesirable jobs are made more productive, the product price goes down and that money is spent somewhere else. On the other hand, if we want to go with much lower productivity, we could all spend an average of 12 hours a day 7 days a week (or the equivalent) obtaining food and shelter. After all, with less productivity, everything takes more labor and more time, and we would have to do without many of the luxuries we take for granted. But everybody could be working really hard.
