"FICO SCORING http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/art/chart_fico.gif This is from the PBS Frontline show ""Secret History of the Credit Card."" Getting rid of one card won't immediately trash your score, nor will it be by the full impact (15%) of credit history. If there's no fee, I'd buy gas once per quarter with it. If there is a fee, I'd check my FICO score and if I can afford to lose 20 or so points for a time, I'd go for it."
