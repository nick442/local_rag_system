Look, listen, I'm talking about **fraudsters**, people intentionally manufacturing fake payroll checks, not the companies themselves doing it. You're missing the point! Making a check that looks legit is not hard, especially if the check itself is legit and the information on it is bogus. There is a lot of exposure when you hand out a check to someone, corporate or otherwise. You need to carefully reconcile them against what the amount was supposed to be. If you ever lose any checks you have to get those numbers cancelled immediately. It's an enormous hassle.
