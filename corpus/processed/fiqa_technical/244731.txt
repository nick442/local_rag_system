"I didn't downvote but I will disagree wholeheartedly with your 75% decline analogy. That's like a palm reader predicting that someone is going to die. Well no shit, I'm sure someone is, somewhere, at some point. Or an analyst saying a stock will drop because of A, but it actually drops because of B, and you say ""See! I told you it was going to drop!"". All you're doing at that point is throwing something at a wall and hoping it sticks."
