That's some really fucking stupid reasoning. Cost of production has no bearing on how much something is worth. That's why a fashion brand can sell a t-shirt they made for 5 bucks for 200 and an unsuccessful business will manufacture stuff and then sell it at a loss hoping to break even in the future. Anyone could invent a crypto coin that costs 1 billion to mint one. Doesn't mean it's worth 1 billion if nobody is willing to pay that for it. It means if you spent 1 billion making one, you're a moron.
