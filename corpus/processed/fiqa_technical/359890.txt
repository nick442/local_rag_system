This is a very misleading headline. The USPS is mired in debt because they over-extended their labor costs and obligations, despite declining revenues and a dying business model. The Internet has stolen their market, wholesale, and yet they still over near permanent employment, health insurance and defined benefit pensions. If the USPS does not make it's $5B payment into the health care fund, what happens when employees need to draw on that fund in the future? Who will pay for hip replacements and cancer treatments? This is an obligation, just like servicing trucks, paying salaries, buying gas, etc. They're dying because letters turned into free email and junk mail turned into spam and website analytics.
