"Poor in a rich country isn't necessarily better than being poor in a poor country. Have you actually seen how real, true poor people (poor or even on the dole) live in this country? I do daily; it's not ""rich,"" unless you're just so amazed by running water and a couple hundred dollar TV. Running water is pretty great, but a decent TV doesn't make your life ""better."""
