Yes you have the freedom to leave the country. The only problem is that in every country there are 9 other people just waiting for you to move there so that they can do the same. The Supreme Court interprets the constitution and not the Social Contract. And first you base your argument on the constitution, and then one second later you say that the constitution is outdated. Make up your mind please. Capitalism is anarchy. It is not a system. What is a more correct distribution of wealth than allowing everyone to keep what they earned with their skills on a free market? Monopoly is a game. You certainly don't better society by exploiting a minority, that's for sure.
