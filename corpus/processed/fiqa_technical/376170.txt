The niche they were going for was a family-friendly sports bar but no one wants to spend 2-3 hours in a bar with their kids or watch 1/3 of a game. What's more if I want to watch a game with my friends away from home it means other people's kids are going to be running around. It was also meant to be an alternative to Hooters but the family angle means you can't do the trashy eye-candy thing. The food isn't great and it's not cheap either so their business model is off and the food is only marginal. The question isn't why millennials aren't going, it's why that many other people are.
