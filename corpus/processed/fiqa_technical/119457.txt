There's no easy answer, and you're asking others to do all of your research. Read up on utilities in North-West Europe and figure out their energy fuel mix. If 1 of the Company's 2 nuclear reactors went offline, they'd have to make up for the energy they've promised through another fuel source, or purchase the power from a different utility co. You'll have to research their fuel mix, back up power generation, PPA's, Hedging strategy & position, and so on. Otherwise, if you think a large portion of nuclear will go offline, what's the next largest source of power for those companies? Coal? Natural Gas? Oil? Go Long the backup fuel.
