"You don't offer any specifics, so I'm guessing a little about what you're talking about, but here's a few thoughts: Remember that all tax-related transactions are reconciled when you file. All of your activity for the year is totaled up and (for the most part) when during the year things happen is irrelevant. Your gross taxable income is calculated (which will exclude any ""pre-tax"" activity, deduction applied (which will any include and ""post-tax"" deductions), tax liability calculated, and withholdings subtracted to get your net tax due. Whether you have ""pre-tax"" activity and less tax withheld or ""after-tax"" activity with a deduction and reduce your net tax, the net effect should be the same."
