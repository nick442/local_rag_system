"So you are saying the game is rigged. You said that the average raise has to be 4% and that is pre-decided. So that means the game is rigged. Also you discussed good and bad managers. Well over 90% of managers I have had were horrible. The good ones were great but they were few and far between. Also you mentioned about how money is not everything. The reason money is not everything is because the employees know they are not gonna get any more money. So that is why they settle for ""casual friday"" and other bullshit perks."
