Quite interesting. I'd like to see an interview of someone who pays $10k a month for a Zynga game. They haven't really described the demographic of the customer who is like that. This reminds me a lot of the Starbucks phenomenon, more so than casinos. People are willing to spend $4 per latte, spending maybe $50 a month, on an impulsive, addictive purchase.
