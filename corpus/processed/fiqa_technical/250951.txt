"Economist [Mark Weisbrot](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/27/china-imf-economy-2016), > It is true that the ""market rate"" measure is better for some comparisons. **But one important place where the PPP measure is more relevant is in military spending.** The cost of producing a military plane and training a pilot in China is much lower than in the United States. > Washington's current policy is to maintain military supremacy in Asia, but an arms race with China could make the cold war look cheap by comparison. The Soviet Union's economy was just a quarter of United States' economy when we had that arms race. If the US were to have a serious arms race with China, we could forget about Medicare, social security and most of what our federal government spends money on."
