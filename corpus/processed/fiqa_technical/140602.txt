> ..isn't this kinda good for development of new drugs? Yes, since they make it harder to get competing products on the market, patents and FDA approval incentivize the creation of new drugs as they discourage competition. That said, I think the idea that we need to incentivize drug R&D is myth used as justification by the industry for high drug prices. Invention is a wave of small evolutionary improvements meaning that [discovery is rarely from epiphany but the next logical step after all the prerequisite technologies are in place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery). A company's supercharged R&D mainly gets them to the patent office a couple of months or years before their competition but it doesn't find drugs that were never going to be found otherwise. For example, [dozens of groups were working on flight when the Wright Brothers succeeded](http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/who-flew-first-290750/) and if Orville and Wilber had failed, someone else would have succeeded shortly thereafter.
