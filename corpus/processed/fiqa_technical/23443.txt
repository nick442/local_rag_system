As a beginner to cryptocurrencies, I would recommend that you sign up for an account at gemini.com. Once you get verified - and understand, that getting verified will take multiple weeks, unfortunately, considering the large amount of traffic that these web apps still have to scale for - you will be able to make daily deposits of $500 to buy either bitcoin (BTC) or ethereum (ETH). Any other currencies (altcoins, usually built on another network or entirely separate networks) will require you to sign up for an altcoin exchange like Kraken or Poloniex. Speaking of which, another user that commented on this post mentioned Kraken, but the issue with Kraken is that it only allows you to buy currencies using other currency, which is why I recommend gemini (you could even use coinbase, but coinbase is EXTREMELY popular and it takes forever to get verified). After purchasing crypto, you can transfer to other accounts on other exchanges to speculate on altcoin. Please be secure when using these exchanges. Consider also using a wallet (I personally recommend exodus.io), as many exchanges suffer from occasional attacks. As for /u/beat_tapes questioning your motives, I totally agree with that sentiment, as no one REALLY knows what's going to happen tomorrow, which is why I implore you to evaluate your financial situation and only speculate with what you're entirely comfortable with losing. You're entering casino doors, and yeah, I'm a personal believer that at this casino you'll win big, but it's still a gamble. Just keep that in mind.
