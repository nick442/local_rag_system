> Instead they focused on bottom line, cut training, and pissed off the community by abusing employees and being rude and useless to anyone walking in the door. > 1. OH NO, they do NOT cut training, not by a long shot. People seem to think they (past employee) are the 'worst tech-selling company', they aren't, they're a decent electronic store. We are trained on sales and basic product knowledge. Except when as a cashier / customer support guy, I was trained oven installation. Twice actually because they needed it again. We get more training than we know what to do with (not really but most of it is bs so we don't care) and you can just click through the fuckers, and with common sense, pass tests. I build pc's and have maintained multiple business networks in my home-town, but couldn't work GS even after I passes all necessary training, because I couldn't sell as ons well enough. Like really, 100% I just couldn't (even though I left top of my dept.) 2. We sell, and we try to sell hard. People see it as annoying and pushy, same here. 3. We will not go down or byebye for a long time, because we did what Radio shack is doing wrong, cell phones. Best Buy mobile is insanly popular / profitable, and a whole lot of people love it. We shut down 100+ stores last year.. we opened up 3 times the number of specialty mobile stores in the US / CA.. A lot of those old stores were never profitable, almost every one of the new ones really is. People just like to think BB is screwed, no, it's actually not. It has a market that doesn't really exist on reddit, the regular guy that wants some shit and someone to maybe fix his shit when his shit doesn't work. He doesn't need the best shit, the newest shit, or the special shit, he wants what his NEIGHBOR has and what he thinks he kinda gets. That middle America, Kentucky and Tennessee market you know? That is fucking huge, we just forget about em.
