Short answer is it's illegal to discriminate against people for reasons of age, gender, religion, race, or any other protected class. These came about due to the history of various minority classes being kept out of the labor market for no fault of their own other than who they are or what they believe in. I think the better question would be - if you're the owner of a workplace, why wouldn't you want the person best qualified for the job regardless of class? I'm a moderate agnostic, and I have worked effectively with everyone from super-conservative fundamentalist Christans to socialist Buddhists. If they know their stuff, I don't care whether they pray to a mythical sky beast or the bones of their ancestors. In fact, having some non-Christians around is always nice for holiday coverage. Sure, business owners should have the right to hire people who work well with existing employees, but that is superseded by the rights of people of all stripes should have the right to be judged based on their merits and not their birth or religion.
