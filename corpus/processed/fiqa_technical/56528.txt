"Actually reminds me of the A&W burger diaper. It was a fantastic way to wrap and eat a burger in the car, yet they called it the ""burger diaper"" in house.. which trickled it's way to the customer before mine even sold one. It took less than a year to contract with Sonic to take over that location for me."
