It also creates a problem of ""you manage what you can measure"". Is physically being at your desk tied to productivity? Better hope so, if you are managing to it, or are you accidentally creating a culture that incentivizes not networking, not having meetings, and not communicating where organizational knowledge decays and vanishes in favor of sitting at your desk on reddit? You know, in theory."
