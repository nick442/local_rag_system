When you apply for the mortgage expect that the lender will want your sister to sign a form explaining that that is a gift, otherwise the lender might be concerned that it is a loan. Be careful about the gifting of the money to a minor. You could run into an issue if the money isn't spent on something that benefits the child. The IRS does get concerned about using money transfers between child and parent to get around tax issues. Other than that you don't have a tax issue. If the gifting is done correctly your sister can gift $14,000 to you and your spouse each year. If your child has a large expenses in the near future: tuition, braces.. Your sister could transfer funds to the child to pay for those items, thus freeing up some of your funds for the house.
