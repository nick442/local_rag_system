"This stupid argument again? Testimonies explicitly explain how he was able to pass the blood tests. Don't you see how futile it is to argue that he has never doped just because he passed the blood tests when it is known that he can easily pass them? I'm not saying the lack of positive blood tests classifies as proof of guilt, but it certainly cannot be used to prove his innocence. Let's say you commit a crime and the police comb through the scene of the crime and find none of your fingerprints. Wouldn't it be stupid of you to argue ""You have not found any of my fingerprints at the scene of the crime, therefore I must be innocent!""? You could easily have worn gloves. Likewise it was easy for Armstrong to pass the blood tests even if he was doping, therefore the fact that he passed isn't proof of his innocence."
