"Is option trading permitted in the account? Most 401(k) do not permit this. 1 - it means none traded today. 2 - there are 50 outstanding contracts. Each one has a guy who is long and a guy who is short. 3 - not really, it might depend on the stock. 4 - no. With commissions so low, and the inherent leverage of options, one contract reflecting 100 shares of the underlying stock, the minimum is what you can sleep soundly with. 5 - because GLD does not reflect precisely 1/10 oz of gold's price. If you look at the prospectus, it reads ""The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the Trustâ€™s expenses."" Since there are no dividends to take expenses from, the GLD price will erode by .4% each year compared to the price of 1/10oz gold."
