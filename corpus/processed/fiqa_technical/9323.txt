couple questions for clarification: 1. Investment firm is a pretty broad term. Do you mean Registered Investment Advisory firm or broker/dealer, or something else? 2. Are you asking if they can reveal who they generally custody assets with? if so yes, they are always willing to give this out and many firms use multiple custodians. If you are asking if they can reveal client information and where the assets are held, then no, absolutely not, the only reason they could legally give this out is if the feds inquired or if a court order was issued.
