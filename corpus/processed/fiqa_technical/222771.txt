From PayPal's User Agreement: 3.13 Credit Card Information. If your credit card account number changes or your credit card expiration date changes, we may acquire that information from our financial services partner and update your Account. In theory, what stops PayPal from charging some huge amount on your card is that you could call your credit card company and reverse the charges claiming fraud which would then cost PayPal as the funds would be pulled back and a fee assessed to PayPal.
