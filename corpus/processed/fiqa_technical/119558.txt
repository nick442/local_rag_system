1500 what? Items purchased at a supermarket? Assuming I purchase 50 items during a serious visit (a pretty low estimate) 1500 data points only represents 30 visits. If I go to the supermarket once a week, that's not even a year's worth of data. How about websites? According to [this guy](http://kickstand.typepad.com/metamuse/2007/10/how-many-web-pa.html) an average internet user initiates between 120-140 unique pageviews per day. taking the low estimate, 1500 data paints doesn't even represent two weeks of data (12.5 days). 1500 data points is NOTHING when you're trying to predict consumer behavior.
