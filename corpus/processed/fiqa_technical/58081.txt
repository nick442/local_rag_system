Your article uses two metrics, number of lawyers per capital and number of lawsuits. I don't think those simplistic metrics are sufficient to count as science or even a fully reasoned analysis. Perhaps number, + dollar value, +validity, +lawsuits that are threatened but not followed through with. I actually live in Germany, after having grown up in the us, and it's very clear to me that the US has a significantly shittier environment surrounding litigation.
