It's not actually fighting the paradox of choice, it's lowering the costs of supply chain management. A regular supermarket, for example, has to source 50 different varieties of hot sauce from different manufacturers. Trader Joe's has a couple of varieties of their own sauce, and it's delivered in the same truck that delivers 99% of their food. People overlook this fact a lot - Trader Joes is a business that is vertically integrated, unlike any other supermarket.
