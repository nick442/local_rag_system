"You don't need a law degree, but it is pretty negligent to ask the internet legal advice. But hey, I guess you know better than me man. My statements were more to say ""I don't know how nebraska works so you can't assume what I say is true everywhere."" Speaking of which >Nepotism laws only apply to public sector jobs. Doesn't apply everywhere anyway. You shit on me for trying not speak in incorrect definitive yet you then go ahead and make a false statement unilaterally."
