I work at a manufacturing facility near Savannah, GA. When it was finalized that we would shut down at the end of the week, the upper management was out a day early. They all drove to the airport and flew out of here on Thursday. This left the employees and supervisors (and a few area managers) to left everyone navigate the confusing and uncertain shut down and evacuation process. I lost all of the respect I had for management.
