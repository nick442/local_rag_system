"1.65% is the annualized interest rate. If it is pail semi-annually, you'd get 8.23 every 6 months. And yes, if the YC is upward sloping, it means that 30 years t-bills pay higher interest. Thats a premium they pay for having your money locked in for a long time. It makes sense if you consider that they'd pay you that rate (say 2%) for the next 30 years. If for some reason interest rates in 25 years from now are like 15-20% (like they were 25 years ago) and inflation around the same rate, you'd still only be making 2%, on top of bleeding purchasing power of your initial investment. That's why long-term bonds require a premium. That being said, sometimes you get an ""inverted yield curve"", where yield's fall with the longer maturities. Look that up."
