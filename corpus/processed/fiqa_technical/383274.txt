Sure, but if a company can reduce its workforce to incur less liabilities don't you think they'd do it? Everyone from HP, GM, GE, AT&T .. ALL of those and many many more would do so if it meant lower liabilities. Some companies could do it, some can't. His company is medium enough size he may have that option. A company with 150,000 employees would need a waiver or eat the costs. **Again, it's not about right and wrong, it's about incentives and available options once those incentives/disincentives are active.**
