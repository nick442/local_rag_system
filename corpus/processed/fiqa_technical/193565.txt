The big issue I can see is foreign exchange risk - if you've got the money in the US and you need it in Australia, you're vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the two currencies. I would think that if you're expecting to go back to the US, you might want to leave some money in the US (to guard against the AU$ falling against the US$); if you're not planning to go back you're probably better off moving the money with you unless you expect the USD to appreciate considerably against the AUD anytime soon. The picture changes slightly if you still have expenses in the US, like paying for a mortgage, or repairs to a property there or something similar, as you're probably better off leaving part of the money in the US to get rid of both the exchange rate losses and currency risk.
