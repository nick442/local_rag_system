I have gone out of my way for my customers and probably done more than I should have. It's always so wonderful to get an email thanking you for your hard work. The software company I work for is in the medical business so a lot of counties in NY have our software and talk to each other. I loved that one of my clients told me that they had a big meeting in upstate and they all said that I was the best one to deal with because of my knowledge, sense of humor, etc. It makes me feel good. Too bad the owners have no idea how much I've saved them over the years. I love what I do.
