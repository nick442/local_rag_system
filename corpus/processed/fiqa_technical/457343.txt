Dumb & Dumber held a strategic meeting and came to the conclusion that in the absence of roads and infrastructure and the fact that Taliban love operating in the mountains where there are none of the said roads and infrastructure, and the said Taliban control most of Afghanistan and Dumb and dumber control parts of Kabul, it was far more fiscally viable and would place less man and material in harms way, with a higher probability of finding something of value, to pick minerals out of each others butt.
