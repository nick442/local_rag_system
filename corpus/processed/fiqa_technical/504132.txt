It's amazing how bad and speculative Fox reporting can be when you read other news sources to confirm things. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-28891292 > Earlier this month Venezuela launched an anti-smuggling operation on its border with Colombia. > It deployed 17,000 troops along the border and began closing all the crossings at night. > The one-month ban will be lifted in mid-September. > The decision to close the border was agreed with Colombia, where the smuggling of cheap goods from Venezuela is also seen as a major problem. > The Colombian government says it leads to a big loss in taxes, with complaints of unfair competition faced by local businesses. It would seem at least according to the BBC that the problem is not the socialist government but enterprising ~~thieves~~ capitalists who are smuggling low priced goods to a high profit secondary market.
