First, business turns into socialism because of heavy government regulation, trusts, collusion, corruption, lobbying, I could go on but I digress. I think the debate here is: >If companies made wrong choice then market would punish them and companies that hire quality personnel would win out. This is not an accepted truth by everybody on Reddit, in the USA, or in the world. For one thing, lobbying exists. For another: four competing companies can differ on more than 16 different choices, one of them can be company A ruins the environment and hires cheap immigrant labor, company D is good for the environment and good for labor, while companies B and C do one and not the other, alternatively. The environment and cheap immigrant labor are only 2 of 16 choices, such as marketing, donating to charity, having a corporate office near one of the plants versus in a geography with low taxes, having plants near certain resources, etc. So, it isn't like one bad choice would ruin a company, or one right choice will ruin all of a company's competitors. >If companies made wrong choice then market would punish them and companies that hire quality personnel would win out. You act like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Cox Cable, and Comcast, must have terrific customer service ratings. That simply isn't how the market works, not for big banks, and not for telecoms. It probably doesn't work that way for oil companies, or major media conglomerates like Disney, it probably doesn't work that way for one single industry in the USA. Then again, maybe it does. But it certainly is conjecture, and you can't say, >That's not how economy work. If good people are worth the money, then companies would hire them. As if this is a given or a fact. That is completely your opinion, popular or not. In Capitalism, those who start out with the capital have a huge advantage to put out of business or buy out competition, until there is a monopoly, or at least a trust.
