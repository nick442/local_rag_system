For those who haven't followed the whole story from the beginning: After the success of Atlantic City's more upmarket Borgata Casino, Revel was supposed to take things a step even further, being more luxurious and high-end, attracting an affluent clientele who may not have visited Atlantic City otherwise. With a $2.2B investment in a massive, gleaming structure almost twice as tall as the next biggest casino tower, plus exclusive restaurants, Revel seemed to have all the ingredients to cater to the high money Vegas crowd. It never happened. People who wanted a high-end Vegas experience could simply afford to go to Vegas, while at the same time, Revel alienated the lower end customer base by banning smoking and not offering any inexpensive buffet style dining. Later attempts to cater to the typical Atlantic City customer were too little too late, and now it looks like the experiment may be done for good.
