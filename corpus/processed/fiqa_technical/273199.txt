"That is correct. I've bought plenty of well made products made in China. My beef is with products formerly well made in the US, that have been moved to China but that don't seem to care about quality any more. It's as if the companies are saying ""look how much we're saving"" without realising that too much profit is not sustainable if it includes making a cheap trashy product."
