I don’t understand people’s obsession with inequality. As long as real wages are staying constant or rising then you are as good, or better off today than you were yesterday. This idea that “they” are getting “better” faster really doesn’t matter in the long run. It was only 60 years ago that multiple middle class houses shared a land line and you had to wait for your neighbor to finish before making a phone call. Today just about every individual in a low-income household has a cellphone. My point is, as long as things keep improving for everyone is it really that bad if it’s unequal improvement? [Freakonomics did an interesting podcast on the topic of spite a while back.](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/what-do-medieval-nuns-and-bo-jackson-have-in-common-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/) The most interesting part to me is experiment where people were willing to accept less money just to ensure that the other person did not get more than them.
