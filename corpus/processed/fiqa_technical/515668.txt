If you 'took' redundancy, then it generally means you've accepted to resign after being offered a package. Firms will try to offer people redundancy before forcing mandatory redundancies. It reduces your employment rights, as you can't immediately claim things like Job Seeker's allowance, but it also means the firm can fill your position sooner than if they had made you redundant. In this case, they were mandatory, and they'll probably only get the statutory and contractual payout their union had agreed to previously.
