That's true about normalizing but that's not the problem with TV advertising; the problem is compressing. If you've ever listened to talk radio, sometimes the host gets really quiet and almost whispers.. and then he lights up and begins yelling and shouting. Yet during this time, you don't need to adjust your radio's volume; the sound from the radio studio has been very heavily compressed so that the quiet and loud parts are all the same volume. If you compress the crap out of your commercial's sound and then normalize it to 95% of the peak of the TV show's sound, which is typically not nearly as compressed, then your commercial is going to be perceived as *vastly* louder than the TV show, even though it never exceeds 95% of the TV show's peak volume. Thus a law referencing the average volume is thought to be more effective than one that simply requires normalization. It still seems easy to work around though; just have 29 seconds of silence and 1 second of horrendously loud, house-waking marketing slime. What they need to do is require that neither the average *nor* the peak dB level of the commercial may exceed the average dB level of the show. There might be cute little tricks that can get around that too, but at some point the ad agency has to actually talk and sell their product rather than performing mathematical backflips on the audio just to wake everyone up.
