Floyd Mayweather isn't wealthy?? Wtf are you talking about? Forbes puts his net worth somewhere near 400M. That's not all in liquid assets he can just hand to the IRS (which would be stupid if they were liquid). The guy has houses, cars, jets, boats, planes, businesses. Wtf? The guy has made himself into one of the best boxers and promoters on the planet, he'll be rich off of boxing forever. He has tax liability, i'm not sure why but it's not crippling for a guy who in a month will make literally 10x his liability in one day. If $500M isn't wealthy.. no stop, it's insanely wealthy. Y'all are just bonkers.
