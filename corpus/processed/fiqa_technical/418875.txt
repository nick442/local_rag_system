There is usually a phone number on the side of the ATM to call for situations like this. That is where I would start. Can you pursue a legal action? Sure, you could do that even if the machine didn't eat your money. Anyone can do that for any reason. The pertinent question is whether you will win. Maybe, but even if you do it would take a while and probably cost more time/money than it is worth. It isn't like there was malicious intent from the bank, call the ATM vendor or bank, and politely explain your situation. No need to start the conversation by threatening a lawsuit. What are the chances of BOA screwing you over? Based on their reputation, probably higher than they should be.
