Thank you, I was thinking the same way. A lot of women who are in a relationship and with children want to contribute financially, feel like they are accomplishing something and be successful (in the career sense) but still have their main role as house/child care. These schemes prey and focus on this and how easy it is to do from home/in your own time. It is something that a lot of people wish were true and get sucked in by.
