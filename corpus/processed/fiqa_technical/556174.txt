"So your evidence for them being legit is them saying they are legit on their website? Why don't they list the credentials of their ""collective of volunteers who assist in research for many sources listed on these pages""? Scroll down the methodology page, see the part where they say their methodology is not scientific or tested? And that none of their contributors are experts in anything relevant to media/communications research? Reread my previous comment, some of it got deleted so I re-uploaded it."
