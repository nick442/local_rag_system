I think tradition is going to be a big obstacle to lab grown meat, as there arent that many ways to grow it in a way to fit the idea of meat for people who are used to eating actual meat for 20 or more years. the taste and texture is going to be really different. People are sensitive to this stuff. its like, i like meat, i have been eating it all my life, and now suddenly there is something entirely else that calls itself meat on the table. No, if the cost is similar and it has a lot of marketing campaigns, im thinking years of marketing, behind it, its still going to be the same effect. meaning its not going to be this big money maker that its makers expect. you cant force a product to socceed if there is no product market match
