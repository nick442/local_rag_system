> Hybrids & electrics are not quite ready for the prime time. I mostly agree. But I know a couple Prius owners and they love their cars. > without a massive and permanent increase in oil prices, widespread adoption is unlikely. I believe the increase is inevitable. You mention 20 to 30 years out. Thirty years back, my car still had a carburetor. We've come light-years since then. I suspect the time frame for being ready for prime time is more like ten years. The Chevy Volt just got a 10% bump in electric-only range.
