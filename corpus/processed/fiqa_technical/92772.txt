I agree that there is a lot of filtering going on. I run filters for people's blogs and news sites I rarely read. The caveat is that I unblock sites I use frequently, and pay for YouTube Red, music streaming and Patreon to support content creators that I enjoy. This, to me, is an issue of the ad targeting not being mature enough yet. Once companies figure out that I'm responsive to ads on certain sites but will blacklist others that do the same, they can selectively serve ads on platforms I'm more likely to engage with. In the meantime the shotgun approach is what advertisers go for. The future is really in honing how and when these ads are delivered, as well as offering more widespread alternatives to ads, such as subscription services. For what its worth, I also run noscript. I've had ISPs in the past that had data caps, and given how much data I already use via streaming and Steam, I need every spare Mb I can get.
