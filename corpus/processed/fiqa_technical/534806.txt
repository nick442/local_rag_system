Having all your funds in an illiquid format instead of any liquid investment (shares, bonds, TD) is highly unusual as it makes these events occur. I'm an investment banker having your investments appropriately staged to deal with liquidity events is a major aspect of this. For someone apparently worth a billion dollars being unable to pay a $7m tax liability from 2010 is weird. If I had a tax event equal to 0.07% of my networth I'd either have the cash or shares to sell to meet that liability. Yet he posts pictures of uncashed cheques while the IRS hasn't been paid since 2010. 50 Cent did this.. Edit. Downvoting without even a comment is the reddit way of saying I'm right..
