If it has anything to do with the US, the US has to be the worst. It's like an experience my friend had in the mid-nineties where some emo douche who overheard our conversation about his coming to the US berated him for claiming that life in the Ukrainian SSR was much worse than life in the US and that he was either stupid or blind for not recognizing that reality. Said emo douche got a punch in the face from my friend.
