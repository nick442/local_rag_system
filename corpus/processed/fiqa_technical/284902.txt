"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm) reduced by 95%. (I'm a bot) ***** > Is there really a defensible case for countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, or the United States to pay down the public debt? Two arguments are usually made in support of paying down the debt in countries with ample fiscal space-that is, in countries where there is little real prospect of a fiscal crisis. > For countries with a strong track record, the benefit of debt reduction, in terms of insurance against a future fiscal crisis, turns out to be remarkably small, even at very high levels of debt to GDP. For example, moving from a debt ratio of 120 percent of GDP to 100 percent of GDP over a few years buys the country very little in terms of reduced crisis risk. > Faced with a choice between living with the higher debt-allowing the debt ratio to decline organically through growth-or deliberately running budgetary surpluses to reduce the debt, governments with ample fiscal space will do better by living with the debt. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6ulozq/imf_on_neoliberal_economics/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~194154 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **debt**^#1 **country**^#2 **fiscal**^#3 **growth**^#4 **capital**^#5"
