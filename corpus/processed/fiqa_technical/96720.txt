I would also consider the following factors: How stable is your income? Are you in an industry that could vanish in the near future? How long would it take you to replace this income? If you are at risk, then you need to consider that your lenders do not care how fast you've paid down your debt. All the care about is that you make next month's payment. You need to have liquid reserves available to weather any storm. (current wisdom is 3-6 months expenses). It may be prudent to put this money in GICs or T-bills. There may be an early withdrawal penalty, but at least you won't lose your house. (obviously, this isn't as important when you can actually retire all debt) What's your debt level? If it's more than 3x income, then reducing that number might be the most prudent. On another note, what is your expected retirement income? IRAs defer the tax to a later year. BUT, if you expect a great pension, it is feasible that you might be in a higher tax bracket on retirement (when you withdraw the funds) than you are now -- A situation that makes Indexed Retirement planning counterproductive. (Rich people don't buy IRAs)
