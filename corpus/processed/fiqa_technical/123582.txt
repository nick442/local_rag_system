So, you agree that the government is actively colluding with klepto-capitalists to restructure the US into a series of all-dominating monopolies crushing consumer value and worker interests, but you don't think the gov officials doing that are in it for their own gain and not yours? Bro, do me a favor, look up Hillary Clinton's net worth, and tell me how the fuck she did that on a gov salary. Look up Susan Rice's net worth. Look up just about any congressmans net worth and tell me how the fuck they did that.
