"This is great guys! I'll take a ""comment per day"" approach and write my view on each concept raised. I don't mind how far fetched or crazy it might be, if it's a informative question (""What are derivatives?"") I will explain it in a informative manner. If it's an opinionated question (""What is the intrisic value of water?"" :P) I will try to explain it terms of Finance mainly but the general perspective will be opinionated. First up is iamstandingbehindyou! I'll tackle your question first :) If you guys would like I can mention your twitter/personal site as a reference to the origin of the question. If not, I'll link to your reddit user :D"
