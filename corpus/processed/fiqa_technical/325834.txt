Amazon sells 65% of *all new books* sold on the internet, print or digital. When you control that much of the market, it's easy to use your size to extort your suppliers to agree to your terms. It's more similar to how Comcast is using it's market position to force Netflix to agree to their pay them extra money in order to have adequate performance on their network. Regardless of their size, a disagreement about *ebook* pricing should not affect the sale, price, or visibility of Hachette's *print* books already on their site. But Amazon has removed the ability to preorder Hachette's print books, raised prices on existing books, and decreased the visibility of the publisher's books.
