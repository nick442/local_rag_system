There's no doubt that equities, as well as junk bonds (which have, in Europe, according to BAML, reached the same average return as 10-year-US treasuries) are currently overvalued, which is why I, and I suggest this to any active investor, have taken out all my money from tradable equities and debt and invested it into undervalued dank memes.
