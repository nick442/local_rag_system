Eh I always wonder about this so called show room effect. I mean I check amazon in stores sometimes, but I'm not looking for prices really, I'm looking for *reviews*. Now if I see that Amazon has it 50% off of the in store price I might hold off, but best buy could prevent me from even looking by honestly gathering up reviews for products.
