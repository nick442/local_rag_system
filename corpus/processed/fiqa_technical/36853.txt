Lots of long answers. The short answer is that speculation and growing confidence in the currency have increased demand. Supply and demand tells us that the price will increase until holders of the product are willing to sell, or until the buyers are no longer willing to buy. My personal opinion is that we're seeing a bubble in action. But have we passed the point where the market will stabilize after a correction? Far too soon to say. If I knew I wouldn't say and I wouldn't be slaving at a 9 to 5 job.
