Lowering the minimum wage would be a greater benefit than raising it in that case. Minimum wage makes it illegal to hire people whose value is not worth the minimum wage, meaning low skilled people, seniors, young workers and the disabled. I don't see any reason we should keep the people out of the workforce artificially. Having a little money from a part time job is better than being completely dependent on welfare like UBI.
