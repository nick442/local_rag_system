"It actually works very well on Google Home, the issue is that I don't get free shipping until I reach the minimum. Basically you say ""hey google buy baby wipes"" and it will give you choices and prices, or it will say something like ""last time you bought blah blah blah, buy the same?"" and you just say yes. This is useful when you are in the kitchen and you notice you are out of paper towels or something like that and you can just order it. But again the stupid minimum makes it so I can't use it."
