It's kind of like a fat guy bellyflopping into a pool from the high diving board; the wave travels out, reflects off the side of the pool and comes back to you a little later. GFC I causes increased government spending to bail out banks/stop economies going into reverse. It also causes a tightening of the credit markets as fake paper goes bad. So the deficit can't be cheaply covered where financiers (who's fraud caused GFC I) don't see an easy return. So we get GFC II as sovereign entities go bad; caused by GFC I and those self same fraudulent bankers. Who still aren't in jail, and are still paying themselves bonuses.
