Really? Tell me why then Microsoft runs it's own bus service? Tell me why Microsoft contributed HEAVILY for the 40th St exit on 520 - shouldn't traffic be the state/municipalities problem? Infrastructure when heavily leveraged by a major corporation becomes the corporation's problem. The corporation has to exist within the infrastructure and needs to make it work for themselves, their employees, and the local communities that services them and their employees. Otherwise, people move away, services are reduced, and the desire for employees to live there is lessened, making them targets for competitive recruitment.
