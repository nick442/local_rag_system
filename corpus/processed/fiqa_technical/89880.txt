People don't realise this. Their trading Bitcoins doesn't validate its utility and guarantee its survival. They will trade anything which makes money without taking a position on it. Even if they take positions they will be the first one out at the sign of trouble as it happened during the Lehman crisis. In any case this might be some junior guys making a proposal to the management which would most likley get shot down.
