But they were spending on things that people didnt need, ie tanks, guns, bombs. Not things a consumer would want or could use. This is the difference between productive work and the hole diggers I was illustrating before. Govt spending for the sake of spending does not create wealth, it on redirects capital from more productive avenues. Sure the govt needs to spend on war items if there's a legitimate threat of us being attacked. But govt spending should always be kept to a minimum so that the private sector can achieve the highest level of productivity with the scarce resources we have.
