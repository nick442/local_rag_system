I hate articles like this because it encourages irrational investing behavior and increases the chances of people falling victims to scams At the time of the article there was absolutely no guarantee that Netflix was going to beat Blockbuster. Blockbuster was the big whale and instead of taking Netflix seriously they held on to their money maker for too long and then failed to compete when they tried to pivot to renting DVDs and streaming. If Blockbuster handled Netflix how Facebook is handling Snapchat (copying every feature and rolling it out to every asset they have) Netflix could have just as easily died.
