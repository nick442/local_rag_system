"Excellent analysis. I agree that one of the main reasons millenials are so critical of advertising is we have grown up with it our entire lives. The author calls the millenials ""digital natives,"" which is an absolute misnomer and a term I have been using for years to refer to the generation to come, the true digital natives who have been downloading apps since before they were creating memories. We ought to be called Advertising Natives. I am fully aware people are trying to sucker me out of my money for mostly frivolous causes, so I have add blinders on and generally research products before I buy them. Gone are the days of claiming something is NEW AND IMPROVED having any affect on consumers."
