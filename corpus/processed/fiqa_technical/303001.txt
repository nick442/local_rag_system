I agree that their tech incubator works great, but with so much extra cash, I can imagine how investors are frustrated with it just sitting there. If goog paid dividends the investore have the option to plough it back into the company to help fund r&d, or to invest it elsewhere. As it stands, the only options that the investors have are to stay for the ride, or do the wall street walk. Also, nice username. U wsb, bro?
