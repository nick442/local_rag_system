What America needs is a federal union. One that will: - eliminate H1B visa programs - put the wall up and hold employers of illegal immigrants accountable - enforce patent/copyright infringement to the point that trade agreements will be disassembled if there are system, widespread, wholesale violations. - force automation into low paying roles (low paying wages are a scourge and need to be automated as quickly as possible) - provide training pathways and educational opportunities that don't put the trainee/student in debt for the first 10 years of their career The list is really endless, but these are just a few starter ideas to nail to the door of the labor market.
