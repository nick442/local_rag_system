I lived in a non tipping country before coming to the US. Tipping is a far better system. In non-tipping world, the service is typically awful. Servers do the bare minimum to not get fired. There is no incentive. The prices are far higher than US prices + Tip, as the restaurant needs to pay salary to inefficient servers. Tipping culture has driven the US to be an amazing service country. Prices including the tip are still lower than most other western countries AND servers at any busy establishment make far more money. In many countries servers are making around minimum wage, perhaps up to 20% over minimum wage. In the US, great wait staff can earn 6 figures in a good establishment. Tipping is better for customers, better for motivated workers, and better for restaurant owners.
