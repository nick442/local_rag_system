"In San Francisco (home of super-expensive real estate and more than a bit of marijuana use) you'll see people asking up front for ""first and last months' rent"" plus a security deposit when you move in somewhere. If someone can't come up with the cash, then it looks like this is the last month.. and time to look for a new roommate. of course, it can be difficult to implement this arrangement if you've already moved in with a bunch of people, and if it's not common in an area people may balk at the money required up front, but.. it is a reliable way to deal with people flaking out on the rent money."
