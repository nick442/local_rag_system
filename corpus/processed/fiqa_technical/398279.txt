"> In my opinion, companies should be free not to bake cakes for neo-nazis or gay couples. This is where we disagree. I don't think people should be able to turn someone away just because they're gay or hold an opinion I disagree with. We don't have a ""free market"", so you can't simply say that the market will sort this stuff out. It's especially wrong when it starts to involve companies that are involved with credit reporting agencies. After denying them access to payment processers, what's next? Do you deny them food and housing? Healthcare? Deny them a credit score? Do you just want to disenfranchise everyone you disagree with?"
