You're still confused. The first guy in the thread said > All sounds nice for consumers, but you're not mentioning the biggest drawback- the tight stranglehold on supply the taxi industry keeps. You then said > That stranglehold is because of the small margins in the business. Then I said > So medallions are limited (in some cities) because margins are small? That doesn't make much sense. Then you said > Other way around. So, your claim is that the taxi industry keeps a tight strangehold on supply because there are small margins in the business. Then, you say that margins are small because medallions are limited. That is a circular argument.
