It's certainly crushing the legal market. Law schools don't teach you anything about actual practice beyond a few abstract legal form courses. After graduating it was another 2 years of knowing nothing and constantly asking for help. Even if you do get hired, they usually stick you with the partner who is struggling and is already breaking down from stress and alcoholism, so it's never a positive mentor situation. Firms just don't want to bother with training anymore so they expect you to go work the public sector. Except those jobs are all filled with veteran lawyers looking to work less and retire on government money. The gridlock just doesn't end.
