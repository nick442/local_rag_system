As pointed out by other posters, you need to check exact language of your settlement contract. In US, the answer depends on the state where this property is located. For example, in Michigan, one pays their real estate taxes for the current year, but in Illinois, one pays their taxes for the PRIOR year. This means that if you sold your property on January 2nd, 2014 in Michigan, as a seller, you are responsible for the portion of the tax bill for January 1st, 2014 only, and you will compensate the buyer for this amount via settlement provisions. In Illinois, as seller, you are responsible to make the payment in 2014 for tax year 2013. You will either make the full payment yourself or compensate your buyer via settlement funds. You will also compensate them for January 1st, 2014 portion as well.
