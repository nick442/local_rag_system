I supported my claims with research from pew. You can ignore it and continue to parrot Trump talking points or you can look at it and make the connection. I’m not going to hold your hand. It’s not my problem if you’re too stupid to understand the implications of the data I linked. You may not have voted Trump but you do a great job parroting his talking points. Were you also the type of person saying both sides are the same during the election. You clearly have very nuanced views..
