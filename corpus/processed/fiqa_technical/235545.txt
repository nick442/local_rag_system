The short term loan that accept any credit score is really merchant cash advance. They call it loan because clients do have options to pay as direct deposit but most of the times they would make clients switch to their credit card terminals so they can get percentage of daily sales as payment as well as percentage from their partner credit card company. And that kind of payment (percentage of daily credit card sales) is merchant cash advance.
