> but why would select Applebee's if you are longing for a steak? In all seriousness? Because it's already 7:30, and you live in BFE, Flyover Country, and it's an hour's drive to anywhere nice. Because it's your ten year old's birthday, and he wants to take a half dozen friends out for his party, and none of them know any better. Because you're still getting paid 1997 wages on a 2017 cost of living. Because your mom raised you on a strict diet of Marie Callendar's and Hot Pockets, and you don't know any better than to pay steak prices for shitty sirloin. Because your girlfriend's mom also raised on her on shit food, and she makes yuck-faces at places where they put things like horseradish sauce, and rare prime rib, and roasted asparagus on the table. Because your five-year-old is just barely housebroken enough to eat in a restaurant without a built-in playground, and the odds of getting an hour of good behavior go up dramatically when you can bribe her with chicken nuggets, ketchup, macaroni and a Shirley Temple.
