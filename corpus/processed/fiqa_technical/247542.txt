This is exactly what they are doing. Examples would be the BRICS trading bloc and the ASEAN equivalent. Along with the trade agreements that many countries have made with Iran, all of which completely bypass the American Dollar. America needs to recognize that for many countries in the world, dumping their excess reserves in US Treasury Bonds is not in their best interest any longer. Especially considering the fiscal situation in the US, and the policies that are used to manipulate bond rates. (These policies are cross aisle, this is not a political statement) American Imperial might is finite. Americans ignore this at their own peril. Edit: I would also add the regulatory and legal uncertainty in the US is also a problem. By that I mean things like MF Global, Peregrine Financial, Knight Capital among others.
