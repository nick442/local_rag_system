Well I mean they'd have to do both. But there are plenty of stores I go into that just because of the way it's built (I assume they've not intentionally built a faraday cage) I get a terrible signal. It's all in the materials used to build. A lot of places use metal for a layer or two of their roofing, along with concrete walls makes a pretty effective dead zone without even being intentional. I don't think they have to build a complete faraday, just enough to make it annoying and slow to connect outside of their network.
