I haven't watched tv in forever but your post reminded me of just *why* I haven't. Old style tv, while I may not have been able to see the sweat on an upper lip in HD quality, I could watch with out artifacting, lag, and total frame freezing. Digital was fucking *awful* where I lived and, so it seemed, every where else I went.
