"Why don't they raise wages then? Adjust the prices for labor costs and call it a day? Working fast food you're not exactly building valuable workplace skills and your life is more or less on hold, they may as well pay you enough to exist. There is also the question of making sure it's relatively isolated to the area. You can live off working at McDonalds for $10/hr in someplace like Missouri where the COL is super low but as soon as you go someplace like the city that becomes starvation wages. I think companies like the leverage of starvation wages though, it creates a situation where the worker doesn't have anywhere to go and no time to work upward creating a perpetual cycle of working for low wages and being unable to mobilize. I think companies like this because it may reduce turnover. Raising the wages a little more gives people room to develop skills and bounce. At most of my jobs the managers openly talked about not promoting people in school ""because they were just gonna leave anyways"" which about sums up how I feel about it."
