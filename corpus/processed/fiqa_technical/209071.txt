My family business is in Thailand, and I am an Indian citizen, so getting a job in Thailand is not possible. Until I complete Level 1 (if I take the Dec exam), I will have to work in my family business. Then I have will have to shift back to India to find a job while studying for Level 2. It is highly likely that I will not get a job till I finish Level 2. It is also highly likely I may not complete all 3 Levels in the first attempt.
