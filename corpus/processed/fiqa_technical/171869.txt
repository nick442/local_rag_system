I only worked there for all of three months, but I thought it was fine. Nice, friendly people and it's in a great location. However, both of my bosses actually left the company when I was there. To my understanding, there wasn't a whole lot of room for advancement in the company. There are a few divisions where the bulk of employees reside (sales/investor relations, collections, customer support), typical business departments consisting of a couple employees each (accounting, HR, IT), and then a couple of managers plus multiple executives. The company isn't too large, I believe there were around 70-100 people when I was working there. However, I would do a google search and see if you can find someone who worked there more recently or for a longer period of time.
