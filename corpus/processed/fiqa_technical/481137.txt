"Of course it counts - it's privatization of work the military would otherwise have to do themselves. You're right that most of the contractors aren't pulling triggers but I don't think that's the right measure. Is 16% of contractors, >10 thousand people, working in ""security"" not privatization? Type of Work Performed by Contractors Contractors perform a wide range of services in Iraq. As of March 2011, approximately 39,000 personnel (61% of contractors) performed base support functions such as maintaining the grounds, running dining facilities, and performing laundry services (see Figure 8). Security was the second most common service provided, with approximately 10,500 personnel (16% of contractors). Combined, these two categories accounted for almost 80% of DOD contractors in Iraq.
