You know what? I'd love it if I could work a part-time job, but make the same salary (scaled down to the number of hours, obviously). I spend entirely too much time away from the things I'd rather be doing (family, hobbies, relaxing) in my 40 hour hell-hole. I'd much rather take a reasonable cut and work less. Basically, I don't need to get rich, but if I can live off of a reduced salary *and* work fewer hours I'd be a very happy man. Now.. working part time and not earning enough to survive- that's not acceptable at all. I'd be willing to bet the vast majority of part-time jobs are this way.
