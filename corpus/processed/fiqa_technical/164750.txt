I'd definitely say I have doubt in their potential for future growth. Some say all they have to do is continue to grow their user base. The problem there is they don't have very much expansion area among the US population, and only a bit more among western nations in general. Of US internet users, about 70% are already on facebook, and the rest are largely people who will never signup, or people who have had facebook and moved away from it. Outside of the US, facebook has significant competition to deal with. China and India already have established facebook competitors that won't make it easy for them to grow their. Russia is the same. Countries like Germany, France, and England have the same saturation issues as the US. Some say all facebook needs to do is spur ad clicks. The problem there is more and more facebooking is done via mobile apps, where the existing UI's don't even have ads. I'm sure the official Facebook app will start to incorporate ads down the road, but there's still the issue of not many people click them, ever. I really just don't see where their growth will come from.
