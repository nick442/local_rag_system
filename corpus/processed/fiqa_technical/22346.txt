"> I am confused how you spin an ""infinite mileage warranty"" into something negative It will increase their costs in a business model which, until recently, lost money on every unit. It's good news for buyers in the short term. If Tesla goes out of business, however, the infinite-mileage warranty won't make any difference. And, in the larger picture, if they're out of business, their awesome customer-focused model doesn't really benefit their customers in any way."
