Still better than that third customer telling the other two to purchase online from Amazon. Sure, profit goes down further, but still doesn't drop to zero. And price matching [is hardly new](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22price+match+guantee%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&client=safari), nor is it something those stores try to keep secret. They advertise it heavily, and yet the majority of consumers still don't take advantage of it. Best Buy has already matched prices for years -- the only thing new would be matching online retailers.
