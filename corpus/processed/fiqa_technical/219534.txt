Absolutely do research on the company and come with questions. Make sure you send followup thank you emails as soon as possible after your interviews. You have a short interview (two hours is nothing) so unless you interview is with a group of people you will likely have a few to write. Make each thank you individualized. Remember key points from those people and reiterate positive parts of the interview or special things that came up that make you stand out. If you don't have all of the email addresses ask the recruiter or HR contact for them or to pass on your thank you messages. Take two copies of your resume with you, a notebook and pen. Good luck!
