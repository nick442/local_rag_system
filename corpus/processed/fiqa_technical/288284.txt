Ah, so GS didn't tell its customers to sell stocks. Businesses aren't concerned about healthcare, the EPA and the NLRB. Healthcare isn't about to get tossed by the SC. And Fast & Furious wasn't a way to change gun laws. (Try to compare it to Wide Receiver and I guarantee you'll fail like the typical liberal idiot you are.) Oh, and I didn't get downvotes because people think I'm a republican. LOL Why do liberals simply ignore facts? This president is a complete failure and Romney is the only choice we have. Sorry you can't handle the truth. Worthy only of mockery, you shall be laughed at for the next 2 seconds.
