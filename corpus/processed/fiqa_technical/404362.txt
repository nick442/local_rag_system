argument against (in a way) 1.)bad effectiveness of US corps which tend to be international. they want you to be available 24 hours a day. 2.)bad health care - UN and international orgs rate USA as lowest in industrialized nations. Telling the bosss you are sick is often a DEATH BLOW. Some DIABETICS AND OBESE (see the obesity epidemic in USA) are just slow but steady performers. So, they spend a fair amount of UNPAID overtime. 3.) 4.)much of the job training is bad and sometimes COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. so, see need to LEARN ON THE JOB. 5.)by international standards, health care is the worst of the industrialized nations. Letting your boss know about your REAL ILLNESS is often a DEATH BLOW. Moving from job to job is a real HASSLE as to health or medical coverage. So, the boss requires overtime and THE RUSSIANS SAY THE TRUTH: They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work. 8.)in many cases, it is better to work and produce what I call anti-work. Obfuscated code and ties into multiple classes. comments that tend to be re-phrasing of the previous, or that is to be specific, in the the possiblilities that are the latter or correction ..the former.. n to n mappings of such code that includes arrive at (go to code) or go to there and go back (circular)..?? 10.)it is not the overtime or the business necessity. The bosses' boss is often playing on the golf course at the club. Yes, my friends know THE BARTENDER and he is a first person witness. It is the control from the culture of the USA - founded in part on slavery as economics?? President Jefferson not enough to work the slaves to death, but to SCREW or female relations with the female slaves. 14.)more are run by MBA and accountants. IT DOES NOT MATTER - that was the title by Harvard Profess Nick Carr. Info Tech and good programming skillsets are WORTHLESS. So, just cut pay and increase the hours or 'request FREE overtime.' 15.)two way street. NO PROBLEM DOING OVERTIME DURING CRITICAL PERIODS, but certain times (my girlfriend gets vacation and I MUST TAKE VACATION AT THE SAME TIME) - boss does not really care. It's a two way street. 16.)the YOUNG and sometimes foolish and often UNWISE IN BECOMING SLAVES. 17.)THE culture of most of the organization is ASS BACKWARDS. the young coder, who does FREE OVERTIME, codes fast and sloppy, and produces large LOC is the HOTSHOT. the old, experienced coder (like me) who gives only the best time, codes SLOW AND THINKS A LOT and produces REAL QUALITY is the outsider and 'NOT TEAM PLAYER.' team player is cheerleader and faith rallies -prevalent in the USA. works on weekends and LOVES THE COMPANY. Always says good things about the boss, even if the boss is plainly WRONG. there is a BAD BAD TREND in the USA towards contracting. relatively low bids using BAD BAD estimating techniques. So, the ONLY WAY TO MEET THE BUDGET IS TO SCHEDULE FREE OVERTIME. very similar to office cleaners using Hispanic ladies. Union rules - show the real productivity. Any complaints about FREE OVERTIME means reprisal and possible firing. look at the law cases won and the legal journals. Labor is at a disadvantage and that includes even strong UNIONS including software engineers in WISCONSIN. Governor Walker. PS. child labor is LEGAL in PRC or communist china. called an internship. dead end job in factory or even in GAME TESTING at the internet center. a kid, two computers and two mice clicking at various spots to make the system crash is called - FREE LABOR IN TESTING. see recent HBR harvard business review articles on effectiveness and NO CORRELATION with time schedules or OVERTIME schedules. PS. much of the silicon valley 'stock options' or the PREFERRED STOCK FOR FACEBOOK sometimes results in valuation of ZERO cash. But, you the programmer feels like an owner and even rich. Facebook is an illustration, but could apply to other orgs.
