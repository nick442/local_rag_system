Paying yourself first is a method to ensure you are meeting your financial goals whatever they may be. It's also an easy way to automate the process of sending money where you need it go without needing to think about it. Your goals could be to buy a bit of a mutual fund every month, max your IRA, or stash a percentage of each paycheck in a wedding savings account. Maybe you are saving for a house. Knowing you should save and not doing is guilt generating. Paying yourself first means regularly putting money to these goals so you can stop worrying. Any way you figure it, you've still got bills to pay. Paying yourself first means taking care of these payments right off the top of your paycheck. The money goes where you need it. A good move is to automate this with bill pays, ACH transfers to investments accounts, etc. Once this is done, you can guiltlessly spend the money that is left over knowing that you've taken care of the important things and met all your goals. You never have to find yourself wondering if you paid your cell phone bill or if you have enough money to go out tonight. Savings for the new car you want are, as they say, in the bank.
