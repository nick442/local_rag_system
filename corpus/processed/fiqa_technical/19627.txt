im in no position to guess what would happen. rather than sitting in any particular sub, i just usually keep hitting refresh on /r/all/new and see what catches my eye. or in this case. what doesnt. :) i cant see it being phased out tomorrow though, or anytime in the near future, as far as economics of it all go, its my guess its all manipulated by the mega wealthy anyway. we are all stuffed regardless. i know theres a lot of oil in the ME that the west wants. thats why we have wars. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4 if there was an alternative to oil, so long as we all had ~~free~~ access to it, id think there would be no need for war, and instead of the global budget spent on militaries,, we could use it to feed the hungry, shelter the homeless. i think we would all prosper :)
