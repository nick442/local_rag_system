If your gripe is with government fund allocation, that's a completely different conversation we can have. But don't come in here defending corporations for shitty business practices and poor treatment of employees. I'm much less concerned with what the government does with the money, than I am with the fact that a system of checks and balances exists to try and prevent corporations from acting like a bunch of cunts.
