IRA and 401k are investment accounts. 401k accounts may be limited in what you're allowed to invest in more than the IRA, but still - these are investment accounts. The money you deposit in them - is invested, per your instructions. What happens to it is up to you. When you leave your job, if you have some unvested match balance in the 401k, it may be refunded back to your employer, but your own contributions are always vested.
