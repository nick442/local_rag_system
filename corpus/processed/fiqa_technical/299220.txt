I work in this industry, designing coaching programs for people who want to lose weight (and quit smoking among other things). The statistic we often use is that 1/3 of people are obese, with a BMI in excess of 30 (ignoring the very few percent of people for whom BMI is not an accurate measurement). And another 1/3 of people are overweight, with a BMI between 25 and 30. So we have a target of 66% of the population that can be potentially coached to a healthier weight. Making a business case for enough participants is never a problem.
