Why would I ever choose to open a savings account? This is slightly broad and opinion based. If the interest rates are same and other aspects are same [or same to you .. for example savings account allows say 6 debits per month and you only need 4, then its same]. Unless one compares the specifics one can't decide. A checking account may have fees, at times waived if there is direct deposit set-up. It maybe more easy to get phone banking or other aspects. Quite a few items were initially possible with only checking account, get a check book, get a debit card [not just ATM card], etc. These days there are multiple flavours of products that bank is lunching which blur out the lines, hence traditional comparison will not do justice.
