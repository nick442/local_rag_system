that's just not possible. 27% of all US scientists are immigrants and so are 48% of all engineers. America does not produce enough high educated/skilled workers. MS build, or planned on building, a research facility around 5 years ago. They said they can't get enough professors and doctors with adequate education to fill the 9,000 positions. so they asked the INS how to proceed. the INS told them to fill H1b visa applications. that is only once a year and they might get, statistically, only 2000-3000 out of it of they're lucky because most will be rejected or just not get picked (it's a lottery). MS asked Canada, Canada said do whatever, more taxes for us. MS built it in Ontario I think. at the same time Google wrote that angry blog post in their corporate blog about how shitty the H1b situation is.
