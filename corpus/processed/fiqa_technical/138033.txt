Your colleague made a simple and incorrect assumption, that as our society's technology improves, we will use that technology to replace labor with capital, keeping output constant. Clearly this is a contrived example, but it illustrates the point effectively: Suppose we have a factory that produces some level of output and employs 1000 workers. Say a technological breakthrough is developed that allows that factory to produce the same level of output using only 500 workers. Your colleague is assuming those 500 people will lose their jobs. But who is to say the factory won't just double its output? In fact, since the 'Industrial Revolution' that is precisely what we've seen. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution workers have shunned more productive capital in fear they will be replaced. Historically, that has not been the case. Society instead has used the more productive capital to produce more output.
