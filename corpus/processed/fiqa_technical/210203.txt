">In a note this morning from Deutsche Bank's freight and logistics analyst Amit Mehrotra, he notes that the ""WMT vs. AMZN battle is heating up"" and points to a report by DV Velocity, according to which a well respected transportation industry consultant told attendees of a logistics conference that Walmart (WMT) is telling trucking companies that it will no longer do business with them if they continue moving goods for Amazon (AMZN). Basically, an analyst from a foreign company said that a report from another company cited a ""well respected transportation industry consultant"" who told people at a logistics conference that Walmart is telling US trucking companies that it won't do business with them if they continue moving goods for Amazon. This is like quadruple hearsay, from an unreliable website, and should not be relied upon."
