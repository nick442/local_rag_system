Deserved. There's not nearly enough accountability in the finance industry these days. No one went to prison for anything related to the 2008 housing/mortgage crisis; also read in the Chicago Tribune today that somebody got off with just *fines* for billions of dollars of tax fraud. It's ridiculous.
