ok.. That's not a risk of making an investment. That's the risk of an investment failing. My point is, the workers ARE actually the ones taking the biggest risk - their lives, health, family and homes DEPEND on the companies employing them. And if those companies fail, they need a financial cushion to get them into the next job just like investors need some investments to make a profit to cushion the ones that don't. But as it stands now, the investors are getting every pillow in the land and the workers are left to hit solid rock as they fall. They aren't getting a comparable share of the profits they are making - not nearly enough to provide any sort of savings scheme anyway - when the companies and investors are rolling in profits. And that's NOT the way to a healthy society.
