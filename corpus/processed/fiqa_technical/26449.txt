"> Would they go up at all? I assume, based on the rest of your post, that this is in reference to new tenants? > If the minimum wage goes up some workers might choose to move out from living with relatives or roommates so there would be some increase in demand but we wouldn't be ""overflowing with potential tennants"" I was referring to the areas where people who are currently making $15/hr live. People can always live in cheaper areas, but the neighborhood generally reflects that, so people would rather live in the nicer places with less crime and better roads. That you assume people will have relatives that they can live with tells me something. > and if rents started going up these new entrants to the housing market would likely fallback on their original housing setup with would moderate the impact. Looks like you're starting to get it. > As far as gas goes, while I don't have specific numbers in front of me, I think it's a reasonable assumption that US labor costs are a relatively small percentage of what you pay at the pump so even if those costs went up you wouldn't expect prices to surge. Oh, sorry, I thought you meant gas for the stoves and heat. You mean gasoline (maybe the brits have it right by calling it petrol). That will increase as the value of our dollar decreases in relation to the rest of the world, due to the fact that we don't really make anything anymore."
