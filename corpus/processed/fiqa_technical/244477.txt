Oh sure. That 10,000 negates all the benefits from our laws (this part is huge, considering it protects against copyrights, poor food and water quality, poor product processes, poor treatment of workers), peace keeping, national security, diplomacy, standards of living, disaster response, elections and leadership, and on and on! This anti-government reductionist attack is so insanely short sighted, I donâ€™t understand how anyone can even imagine it is believable. Edit: If you want to see some REAL rent seeks big, just make all our infrastructure privatized. I doubt the private sector would hestitate even a second before exploiting us for our infrastructure needs.
