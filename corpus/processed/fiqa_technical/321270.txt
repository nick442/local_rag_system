">Goods that are exchanged for financial value, which you can use to increase your own standard of living at the expense of the people importing your goods. If you're doing that, you're running balanced trade, not a surplus. To run a surplus, you have to accumulate the financial claims. That's why you see Japan and China for example holding large balances of US dollars which they just park in treasuries. If you pursue trade surpluses as a policy, you're stuck holding the money. >I've been ""emphasizing"" a bottom line this entire time! It's the wrong line though. A *voluntary* financial constraint that forces real output capacity into idleness leaving a country poorer in real terms."
