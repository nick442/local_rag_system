Yeah any tax cut plan is going to help the rich. Derp. That's not a bad thing lol. Really the rich need to pay less, the middle class needs to pay less, and the poor need to pay in a little instead of none and or getting tax refunds yet paying no taxes (income tax I mean). I'm a flat tax guy myself, with no loopholes. But that's a pipe dream :(.
