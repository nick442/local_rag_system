We have a very mixed economy. If takeovers were all a case of a more competent organization taking over a less competent organizations then there would be no need for vetting. But that is not the case. We have companies that are monopolies thanks to their relationship with governments. They are not more efficient, better run, more visionary, or more capable. Indeed, they are often dependent on a single monopoly, in a single market. Everything else they touch turns to crap. They acquire other companies trying to stave off their own collapse. Do you want to invite companies like that come into your market and link important companies, in vital markets to that house of cards?
