It's technically correct to say BK will still pay taxes on all profits made here in the US, the problem here is that it's very easy to structure this whole thing so that there are no US profits. Company A sells itself to Company B, which it also owns. Company A transfers all its' intellectual property to Company B which then charges Company A a fee to use it. The fee is structured so that Company A makes zero profit and Company B makes all the money.
