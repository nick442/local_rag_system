Western Union is one way to send emergency cash to a family member. It seems suspicious as a method of goods payment because many frauds have used it as a means of collecting irreversible payments. EBay and Paypal would be a better more trustworthy way to sell to usa customers. Most USA banks need a USA address for the account owner... But you may not need a USA bank account as PayPal can store and exchange funds to other currencies.
