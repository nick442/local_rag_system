How can you have a competition against facebook. Isn't it a natural monopoly. Why have two social accounts. Also amazon shouldn't be compete with other internet retailers but natural ones which could be prevented with internet tax. These internet companies are the biggest companies in the world and US because they find a empty spot where they capitalize on advantages of internet. If there is a scaling tax for these companies it would only hurt their profit since their workers aren't paid a lot anyway. So in natural cases competition would be healthiest way but i don't believe other firms can emerge in this markets and amazon could kill real life retailers in 10-20 years time. 8 years ago biggest firms were banks and investment firms while now market is dominated by internet/tech companies because internet is a very effective tool for shopping.
