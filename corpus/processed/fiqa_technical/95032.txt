You have a very pointed way of putting people down that you disagree with, but you are not in the least bit interested in conversation or exchanging ideas. In two posts you have presented not one argument, but you have insulted me in each post. If indeed you had an argument insults would be beside the point. I can only conclude that you have no argument. Only hatred. Hatred will not sustain your life. Grow some balls. Look around you. Find out what is really going on. Expand your data base. And most of all start thinking for yourself.
