This is great. I have a question though. What happens if I have all of the plans for finance mapped out and ready to meet a potential investor, but the idea that I bring with me is not patentable? I certainly would like to get financing and let the investor know what I want to accomplish, but I don't want to give away my idea and have the investor take my idea and run his own company with it. How is this dealt with?
