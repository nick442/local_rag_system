> Relative to Netflix, I don't feel like Prime holds up. I mean, yeah. Netflix also costs more than Prime every year, and doesn't come with all the real reasons I have prime :) I feel you on the Tivo issue, I wish they were better about that. I play it through the desktop PC hooked up to my living room TV, and I have a fire stick in my bedroom, so that experience is definitely different between us. But yeah, you may just not be into their originals. They'll keep trying though, haha, they got all sorts of money flooding into that.
