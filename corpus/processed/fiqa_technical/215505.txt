I live in a relatively low cost-of-living area. I started at $50k, would be close to $70k now if I had kept that job. I make $45k currently, however I just started in a big corporation and advancement should come pretty soon. It's enough to pay bills and live comfortably now though. I should mention I'm single and I don't have kids, so that helps.
