"You do realize the financial state of most older airliners, or the top guys has dramatically decreased since 2001. In fact many are on the verge of collapsing all together, American took a 3-4% drop to their overall gains this last quarter. The security measures have in itself added another problem to the entire air industry and just created a larger stigma as to why flying in US airports is bollocks. If you think the US state department asked the airlines anything, you must be a little off on your politics. Anything NSA has their hands on won't ever ask cooperating parties what they think. Which again has been a dramatic reason as to why so many ""security"" orientated implementations since 2001 have been nothing but an extreme drain on already wobbly financial situations. This tax could be the straw that breaks the camels back and some airliners may fold under or just stop going to those locations and charge more for international flights."
