"I've heard similar sentiments parroted. The one I hear the most from the older generation is ""they're not making more land, so property values are guaranteed to go up!"". If there's one thing people need to understand, it's that before you start listening to expert advice, looking at rates, or building large abstract models or plans based on how you see the market, it's to know that fundamentally a market is a very simple thing: people are buying, and people are selling. If someone is selling for that price, it's because the cash is worth more than the property to them. You would have to be insane to sell if you genuinely believed it would double (or at least be guaranteed that it would appreciate faster than your mortgage rate)."
