There has been no poaching of employees. The employees are not being hired away- they are being called out for short rides that waste their time. Call for a 1 block lift- it takes a driver out of action for the time it takes to get there, carry the passenger, then get to the next dispatch. So I retract my statement and replace it with a caution to ensure you comprehend what you are reading before you reply.
