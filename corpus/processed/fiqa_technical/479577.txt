I don't know if Canada's immigration policy would be a huge draw. Not because Amazon wouldn't want it, but because if the US actually gets so dumb it truly restricts quality immigration, who's to say it won't get dumb about border crossing? Even just making it unpleasant could be enough to ward off the best and brightest. Meanwhile there are actual Canadian cities in the running which would allow Amazon to avoid the risk entirely. I know the Toronto bid actually had a letter from the Prime Minister vouching that Canada would be accommodating.
