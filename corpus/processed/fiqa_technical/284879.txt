👍😂 haha I'm also very cynical & jaded, think we all are to differing degrees. I don't get why our free market economy relies on constant and continuous growth in producing goods/services. Doesn't this contradict the entire point of economics in that there are scarce resources ? How can we keep increasing our production of goods from a limited amount of resources?. I can't see it ending any other way than mass destruction, I mean war and famine will wipe out a massive proportion of the human race from earth & financial systems will collapse as this unrestrained economic 'growth' will get so out of control we'll pass a tipping point where there's just are not enough resources to sustain it. The real value then is in resources not money, money is just something we made up.
