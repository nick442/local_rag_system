What are the misconceptions? And why do you feel the hate is undeserved? From what I've seen, most people have a pretty accurate impression of what these places are trying to do. It's a business that tries to skirt the edges of gambling laws while still letting people feel like they're gambling. Which pisses people off on two fronts - it brings gambling to places they don't think it should be, and it's a often a transparent attempt to get around following the rules. Both of which are pretty reasonable things to be annoyed by.
