It's unfortunate that these spots cannot be filled with US citizens. Not sure if it's a problem with our education system, but our economy moved from manufacturing to services and high tech enterprise. I'm surprised our citizens are so underqualified that Microsoft is having trouble filling 6000 spots with millions of US citizens.
