"So this situation is fraud. -SumGuy: ""Hey Mr. Target employee can I use this to buy this."" -Employee: ""Abso-fucking-lutely Sir"". The responsibility lies on the store, not the customer in this situation. Terms of service on things like coupons are not LAWS, they are terms a company is telling you they will accept. For this Company to then accept it makes these people a few bucks richer, not criminals. The customers did not lie or hide what they where doing, and the company accepted it. Good on em I say."
