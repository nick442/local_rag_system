I don't like some of the engineering work that I do but yes I do like having a job. I don't think that's a crime - I enjoy the financial and project managing side of my job more than modeling and technical analysis.. I'm sorry that I want more information that sounds cool to me and may be something I want to make a career switch towards? Is there something wrong with this reasoning? I can see if it looks a bit naive since I am unsure of some parts of my thinking as well so please let me know if what I fleshed out seems like a ridiculous or dumb decision!
