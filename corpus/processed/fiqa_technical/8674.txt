>banking practises thrive through deception. and >A bank is in other words, just moving money from A to B and then making profit out of thin air due to the capitalistic systems nature and >they are private govt agencies I realize these are just snippets, but from other debate threads it seems there is a lot of misinformation about what banks are. I have only taken a few finance classes so I was coming here to see what /r/finance thinks a bank is. Sorry if I let me own bias show in my post, I wasnt trying to let it. But I still havent seen anyone mention the benefits of credit. It seems most peoples perception of a bank is very simplistic.
