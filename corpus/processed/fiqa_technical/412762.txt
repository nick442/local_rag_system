"I'm guessing a 6 figure income but I'd settle for upper middle class. I've not looked at what the top 20% of income statistics look like. They likely include a sector of ""sub rich"" or even sub super rich if you will that heavily finance the lifestyle. It's getting hard to define what rich really is because the inequality is so great. For many rich would be simply doubling or tripling thier income. The reality is that rich now means exponentially richer."
