No worries. So I suppose it depends on your current excel experience. I never had a ton which is why I picked it up. I'm almost through section 4 of the course, and learning conditional formatting, dynamic names in cells, and other shortcuts. I haven't touched anything finance related necessarily. Section 5 looks to be where the advanced formula lessons start, and Section starts P&L construction. As someone with limited experience beforehand it's been great
