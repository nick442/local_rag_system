I'd breath a bit. You actually aren't in that much of a pickle as you think. Your credit card debt is your number one priority. After that is paid off you need to think about what your financial goals are. You mentioned you wanted to start a family. I'm assuming you are in a solid relationship that would be conducive for this. You need to start planning out how much it's going to cost and then tack on another 50% because babies are expensive. I wouldn't worry about being debt free but you do need to get that car loan down to where you owe less than the car is worth. Honestly though your debt seems highly manageable if you just create and stick to a budget.
