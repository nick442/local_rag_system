"Yeah.. Colombia is one of the top Emerald mining countries of the world. I recommend you to investigate a little bit about it, check emerald prices in your country, then you'll find out if it's really profitable for you. If so, I recommend you to buy them at the ""Emerald Trade Center"" located in Bogota, all gemstones there, are certified, sometimes you can find people selling really cheap emeralds on the street, but most of the time it's a scam. Depending on size, color Weight, treatment, etc. Emeralds are less or more expensive. You can buy just the emerald or emerald Jewerly. Once I met a Colombian guy in Aruba, who buys emeralds in his country and then he sells it in Aruba. He said, it was profitable in Aruba.
