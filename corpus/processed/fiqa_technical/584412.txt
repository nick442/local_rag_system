At present, Australia is looking like a good bet. I'll need to find a new job as part of the move. The problem with waiting until after things fall apart to move is that it may no longer be easily possible, and even if it is possible to leave, it may not be possible to take wealth out of the country. It would not surprise me at all for instance, to discover after high double digit inflation starts, that it was difficult to move precious metals out of the country. There is a distinct possibility that the government might choose to seize precious metals even from people not leaving. It wouldn't be the first time in US history that it was illegal for US citizens to own gold and silver (for those owning coins minted after 1933, the government could instead choose to redeem them at face value - i.e., a $20 gold piece for $20).
