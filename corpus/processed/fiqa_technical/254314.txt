Unpaid internships though are the bread and butter of unskilled labour. In many fields, taking in someone who has no skills and nothing really to contribute to the enterprise but would like to work in the field for experience, paying them makes no sense as they do little other than take up time of staff teaching them. If they prove themselves and develop their skills, thus improving the productivity of the enterprise then they deserve to be paid.
