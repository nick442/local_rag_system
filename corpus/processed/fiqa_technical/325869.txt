"> I'm sure if you post an ask reddit asking about people who smoke and what they do for a living you will be outright amazed at the cross section you find. And you'll be amazing at home many kids that are 30 and living at home there are as well. Its known to cause a lack of motivation. The thing is, the daily smokers are the problem and most professionals aren't daily smokers. > Now, that anecdotal evidence is not super compelling as there are confounding factors. But it's far more compelling than ""This is how it is because this is how I feel it is"", which seems to be the gist of your responses. My undergrad degree is in psychology and the whole field agrees with what I'm saying. Like you said, the data set (you and your friends) you are using is too small AND who said you couldn't make more money if you didn't smoke? I'm not saying you would or wouldn't, but you can't use your argument unless you can prove that you wouldn't make more money if you didn't smoke. You would need to compare you to you. There are many other important factors as well you are ignoring. Do I want a happy employee or one that is so broken he needs to use drugs to take the edge off and make it from one day to the next? And why should I risk millions in lawsuits from an impaired employee? I would also get sued for negligence if I have impaired employees working with machinery or anything that can hurt them or others and I don't test them. > But it's far more compelling than ""This is how it is because this is how I feel it is"", which seems to be the gist of your responses. Like I said, there is a whole field of science that supports what I'm saying. I'm not making an argument based on feelings, its based on data."
