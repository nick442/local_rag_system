As an electric vehicle engineer.. I can say that shitty 18650 batteries are not the only bottleneck in vehicle production. If your supply chain is completely dependant on out of date battery technolgy, one small part of an EV, the vehicle will be postponed a great deal. There are many many facets to vehicle production than 1/5 of the powertrain.
