One owns bar/restaurants and is a millionaire, but claims he never used anything he learned from the degree. He is more of a COO so in a way he doesn't need to think about the economics of the business. He just needs to operate/maintain. The other, lost his job so parents bought him a gas station. These people never really went the corporate route so they aren't the best examples, imo.
