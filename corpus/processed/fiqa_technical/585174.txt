This always happens with these types of liquidations though; it happened with Zellers, it happened with Target, and it is (or soon will be) happening to the Sears stores. Yet, somehow it works. The stores are often packed, people buy anything worth owning when it's close to regular price, and by the time you reach the >60% off part of the sale, there's nothing left that's actually worth buying.
