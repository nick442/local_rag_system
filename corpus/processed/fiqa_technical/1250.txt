"A majority of employers view the: >""there weren't any jobs"" excuse as *""you weren't good enough for a job""*. I'm not arguing that there aren't more workers than jobs, it's just that employers expect to get top talent for their dollar. Why snag someone who was/is unemployed (and hence undesirable), when you can potentially steal fresh employed talent from your competitors dealing a blow to their business and a boost to your own? That's the situation we have today in the labor market. American society and the bootstrap mentality dictate that unemployment is the fault of the unemployed. I don't see how this recession has made any significant inroads towards changing this widely held (mis)conception."
