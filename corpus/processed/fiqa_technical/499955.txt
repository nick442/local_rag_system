I've always wondered why the USPS was a sponsor of Lance Armstrong, for example. It's incredibly hard for me to give a shit about the fact that they're in debt (besides the fact that they're government funded so in the end I get screwed regardless) and are getting further into it when I think about their priorities in the past and current. They've sponsored all sorts of things and been part of campaigns..like movies and other sports..If they are supposed to make enough money to be self sufficient then I'd think at some point someone would have come in and said, 'So hey, we're currently in some serious debt here so perhaps it wouldn't be the best use of the money we get from the government to sponsor shit'. Companies sponsor things in order (or at least in large part) to gain brand awareness. It's the effing post office. Everyone knows who they are. They come to everyone's house almost every day. Same goes for all the money they spend in their own marketing campaigns..be it print, television etc.. How about tax payers vote on where we think our money is best spent when that money is going to a private company? At some point you'd think they'd take a hint from companies like FedEx and UPS and spend all that money on making sure their service was on par with them..but they don't. They just keep taking and taking and reducing services and maintaining shitty customer service etc.
