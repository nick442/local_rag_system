I fully expect you to be back here in July, telling people that the employment figures are actually terrible, according to the non-seasonally adjusted numbers. Or as the case probably will be, telling people that the employment figures are *more* terrible. :( I think a more helpful figure would be the new 3-month average: +96,000. Quite bad.
