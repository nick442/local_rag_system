"Honestly, last night was the worst I've seen in terms of spam being submitted. Normally, the filter gets it. I've removed the majority of those articles reported as ""spam."" As for the political tones of the submissions, I think we do a pretty good job in terms of keeping the article headlines neutral and to a certain extent, the content."
