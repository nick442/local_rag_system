Well, holy shit better sell everything. Here's the same guy saying this in 2013: http://www.moneynews.com/Economy/Levy-economy-recession-debt/2013/08/07/id/519172/ Then in 2012: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QICgObHj4dg And he was saying this in 2010: http://demandsideblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/double-dip-week-david-levy.html Eventually he will be right, but you know it's just not that impressive. Tired of my more doom and gloom investor friends sending me links to this guy.
