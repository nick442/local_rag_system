"> Thirteen out of 41 republicans voted against Carswell, and 17 out of 43 for Haysworth. And 6 out of 46 Republicans voted against Bork. > It would only serve to fire up their worst partisans with the ""indignity"" of it all. Several of the Republicans I have talked to about this don't realize what the Republicans did. One even wondered why Obama never appointed anyone. I guess I think the partisans are going to be fired up about something regardless. Might as well make it about a real topic. > Fights to the death are zero sum games. I agree. I just think zero-sum is better than what the Democrats have been getting the past few decades. > All this ignorance is perpetuated by the climate of us versus them that only gets worse every time you double down. So the Trump campaign was the worst I have seen in terms of ignorance and an ""us versus them"" climate. Two questions for you in regards to it. 1) Do you think the Democrats did any doubling down to warrant this campaign? If so, what? 2) Trump won on balls and showmanship. He lied often but never backed down. He made tons of nebulous promises without giving specifics. He stoked the ""us versus them"" climate and then he won. Doesn't that suggest to you that modern American politics are not about issues or compromise but mostly about fanning flames?"
