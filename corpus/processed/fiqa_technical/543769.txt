"'dumb on purpose'? -- uncalled for. The primary point of the comment you replied to was calling out that a bike vs a tesla was not much of a race at all..specifically a ""bike racing a car"". You replied 'not sure if serious', focusing on an inconsequential detail of the statement (price of the bike). The parent could have said $10k or 20k and it still wouldn't have invalidated the primary point."
