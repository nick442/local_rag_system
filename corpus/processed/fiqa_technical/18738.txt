Perhaps your view of the world should be *more* calloused? It seems like you think the world owes you something..it doesn't owe you shit. You could die in a ditch and the world wouldn't give 2 shits. Maybe the world IS calloused; has that crossed your mind? Have you traveled outside of the college campuses in Northeast US? Shit can get pretty crazy out there in the real world. And you still haven't even put forth an argument, or idea, or verbalized what you are pissed about. Are you just mad at the world? Think the system is unfair? Just want other people's stuff? What change would you make in the world? . . >I hope that you never have to face adversity in your life. I did. >I hope they tell you to just simply get a better job, I hope they tell you to take responsibility for your own life They did.
