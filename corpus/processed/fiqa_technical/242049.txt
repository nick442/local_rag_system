/u/tyby linked to AVE's [teardown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ). This thing is built on the printer and ink / game console model. Those $400 machines probably cost more than that to make. It's as if Keurig only sold commercial machines, at a loss, while requiring a $2,000+ per year subscription. The idea of K-cups for juice is fine. Writing the manufacturing people and engineers close to a blank check is not fine.
