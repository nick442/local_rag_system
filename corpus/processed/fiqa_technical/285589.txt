We are a pretty average (professional, used to be fully two-income) family. I have gone part-time (plus a total career change) to be more involved at home - that's minus 50K from our family budget a year. Montessori for the younger one is - 10K. Violin (-5K) and piano (-5K) lessons for each kid.. summer science camps.. summer golf/tennis plus equipment.. dance/sports all year round are around 10K too. We are looking at an 80K hole in our budget (compared to what we could have had). Plus by now I would have been probably more advanced in my previous career had I stayed there, so the hole is potentially even greater.
