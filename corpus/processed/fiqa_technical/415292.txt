"From a financial point of view: If your savings are 'free' (you don't expect to need it in the near future): pay off the loan completely. You say you feel a little hesitant, and this I understand. ""What if you unexpectedly do need that cash in the near future?"" A simple solution is to pay off the loan in 4 or 6 steps, say each other month. This way you mitigate the risk of regret."
