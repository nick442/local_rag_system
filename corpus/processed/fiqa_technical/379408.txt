Whirlpool has absorbed a number of its erstwhile competitors over the years. Maytag, KitchenAid, Magic Chef, Jenn-Air, and Amana are all made by Whirlpool now. Frigidaire and GE are the two remaining major American makers of major household appliances (Hotpoint is GE) and Frigidaire is actually owned by Electrolux now. It's my understanding that Sears has been switching over to LG for some of its Kenmore appliances. Their flagship front-load washers and dryers sport features nigh-identical to top-end LG models. This relationship, by the way, may be largely responsible for the increased availability of LG parts and service in the US recently (spotty availability of parts used to be a hazard of buying LG). We had two service calls on our Whirlpool Cabrio top-load washer while it was still under warranty. The repair guy told us they are generally reliable in his experience, however, and that ours was something of an anomaly. After replacing the main motor and the controller board, we have what is basically a brand new appliance internally. It is still occasionally flaky (every few months it forgets how to spin the drum) but I figured out an easy workaround that has worked so far. My advice, though, is to definitely buy the extended warranty.
