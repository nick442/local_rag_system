In finance, a lot say corporate tax is the original sin. Corporate taxes make debt financing more attractive, so every company's debt ratio is much higher than it would be if there were no corporate tax, which makes them more vulnerable to shocks in cashflow and at higher risk of default in a downturn. A slight downturn can snowball into a larger one because companies are so heavily debt financed they end up unable to service their debt, and end up in worse situations than if they were more equity financed. Subsequently, banks become much more important in the economy because everyone is more leveraged, and more company value is tied up in bank/debt balances. Of course, the voting public doesn't generally want to lower the corporate tax rate; because the general population believes this is how they get their pound of flesh out of corporate america -- however that is rarely the case.
