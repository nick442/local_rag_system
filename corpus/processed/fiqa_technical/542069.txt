I would love to assist you. It’s funny that even when I got my MBA I still didn’t know how to make money. I believe education is going to be mainly on line in the future. Just let me know how I can help. My email is wilkinsd@aol.com (yes I’m old school). Also can be reached via text at 205-394-4242.
