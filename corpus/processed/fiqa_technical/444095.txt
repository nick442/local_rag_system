No, there is no advantage. There may be some peace of mind at no cost if you are already in the lowest tax bracket. Otherwise, it is actually disadvantageous. Consider the following scenario: RRSP HBP withdrawal $15000 ($1000/y repayment), You are required to pay back $1000 a year with no tax advantage. Any additional RRSP payments can be designated as HBP (no tax advantage) or as a regular RRSP contribution Tax = (Taxable Income - contributions) * rate. So, you are forgoing the tax benefit for no advantage.
