Nope. Ford are moving production to eastern and southern europe (where wages and employee protection are low), trusting that the EU will continue and that they will be able import vehicles to one of their primary markets without actually making the vehicle here. Its actually one of the inequities of 'free trade' - the freedom for large companies to shop their production facilities around the world and in doing so make employees and the rich OECD countries poorer. Eventually it will have to come to a screaming halt.
