TV has always been innovative, it's just that new players have emerged (mainly in Hulu and Netflix) which arguable unjustifiably threatens their position. Hulu and Netflix are trying to eat TV/Cable's lunch while they bring nothing new to the table, essentially they are getting a free lunch off the work of the TV industry. I don't know how/why TV became the bad guys. I think it's mainly because people are cheap and figure they will still get high-quality programming on the internet for free. The problem is that if TV ever goes away, say goodbye to quality programming. The only content available on the internet will be cheap reality shows, low-budget comedies, and the occasional hollywood movie which companies like Netflix and Hulu will try to kill. This is a lose-lose situation. We need TV, to underestimate the value of the TV industry is a serious oversight.
