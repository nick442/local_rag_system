There is no reason he needs to know the full project's budget. Clearly define the problem you need him to solve and ask him to quote you a price. If it's more than a weeks work I suggest reviewing in stages. It's very common for inexperienced developers to find themselves out of their depth and burn time. This is important if he's charging you by the hour and not a fixed price. Also, make sure you have very clear specifications and expectations from your client so you avoid scope-creep. Changes made by your client can lead to more costs with your backend developer. Ideally you should have provisions with your client contract that you can increase the fee when changes are requested. This usually happens when a project isn't spec'd in enough detail. Good luck with your project.
