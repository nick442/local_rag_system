very interesting. I deal with speculation all day every day, I wish there was a dependable method to determine what actually happens in these possibly nefarious and possibly innocent events. I believe that Sadam Hussain and Momar Quadafi were deposed/eliminated because they both traded oil for currencies other than dollars.
