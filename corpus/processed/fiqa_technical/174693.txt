That's a very good point. As much as I love cars I'd be happy to have the choice of any high end car on demand at the touch of a button, and not have to maintain it or take the hit of depreciation. The insurance premium then will be down to manufacturers or car suppliers, who are probably big enough to run their own insurance schemes. In this scenario perhaps it doesn't bode well for Geico, unless they get into the car business.
