In reality, shareholders have very few rights other than the right to profits and the right to vote on a board. In general, a proxy fight to replace the board is complicated and expensive, so unless the interested parties buy close to 50% of the shares it's unlikely to be successful. Furthermore, a lot of the shares are held by insiders and institutions. I suppose if a large group of shareholders got together and demanded this, the existing directors may listen and give in to avoid unhappy shareholders being a general annoyance. That seems pretty unlikely unless the stake gets large. There's a great episode of NPR Planet Money [board games](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/07/19/538141248/episode-594-board-games) which talks about one man's struggle to get the company to take some action.
