> Soooo those bombings and stabbings happening on a daily basis are irrational fear because it didn't happen to you right? Those bombings and stabbings are an irrational fear because it is incredibly improbable. The Grenfell fire alone will likely kill more people than terrorism in the UK for the past 20 years combined, (79 dead and climbing vs 89 deaths to terror since 2000). Terrorism is a more complex problem than a demagogue shouting BAN ALL MUSLIMS! If that's not utilizing fear, I don't know what is (especially since white terror attacks are conveniently ignored by Trump).
