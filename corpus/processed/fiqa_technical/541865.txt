The general rule is to spend as little as possible on transportation, as it is an expense. Many people can get by without a car at all, but you say you can not. So, what you need is the cheapest car that is sufficiently reliable for your needs. I suggest you do not need three cars. You don't need to loan cars to your children; if they need a car, they can get a job and buy one, or borrow your reliable vehicle if (but only if) you are not using it. I would suggest, then, selling two of your vehicles and holding on to one for your daily commute. Pick the car you judge to be the most reliable. However, not all decisions are made purely rationally. My vehicle is a 2012 Subaru Forester. AWD is very nice in my snowy climate, but I could have picked up a second hand vehicle for a lot less money. Similarly, you may choose to hold on to a second or even a third vehicle because you judge it a reasonable use of your money. It's an unnecessary expense, but so is coffee and you can have my coffee when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers. More generally, there's a rule of 28/36. Roughly speaking, that says that a household should spend a maximum of 28% of its gross income on housing expenses (mortage, heating, etc. etc.), and no more than 36% on total debt (the aforementioned housing, plus also car loans, credit cards, and other loan repayments). If you are spending significantly more than that, it's time to seriously consider selling one or two of your cars, plus cutting back elsewhere. If you are significantly below that, the fact that you may be underwater on your home may be a far less pressing matter.
