Perhaps you have heard of 'The Paris Accord'. No? Shame. The entire rest of the world signed on to it. So, yay 'murica and all but the rest of the world is dropping dollars on that big time. Norway banned oil heating in all homes and businesses. 100,000 homes and business have 2 years to scrap their oil heating systems. 2 years! Germany completely banned the sale of internal combustion engines by 2030, India 2031, Norway, 2025, china wants 60% of the whole fleet to be electric in cities by 2030. Canada is raising their carbon taxes even higher, BC alone is set to $40mil on public car chargers this year and that is just the public money. The rest of the world is moving and America is being left behind. 10 gigafactory sized battery plants are currently under construction and battery prices have been dropping by 30% per kwh per year every year. Power storage is expected to be the next semiconductor race for costs. Like smartphones, this is the next tech boom and reading what is going on the industry right now is staggering. They are ramping up battery production like no time seen in recent history. Oil prices are as much a function of speculation into the future as right now. The entire industry is slashing investment because they know that in a few short years it will become a shrink industry and that is not good for the bottom line. Saudi Arabia and most oil countries with 'cheap easy oil' are now vested in pumping as much oil as they can in the next decade. Leaders have quoted as saying 'what we don't pump in the next 10-15 years will never be pumped'. The race is now on to pump cheap oil fast because these guys have driven tesla P85D's and they know what's up. Prices will continue to stay low because they want to crush the competition and be the last to sell oil. Holding on to their vast reserves is now bad for business where as before it was waiting for higher prices when you close the tap.
