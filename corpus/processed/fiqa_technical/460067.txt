Just finished moving my Mother In Law from her 1500+ sq ft condo into 400 sq ft assisted living. We had grandiose ideas of selling all the valuable antiques and furniture to help her financially. Turns out no one wants it, for the most part. Made a few hundred dollars for many hours of works from half a dozen people. Ended up giving 80% of it to Goodwill/Salavation Army. Even her $6000 fur coat was only worth $200. Too much supply, not enough demand. All I know is that my wife and I are now going through our stuff and getting it out of our lives so our son doesn't have to deal with it (in the *far* future, hopefully!)
