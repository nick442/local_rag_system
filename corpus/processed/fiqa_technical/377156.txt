"Yeah. I went to a free seminar which was really just a roundabout sales pitch for their expensive seminars. They promised big secrets etc. Yet when I asked the guy what his portfolio consisted of, ""Some property and some stocks"" was his reply. ""So how did you get them and choose them?"" I asked. ""We cover that in our other seminars which you can sign up for."" yeah and pay tons for. Obviously he was there to drum up sales for nebulous and vague seminars on ""Wealth Building."" for a thousand bucks. I'd rather just buy a thousand bucks on investment books. Least I know ill be getting worthwhile knowledge out of that. Tl;Dr felt like a scientologist sales pitch. Lots of show and money spent. Probably bullshit aliens at the end."
