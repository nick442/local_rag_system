I wouldnt call it being duped. Using the examples you provided it seems to me that both parties are purchasing a product or service they find value in for a price they deem to be reasonable. We all have things we like to do that cost us money that other people may not understand. They're called hobbies. EDIT: I don't play video games and would never pay for one. I do not find it to be entertaining.
