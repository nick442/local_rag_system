I'm not OP, but I think a very basic example would be brand choice. Every day people choose to buy cheaper products over greener products. Styrofoam cups still exist because people buy them. Companies get as big as Walmart because people shop there. If people really have a shit, they could simply make different choices in a capitalistic system that would then promote small local business and sustainable practices. But people choose lower prices every single time, without regard to the inequalities or environmental destruction their choices promote.
