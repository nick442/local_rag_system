"I think that technology has had a huge impact on the salary aspect of ""unpaid weekend work"". It's so easy to fire off an e-mail in between links while fucking off on Reddit and watching T.V., that I have no problem ""working on the weekend"". I haven't heard of many jobs in the U.S. that don't compensate for every hour that you are on premise, however, and that would be a very disturbing trend to see emerging."
