"What ever you convert from the 401(k) will be subject to tax. The bigger issue is that there's no ""do over"" no ability to recharacterize the conversion if when you do your taxes, you realize you need to undo some. I'd suggest transferring from the 401(k) to the traditional IRA first and then convert, just bring aware of the prorata taxation that will be due."
