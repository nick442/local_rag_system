Oh, I see where the confusion is from. Amazon controls 41% of new book sales, and 41% of all book sales (including used books) are from online retailers. Those two being so similar was throwing me off. I was meaning to reference all *new* book sales, since the dispute between hachette and Amazon has very little to do with used books as far as I'm aware. Both I and the article I referenced could have made that distinction more clear. Again, regardless, Amazon is a big enough of a player in the market that they should not be messing with the price, availability, and visibility of a publisher's print books as negotiating tactic in ebook prices. The financial impact on Hachette doesn't seem to be as big as I initially thought, but any lost revenue in Hachette's print book sales as a result of Amazon's actions to convince them to accept their ebook terms seems unethical.
