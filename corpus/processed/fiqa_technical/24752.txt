Gone are the days when in India, the fuel price was revised on every fortnight. Many times you would have filled up the tank one day before to save few bucks. Now, from 16th June 2017 onwards, Government has decided to revise the daily fuel price at 6 AM according to the international crude oil and dollar prices with respect to rupee value. The notion behind taking this step was just to remove the big leap in fuel rates and also a government initiative to maintain the demand and supply situation in equilibrium.
