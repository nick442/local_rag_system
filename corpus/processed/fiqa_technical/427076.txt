I would first get rid of the student loan. This will leave you with 11K. I would then use this to fund your ROTH. If you are married you can put up to 5K per year each. For any money left over, I would open a regular (not tax advantaged) mutual fund. You can contribute half the money you were paying toward your student loans, and the other half can go to your mortgage. Also I would look at doing a refi on your house. You might be able to move a 10 or 15 year at your current mortgage payment.
