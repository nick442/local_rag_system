That was my exact feeling reading this. It was a stroke of luck that Bob got bought out and an even bigger stroke of luck that he got into a position that he could help out the supplier. If none of that had happened, he would have just cost the supplier money and woken somebody up at 2am for something that could have been dealt with the next morning.
