> If everyone on average gets say..a ~3% boost on their score, why wouldn't banks just adjust their standards by 3%? Because the score change only affects those who have had delinquent payments (but are current now) on medical debt in the past 7 years. That's not everybody.. by a long shot. Also, no lender (except possibly automated consumer debt applications) gives a shit about what your actual score is. Mortgage lenders review each application based on things like debt:income, existing installment payments, and actual credit history (meaning account details and repayment history).
