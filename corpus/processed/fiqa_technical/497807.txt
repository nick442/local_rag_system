"Yeah, you could literally just set up a fixed amount of states, set up a simple AR model based on normal components, find the optimal parameters for the state spaces and the AR model and you're done. Or you could set up a VAR model with student's t components instead which makes it more complicated by a couple of magnitudes. With student's t components the regression is structurally complicated so I've found I need to apply copluas (or is it copulae? or copuli? I have no damn idea lmao) instead to be able to sample properly. I might not be very bright but I wouldn't say that's basic math. Also the regression for state spaces is a bit more complicated as well. It'd be like me saying that valuating exotic derivatives is ""literally just solving PDE's with simple numerical methods."" It's a *little* bit more work to it."
