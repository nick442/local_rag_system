"Thanks for the great response. The example with calculus is perfect! Group A is some students who will never ever get it, no matter how much you teach and train them. As you know, group B is some students who excel in calculus just by reading the book with no need for a professor to explain or teach them. They probably exceed in understanding beyond the course objectives. Group C, most, will be in the middle: struggle and with efforts of the professor (if the class is not more than 10-15 students) and their own efforts, they will eventually understand.. some will get C, some will get B and few will get A. Which group will succeed with their career if it requires calculus? > The messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach. True. I was an adjunct professor while studying for my master's. In the end of the semester, students had to evaluate their professors. I got the 2nd best results, after another part-time adjunct professor, and way above all tenured professors. Are you surprised? By the way, I was teaching introductory classes and I was working for the department I was teaching for as a research intern. As for professors who don't know how to teach, this was not an issue in the past and was not needed in the past (i.e. it's because of past traditions). In the past, the role of the professor was not so much to teach, in the sense and the way teachers teach today in elementary school: attend and dance around every student's special needs and go in a slow pace to accommodate make sure nobody is left behind. The role of the professor in the past, being a real expert and full of knowledge far and beyond what is required, was to plan and sequence what has to be taught, in a pace that will meet the full agenda of the class. No concern is given for students who can't keep the pace. Also, the role was to challenge the students, test then and answer any question they may have. This includes debates over any topic related to the class material. > I think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job Absolutely true!! Or let's put it this way: **the best school was, is and will be ""a Master and an Apprentice"".** Which is somewhat still done in Germany, and is the only way Medical Students learn.. because, no choice: the life of others is in their hands. By the way, **Masters have zero patience** for apprentices who don't show a promise. Masters also have little talent in teaching but **Masters have long term 1000% patience** to show, again and again, correct again and again, demand, explain and challenge their apprentices. .. to the point the Masters actually don't do much work, and, instead, just teach, in their own special way."
