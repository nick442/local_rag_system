"Thanks. Glad you enjoyed the writings. :) Relating again back to your points about timeline, it's important to understand that capitalism is what mathematicians or engineers might call an ""optimization engine"". Given an initial situation and a set of constraints about what is allowed, it seeks an optimal solution within that constraint space. But it's just a tool, it's not artificially intelligent, and it will only do as well as people's willingness to bound its search by an appropriate set of constraints. The timeline is part of that. If we tell the engine ""only care about short term gains"", that's how it will function."
