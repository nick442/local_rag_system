Tax obligation for your parents: NIL The transfer would come under the Gift Tax act. There is no limit on the amount for near relatives. So you can send unlimited amount to your parents and this would not be taxable. However if you parents invest this in FD, Interest on savings, etc .. this income would be taxable. Nope there is no tax exemption for you on this amount.
