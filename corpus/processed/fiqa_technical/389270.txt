Businesses have been using immigrants (illegal and legal) to screw labor in this country. Flooding the market with foreign labor [drives up supply and drives down wages.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/) Maybe if we let the wages rise over the years, Americans would be willing to pay more because they would be making more. I think so many people are hostile towards labor and defend corporations so much is that corporations can afford PR and labor cannot.
