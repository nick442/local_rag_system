I'd buy it out, and change the paying system for the employees back to an incentive service even though not having that is what made them so successful in he 90s, That business model doesn't work anymore. They need to connect with the hardcore electronic people too. They lost their core market when they lost their knowledge in electronics. You know that 5%-10% of the market influences the rest of it. Frys electronics does it right. They need to have a vast quality of media on hand too. It needs to not be all the blockbusters (irony) but just things I can't download from thepiratebay that I want to watch now. Thats the only reason I go to best buy now. Sell them at competitive prices too. Im starting to think $20 blu-rays is where it should be.
