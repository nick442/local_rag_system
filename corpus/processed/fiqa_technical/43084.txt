The rate of spending growth is relevant. The reason tax cuts are expected to pay for themselves is that they are expected to increase economic growth such that the absolute dollar amount of revenue is the same, though it makes up a smaller relative proportion of the total economic value created over a period. This would be sufficient to pay for itself if spending growth were flat, but if it's growing, particularly if it's growing sharply, just maintaining the same absolute revenue level won't be enough to pay the government's bills. Basically, whether or not tax cuts pay for themselves depends on where we are on the Laffer Curve AND on the level of spending growth, hence my previous comment.
