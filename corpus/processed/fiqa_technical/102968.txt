Okay first of all and economic system needs division of labor to have much more efficiency and productivity. Which means people will do repetitive task and be very good at them, decrease their cost of starting a new task(there is a preparation time and cost), which also suggest people won't be inclined to do the same stuff since it becomes pointless and could have existential crisis. It is much fun and fulfilling to do everything you need to done yourself, like keeping care of your house, making food(even hunting), taking care of health if family, building your own house but is also much much less productive and also worse. Making this part clear, which is a long paragraph for a obvious fact, people also need motivation for this repetitiveness which is money and statue. These are the goals of everyone doing the same unnecessary stuff( lets face it other than shelter, food,education and health , things being done these days are no so quite a necessity). So unless humans became more capable of understanding these are just made up dreams that we had made which makes the system go on (otherwise it will collapse) and understand the real inner reason for these dreams (self-fulfillment , attention, whatsoever) this economic system will continue. I understand my response was nothin economically related and was sort of edgy this is my sincere thoughts on the topic. I also think this economic model won't change unless 2 reasons; -Political systems changes which i find likely in 50 years time and people will just give up in democracy since it is being used much worse than monarchy -A war that has never been written in history before which would change the economic system entirely since most of the economic system in interrelated with different countries(globalization) and most economic activities are not production(solid material) but services (entertainment and other) which has no use in war economy.
