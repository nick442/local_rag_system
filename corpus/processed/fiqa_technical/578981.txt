As someone who provides PR services to startups, I may be biased but I can shed a little light. Those who do not hire PR firms, mostly need to get lucky, have connections or hire a marketing intern. If you do not have connections, it makes sense to hire a PR firm with a database and contacts with journalists. Or the PR firm can do manual outreach for you instead of an intern.
