Ah, but it might be the regulators responsibility. Predatory pricing can be a monopolistic tactic, meaning that large corporations that can afford to lose money on some projects may be wise to do so to keep their smaller competitors out of the industry, and then being the only one (or several) left, can make those losses back on jacked up prices since there is little/no competition in their market. Bidding at a loss is often [illegal or regulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing#Legal_aspects).
