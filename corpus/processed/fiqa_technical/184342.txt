"It's an interesting point that leaves me conflicted. In some sense being poor also means you are not going to get the same education, or the same value from education made available to you. On the other hand, education seems to be universally empowering, and therefore we try to make it universally available. If the same is true of various enhancements, should we not make them also universally available? For me the ""if"" is still too big."
