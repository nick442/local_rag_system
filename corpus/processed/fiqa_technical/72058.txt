I've shopped ToyRUs for years now. It was the go to store for my kids when they wanted a new toy, or just to kill time and let them see whats out before christmas shopping. I used to spend around 60-80% of my money there, then as the kids got older I shifted to around 20% with Amazon helping out so much. But this year they shut down several of the stores near me, including the one that I spent all my money at. Kmart did the same thing, and now the 2 brick and mortar stores I still spent money at are gone. I guess it's Amazon for 90% of my shopping now and target or (shudder) walmart for the rest.
