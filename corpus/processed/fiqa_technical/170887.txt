>[**Michael Pento – Gold Setting Up for Huge Spike Higher [28:48]**](http://youtu.be/U3qHMPgYy4c) >>Financial analyst and money manager Michael Pento says, “I think it is setting up for a huge spike higher. I don’t think the time for that to start is exactly now, but the gold market is catching a bid here. The big boom in gold and gold mining shares will be when we have a watershed moment, when the market realizes in mass the central banks have lost control of the economy and the money supply. That is coming very, very soon, no later than the middle of 2018, and it could probably happen this fall, and that is when the market understands that central banks don’t really control interest rates. They cannot control the long end of the yield curve, and they will destroy economic growth and stock markets across the world. That is the big moment when you want to pile into gold. If you don’t have any gold, you should have at least 10% always. That’s your base level. . . . Hard assets will go through the roof.” > [*^Greg ^Hunter*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-G8LLr38fQUNZU8K0t-EA) ^in ^News ^& ^Politics >*^47,716 ^views ^since ^Jul ^2017* [^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index)
