There's a symbiotic relationship between what people want and what products businesses advertise and sell. The very nature of fast food is high in refined carbohydrates and fats which our bodies naturally crave. That isn't to say that slow food doesn't do the same damn thing, but there's a greater degree of hitting the pleasure centers with cheap shots. I absolutely agree that we lack a healthy eating culture, but we used to have one. It disappeared, partly due to the transition to cities and pressures of food safety and freshness that resulted, but also due to active campaigning by businesses taking advantage of our predilection for energy sources which would be scarce without industrial agriculture.
