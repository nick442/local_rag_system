I think Starbucks makes it difficult for Burger Places. Years ago it was unheard of to spend 4 or 5 bucks on a drink. Now Starbucks is taking fast food places out of the market unless they have something light, or that at least taste light. So a person can feel comfortable eating at a Burger joint and still purchase Starbucks drink later in the day or vice versa. Also, all the other fast food restaurants have been molasses like slow to breakfast. Fast food chains in the future need to carve the brand out of breakfast and prominent light tasting options. And they should be able to take some of Subways and Starbucks market share.
