The simple solution here would be to either sell or give the car to your family member. The answer depends on whether they can afford to buy or you can afford to give. Transferring ownership gets rid of any of the liability considerations you outline, and also gets it out of your driveway! It also saves you from having to deal with any relationship issues that could arise if they borrow and something goes wrong (they damage, fail to return, etc). Your gut is telling you that there could be issues with lending a car to you family member, and i would trust your gut & transfer ownership one way or another.
