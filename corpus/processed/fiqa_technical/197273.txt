As you can see by his username this guy works in IT. I will explain for those who aren’t in the industry. In IT demand for employees has never been higher. It is crazy right now. This means it is hard to get talent, particularly good talent which can be many times more productive than bad ones. Now Amazon is a tech company fundamentally. What many may not realize is Amazon is also the world’s largest hosting platform too. For example, Reddit and Netflix are on their systems. So they aren’t just a store, they do a lot of everyone else's tech too. This means they need a shit-tonne of good tech and related people. So the location will likely hinge on where the can find good staff. However, as OP just said Amazon has a terrible reputation in the industry. So this makes this even more difficult as everyone hates them and no one will move for them, and they need a lot of good people which are in high demand elsewhere. This is what their decision will rest on. Tax breaks and all are perks, but they need to find 50,000 experienced employees to fill this thing, everything else is secondary.
