Best Buy spent the better part of a 15 years fleecing customers on price and inexperienced staff overselling what people don't need. That leaves a lasting memory and word of mouth. You can't just undo nearly 2 decades of poor service with a different campaign. Those memories and experiences are powerful factors in deciding where to shop.
