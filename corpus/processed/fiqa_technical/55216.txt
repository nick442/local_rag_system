I hate it when this is done. I like it when design and specs are made like an athlete trains. To make things as great as you can make it and then show it off so that people can see how far you pushed the envelop. To then deliberately retard the thing, hold it back, to stupefy it. The athletes should run as fast as they can and not have their fucking shoelaces tied.
