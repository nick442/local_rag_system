"To be fair, this isn't just marijuana. Heroin and meth are big problems some places. For example, oil workers in remote areas have a tendency to have meth issues. That's a big problem. The other issue is that with drugs like marijuana, it can be difficult to tell if someone is high. Yes, marijuana is basically on the same level as alcohol, but it's easier to tell when someone is drunk vs when they are high (if they're covering up odor). In factory or field jobs, being able to tell someone is drunk or high is important. If you can tell someone is drunk, you send them home. If you can't tell that Mike went and got stoned because he doesn't smell like it, doesn't have red eyes, etc., he can still kill someone because his performance is affected. It's not as simple as ""marijuana is on the same level as alcohol"" because yeah that's true, but there are differences and those differences can lead to expensive and problematic workplace injuries. Those ""antiquated CEOs"" are probably right on this one. It's not as simple as you make it out."
