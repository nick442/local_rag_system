"This is easy but you won't like it. The reason you give away to large corporations is that you are communists and simply take so much tax that nobody in their right mind wants anything to do with you. This means you have to buy companies to make your economy work. If you cannot understand the difference between the word ""buy"" and ""give away"" then you have been suckered by this local government. The government has simply failed to perform efficiently and is trying to make up for it. We see the advertisements across the country, come here and be tax free for 10 years, as if it is a retail purchase item. Just put a spinner on your hat that says something stupid because it garners the same type of attention. TLDR; NY is a nerd trying to buy friends."
