I don't think the DRM has anything to do with it. Amazon is cheap and convenient. Finding specific e-book torrents can be a hassle, and causes people a small amount of guilt for not supporting the authors. Not only does Amazon have an incredibly convenient store that's integrated with its hardware, but paying for content is guilt-free. DRM itself doesn't do shit to prevent piracy. I don't read many books, so I neither buy nor torrent, but this is pretty much how Steam caused me to stop pirating games.
