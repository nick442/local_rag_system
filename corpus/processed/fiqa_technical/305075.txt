So working at a cafe doesn’t mean you will learn everything you need to know to run a cafe. Are you being exposed to how the finances/taxes/food regulations are handled? How about ordering/managing supplys? How about employee management? They aren’t gonna teach you all of that in business school probabably either but they will teach you stuff you didn’t know you needed to know. I say skip school but realize it comes at a cost too.
