"There are two reasons leases are generally a worse deal than buying. First, inherent in the lease is the concept of trading in the car at the end of the lease term. As we all know, cars depreciate the most in the first year or two. By repeatedly leasing cars on short time frames, you own the vehicles during those most expensive years. Of course there's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing when buying (be it via cash or loan), but leasing builds in a schedule and encourages you to stick to it. Second, it is easier for the dealer salesperson to hide things from the consumer in a lease contract. Most salespeople will try to get a car purchaser to focus on the monthly payment, or they'll four-box the purchaser, but even then there's only 4 numbers, and most consumers have a rough idea what they are and what they mean. But in a lease the numbers in question are renamed and obscured. ""Price"" becomes ""capitalized cost"". ""Interest rate"" becomes ""money factor"" and is divided by 2400, making it look really small and not easily translatable without a calculator or pencil and paper. ""Down payment"" becomes a capitalized cost reduction. There's a new concept ""residual value."" Neither of those reasons change when interest rate is lower."
