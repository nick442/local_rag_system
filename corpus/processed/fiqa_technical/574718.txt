In essence, networking, hard, and continuously working to improve my resume. I am not certain about a certificate course, but if you can't say without hesitation that your modeling skills are strong, you should focus on improving there. In terms of networking, build a list of firms you'd like to work for, build a list of the relevant personnel in each (example, if you want to do equity research, build a list of analysts in every sell side firm in your city), and then begin reaching out to them via phone or email to ask them for 15 minute coffee meetings. Once you build up a few folks in firms that you know, touch base with them quarterly. CFA may be something to consider if your focus is research. It's a lot cheaper than an MBA.
