i accidently deleted my comment, but like I said, random forests are hardly black box. Please see here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/21152/obtaining-knowledge-from-a-random-forest Random forests are not black box, and like I said in the comment I deleted, the variables have weights and metrics that can be traced back. This example in the link uses the other method of random forests which is decision tree, opposed to the Lin Reg.
