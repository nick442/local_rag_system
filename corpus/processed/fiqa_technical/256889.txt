That's exactly how I feel too. I don't think there is an easy or painless way out of this mess. But I do think the government needs to step aside and let everything correct. Promote competition by removing regulatory hurdles for new businesses, and reduce taxes dramatically. I imagine a huge part of this can be financed just by stopping our military operations, and not touching social services and healthcare. Torpedo the hell out of wall street by letting the banks fail, and abolishing or nationalizing the Federal Reserve. The economy will fall into depression for a while, but it will recover on its own in 1 to 2 years, much like the [depression of 1920](http://mises.org/daily/3788). Absolutely do not try to prop prices up like they did in the Great Depression (for example, [by slaughtering pigs when people were hungry](http://www.lib.niu.edu/1993/ihy930578.html)). The alternative to this is what we're doing now, which I think will, at best, end up similar to Japan's Lost Decade, or at worst, a hyperinflation of the US dollar.
