Maybe, maybe not. By and large my union rep and my governor (nevermind the secretary of state) are also likely to engage in high stakes--possibly higher-stakes--negotiation. So I'll ask again: what distinguishes public employees and union reps so that they should fly coach, but c-corp execs should get fancier tickets?
