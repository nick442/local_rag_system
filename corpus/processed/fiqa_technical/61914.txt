The FRB mandate is to shoot for maximum employment and stable dollar. Nowhere does it list that they should be concerned with stock prices. Moving too quickly in the past could have triggered an exogenous shock in an already fragile housing market, developing country, or significantly slowed hiring. Instead they have the current problem which Dalio admitted on BB interview today that is manageable but tricky. His primary concern is that there will be a debt crisis. But the FRB is not in the business of trying to prevent future problems (which is partially how we got here). Edit: I am also of the mindset that any finance person will talk their book, so I take their words with a grain of salt.
