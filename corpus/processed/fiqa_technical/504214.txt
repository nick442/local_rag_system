There are two industrial sectors with a recent history of raising revenue and profit faster than inflation: education and health care. While there is indeed some political risk, my assumption is these sectors would continue to beat inflation even under a theoretical socialist President Bernie Sanders. There are several such sector funds available from popular low ER mutual fund companies; I don't believe this forum likes specific commercial investment touting so I decline to name specific ones.
