This is complete bs. Other countries already have the kiosks and have had them for awhile now. In case you didn't know, mcdonald's has been failing for quite some time. The adding to of the 24hr breakfast helped them out a bit, but they are still struggling with sales. There best bet to please the shareholders is to get rid of a percentage of the work force, and replace them with a kiosk. It's all about turning a profit, and the minimum wage going up has nothing to do with their declining sales.
