"> I bootstrapped a business with my husband, from part-time while consulting to over $600k/yr in its 3rd year. I don't know nothin' bout no business! *yawn* I could go into a long rant about people who brag about their accomplishments on the internets and describe themselves as a ""bootstrapper"" but I won't. The whole blog reads like an Amway pitch with no indication as to what you actually do: ""Do you want to break out of working by the hour? Do you want to create your own products and really be your own boss?"" Seriously? This is a troll, right?"
