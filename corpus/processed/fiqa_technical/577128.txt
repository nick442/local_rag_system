This podcast really opened my eye to Netflix's toxic culture. Netflix can still continue to get away with this short term thinking culture because it's still growing. Once growth stopped, I don't think current culture is sustainable. They'll have to reinvent themselves again or die. It made me question the value of unlimited vacation and one year maternity Netflix so proudly advertised. I suspect any Netflix employee who plan to take those benefits will find themselves unemployed very quickly.
