"China has undergone an ""economic miracle"" over the past two decades. Brand-spanking new cities have sprung up all over China during that time, and Hong Kong is no longer the shiny pearl it used to be in comparison with the rest of China. It doesn't capture as much mind-share of the Chinese people as it used to now that there are alternatives. Sort of like if the Apple iPhone were ever to fall behind Android phones in fashion and technology."
