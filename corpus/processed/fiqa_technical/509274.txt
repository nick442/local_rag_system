Bankers, home builders, and real estate people made a lot of money selling more houses than they should have. To sell that many houses, they had to lie and let people without good jobs buy houses that cost too much. Then the jobs went away and the people lost their way of paying for their house. Now there are still all those houses and still no jobs. It is called a bubble because it was planned. It was no accident. Even the part about jobs going away. The rich people knew what was happening, the jobs began to go away in the early 1970's. The plan, in part, was to make as much money as they could before too many people lost their jobs. No jobs means no customers and no more easy money.
