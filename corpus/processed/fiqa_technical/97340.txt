I am just an undergrad, but I will try to answer as best I can. As mentioned in the other thread you posted, you should study for, and take, the CFA level one exam in December. This will give you some perspective as opposed to simply reading some articles online which talk about the day to day duties and earning potential, which I assume is where your real interest comes from. It's easy to be interested when you love a subject. It's not hard to be interested when your big paycheck on Friday depends on it. It's very hard to be interested when your first paycheck is two years away. Yes, an MBA is marketable. Yes they have higher earning potential than a school counselor, **in a vacuum**. It really depends on you. The degree does not make the career and I know a few MBAs with sad careers. I would do the CFA first and learn as much as you can about the industry, including meeting with people in various roles and asking as many questions as you can, before committing to anything, especially a costly MBA. You are 26, you have time. Not a lot of time, since I believe there is a definite preference for young, malleable, recruits, but some time. Consider it one big research project.
