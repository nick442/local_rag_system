">What's the point of commenting on a down voted thread anyway? There is no agreed upon cut-off for Gen X. You could make an argument that anyone over 40 and under 60 is Gen X. You are really and truly ENTIRELY clueless and confused. Let me say it again: **Boomers -- born 1946~1964** (and that is pretty definitive, especially the ""kickoff"" date of 1946; the ending date is a bit more subjective, but in invariably centered around 1963-64). Ergo at present **Boomers are individuals (presently) aged 66 down to ~48 (give or take a year or two).** **By contrast, Gen X is unarguably and definitively mid-1960's through early 1980's.** Ergo Gen X is currently aged around ~30 to ~48 years old. --- >You could make an argument that anyone over 40 and under 60 is Gen X. No one. And I mean NO ONE who has a single clue would EVER consider anyone over age 50 at present to be ""Gen X"". No one. *The only ones who would make such a statement would be someone who (idiotically) had entirely CONFUSED GenX with the Boomers.* Go get a clue already."
