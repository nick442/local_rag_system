Yeah. The student run investment fund at my school valued Tesla and they're significantly overvalued. Their capital structure is way too much debt and given the capital intensity requirements of the industry, they're gonna be cash flow negative for a while. They made 45% in three months bc of the capital gains but knew that shit wasnt stable lmao
