I used to work at a record keeping company, and while we worked with plan administrators through transitions in investment offerings, we never actually worked through a forced sale. From what I recall I thought that was illegal, and that all the administrator can do is stop offering the investment (i.e. no new buy ins), but people who still have their money in it can either continue to hold or sell.
