Yea that's all fine and dandy if you have the resources to afford not having a reliable income while you take the risk of being entrepreneurial. One of my good friends just sold his company to yelp for $9mil. Good for him, I wish him the best. But it's easy to justify taking the risk of starting your own company if your parents are worth $200mil and bought you a $3mil house. In that situation, you aren't actually taking a risk.
