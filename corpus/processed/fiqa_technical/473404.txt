"It has to do with humidity (or dew point) and is partly meant to be a scale to judge how hot it ""feels"". When you have high humidity, the sweat from your body will not evaporate as efficiently. The evaporation is necessary to remove heat from your body, so without it you feel hotter. With 100% relative humidity, the air is fully saturated and NONE of your sweat will evaporate."
