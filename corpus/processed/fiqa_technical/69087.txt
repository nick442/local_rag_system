"Yeah.. I think what's missing here is that Amazon is an ABSOLUTE last resort place to work. After my experiences with them, I would just leave the industry and go hang drywall before I'd work there. There's a lot getting lost in this ""50,000 jobs"" thing- these aren't shovel ready jobs, these are jobs that Amazon would likely just NOT FILL if they couldn't find exactly the right people. The AVERAGE tenure for an Amazon engineer is ONE YEAR. People hate working there, and nobody plans on staying long. They are the most dangerous and toxic workplace in the country right now, and whatever formula they have for extracting value from human misery had better stay locked up in the vault with the KFC recipe, or everyone in this business is screwed. This is where you go work for a year after school, get burnt, and use the skills to go find a better place to work. Think FoxConn, not ""cool startup with perks"". There ARE some cities who could benefit from this, but I think they're the least likely to get this. So far California offers the best mix of talent and tax incentives so far, IMO. Whoever gets this will probably not benefit, in any way. That's how Bezos operates. This will flood your city with 50,000 dumb ass 22 year olds who don't care about spending 60% of the income on rent(because this is the first time they've paid it!), don't have time for life outside of work, and who plan on quitting when the lease is up. If you're an Uber driver of a Condo tower builder, you'll benefit."
