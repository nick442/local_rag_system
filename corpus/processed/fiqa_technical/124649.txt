I don’t think you know what is right or wrong. This is the third time you’ve called me out, and the third time you were mistaken. The starving man is starvinf because he lacks food. Give him a million dollars in the middle of Antarctica, and he will still starve. These false equivalences you have presented above are where so many of our problems come from. People forget the value of reality over currency. The Mother’s affection does have monetary value. It just isn’t so easily quantifiable. See: Psychiatrists and Psychologists. They make money off these issues. The financial value can be seen in the correction of the consequences from lack of affection. To PAY for affection, trust, loyalty, so many of the “social” properties we rely on, though, negates some or all of their value. You assume so many rules that just aren’t supported by reality. Your economic theories seem to fail when faced with the nuances of reality, especially those economics has ignored. That’s my opinion, anyway.
