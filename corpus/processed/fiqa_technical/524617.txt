Because it's a con. People give you money because you promise them more money, and then you walk away with their money. There are more steps but they don't matter. You can probably ignore the MLM drone who doesn't realize he's a cover for abusing those hyped kids. These companies are minimally different from outright fraud. If a business repeatedly assurse you it's legal, that's a warning. You can definitely ignore the edgelords whining about government.
