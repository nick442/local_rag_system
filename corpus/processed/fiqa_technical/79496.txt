"Pyramid Schemes are illegal. This is not a pyramid scheme but I wouldn't dive into it unless you either had some killer marketing skills OR you are an extremely social and likable person; like high-school popularity contest winner level, but older. The affiliate earning system is way more complicated than what you mentioned (in a good way) because there are many ways to earn, but the biggest way to earn requires someone who ""knows how to throw a party"" or someone who absolutely loves people. (I don't). I personally am documenting my experience with PMB CBD oil and am posting my no B.S. review about everything from the product to the affiliate system on my personal FB. I'm not a people-person so i don't see me standing on a podium with a little mic around my cheek, but oddly my candid (and often funny) reviews inspired many of my Facebook friends to buy CBD. I get $30 for every bottle i sell through my affiliate page; this is a better way for me to earn than standing up in front of people like Martha Stewart. It helps if you actually like and use the product because that way you don't feel pressured to sell. I'm experimenting with CBD because I simply can't relax and suffer from some major anxiety and stress attacks. Results? Well it's 6am and i'm writing to you not freaking out about work tomorrow and browsing for Rick and Morty memes. I like it so far but we'll see."
