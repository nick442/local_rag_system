I can see other property owners being against it, because it would drive down the prices of their homes. As it stands I think home pricing is a complete fucked up retarded system that mostly depends on your neighbors house values. The whole things is a shambles. EDIT: also any new owner of the property is responsible for back taxes I think. That's also extremely fucked up.
