Similarly, as a server or bartender, I would hook people like you up in hopes of a tip like that. I wasn't losing out if you got a double pour of vodka in your drink or only rang up four shots when you ordered 6. I enjoyed those customers and the tips too. If it wasn't a chain I might have felt bad about doing that. But then again, it's basically the same as a customer loyalty card.
