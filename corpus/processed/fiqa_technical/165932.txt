Hello! Have you thought about going to meetup.com and looking for some developer group you could network with? It sounds to me like you are the perfect candidate for a bit of mentoring. A few people to bounce ideas off of. I live in a very high tech town (Austin, TX) so this is super easy to find here. But you can also start your own group if one doesn't exist in your area. I hope also that someone answers here!
