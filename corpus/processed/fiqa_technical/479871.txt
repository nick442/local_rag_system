I only used disposable diapers for my baby's first month. However, I now use half disposable diapers (for part-time daycare) and half cloth. My son is now 1 year and during a normal weekday, I go through 4 disposable diapers and 3-4 cloth diapers (this count includes a double thick cloth diaper for night). On the weekend, I use about 7-8 cloth diapers a day. For disposable, I buy Costco's Kirkland brand diapers which gives me about 200 diapers for $50. I tend to go through one pack every other month. For cloth, I bought FuzziBunz One-Size Diapers. These are pretty expensive diapers (about $19/each) but I wanted ones that would last over multiple children (I chose these over the BumGenius because I thought snaps would last longer than velcro). I bought 24 new cloth diapers which means I wash diapers every 2-3 days. A couple of weeks ago I totaled up my receipts for cloth and disposable diapers and determined that I will recoup my diaper costs at around 16 months of part-time use. Notes:
