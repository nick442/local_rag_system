Oil itself is actually quite nice because you can store it in large quantities cheaply, but it costs a lot to move it and get it out of the ground. Another factor which you pointed out is how you can only get an engine 50% energy efficient, whereas electric motors are far more efficient. The main problem with renewables is that it is hard to store in large quantities, since our batteries aren't that efficient at storing a lot of energy for nighttime/calm days. Nuclear power and a really efficient battery would solve all of our problems, but people are deathly afraid of nuclear. The main point is that people have been predicting the end of oil for decades, just a matter of time until it's economically viable to stop using it.
