"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://qz.com/851066/almost-all-the-10-million-jobs-created-since-2005-are-temporary/) reduced by 61%. (I'm a bot) ***** > Survey research conducted by economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard University and Alan Krueger at Princeton University shows that from 2005 to 2015, the proportion of Americans workers engaged in what they refer to as &quot;Alternative work&quot; jumped from 10.7% to 15.8%. Alternative work is characterized by being temporary or unsteady-such as work as an independent contractor or through a temporary help agency. > &quot;And over 60% was due to the [the rise] of independent contractors, freelancers and contract company workers.&quot; In other words, nearly all of the 10 million jobs created between 2005 and 2015 were not traditional nine-to-five employment. > Katz and Krueger found that each of the common types of alternative work increased from 2005 to 2015-with the largest changes in the number of independent contractors and workers provided by contract firms, such as janitors that work full-time at a particular office, but are paid by a janitorial services firm. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/79k7gc/almost_all_the_10_million_jobs_created_since_2005/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~237356 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **work**^#1 **Alternative**^#2 **job**^#3 **Krueger**^#4 **full-time**^#5"
