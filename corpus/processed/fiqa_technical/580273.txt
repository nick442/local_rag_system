So true, I'm 30 and got rid of my FB 2 and a half years ago. My gf is almost 10 years my junior, most of her friends don't have FB it seems like the younger generation is ditching Facebook all together. Older people I know are all either just getting into Facebook now or have only had it a few years. Wild times
