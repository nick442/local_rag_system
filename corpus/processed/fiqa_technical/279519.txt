The entire world came together and agreed America should be fined for its over indulgences or success, pay for the bulk of the costs, give all the power and control over to a foreign leader most likely one from an impoverished country. Allow China and India to decimate their environment while reaping all the benefits of manufacturing without an environmental restrictions. Allow foreign companies such as American companies to get obscene tax benefits by relocating to China or India, replacing American workers with foreign locals. Of course the world wants this- as do liberals. Liberals saddled with guilt hating free enterprise and constantly being in search for a new cause to make them feel good about them selves. Moral superiority. Climate change fits the bill. Sound fair ?
