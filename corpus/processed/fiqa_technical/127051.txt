"I find it hard to believe that cities like NYC or DC lack the regulation needed to ""stop"" service refusals. I've been turned down multiple times in DC based on location (DC to Arlington usually but not exclusively). The locals actually had a habit of not disclosing where they were going until they got inside the cab because the cabs so often refuse to serve certain areas. That's not a problem with Lyft. The driver sees the destination requested right there and can choose to pickup. Even if they actually wanted to refuse service for a customer, the customer has the ability to rate them which can lower their rating below the 4.5-4.75/ out of 5 rating needed to continue driving and will be completely refunded and taken care of by Lyft if a complaint is sent."
