I have a Whole Foods, Walmart, 3x Kroger, 2x Publix, Traders Joes, Spruce's, and a Fresh Market within 10 minutes of driving. I've actually started focusing on Walmart more and more because they simply have better prices on the stuff I buy most. I might wander into Whole Wallet for some of their loss leaders but I don't think I'll move the bulk of my grocery purchases away from Walmart / Kroger.
