Think about how many bills a person had to pay from a single paycheck back then. Think about it now. You've got ten times as many things to pay for, with half the money. Real incomes have been DECLINING since the 70s. First we worked more hours, then we sent women to work, then we ran up credit card and mortgage debt, then we had no options left and everything's fucked. All because the top 1% have been keeping all productivity gains for 40 years, instead of leaving them with the people who EARNED and CREATED those gains, the employees.
