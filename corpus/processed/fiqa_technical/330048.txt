Could you please tell me how the election result undermines my point, that I live a very good life, thanks to social redistribution, which you initially questioned? Further, Vienna voted completely contrary to the country as a whole. Being one of the cities with the most publicly financed projects for social redistribution (very big point: social housing in order to reduce rental costs). Seems they are not as unhappy as the people living on the countryside, who fear the dangerous migrants (fun fact, most foreigners in Austria live in Vienna, those who voted least for the anti-migrant parties..) Another fun fact - Vienna has been voted [8 years in a row for the city with the highest quality of life](https://www.forbes.com/sites/civicnation/2017/10/12/a-catamount-post-mortem-what-does-it-actually-take-to-engage-students/#14ba4c061f3b). A city with a social democrat/environmentalist government for years. Doesn't seem to be that bad huh?
