"Oh shit. I just realized I was in /r/economy not /r/economics. I thought I was going insane when I read through these comments. I don't understand how any reasonable person with even the slightest ability to critically think could read that article, and the study they quote, and come to the conclusion that ""college is for suckers."" It's just illusory correlation bullshit. Its the Reddit equivalent of those dumb people you know who post articles on Facebook like ""study finds lazy people are smarter,""to justify how sad their lives are."
