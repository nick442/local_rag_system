I'd say take the bet. you'd expect that half the quarters are heads (1-1 odds), so an 10 more quarters showing heads is a 20% increase. you've given me a larger odds increase than the increase in quarters that are head. Sorry if the answers wholly intuitive, not really sure how to calculate the fair value off the fly.
