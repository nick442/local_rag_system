It still has its moments. A couple of years ago I went to Lowe's to get pricing on two new vanities. They sent out someone to measure and that person called first so I had their phone number. I reverse searched it, found the name of the subcontractor, looked them up on the BBB and saw that they had an F. I brought this up to Lowe's. The person I spoke with there was not aware of which century we were living in, had no idea how easy it was to reverse search. Lots of 'we take this situation very seriously' bs. It was an enlightening bit of info for me, learning how dependable Lowe's contractors are. However, for the most part, I agree that the BBB is useless.
