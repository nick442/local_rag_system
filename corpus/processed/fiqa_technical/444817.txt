When our 20yo Sony Trinitron died I researched all the Audio/Video forums and the consensus was that Panasonic Plasmas have the best picture. When I went into the department store to buy one they had a Panasonic and a Samsung LCD on display right next to each other and the difference in quality was noticeable (Samsung was noticeably better). At the time I had never really considered Samsung to be any good, but the quality and sharpness of the Samsung is undeniable. It actually took me two days to get over my cognitive dissonance and buy the Samsung because up until then I was 100% determined to buy the Panasonic. They are also the only brand that I have seen with little to no artifacts. Samsung is this generations Sony.
