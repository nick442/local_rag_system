I’ve spent roughly $70,000 at Amazon the past 3 years (calculated using their spreadsheet data of spending in the account section). What these businesses don’t understand is that the products are all the same and the pricing varies minimally; customer service is and always will be my number one determining factor in where I do business. It takes me 30 seconds to get an Amazon agent on the line and 20 minutes for a Best Buy agent, plus Amz’s return policies beat the shit out of B.B’s.
