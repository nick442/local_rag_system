one thing that would push me to agree to the delivery service is if they bring the bags right into my kitchen. I don't want to do a hand off at the door of load after load of bags also, at the store, I put like items on the belt so all the cold stuff is grouped, meat group, dairy group etc and my fruits and veggies grouped. point is, I want it BAGGED that way so getting home I can prioritize cold over dry. wonder if Bezos thought of that one ! :-)
