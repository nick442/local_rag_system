"So nobody is blaming them. I'm not sure why it is clear that it's someone's ""fault"" versus being just a shift in consumer behaviour. If there's a failing business should they fire the workers more quickly? I'm trying to understand your position here, and I don't know enough to ""blame"" anyone. Really, what do you think is the primary issue? Clearly you feel something was the executive's fault, what is it you feel is their fault?"
