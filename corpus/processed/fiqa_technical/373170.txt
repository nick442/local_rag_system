You dont need to know low-level programming languages. There are armies of people hired/contracted to deal with that stuff. Your job is to use what they build to make smart decisions and look at the data correctly. So focus more on front-end tools that are used widely (e.g. Tableau) and if you insist on learning a language, it's probably better for it to be something like SQL so you can write your own database queries. Knowing Python might help you write some scripts to automate certain tasks, but I seriously doubt it'll be a career-defining feature of your skillset in corporate finance. It'd be useful if you want to one day pivot to some kind of data science work though.
