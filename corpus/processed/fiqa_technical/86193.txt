That people actually believe the nonsense in the title is sooooo insane. I have worked so many low paying jobs. From experience, I know that it is quite possible to earn minimum wage, take no government assistance beyond tax credits and live a simple life (even while supporting a family) and be quite happy. Sure, we weren't always able to own a cell phone, or have the fastest internet, but our bellies were never empty and we were always warm in the winter and somewhat cool in the summer. I can't help but think that the majority of people that think you have to take government assistance when you're poor in the U.S. have either A) Never been poor in the U.S. or B) Have never learned how to live a frugal lifestyle.
