Unfortunately I live in a second tier city with Comcast as the sole option. When I used to live in D.C. and Chicago there were multiple choices (AT&T U-Verse, VZW Fios). Even still, I dropped Comcast for DirecTV + DSL. There is a slight difference in speed at the top end, but I have not had any issues with streaming TV or Movies or Xbox online.
