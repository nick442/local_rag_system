"I'm no expert on this topic but I'll share my reasoning. One of the main themes of capitalism is ""Profit over everything"". Since the industrial revolution and the invention of the lightbulb, two things have been happening. 1) income inequality grows farther and farther apart 2) workers work more and more hours for the same or less pay. So fast forward to today's times and 8 people own 50% of the worlds wealth because capitalism and free market tactics allow those people to acculmate and insane amount of wealth. 2008 Citezens united basically made bribes legal in America. So because of capitalism, Corporations are able to heavily influence the government. So I think capitalism is a bigger problem than government."
