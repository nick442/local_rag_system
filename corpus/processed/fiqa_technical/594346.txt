Fair statement but two points: 1) slow change in politics is one of the primary intentions of the design of our system from the beginning. 2) these reference points are all over the map. Pairing economic trends with wars makes things seem more drastic than they are. We all knew from the beginning volker and other regulations weren't going to change shit. The reality is that the market is back to all time highs. We're up something like ~12% already this year alone. Beyond that I don't agree with using the market as a proxy specifically for the reason that, while the market is crushing it, us average joes don't feel that. The more important metric would be incomes and net worth of the middle class. Which, according to Buffet is at all time historical highs, though I'm not sure I agree with that either.
