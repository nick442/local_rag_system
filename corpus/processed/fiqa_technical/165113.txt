"> how the market going up and down in dramatic fashions due to speculative behavior by traders (of any kind) should have the power to decide the worth of thousands of companies going about their normal business. Wow. I don't even know where to start. First: why shouldn't traders be able to decide (as a group) what the companies are worth? If not them, who? Some committee you and your friends in the government get to appoint? Second: do you really think that intraday (or even intraweek) prices are really representative of what ""the market"" thinks a company is valued at? Third: compared to the effect of long term buy and holders changing their mind about a company, the effect of any HFT people on the valuation of a stock is practically nothing - like I said, there's just about no evidence of speculators causing significant mispricing over any significant period. Fourth: there's no credible evidence that outside of individual events like the Knight Capital farce HFT has actually increased volatility."
