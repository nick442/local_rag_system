"Stop trying to start a civil war on a shitty ""sob story"". Blaming your employer is the most piss poor excuse you can make for being a mediocre peasant. No one ever said you had to work for all the shitty employers that you claim to have had. You have the ability to find other work, you're laziness just disallowed it. If you hate your job, become its competition; don't sit on reddit and arouse yourself to other mediocre peasants jerking off to you're second class pitied rhetoric. You probably have never felt a woman either, bitch."
