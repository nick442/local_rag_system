>Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, told a forum in the northern city of Tianjin at the weekend that his ministry had started “relevant research” and was working on a timetable for China. >Xin said the policy would be implemented “in the near future”, according to the official Xinhua news agency. One guy in the bureaucracy announced to a group of irrelevant people that they're thinking of looking into it. This is another empty promise made to look good in the papers, not a real policy. Banning all gasoline cars in a country that size, with that weak and inconsistent of infrastructure? I'll believe it when I see it.
