Yes, but what qualifications are they asking for? [Here's one reasoning for why they keep bitching.](http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/at-work/tech-careers/why-bad-jobsor-no-jobshappen-to-good-workers) Essentially it sums up to the companies not wanting to pay market price for homegrown talent (essentially they set the price and expect people to sell at that price when there are plenty of buyers), the companies not wanting to spend the money training, and the companies want people who can start on the ground running instead of taking a little time to get a feel for the job. Most of the engineers I graduated with knew that they would need more on the job training because the degrees were so general. It's almost impossible to make the degrees fit perfectly to the parameters that the companies want, so the universities provide a good engineering foundation that businesses could build upon. If the businesses were willing to spend the time training people there wouldn't be a problem.
