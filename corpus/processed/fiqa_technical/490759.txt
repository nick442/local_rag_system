It's retarded to not promote students because of that reason. People in general think that adults work in maybe 3 jobs their whole life. That's not the case anymore. Company and employee loyalty is out the window. In a lot of jobs especially white collar work getting headhunted into a better situation and compensation is the best way to move up it seems.
