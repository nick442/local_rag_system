You should look at consulting firms or quant type roles. I'm not a consultant but I have friends at all of the major firms and I know they recruit PhDs though, admittedly, its usually right out of school or soon there after. There are also more niche consulting firms (I'm thinking econ consulting though that could be misguided, someone else will have to chime in) that would appreciate the intellectual rigor of your background. You could also do something in the Pharma space covering biotech and/or drug companies.
