If this was the 20th century that would be a workable idea. As you might have noticed this isn't the 20th century. We have whole industries which used to hire hundreds of thousands of people being replaced by firms with 15 people providing better services. We need a basic income because we have an economy which is more productive than ever, depends on a strong middle class, if lets to its own devices will produce one person who owns everything.
