I don't think you can make that comparison at all. The '02 prius isn't using the same battery type as a new hybrid or EV and the charge/discharge and usage cycles are different between EV's and hybrids. There hasn't been enough EV's on the market to get good data as of yet, but the Leaf has had issues with failing batteries in warm climates. Nissan also claims that the battery should lose about 20% of it's performance over 60k miles (a far cry from negligible).
