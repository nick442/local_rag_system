Both of these are important points. I think that what /u/chogall is saying, and what most people miss when it comes to AI / machine learning, is that it's often nothing more than a more advanced form of logistic regression (e.g., neural networks). So, to a degree, machine learning is nothing terribly new. It just requires much more processing power and has been largely limited by that. The part where it becomes a black box is that, with a regular logistic regression, you select your variables, interactions, polynomials, etc. You're defining the model. Whereas with machine learning approaches, you're still selecting variables, but you're not defining how they interact with each other. And, while you can technically look inside and see what it's doing, it's not something that really makes a ton of sense. I can easily explain a coefficient on a standard logistic regression or OLS model. But what does the weight of the 6th node of the 3rd layer of a neural network mean?
