"Regarding tax deferred retirement plans you said: ""In fact, I would dare say that in most cases, people end up paying more in taxes, because they pay it as regular income rather than LTCG."" And that's totally wrong. Maybe you should re-read my post because I in no way agree with that. The ordinary rate being higher than the LTCG rate was never in dispute. That point isn't even relevant."
