Yea a guy built it of a program called paradox 12 years ago. We paid about $100,000 for it then. We do about 25 million in sales between the two of us, so we are small in terms of people, but we are very large in our industry. We have been in business for 30 years. I have been looking through thatmorons suggestions, I think these are excellent places to start.
