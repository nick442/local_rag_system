> outside of Germany, you have abysmal unemployment rates Europe has a higher unemployment rate, but that's OK - they have a strong social safety net. Unemployed people still get excellent free healthcare, unemployment benefits, university is still free. Europe does not optimize for full employment. > The US unemployment rate during the Great Recession peaked at 10% [Factually incorrect. 25%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) > You can have labor that is controlled like you mention and high unemployment or lower controls and less unemployment. Is it better to have high unemployment but workers that are better off or lower unemployment and workers that aren't as well off? Life is better in Europe. You know The State has got your back. You cannot lose your pension because your company went bankrupt (the pension funds are independent of the employer), healthcare is great and free at point of consumption, your kids will go to the best collage they can get into, because all collages are free. > The Euro zone is forgetting how to be competitive. We live in an economy where price matters. The price of labor determines the prices of goods and services. And supply and demand of products and services are determined by prices. Its a cold hard truth. You are optimizing for the wrong target. If you push price of labor down, you push standards of living down. That's not good. That's missing the point of having a State and an economy. We build our society to make out life better, not to generate shareholder value.
