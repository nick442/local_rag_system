There is nothing wrong with giving out data and statistics so companies can hire a more more diverse workforce. And I have absolutely no problem with what a company does internally to accomplish this goal. The problem I have is what you said last. >If a company wants to be racist in their hiring I am ok with that company going away. That is the most heavy handed thing the government could do. Even if a openly racist is only hiring whites; what right does the community/government have to stop him? The racist is not hurting anyone. His only crime is only wanting to associate with individuals he wants too. Yes less blacks will have less jobs but is it the responsibility of the racist to hire blacks. No of course not. But if the community/government wants to shut the racist down for his hiring practices then we don't live in a county where rights and property is protected. We live in a country where we think that it is a *right* to force someone else to hire you.
