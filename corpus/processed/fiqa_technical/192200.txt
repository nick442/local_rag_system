Usually, sell. Every month -- arguably every day -- you own the house it is costing you money for mortgage and taxes and upkeep. Unless it is also producing income, or you are actually living in it, that is a serious problem. In any sane market, it is extremely unlikely that the house can gain enough value to offset that loss. Renting it out, even if you lose money versus the costs, would at least slow the bleeding.. But unless you actually want to deal with rental, or strongly expect to return very soon, selling rapidly for a good price is usually optimal. Of course when setting the asking price, and negotiating offers, you are going to have to consider exactly this trade-off.
