Iran, if he pull out of the deal and Iran goes nuclear, he looks like and asshole, if he stays in the deal, he looks like a bigger asshole 3. Afghanistan, he already looks like an asshole and he is going to look like a much much bigger asshole 4. But the thing that is really going to get him designated as Asshole in Chief is Tax reform North Korea is over and done, they are not going to go back. Tax reform is what we have our eyes on . . .tell us how taxing the poor through hidden sales taxes and giving the rich tax breaks is going to work for everybody.
