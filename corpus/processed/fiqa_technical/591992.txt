"> Why the shift toward plant-based eating? Cutting back on meat consumption is [better for our health](http://www.triplepundit.com/2016/01/not-eating-meat-new-years-resolution/). Generally, eating less or no meat [reduces your risk](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/meatless-meals/art-20048193) of coronary heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. The ""better for your health"" link leads to another article which in turn cites [this Harvard page](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/) which in turn cites three observational studies. It might be worth noting that in general these types of studies come to the wrong conclusions about 80% of the time ([Ioannidis, 2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16060722/)). The ""reduces your risk"" link is just a Mayo Clinic article on recommended intakes with no linked studies. The assumption here is that eating less meat will improve health because the *correlation* seen in these observational studies and e.g cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc. But what does studies in vegetarians tell us? If just reducing meat consumption has a ~20% reduction in relative risk then not eating meat at all should have an greater effect. But we don't see that, studies show no effect on overall mortality in non-SDA vegetarians: [Figure 2 mortality](http://imgur.com/WgSrBJa) *Kwok CS, et. al,* [""Vegetarian diet, Seventh Day Adventists and risk of cardiovascular mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149402) *Int J Cardiol. 2014 Oct 20;176(3):680-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.07.080. Epub 2014 Aug 4.* What these observational studies in the general population show is other factors, e.g the healthy adhere bias where people who eat less meat tend to be healthier, and not that meat is inherently unhealthy. > While Google is focused on improving employee health, serving less meat is also part of its initiative to reduce its carbon footprint. Significantly more water and other resources are required to raise and slaughter animals than to grow fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains. According to a study published in the journal [Climatic Change](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-014-1169-1), a plant-based diet has a significantly lighter carbon footprint than a meat-heavy diet. These diets also reduce overall protein consumption, when you compared equal protein intakes, factor digestibility, and amino acid content, the differences in emissions are trivial ([longer post](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/4qs4eg/meat_is_horrible_it_may_be_delicious_but_the/d4wd70e/)). Water use isn't that different either ([short post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/558vdq/trailer_before_the_flood_2016_documentary_movie/d89jxdy/)) Looking at the big picture shows that meat shouldn't be the focus. In the US *all* agriculture, including crops grown for human consumption, is just 8.1% of emissions: *In 2012, emission sources accounted for in the Agricultural chapters were responsible for 8.1 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.* *Environmental Protection Agency*, [""Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Agriculture""](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/US-GHG-Inventory-2014-Chapter-6-Agriculture.pdf). The 2015 draft also shows that this is declining, as a percentage, to 7.6% ([chapter 5](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/pdfs/usinventoryreport/US-GHG-Inventory-2015-Chapter-5-Agriculture.pdf)). Meanwhile we have 31% from electricity and another 27% from transportation: [Sector emission chart](http://imgur.com/r9qavFg) *EPA,* [""Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions""](http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources.html). Switching to clean energy, solar/wind/nuclear, and moving to alternative fuels would make a huge impact and address the actual problem far more efficiently. Blaming meat is just a [red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring) pushed by groups with other motivations than climate change."
