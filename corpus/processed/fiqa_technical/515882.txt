i will probably choose to buy a stereo or a dvd player, as opposed to designing and building my own, but i can grow a potato, as long as i dont go to prison for growing a potato. i just might grow my own produce, you dont know what i grow. but i do not have the freedom to grow weed, because the police will raid my home and take my children and they will put me in prison and they will auction my home to strangers, lol.. for the five hundredth time, i have the freedom to grow a potato or a carrot, but if i grow one single weed plant i will be sent to prison with murderers and rapists. #when weed is decriminalized, then i will not need to buy weed from criminals,.. lol.
