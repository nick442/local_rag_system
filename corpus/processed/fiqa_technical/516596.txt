? The guy claimed that BTC had intrinsic value so I asked him what instrinsic value BTC had. BTC has literally 0 intrinsic value, it doesn't even exist physically. I'm not saying the technology is worthless or that it doesn't have value, but it certainly doesn't have intrinsic value. Gold--you can create things with gold, silver--silver is important in medical applications, can be made into things. These things have value, even in circumstances where the market disappears or the demand ceases. A company has intrinsic value in that its assets can be sold off and liquidated for cash--even if they don't generate a single penny. Gold has intrinsic value in that even if there is no one demanding gold, it can still be useful for something. If no one wants BTC, you literally can't do anything with it except look at the numbers. It's the equivalent of hoarding a pile of dust that the market valued for some reason and then the market crashes--what are you going to do with a pile of dust? Literally nothing except watch it fly in the wind. It was only worth something because other people valued it. Block chain is revolutionary tech, but there is no IV with BTC. BTC and block-chain aren't really even interchangeable--it's like the relationship between a square and a rectangle; a square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not necessarily a square. BTC is block chain but block chain isn't BTC. Even if BTC fails and dies, there will be something else that takes its place but there is no IV with BTC. Trying to assign BTC some sort of IV is a misleading. There are many reasons BTC is revolutionary but it's not because there is some sort of huge IV attached to it. And where did I ever call BTC a ponzi scheme? You sound like you got a chip on your shoulder.
