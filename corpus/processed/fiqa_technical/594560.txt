Couldn't you sneak by those questions with an undergrad in finance? I heard Level 1 is a lot of stuff you learn in undergrad (except ethics, I heard that section usually nabs people). I'm glad you grill those people though. I have a friend/former classmate who signed up for the test mainly just so he could put that he was a candidate on his resume and get a good job. He ended up scoring a pretty decent job too, not sure how much of it was owed to the CFA candidacy. Trying to take the CFA this December to help with attaining a job after the spring semester if I can get a CFA scholarship.
