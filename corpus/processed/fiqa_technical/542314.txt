You are making an assumption that the house will appreciate in the short term, which there is no way you can know. You will probably take a bath financially selling a house after one year into a mortgage even if you sell it for what you paid for it. If there is any chance you might relocate back it is definitely worth keeping it, otherwise I'd say cut your losses. The only upside might be if you could rent it out, keeping in mind that you generally need to rent for about double your mortgage payment to get positive cash flow. Letting it sit empty while you wait for it to appreciate is undoubtedly going to cost you big-time.
