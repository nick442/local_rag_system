> quadriplegic I'm going to go out on a limb here (ohhhh!) and say the money a newly made quadriplegic makes is in the range of zero to negative monies. I did mean discharge though, you are right, I shall leave my mistake for the world to know! Undue hardship is what I was referring to in terms of student loans because I looked into it. It is almost impossible to meet the standard unless, as said, you stop making money (quadriplegic) or you die. There's a third alternative which includes being a minimum wage teacher for two to six years in a slum-city high school but that's about as enticing as just leaving the country altogether.
