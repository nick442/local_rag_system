One thing you may want to consider if your budget is tight..do your own Escrow. You have to be disciplined, but I don't see that as a problem for you. Nice job on no car payment or student loans! The banks almost always screw up escrow, and you can keep your monthly savings payment exactly what they need to be. Dump 610 in a savings account every month and you should be golden. Here in Orange County, Florida taxes are due in April, you can get a discount of 1%/month if you pay early. November is the first time you can pay it. When you run your own escrow, as I do, I can pay when I want (at the end of November) and maximize my discount. Now your situation may differ, but probably 110% (not based upon research) of escrow accounts are goofed up.
