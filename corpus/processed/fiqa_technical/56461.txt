First of all, bush was a liberal. He expanded the federal government to a size that had never before been reached. So yes, liberal policies fail. Speaking of which! Glass steagall's repeal was the biggest reason for the financial crisis. Clinton repealed it. Obama didn't reinstate it. Liberal policies never DON'T fail.
