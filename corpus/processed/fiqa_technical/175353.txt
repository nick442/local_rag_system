">I've never thought about the difference in goals between manufacturers and local businesses. Ultimately they have the same goals: sale of product/services. But they have a HUGELY different emphasis: * John Deere wants you to buy JOHN DEERE BRAND products, and they really don't care WHERE you buy it. * Walmart/Target/HomeDepot generally don't really give a crap WHAT BRAND you buy, so long as you buy it from.. Walmart/Target/HomeDepot. So John Deere's advertising is all about convincing you to ONLY be interested in buying a John Deere (from where-ever). And the retailer (aka ""local business"" whether a chain or independent) advertising is all about getting you to come back to THEIR store to buy.. well whatever (which can be specific, or ""anything and everything"") they sell. Those things can COINCIDE when there is some ""exclusive"" relationship (so the local John Deere dealer IS interested in promoting the John Deere brand, but really only to the extent that you buy a John Deere from THEM, and NOT from some other dealer/store). And likewise, the local Buick dealer wants you to buy a Buick.. but chiefly so that you will buy one from THEM, and/or so that you will come to them to buy parts/service (which most dealers actually tend to make more money on than they do from the sale of the car itself). --- >Hmmm, your knowledge about the facebook ad model might be able to help me with a personal project I'm doing. I don't know that it I would call it ""*knowledge* about the facebook ad model"" -- it's more general knowledge about how the advertising/marketing world, and *speculation* (with back-of-the-napkin-style calculations) regarding about how delusionally far-away from reality FaceBook's supposed ""super specific targeting"" actually is. --- >If you care to take a whack at it, read on: What interested me before the IPO was the debate about the value of FB's ad model. This is/was kind of my whole point (though I'm coming from a different tack than you). My view is that *regardless* of how ""effective/ineffective"" FB's ads prove to be: 1. There is only so much commerce in the world (granted it can grow, but it does so on an incremental basis in *real money* terms). 2. Only a certain percentage of it is going to be spent on advertising. 3. A lot of that -- probably 50% or more -- is LOCAL advertising/marketing (done not by the ""big players"" but by smaller/more local operations). 4. There is no way that FaceBook will capture anywhere near even 50% of even the ""big player"" advertising/marketing money (competing against ALL other types of media? Yeah, not gonna happen!) -- and *they aren't even trying* to get any of the ""local"" money. 5. As a result of the above, there is no way for FaceBook to achieve the revenues (much less the profit margins) to support anything anywhere NEAR the valuation it IPO'ed at. 6. Ergo the price of the stock will continue to drop (especially as insiders & previous investors ""cash in"" by selling additional stock into the float) -- until it reaches a price that CAN be supported by a reasonable P/E (say in the 10 to 20 range) that is based on ACTUAL achievable revenues. (Which I don't see any way for the final value of FB to be anything *over* $10 a share, more likely the PPS will end up in the $4 to $5 range, and possibly even lower, especially if they continue to ""fumble"" things as they have recently -- ultimately, especially if they dilute the shares as they seem likely to, it will probably end up as a $1 to $2 stock). As to your questions.. I think we're barking up different trees. Your approach sounds interesting, but I wouldn't have any idea where you could get HARD data on any of that (at best you I think whatever data you can lay hands on is going to be a lot of highly dubious and speculative BS) in no small part because I don't think anyone really HAS any ""harder"" data (maybe GM does and that is why they dropped their use of the stuff)."
