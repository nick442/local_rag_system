"Am I the only person on this thread to have understood the true meaning of the headline the first time I read it? I understand that its grammatical construction is ambiguous, but it's really fucking easy to figure out what the writer meant to communicate. Then again, I *have* been living in Mexico for twenty years, so that may explain it. Oh, and by the way, even though I understood the headline, I disagree. I strongly doubt that Cuba (except for that obscene Guantanamo concentration camp) has a McDonald's, and I'm sure that Cuba is classified as a Latin-American country in just about everybody's book. But anyway, yay for the Bolivians! It's a democratically created socialist state, and according to the article the Bolivians voted with their wallets in this case, not by voting in politicians to decree McDonald's outlawed. On the other hand, I hope the Bolivian politicians flat out outlaw [Bechtel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechtel#Bolivia) from ever doing business ever again anywhere. Bechtel's water ""project"" in Cochabamba should be notorious worldwide as one of the worst scams any corporation played against innocent civilians in history."
