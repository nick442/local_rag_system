"Are you out of your mind? Offer the Teacher Unions to pay more to teachers? This will turn in two seconds from ""we want to offer 10% more"" to ""we demand 30% more.. and next year another 30%"". Unions are the main reason teachers get paid little and treated badly. P/S: I would not mind to agree with the Union to pay 30% more IF they allow to fire teachers for misconduct. Zero chances they will agree to that."
