"Look, I agree that there needs to be some safeguards in place for consumers. No question about it. But if we say, ""Hey, they need to follow the same rules as taxis!"", then we'll just end up with no Uber or Lyft and the same broken system we have now. Uber and Lyft provide a service that consumers obviously love and value. Taxis would be wise to find ways to improve their service AND try to relax regulations that would allow their industry to thrive, as well. I'm confident they can co-exist, but it's absurd to want to maintain the status quo just because taxis don't like the shifting marketplace. Lower, flexible fares, easy ordering, easy transactions and cleaner cars aren't that difficult to achieve. And the cost of medallions has got to go. It's an absurd barrier to entry that serves no purpose whatsoever."
