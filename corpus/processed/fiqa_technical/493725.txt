I wouldn't buy banks personally for the following reasons: * Secular declines in trading revenue - this is a big part of bank income. We are at an all time low in volatility for the year (like EVER), and with active investing being proven not to be as profitable as buy-and-hold and passive investing (I.e. ETFs), trading may never return to its former glory. * fintech firms and blockchain technology - these are big, big deals. If an algorithm can do financial analysis better, raise money cheaper, and improve security better, then banks will lose a lot of purpose and heavy bargaining power for fees. This is certainly on the horizon and will affect banks. * low growth - the US consumer is not making more money, and S&P says companies are now leveraged at levels since before the recession. The point is I don't think there will be a large renewed credit cycle of heavy borrowing anytime soon as everyone is tapped out.
