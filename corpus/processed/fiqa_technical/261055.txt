"> Any job that went south of the boarder was leaving anyway. It may be true that these jobs not leaving would result in an increase in the cost of living. But the textile market is not going away just because there's no cheap labor market to produce it in. >NAFTA provides you with much more buying power. 20 years ago a poor person could not buy an iphone if it existed back then. Currently anyone can afford any combination of Iphone, Xbox, computer, above ground swimming pool, etc. Twenty years ago I was still working full time, and could afford rent, car, and have spending money. By 2005, the last time I worked, there was no way to afford rent and maintain a car to get to work. I was making better than minimum wage then, but not by a lot. Just what are you basing the notion of ""everybody"" on?"
