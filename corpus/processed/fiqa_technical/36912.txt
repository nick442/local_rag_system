I work for a Big4 and there are no shared audit and consulting clients. We go through pretty extreme independence controls to make sure we don't even have personal relationships with clients. I know people who had to refinance their house because the mortgage company became an audit or consulting client. It's a common misconception that big4s audit and provide consulting services to the same firm, but this is not true.
