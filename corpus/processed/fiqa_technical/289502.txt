I've never had a problem with connection or speed. But they have given me the run around since the start. Signed up for just Internet at the beginning. They told me to try Prism TV. If I don't like it, I can cancel it within 30 days and get my money back. Canceled within 2 weeks. Still got charged for the TV. It's been an on going battle. Let's see if this month's bill is finally correct. It's been 5 months now.
