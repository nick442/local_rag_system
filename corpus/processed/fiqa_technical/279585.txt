Bingo. Unless you're on the labour side of producing kiosks. Should be very few of them. I don't understand mentality. People look at a teachers dispute and make a claim that they don't deserve more money for the work they do. Yet we can all point the finger at each other and judge who deserves what. What we should be doing is saying: why not me too? I once worked on this marketing campaign where I had to hold up a protest sign to draw attention to people doing some flyer giveaway. It's amazing how many people shit on me. There is a rather angry block of people who will hate you for holding up a picket sign no matter what. They don't think.
