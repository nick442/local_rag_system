I suggest looking at Bill Good's philosophy on cold calling. Print out his cold call sheets that teach you about cherries and pit polishing (especially the free articles on cold calling). He teaches you to keep work as fast a possible and keep your conversations as short and non-salesy as possible. I'm sure he charges a fee for actually being taught how to fully envelop in his philosophy but I just utilized the free stuff from his website. I will admit I'm still not a huge fan of cold calling even after using his system. Honestly, it's been like pulling teeth to get me motivated to pickup the phone. But he is one of very few that have created a science around it that could truly work.
