It's hard to trust a reporter who exaggerates such basic facts. Assuming it's correct to use the $800 billion figure, why not just use that instead of bloating the number up to $3.7 trillion? Like you said, if the bigger picture issue here is not $800 billion vs. 3.7 trillion, why lie about it? The end result is that while something corrupt did happen with the banks involvement in the bond market, the public isn't getting truthful information about it either way. Taibbi is doing a disservice to the public by lying, because of the huge amount of disinformation, and insincerity coming from all sides of the issue, the public has no one to trust to give them credible information, and so the issue gets ignored.
