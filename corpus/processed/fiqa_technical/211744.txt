">i have rarely had a ""oops, we overbooked and you get a Hyundai Accent"" experience I was thinking the same thing. The only time I've ever been downgraded instead of upgraded was because I was on a tight schedule and couldn't wait for someone to return a larger vehicle, so I ended up taking a Nissan Versa because it was pretty much the only thing available."
