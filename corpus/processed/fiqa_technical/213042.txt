"Hah! In so far as the financial sector isn't making money off the government, then I would say it is truly ""financed through the financial sector"". The financial sector doesn't operate at a loss, which is what you are suggesting here. They aren't paying the government to have roads and power and plumbing and water, etc. The financial sector is paying because they make more money back. You want to admit who is paying to have roads and water and power and plumbing, etc? Every person who gets a paycheck or owns a house is. Not big money. Ordinary people. Taxes and Tariffs, and printing money pays for all of this. We, the tax payer, aren't seeing a financial reimbursement for our expenses on these projects. But Big Money is. Our reimbursement is: Roads, Power, plumbing, Police, Fire Departments. Which means we are the consumers buying products. Big Money is the middle man making bucks off the system. Perhaps Big Money is necessary, but now it is out of control, and needs to be held accountable."
