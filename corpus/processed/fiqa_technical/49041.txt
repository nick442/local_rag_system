"Diversity is not an issue - since the 60s, you can't discriminate based on race, religion and even sexual orientation. It's how diversity and other junk being taught in colleges and university. I don't need my son to hear crap such as ""white privileges"", ""micro-aggression"", ""no whites are allowed"", ""57 genders"", etc. So you can see the result of this with how ""diversity"" is implemented today in the work place. Did you hear what happened in Google? Anyway, can my son be Trump supporter in certain colleges and universities? Yes or no?"
