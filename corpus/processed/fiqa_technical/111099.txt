>No. He worked overtime, he deserves his pay - not paying him 200k is wrong. He shouldn't be allowed to work overtime. Bridge patrol should be mandated to be well rested and never overworked. They should work max 40 hrs a week. And they should be salaried and not hourly. >Is it mismanagement? Yes OK, so it seems we agree. I'm not saying let's stop paying for overtime. I'm just saying we shouldn't be paying that much money to highway patrol, even if it's bridge patrol.
