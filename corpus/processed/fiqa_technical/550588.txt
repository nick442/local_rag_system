"I think history is repeating itself. Remember when Apple was ""better"" than the PC b/c it just worked in the 80's. But then what happened over time? The PC took over b/c it was an open platform. The fact that it didn't just work proved to be an asset in the long run. I see the same thing happening with smart phones and tablet. Sure, the iphone/ipad just work and android devices crash here and there, just like PC's back in the day, but I think history will repeat itself and the very thing that makes the iphone/ipad successful will ultimately be its undoing. Same old shit."
