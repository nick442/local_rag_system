I hate restaurants that have a damn tv on every possible surface, especially ones that show sports. The only thing I hate worse is restaurants that have a tv on every possible surface AND have a radio blaring on top of that. It's like they can't imagine people actually want to talk to and be able to hear the people they went out to eat with. What's with the incessant racket and visual assault? Guess why we never go back to so many restaurants? Of course I'd rather invite people over for dinner. Nothing but some very soft light jazz playing you can barely hear, and you can actually enjoy the company. Not to mention the food at home is organic and is not drowned in fat and/or breading.
