"I said the majority, not ALL. (And the vast majority of people -- again even within the ""sciences"" -- are in fact mediocrities). That doesn't mean it take some ""super-genius"" to see past the fraud, but it does take a sharp mind, AND it then takes an interest and time to look into the evidence (what little there actually is). Many people within the hard sciences are more than capable of seeing through the fraud and foolishness of psychology/psychiatry. Indeed, many *have* done so. (Cf [Feynman](http://www.rationalskepticism.org/psychology/richard-feynman-briefly-on-psychology-t967.html), and of course the aforementioned [John Ioannidis](psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2010/10/19/what-research-can-you-believe/) who has debunked a LOT of so called ""research"" in both psychiatry and other medical ""science"" research). But far more often those with sharp minds are busy with a lot of other endeavors, and so long as they have no driving need, they do not really examine other fields to much dept (in most cases they do not investigate other fields at all). What is more is that psychologists & [psychiatrists themselves know](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P6_FwpVo_s) (and [when put on the spot will admit that there is no real science behind the malarkey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atsCp2SErog) or the drugs) that they sell -- not that they really care of course."
