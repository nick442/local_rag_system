I was joking--I thought you meant the freemium model so many publishers use. Places like Facebook don't do it for two reasons: 1. They can make more money without it. 2. People aren't willing to pay for Facebook. Other sites that offer real value--Pandora, for instance--offers subscription alternatives.
