I spent some time last year in the UI system and its crazy that it is actually at least as bad there as described in the article. Even if UI only gets like 50% of its funding from public, Illinois debt crisis resulted in them being almost 2 years behind in funds. The grad students were being held up. I was basically told not to consider going there. It's crazy how these schools were 20 years ago were competing with Ivies and now their tenured faculty has been looking to leave.
