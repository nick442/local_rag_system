I would bet that Uber is bought out or goes public before it fails (failing is the only scenario in which Kalanick gets nothing). They're not going to turn a profit anytime soon which means there will be pressure to return value to investors and there will be a need to raise additional capital somehow. Kalanick is going to have an opportunity to cash out billions when that happens.
