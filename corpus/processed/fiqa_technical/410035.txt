"Why bother with the ETF? Just trade the options -- at least you have the ability to know what you actually are doing. The ""exotic"" ETFs the let you ""double long"" or short indexes aren't options contracts -- they are just collections of unregulated swaps with no transparency. Most of the short/double long ETFs also only attempt to track the security over the course of one day -- you are supposed to trade them daily. Also, you have no guarantee that the ETFs will perform as desired -- even during the course of a single day. IMO, the simplicity of the ETF approach is deceiving."
