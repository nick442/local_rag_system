"ITIN's can be granted for deceased minors via Form W-7: Choose ""Dependent of U.S. citizen/resident alien"" as the reason for applying. You are required to write ""DECEASED"" across the top of the form, and you will have to provide a birth certificate and potentially other supporting documentation. The directions are not super clear for this use-case, but I've found that IRS support for ITIN is pretty easy to work with. The directions also have offices/numbers for overseas help, which I'd wager will be better able to assist with your scenario. Edit: I made a poor assumption on answering that the original returns filed were rejected but had been filled out properly, when filing with a deceased dependent without an SSN you typically write 'DIED' in the spot for the dependent's SSN. If the original returns were not filed this way, and accompanied by supporting documentation (record of live birth and record of death), then it may be best to start there, but it sounds like you already got bounced around and had it suggested that the lack of a number was an issue."
