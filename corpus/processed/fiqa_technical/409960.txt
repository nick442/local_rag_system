Sure user data is valuable. But valuable enough to be their business model? The math doesn't add up. If the data is that valuable, then why even charge users in the first place? Letting people in free would certainly generate even more data. Definitely more than what they would have gotten at their $10 price point. If they get twice as many people to jump in at the free price level (not a far fetched assumption) then they would make enough additional money to justify giving it away. And after a certain point, additional data stops being statistically significant while costs continue to mount paying for all those additional tickets. Furthermore, the CEO has already said that their business model is to share the additional revenue with the theaters. I'm not saying that they won't mine their data. They would be fools not to. And they will definitely be able to monetize it. But it's not possible for that alone to be their business model. How can it? Every time they send someone to a new movie, it costs them the full ticket price.
