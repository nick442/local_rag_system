I had a macys card which only had $75.00 credit limit.. I accidently paid over the limit so the card had $100.00 in it. I left it that way for a month. My credit limit turned into 100. So I do think its possible to increase your credit limit that way. I've tried many times requesting for a credit limit increase. I was denied many times. The only thing I have is to add money but the tricky thing is that you'll have to add money and spend the whole amount and then pay it off at once for the credit limit to stick. But since you have great credit assuming because your limit is 1000, you should request for an increase of your credit limit.
