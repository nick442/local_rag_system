The 19th century called, they want your socialism back. >I bet neither the military, NASA, FDA or your local police station/firefighters aren't providing any usefullness.. Let's see.. * Military? - not sure what good I'm getting of some fucker in Afghanistan being killed * NASA - yes, I get value from that * FDA - ditto, but not that much * police - I'd rather get them reduced in size * firefighters - we need a lot of audits on the effectiveness of those When I buy a product from a private corporation, there are a lot of rosources that I can consult on the value they provide. I can choose between the different providers. When the government taxes me, I don't have a choice. I must pay the taxes no matter what. It'a a totally different situation.
