You are claiming that this 'idea' is liberal: >..the National Government has a role in centrally planning restrictions on freedom.. Are you suggesting anarchy as s viable political-economic system? I doubt it. Given that, everyone except anarchists see a role for the national (and other levels of) government to pass various laws. Secondly, how do you see the MIC having anything to do with the government restricting freedoms?
