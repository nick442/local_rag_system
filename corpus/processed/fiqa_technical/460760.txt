This often occurs because of misrepresentation of the corporation income. Most of the income in the US is payed at or a little below the 35% rate.. But when the figure is calculated non-US income is counted alongside US income. For some reason, in the US it makes sense for corporations to pay income taxes in the countries they actually made the income in AND the US. Mind you.. Only USA and Eritrea have this sort of backwards thinking. So yeah.. If they make $100 worldwide income, out of which $50 is US income, and the company reports $15 in US taxes, they get represented as paying 15% effective tax rate when in reality they payed 30% on US taxes for their US income.
