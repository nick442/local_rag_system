The link, in case you’re interested, was in the CS Monitor piece: http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2013/0319/A-lesson-from-Iraq-war-How-to-outsource-war-to-private-contractors Report link: http://psm.du.edu/articles_reports_statistics/data_and_statistics.html …which I provide just in case you want to read them, not to have the same conversation a second time. Interesting that there aren’t more hard feelings between those getting paid lots versus those not. I mean yes, you’re all there together, but if you and I are doing ostensibly the same (and possibly dangerous) work, you’re getting rich and I’m not….then again, there’s no conscription, in both cases you volunteered to be there. Strange also that taxpayers don’t care more about this, although….perhaps not. The amount of bullshit is just too overwhelming. Sounds like you could tell lets of stories about the women, though I’m not sure I want to hear them after a good lunch, and I’m pretty sure you don’t want to remember.
