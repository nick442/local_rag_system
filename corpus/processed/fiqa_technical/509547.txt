>Entrepreneurs that like to invent will simply do it elsewhere. Bullshit. Entrepreneurs start businesses where it's easiest for start businesses, and if all of their networking contacts are here, the infrastructure they need to start their company is here, and the target market is here, they aren't going anywhere. Besides, the top marginal tax rate is the last thing on the minds of talented entrepreneurs. They are far too worried about the day-in day-out running of their business to spend their time day-dreaming of how to hide away all of their money once they become rich. >Expecting people's behaviors to NOT change when diminishing their rewards is ignoring the facts. That statement displays a tremendous ignorance of human psychology. If this statement were true, no one would ever stay in a shitty relationship, no one would be addicted to drugs, and no one would watch The Office anymore. Human beings are creatures of habit, and breaking those habits is exceptionally difficult, no matter how much the rewards may diminish.
