Ya idk.I initially thought a moving average but that can't be it since when price crosses below trend line we see trend line continues to increase. https://villavu.com/forum/showthread.php?t=112371 but this says that it is in fact a monthly average. I don't see how that is possible, as adding a number below the average of a set to that set should decrease the average. People say 'the mean chases the margin,' not a fan of that terminology myself though. Edit: ah wait the yellow line is daily average, not price. If monthly average is calculated on close price, then this is possible. **so the answer then is the trend line is the monthly average**.
