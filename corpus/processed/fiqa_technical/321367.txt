I think, based on their publicly available records, that they believe their own rather substantial increases in wealth since being elected are repeated amongst the general public. Since they only circulate amongst the elite that pay for their elections, they probably are unaware that the average American has see their income decrease since the 1980's, while they and their friends incomes have increased an average of 10% per year since the 1980's. So, for them, at least, their strategy is working. But I still can't see why people vote for them.
