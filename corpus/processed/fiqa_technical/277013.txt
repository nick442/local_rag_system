"Full disclosure, I'm an Apple fan, and gave up Windows as my primary computing experience around the transition from XP to Vista. That being said, when Microsoft goes all-in on hardware and puts their minds to it, they really do have great hardware chops. Back when I was in college, the best peripheral hardware you could buy (mice, keyboards, headsets, even at one point cordless telephones) were Microsoft products. I *still* think the Microsoft Natural keyboard was genius and ahead of its time. The XBox and XBox 360 are other great examples of good hardware. Yeah, the 360 had its share of defects, but even with those, it's still a great system that has had an extremely full life, and is now morphing in to a formidable digital media hub. I hope the Surface helps revive some of Microsoft's past innovation. Personally, I question the wisdom of trying to make Windows 8 work well on both tablets and the desktop, and I think the transition to the Windows 8 interface is going to be extremely jarring for the non-technical user. I also think it's confusing and a potential marketing nightmare putting out R/T tablets that are Windows 8 branded but only run Metro apps, side by side with ""Pro"" tablets that are going to run Metro plus traditional Windows software. I can't imagine having to explain to a non-technical user why they might not want to buy the *cheaper* version of an MS tablet if they have an old app they still want to run. Who knows, they ostensibly have smarter marketing folks than me, just seems like it leaves a lot up to chance."
