"Subchapter S Corporations are a special type of corporation; the difference is how they are taxed, not how they relate to their vendors or customers. As a result, they are named the same way as any other corporation. The rules on names of corporations vary by state. ""Corporation"" and ""Incorporated"" (and their abbreviations) are allowed by every state, but some states allow other names as well. The Wikipedia article ""Types of business entity"" lists an overview of corporation naming rules for each state. The S-Corp that I work for has ""Inc."" at the end of its name."
