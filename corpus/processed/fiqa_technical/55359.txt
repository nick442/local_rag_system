Yeah, so the point is that without Wal-mart a lot of disabled people would be unemployed (a bigger burden on the government). Walmart gets to pay x-amount for their laborers and they still get to work. I worked at Wal-mart for 2 months. My experience might be biased since the floor manager was a total moron, but the job was not difficult. To be honest, the most annoying thing about Wal-mart are the goddamn customers. I almost got run over (this is while wearing a fluorescent jacket) about three times. All this hate on Wal-mart is coming from over-privileged bloggers who get paid to write stupid bullshit the entire year. My friend got kicked out of his house the moment he graduated from high school. He worked at Wal-mart, got paid 10 bucks (higher than minimum wage) and managed to get back on his feet and then joined the Navy.
