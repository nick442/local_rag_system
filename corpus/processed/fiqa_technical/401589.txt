Sweet so you've spent the last six months sinking money into this and have made *hundreds* (your words). You could have made *thousands* at a part time job but then you'd have had to admit your mom was right about everything. No but seriously keep being funny because the rest of the internet (and I) love laughing at you. All the best!
