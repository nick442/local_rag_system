If you can afford to put more money into the 401(k) -- which is what paying yourself back at a higher rate than you're earning would amount to -- why not just put more money into the 401(k)? Or into an IRA, if you've maxed out what the 401(k) will allow. That would seem to have the same positive effects you're looking for, while avoiding the negative ones.
