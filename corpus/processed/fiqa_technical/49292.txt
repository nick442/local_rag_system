The soaps do not lather at all, the shampoo smells nice and that's about it. The dish washing detergent does not clean worth a shit. The laundry detergent will not pull stains and does not whiten whites, the tooth paste leaves my mouth feeling dirty even with my normal obsessive oral hygiene regimen. it's all crap. all brand and lifestyle and no substance.
