"While I agree that there's no known health risk, I do appreciate disclosure. It doesn't have to be a big deal. Nobody's upset if the sign says ""Gala Apples"" instead of ""Apples"", so why would it be so hard to say ""Monsanto #204054 Strain Corn"" instead of ""Yellow Corn""? I would expect-- as GMO technology improves-- we'll see bolder and bolder changes to food products, some of which might inadvertently change the allergen profile. (conversely, we might even see it as a deliberate target-- for example, a peanut that was designed to be less allergenic) I also think there are some non-GMO selection processes that could benefit from disclosure and name-and-shame. The whole ""let's engineer herbicide-resistant crops"" model gives a license for carpet-bombing with herbicides, instead of judicious use. It would not surprise me if such crops end up reaching the market with higher average levels of herbicide residue. So make it easy for me to not buy ""Roundup Ready"" crops. The big mistake with GMO and labelling is that the GMO industry lost control over the narrative. They didn't hit the market with exciting products consumers would care about. Stuff that would make them say ""the future of food will actually be better than Grandma's heirlloom crops."" There was never a sign in the store that said ""Try our new GMO peas with 30% more vitamins!"" or ""This fresh local corn in December is made possible by a GM strain with a longer growing season!"" What we got were lukewarm products like ""it's the same crappy tomato as before but it takes three days longer to rot in the back of the fridge"". If the benefits weren't obvious for the consumer, it became easy for the conspiracy-theorists to take hold of the story."
