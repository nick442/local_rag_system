Tim Ferris has some pretty good finance related episodes with hedge fund managers or personal finance authors (for e.g. the one with Ray Dalio or Tony Robbins). They are not exclusively finance related but include some pretty in-depth conversations. 20-Minute VC is also great if you're interested in Venture Capital.
