Yes of you are right limited resources and unlimited wants is why we have economics. In retrospect I should have been more precise. Resources/energy/space make it so there is a finite amount of work to do in a given time period, my point was that luddites often see work as static, in the foreseeable future as you said unemployment wont be a result of insufficient resources.
