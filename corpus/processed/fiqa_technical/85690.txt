"> So the fact that i was born here against my own free will automatically gives the government the right to seize the fruits of my labor? Yes, in the same way that being born to parents living in a clean house means you are going to make your bed, pick up your clothes, and mow the lawn.. > ""well just leave then!"" Well, yes. It is either that, or change the laws. > Which is fucking stupid and in pretty sure I already gave you 1 way but I'll say it again cuz it's clear you're incapable of following along For someone who is so sure that they have ""*THE* answer"" you sure are defensive. It is quite possible that I have had a discussion over the SAME topic over the last 5 days with a *bunch* of people because so many people got butt hurt that I enjoy paying my taxes, and feel it is a patriotic duty because of all the good it does. > federal sales tax So federal sales tax is your big secret? I would actually be fine with it, as long as it took into account those that are currently not paying income tax due to poverty or disability. > That's why you see countries like Sweden with insane tax rates seeing limited growth and in a lot of cases on the verge of an economic collapse. I have lived in Europe for a number of years. I was in Germany last year, I will be in Spain next week. If you think that strong tax policy makes a country economically weak, then you have not actually lived in any of these countries, have you? Sweden is currently ranked 11th in the world for [GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita). Matter of fact, the only country in the top ten of that list that don't have a strong tax policy is Qatar - and that is only because of ridiculous oil money. Would like to see where they sit in two years. Sweden last year had an [economic growth rate of 4.1%](http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/11/14/111716Sweden-Great-Economic-Performance-but-Mind-the-Debt). More than 3 times what the growth rate in the US was, at [1.6% for 2016](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-economic-growth-slowed-in-2016-to-1-9/). It was ranked [#34 in the world for economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_real_GDP_growth_rate), just under your Bahamas with their no income tax, no estate or wealth tax, but well above the US at 47. The IMF matter of fact said their economy was ""in good health and growing robustly"".. So, not sure where you are getting your facts from, but may want to think again. I would recommend that you actually go visit a couple of these ""tax hellholes"" and see for yourself how ""crushed"" by their taxes these poor victims of government ""theft"" are.."
