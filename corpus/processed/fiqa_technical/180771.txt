"It's a trollish reading of a standardized process in the US. http://www.businessinsider.com/impossible-foods-seeks-fda-approval-for-heme-ingredient-2017-8 >The FDA does not officially approve ingredients in food products, like it does for drugs. The burden falls on the manufacturer to show through rigorous testing that a food is ""generally recognized as safe,"" or GRAS. Once a manufacturer makes a determination that a food meets the basis for GRAS, it may invite the FDA to conduct an independent review. The agency may respond with no further questions or raise concerns, according to the FDA website. >After conducting its own testing of the burger, Impossible Foods sought the agency's review. The FDA came back with questions, which is not unusual. A spokesperson for Impossible Foods, citing the FDA website, said one in five submissions come back with questions. >The FDA wants the company to show through additional testing that soy leghemoglobin — and the 40 other proteins besides heme it contains — is safe for humans, not just rats. >Impossible Foods plans to engage the FDA in another review in the future. The FDA approves a lot of sketchy ingredients, including many banned elsewhere in the world, as a point of reference, and [the entire process is shortcoming and voluntary](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/08/31/how-the-impossible-burger-revealed-some-disturbing-fda-practices/#655158dd6aa9)--Impossible could have just not sought FDA approval and would have been fine."
