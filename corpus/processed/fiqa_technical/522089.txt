Honestly, more start-up companies that grow into huge firms should have succession plans that include the founder handing the CEO reins to a professional executive, while they shift over to the Head of Product/Strategy role. Let someone with experience handle corporate governance, shareholder/board relations, HR policy, risk management, financial controls, etc. The founder built their company through their product vision, being a CEO of a multi-billion company is an entirely different skill set. Really, the Google founders are the ideal model for this. Put your ego aside and let Eric Schmidt handle the CEO stuff, you guys focus on our next moves and making the product the best.
