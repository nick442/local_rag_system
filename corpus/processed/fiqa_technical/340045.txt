"This may be a lame answer, but the best IRA contribution strategy is the one that will actually stick to. A single lump sum contribution every year may be a difficult thing for you to maintain. When it's time to make your contribution, you may say ""eh, $5000 is a lot of money, and my checking account balance is kinda low, I'll wait before I contribute"". You keep putting it off, and then you miss the opportunity for the year. If you setup small regular automatic withdrawals, your IRA contribution will run on auto-pilot. Depending on your cash flow, this may not be favorable, though."
