The best partnership agreements cover all contingencies often referred to as the 5 D's: death, divorce, drugs, disinterest, and disability. Most do not, however, which makes them such a mess. I was an employee of a firm that went through this, and it is not pleasant from anyone's perspective. Of course you don't have that option now. Your best bet is to talk to a lawyer and find out your options. For example, would it be best to form your own company and do the same thing? Would it be best to give your partner double as your legal fees are likely to be higher then the inflated value? Could you offer a one time fee and revenue over time in lieu of the one time buy-out? It is likely to get ugly, and one thing that contributes to this is the emotional turmoil that your partner's family is going through.
