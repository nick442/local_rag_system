The Trump tax plan is strongly modeled on the Kansas's Republican Governor's tax plan. Given that it was fairly radical in size (corporate tax rate to zero), and eventually it was repealed by the Republican Kansas legislature, I think folks should look at some of the research on [the great Kansas tax cut experiment](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2017/07/11/the-kansas-tax-cut-experiment/). PS: Trump's current tax plan is pretty different than the tax plan he campaigned on and talked about in his standard stump speech which was pretty populist and not shocking, i.e. a broad middle class tax cut vs. the current plan which is geared primarily to benefit the rich and corporations.
