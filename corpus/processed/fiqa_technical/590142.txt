The idea of self-regulating free markets is every bit of a naive utopian idea as anything Karl Marx ever wrote. People who wish to limit the government have the best interests of corporations at heart. That is why there are vast sums of money behind libertarian groups like the Tea Party. There will always be corruption in government, just as there will never be truly free markets. That is why our founding fathers set up multiple branches of government with all the checks and balances. Things are broken right now because the American people have lost faith in our government. What we need is for a true patriotic spirit to return to the American people, not this unproductive, flag waving nationalism.
