Sears is great for tools, but kind of useless for other stuff, and their cashiers are always giving you a sales pitch (Sears Card, etc.) and several miles of receipt paper. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, I JUST WANT TO BUY A WRENCH! It kind of reminds me of Best Buy, who is actually even worse with this, but just happens to have more products that I'm interested in.
