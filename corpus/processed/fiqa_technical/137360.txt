I can't decide what to do about apple. Huge market share, huge gobs of cash that they don't know what to do with, huge eps and potential to be the best dividend stock of all time. But they have basically one product that carries the entire organization, the i-phone, which i personally don't like. How do i think about that company? Is it super low risk, or actually super high risk? I just don't know.
