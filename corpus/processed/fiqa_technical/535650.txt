"I do know people who follow the islam terrorist manifesto. One is a great guy, and one is a fucking closet jihadist nutbag who I am 100% certain will go jihadi on someone one day. But that's besides the point. If bugs are infesting your house, you lob the bug bomb in there. You're going to kill some ""good"" bugs, but if you don't, the bugs are going to take the whole house. It's ignorance like yours that is getting people killed left and right in Europe."
