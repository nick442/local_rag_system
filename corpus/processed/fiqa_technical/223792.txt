Each trade will cost you nearly $10 to buy and then $10 to sell. With $1800 that is literally 1% of your initial investment lost to fees. It would be far wiser for you to learn with play money instead. Head over to investopedia and use pretend money: http://www.investopedia.com/simulator/ If you're absolutely fine with losing your $1800 than go ahead and jump into some companies you like. I would not recommend that though. Put the $1800 into one single position that you will hold for a few years and play with pretend money to get a better feel for short term trades.
