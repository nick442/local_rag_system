Actually, the logical conclusion is that, if airlines are unable to pay workers acceptable wages and remain profitable, they should be allowed to fail. But that isn't acceptable because we need air travel. Deregulating labour markets definitely isn't going to improve the plight of millions of workers. It might improve the plight of some shareholders though.
