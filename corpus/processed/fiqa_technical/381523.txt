"I agree. But the whole argument justifying the tax breaks for the rich is that they are the ""job creators."" Giving poor people tax breaks and handouts is because they may often need them. There is no necessity to give them to the rich because they would do just fine anyways. But if they are job creators fueling the economy then the fatcat fucks in Congress can rationalize making sure their taxes and those of their contributors stay low."
