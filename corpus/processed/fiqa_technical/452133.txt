My brain seems to tune out ads now on TV even if I don't switch to another channel. I just feel so bored, and zone out like I'm in a boring class waiting for it to be over. And when it comes to internet ads my automatic thoughts are malware. The type of advertising that has been effective is word of mouth from those I perceive to be regular users.
