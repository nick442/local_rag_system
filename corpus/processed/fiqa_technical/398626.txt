1. 100% in my opinion. I see people raising money for cures all the time, I trust that that will allocate needed resources appropriately. 2. The same way we do now, with flight comptrollers directing aircraft. 3. The same thing we've always had, civil lawsuits. The police do already enforce the FCC rules. However I feel that a small town could take care of minor disputes over frequencies quite a bit better than federal government. On your last point, you're essentially saying that you'd rather have currency debasement over local courts dealing with issues on a local scale. If you want to be part of the establishment rather than attempt to solve problems, you would instead support increasing these programs while telling people they are cuts, however, you could only do that if you wanted america to fail.
