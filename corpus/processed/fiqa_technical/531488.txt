Another way to delay receipt is to delay billing. To be safe you will have to wait until the new year to send the bill, because if you do it in late December they could be super efficient and send it to you with just a few days turn around. They may being trying to spend money before the end of the year. Long ago there was a year where there were tax cuts starting January 1st. I new of companies who allowed their employees to defer receiving their December paychecks until January. For families with two income this made a difference because they moved a month worth of one of their incomes into the cheaper year. If they weren't living month to month they could easily absorb the delay. Of course if you already sent the invoice..
