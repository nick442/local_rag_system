"Possibly, if you can get them at a discount. But not if you have to pay full price. Say there's a $1 million Jackpot for $1 tickets. The seller might sell 1.25 million of these tickets, to raise $1.25 million pay a winner $1 million, and keep $250,000. In this example, the so-called ""expected value"" of your $1 ticket is $1 million/1.25 million tickets= 80 cents, which is less than $1. If someone were willing to ""dump"" his ticket for say, 50 cents, what you paid would be less than the expected value, and over enough ""trials,"" you would make a profit. Warren Buffett used to say that he would never buy a lottery ticket, but would not refuse one given to him free. That's the ultimate ""discount."" Larger Jackpots would work on the same principle; you would lose money ""on average"" for buying a ticket. So it's not the size of the Jackpot but the size of the discount that determines whether or not it is worthwhile to buy a lottery ticket."
