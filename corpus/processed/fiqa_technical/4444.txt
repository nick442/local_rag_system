"I'd answer it this way: What do you want to do? I'd say any amount is acceptable from as low as $100. When you look at the specific ""tree"" of investing paying $5 for a $100 seems unacceptable. However when observing the ""forest"" what does it matter if you ""waste"" $5 on a commission? Your friends (and maybe you) probably waste more than $5 multiple times per day. For them buying a latte might empower them, if buying another share of HD, for a similar cost, empowers you than do it. In the end who will be better off? Studies show that the more important part of building a significant investment portfolio is actually doing it. Rate of return and the cost of investing pales in comparison to actually doing it. How many of your peers are doing similar things? You are probably in very rare company. If it makes you happy, it is a wonderful way to spend your money."
