I'm a college student and recently got an interview at an energy investing firm for a job upon graduation. I have academic and extracurricular experience in finance, but I'm not too knowledgeable on the energy sector. What are some good resources (websites, newsletters, etc.) on learning more about the energy industry? Are there any industry specific questions that are likely to come up during the interview?
