It's not all roses, as I understand it, one effect of a tax inversion move is that existing stockholders will get hit with capital gains tax on the stock they hold as part of the conversion process. Edit: going a bit further, often officers of the corporation are insulated from this tax as they have agreements that the company will pay their tax in the event of such a conversion. Seems like a potential for conflict of interest of officers vs shareholders to me. It's unknown if this is the case with BK execs.
