Good for you. That's where it's at. Hell, I've thought about doing the same. But, if someone wants me to work in Manhattan, I'd take no less than $250k per year. I'm not saying my work is worth that, but it wouldn't be worth it *to me* for anything less. Although, if there's one group of people *more* loathed than beltway bandits, it's investment bankers. Probably, if it all came down, people would gladly spike both our heads. Really, I don't expect the zombie apocalypse anytime soon. But, it's an enjoyable escape! Edit. I wasn't a B. I was an A. Maybe, just maybe, I have some experience with SOF. Christ, people think that Tier 1 operations are some kind of shadow magic and that SOF are fucking ninjas. Operations are about keeping things simple. And don't even get me started on how LEOs work. I've trained them and worked with them often. Hint, hint: if you do good ISR, you don't tend to throw flashbangs into babies' cribs.
