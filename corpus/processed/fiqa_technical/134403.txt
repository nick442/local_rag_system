a pension is an annuity, and GM is making cuts to the pensions..if you read the article it clears up any confusion, and while the OP editorialized the headline..i dont really give a fuck. headlines are meant to grab your attention, get you to read articles you otherwise may not. the only people this seems to upset or affect are the morons who just read headlines and nothing else.
