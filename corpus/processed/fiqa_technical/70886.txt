"Elliott was arguing from the position of an original creditor. They still had the same rights and obligations as if they bought the bond directly from the Argentinian government. So buying the bonds at a huge discount did not mean that they gave up rights under the law. Would your opinion differ if it was the original bondholders in the lawsuit, and not these ""vulture funds?"" Think of it this way, Elliott paid less because the original bondholders' rights were judged by the market to be unlikely to result in being paid in full. But paying less did not extinguish any of the original bondholders' rights. And anytime a bond holder is forced to accept modified terms that they did not agree to, the borrower is unilaterally changing the terms. There is an argument that this is necessary for businesses and individuals, but sovereigns that can raise revenue as a matter of policy have no excuse."
