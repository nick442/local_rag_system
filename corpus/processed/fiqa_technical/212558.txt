Good question! In part, it's just a way of indicating how much we appreciate your time. Typically institutional review boards want to see some kind of of incentive to participants to approve a study. In a best case scenario (max accuracy) it works out to about $40/hr - not bad! And, generally, it's standard practice with these kind of accuracy based studies to have some payoff that increases with accuracy.
