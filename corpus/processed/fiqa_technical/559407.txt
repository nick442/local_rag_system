I actually don't have a finance/accounting background but a much more technical background within my sector and had some general finance knowledge. However, most have finance/accounting degrees I work with, and then learn their sector. Many (a third?) straight out of school, most associates with just a few years of experience in finance/accounting related jobs, not necessarily equity research. Don't fret about not having much luck so far, keep looking for a good opening and understand that a lot of jobs in finance/accounting fields can lead you to other positions.
