There is a whole pile of information on TFSAs here. I recommend reading it. There is no penalty for withdrawing money from a TFSA as such. You can withdraw from it at any time. The only restriction is that you can't put the money you took out back in the same year (unless you have sufficient contribution room for it to be considered an additional contribution). This scenario explains it. There may be penalties for withdrawing money from the investment vehicle into which you paid the TFSA contents. For example your TFSA contents may be in a mutual fund, or in an interest-bearing savings account. If those have restrictions on how much you can withdraw, or have penalties for withdrawl, then you will have to abide by the rules and pay any penalties.
