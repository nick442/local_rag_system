I wasn't trying to argue that, because I really don't know what the right solution is. If you were really trying to argue that and not being sarcastic, then I think you have a very good point though. If it really was a tax as is being argued, why not have a tax on the employer end like you do social security and medicaid instead of this mandate? I am not arguing that either, because maybe it wouldn't work. Just playing devil's advocate and trying to come up with **something** better. Either way, this bill seems miles away from the right answer.
