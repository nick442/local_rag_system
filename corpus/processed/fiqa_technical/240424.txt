The dirty secret of Swiss watches is that many movements come from outsourced manufacturers. I have a TAG Heuer that uses the same mechanism once used in the Rolex Daytona (which is the Zenith El Primero). Most people have probably never heard of [Zenith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith_(watchmaker)), but it's one of the most sophisticated manufacturer of watch movements out there. If Zenith wanted to stop selling movements to TAG, that wouldn't bother me in the least. Anyways, is this wrong? Of course not. Swatch is not required, under any circumstance, to build components for direct competitors.
