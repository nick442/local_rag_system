A common pattern I'm noticing here is an absence of critical reading. You don't see that the problem people have is not with your suggestions of approaching education in an alternative way, you are getting down voted because you repeatedly go back to this theme of 'anyone can do it.' Implying that if you aren't an entrepreneur it's because you are lazy. That is why you are getting down voted. You sound like someone patently out of touch with reality. I know this sounds harsh, but I'm just trying to clarify for you why you are getting hammered with the down votes.
