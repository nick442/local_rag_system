Well, first and foremost you're out of luck if GameStop hits rough times and stops refunding cash, or files bankruptcy. It's a really, really (REALLY), bad idea to use something other than an FDIC insured bank as a bank. This is a lot of administrative effort on your part when internet banking exists and most of the online checking accounts refund ATM fees. This idea is also not funny or hilarious, I would call it something but the mods here will just edit it out....
