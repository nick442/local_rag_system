yea pure speculation for now. ICO price of (icnonomi coin) ICN at .14 cents a share, 8 months later it hits $1.50 then $5.18 per share. smh it's wild. $5,000 @ .14cents => 35,000 shares $185,000 profit off of $5,000 in 8ish months, just insane. worth the risk for a quick flip? maybe hence all the wild speculators and dumb money coming to the market after hearing about over night millionaires. Also attracts the sharks and smart traders, the mob gets scared really easy in these exchanges.
