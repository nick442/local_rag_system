Hmmm.. I guess if my choice is representation with a vote or representation without a vote, that vote might be worth some money. On the other hand, I'd prefer option C - operate independent of the union and negotiate directly with the employer and pay no dues. It seems like it should be up to each individual employee to decide whether to be represented by the union. Out of curiosity, once a union has been established, is it possible for another union to come in, collect signatures, and force a vote to switch representation? Is it possible for a vote to dissolve the union to happen? Why is hiring a worker who wishes to be employed without union representation considered union breaking. The members of the union have a right to vest their bargaining power in the union, but why should someone not already in the union be forced to join in order to accept employment?
