"TELL STORIES. I've interviewed a lot of entry level people in my career, and this is the difference maker. Some of the other comments imply it, but let's be explicit. If you're asked how you liked attending school X, don't say, ""It's great,"" smile, and wait for the next question. There's no right or wrong answer to questions. Interviewers want to get a better feel for what you're like and what excites you, and they don't want to have to work to do it. Tell them a story about the class that changed your life. Two more tips that are good at every level. One, always ask to see the work space. (Shows you want the job, and reassures you it's not a dungeon.) Two, when they ask if you have questions, have questions, and make sure some are about what previous employees (in this case, interns) have gone on to do. This should be a source of pride for the interviewer."
