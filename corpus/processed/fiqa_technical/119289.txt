Might be able to replace, but at what price? There was a reason why people bought products from EU/US - it had the correct quality/price ratio. Now with the new imports you will either (1) lose on quality or (2) face an increase in pricing. Either way regular Russians are going to bear the brunt of it, not the oligarchs running the show. Say high to increased inflation, reduced GDP expectations and damaged international relations.
