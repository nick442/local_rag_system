When I purchased my house I struggled with this same idea. I felt sick to my stomach signing a contract stating how much money I now owe a bank. However, the lawyer I was using put it in terms that eased the nausea a little (I still hate owing that much money - but it's a little more palatable). His words, paraphrased: At the end of the day, you have to have a place to stay. Your mortgage payment is replacing your rent except in this case, you're paying yourself instead of someone else. You lose a little flexibility in being able to up and move with relative ease. However, you've lived in apartments, you know that rent almost only goes up. Your mortgage will not. He wrote out some numbers and basically showed that everything evened out except mortgage payments will give you property as opposed to paying for someone else's property. To answer your question though - others have already stated - you'll get a better return in the stock market (usually). But unless you're really really bad at real estate evaluation - you should make some money off your house when you decide to sell.
