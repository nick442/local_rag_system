I don't want to be needlessly critical, but I think that you're being downvoted because of how unwieldy that source is. The writer struggles to communicate ideas and concepts clearly - his structures are needlessly verbose, to the extent that arriving at his conclusion in even a single sentence is like slogging through a certain legendary molasses flood. I've dealt with technical language before (graduate economics-type stuff), and there are definitively good and bad ways of addressing dry, technical materials. If your material isn't interesting, then it should at least be clear. That blog post is neither (which is moderately surprising [or maybe it isn't?] considering his seniority at Microsoft).
