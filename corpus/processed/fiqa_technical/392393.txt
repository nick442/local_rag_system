"I do actually agree. But here's where I'm coming from - another redditor once told me ""pirates are just looking for excuses to do what they want"". He meant it disparagingly, but I fully agree. Downloading movies is cheap and convenient, and so pirates look for excuses to justify that. The high prices of movies and cinemas, the immoral actions of the studios, the inconvenient alternatives, etc all add up to excuses that can be used. Without those excuses, you get cognitive dissonance. And this internal pressure is what persuades people to pay. Just an example, I haven't pirated any games since Steam came out. I pay an average about $5 per game or something and have literally hundreds of games. There have been the occasional game that I've missed out on but I can live with that."
