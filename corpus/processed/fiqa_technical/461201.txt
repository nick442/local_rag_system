"Wait a minute, this is a huge clickbait statistic. From the article: > Total overdraft fees totaled $33.3 billion in 2016, just shy of the $33.8 billion financial institutions collected in credit-card interchange fees They're comparing the _total_ sum of overdraft fees to the _total sum_ of interchange fees. While interchange fees have gone up over time, all the statistic in the story tells us is more people are using credit cards for transactions than ""before"". Merchants also have a huge choice in what sort of fees they pay, the processor they use (it's a surprisingly large market), and the rates vary by processor, type of merchant, risk to the merchant, type of business, type of card, and so on. As a note, the ""type of card"" is not just ""visa"" or ""amex"", but different cards from different issuers can have different interchange fees. That airline rewards card has a higher fee than that ""rebuild your credit"" secured (read: backed by a deposit) card. In short, this is a nonsense article that provides no useful comparison."
