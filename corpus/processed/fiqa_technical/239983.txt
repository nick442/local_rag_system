"Benjammin822 gave a pretty good summary of how schools are thought of but I'll add my two cents as well. Yes, at ""top"" firms you'll see a heavy representation of Ivies, top LACs, and schools like Duke, UVA, Cal, etc. However, this does not preclude you from going into investment banking. There are thousands of firms out there, and there are a bunch of stories on Wall Street Oasis about guys from non-targets networking their tail off and breaking in (even at big firms). If you want it bad enough, you'll make the necessary efforts to succeed. And if you fail, you always have a ""redo"" by pursuing a top MBA."
