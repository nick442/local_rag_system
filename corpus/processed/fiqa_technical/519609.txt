“Off the rails” my ass. It’s pretty obvious kids have a choice: take on absurd levels of debt and “learn” or make money. If you’re not going to be a doctor or biologist, you can get a sales job with an undergrad and avoid subjecting yourself to further debt/delusion. It’s no big loss Trump missed out on all those highly indoctrinated (or “educated”) sociologist/economist votes. They’re compliant tribalists. Who won the engineers? Who won the computer scientists?
