No it isn't, at least from my perspective. For example many drugs are illegal. Do I think they are unethical to use? Absolutely not. I believe in the non-aggression principle, if you aren't hurting anyone else in any way you are not doing anything wrong. Portugal has decriminalized drug use, many anabolics are freely available in middle eastern countries. Is everyone a drug addict or a 280lb freak? No. We should govern what we do with our bodies, not the government.
