This is a very dumb argument. Apple being worth $700B is only 0.7% of total world econony, with your flawed senseless logic, that is pure shit for a company that's been around for 40+ years. What's your thought process of Amazon? Oh look they sell everything but those suckers only pull in revenues of $120B out of $110 trillion world econony, what a shitty unsuccessful company!
