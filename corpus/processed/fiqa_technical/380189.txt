Don't take it personally, take their money, hombre. There is no way they start WW3 when China is trying to take top spot and stabilize it's economy, Russia is playing siege mode with neighbors under sanctions, and the Middle East is still embroiled in who owns what after the Arab Spring blew itself up, and Europe is fighting off countries leaving the EU. No one has the ability to wage a real concentrated war.
