Sure! I can't go into too much detail about my work directly, but I'll outline what I thought was successful for me. * Find common ground non-work related - especially if you have a direct report, this is important. Being Indian means I have a lot more to talk with my report, but I know another co-worker who bonded with his Indian team over cricket (he's south african) * Time zones - this sounds silly, but timezone differences actually result in more issues in communication than anything else. I always offer to meet my night / their morning when needed, and our team there works shifted hours (they start in the afternoon through their night), which allows for more face/phone time. * Set clear expectations - > * Being polite (can you please do something) is not viewed as being polite and may be misconstrued as being an option. Make sure this is explicitly addressed. > * Change resistance - there's a desire to keep doing things the way they've been done in the past; if you need something done differently you should refer to the old way explicitly and mention that you want to do something different. > * Detail / Ambiguity / Managerial approach - Uncertainty isn't taken to well (and I blame the very rigid educational system for this); expect to spell out what you want and expect a desire on their end for closer review and support. Regular check-ins are especially helpful. > * Desire to not disappoint: Admitting not knowing how to do something is often viewed as a sign of weakness. After you ask them for something, ask for them to play it back so that you can be sure that they really understand what you're asking of them. > * Time management - Deadlines are often viewed as guidelines rather than set in stone. It especially helps to check in on regular intervals to make sure things are progressing as you'd like them to. If I think of more I'll edit them in!
