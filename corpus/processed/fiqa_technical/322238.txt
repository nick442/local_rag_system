That totally sucks! I use Avis for work once a year when I'm flown out to corporate and both times I've done so they've managed to fuck up in regards to my reservation. The first time I received an email from them thanking me for using their service when I still had the car and saw a new $300 charge on my credit card. When I called to inquire about the car I had rented 3 days earlier that was still in my possession they informed me that the vehicle had been checked into one of their depots 2300 miles away and they were citing a fee for returning the vehicle to another location. When I asked the agent how many miles were recorded driven on the vehicle she responded with 108. I then asked her how far she thought Chicago was from San Francisco and if it was possible to drive that distance in 3 days while only incurring 108 miles on the vehicle. In the end, they refused to back down and I had to involve corporate to settle everything. The second issue was much less eventful but happened a week ago when I checked out a car. I received an email 2 hours later saying they're sorry my car hadn't been available and to call them for an explanation. Puzzled as I had gotten the car I had asked for I called and was told that their system says I had checked out and in the very same car I had the previous day at 8:34pm (check in and check out were recorded as the same time, same day) and they charged me $50 for a single day's rental. This time they recognized that it was an error and credited me back the money on my CC but I don't know why they have so many issues with their reservation system.
