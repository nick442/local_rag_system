No shit, Sherlock. Let's see: - Valuation down like 80% since last year.. - Massive competition from categorically better products with infinitely deep pockets (Android, iPhone).. - Only customers are a rapidly-eroding base of legacy enterprise customers with aggressive cost/feature requirements and bulk-purchase negotiating power. Sounds like a winner!
