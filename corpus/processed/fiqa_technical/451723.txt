It may work with an individual selling things but not for a retailer. Imagine the price of an iPhone increasing week on week and then stabilising. Again, this won't work for luxury/veblen goods. How do we go about it? Focus groups, user surveys, test markets. Not second guessing the price. You will lose all customer loyalty, piss of the later buyers who paid more for it, you'll be seen as fickle and not trustworthy. One pricing, all people, all markets, all time.
