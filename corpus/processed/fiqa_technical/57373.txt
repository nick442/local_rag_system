"Uber would have been a better company if they just started up the world's largest payday loans business. It would actually be cheaper to operate, by a substantial margin, and they could run their business legitimately, instead of immorally and illegally on most locations. When I looked at Uber, I laughed so hard it actually made my stomach hurt. A guy I knew reckoned he was creaming it. I used simply maths to show he was making 4 cents a kilometre by the time running costs were accounted for, and many Uber drivers will be operating at an actual loss. At least a payday loan has no hidden costs associated with it, and you don't have to spend days raising the small amount of cash you need to get through the month. Uber must be the most dishonest business of the planet right now, and its ""employees"" (LOL) are the dumbest fucks on the planet."
