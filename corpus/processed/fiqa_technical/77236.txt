That's true, and I hope they don't stand for it. It's about time we, after 700 years of failure, give up on fractional reserve banking and let the market decide it's own currency. But the people will only fix it *after* it's broken at this point, and the clear decision is to wait it out in real assets. In which case you avoided exposure to the recession and the crash of the dollar, and increased your wealth by getting out before it broke.
