Generic drugs are cheap and plentiful. Amazon doesn't have much space to depress those prices. Brand name drugs that are still under patent are where costs are high. Manufacturing lines cost millions per drug. Amazon does not have the resources for the millions of drugs to do so. They will not get into manufacturing. And biologics are anticipated to be 80% of the total dollars spent soon. No way to make those generic. Amazon won't be doing much more than a mail order pharmacy service. I highly doubt you will see unique services from this.
