That's totally different. Woods and Vick continue to play popular sports at a high level. Cycling just isn't that popular, and the only reason Armstrong got to be a superstar is because he dominated the sport and had the cancer story. His dominance is tarnished and he's retired and banned from his sport. I don't see him making much of a comeback endorsing products.
