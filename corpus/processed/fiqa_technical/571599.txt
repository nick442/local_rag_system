what he is claiming is that it would be cheaper on the city to have a bucket collector, like some toll roads have. Of course he isnt providing any evidence, it just fits his preconceived notions that the worker sucked and that a bucket will be cheaper. and while a bucket doesnt have overtime pay, much less any pay, it doesnt catch people cheating, or breaking in, and it probably has a much much much higher installation costs. I dont have the numbers and not going to try to claim that a human is cheaper and better. But you shouldnt just agree with dkinmn because it feels right. You have to actually secure them baskets, add electronics to them. etc. It isnt cheap as putting a bucket out there and hoping no one takes the money.
