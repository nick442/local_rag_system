1. It is difficult. There is no formal process outside of undergrad and MBA programs to easily gain access to interviews. At your level, its mostly about connections. If willing to start near bottom, go to your business school and start applying to bank associate programs. Sounds like you would like sales and trading more than M&A, so focus there. 2. If you got in at associate level, you would do 1-3 months of training and then get assigned a desk. Finance going through a tough time right now, so trajectory isn't what it used to be. Expect to be a VP after 2-4 years, then its all dependent on luck and skill. 3. If you land a job at a top 15 bank, you should be making total comp of 150k or more after the first year. Salaries not quite at 150k, but most VPS make over 150k salary, not to mention bigger bonus's. 4. If you did M&A you would be working very serious hours. If you go into Sales and Trading your hours will be anywhere from 40 to 60 hours a week depending on the desk. Trading hours tend to be the shortest. 5. Boston isn't a hot bed for i-banking finance. NYC, London, Sing, Hong Kong tend to be the places to be. I know nobody in Boston that could help.
