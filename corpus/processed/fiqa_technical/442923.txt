"I did a rough model and in terms of total $$ paid (interest + penalty - alternative investment income) both options are almost the same with the ""paying it all upfront"" being perhaps a $300 or so better ($9200 vs $8900) However, that doesn't factor in inflation or tax considerations. Personally I'd go with the ""no-penalty"" scenario since you have more flexibility and can adjust along the way if anything else comes up in the meantime."
