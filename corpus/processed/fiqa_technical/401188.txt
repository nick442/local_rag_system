Consider this before you buy one: I spent 1900 dollars for a car warranty years back when I bought a car. 9 months after I bought the car it broke down and it was covered by the warranty. Without the warranty the fix would have cost me 3400 dollars. This is a huge savings except for one thing.. The warranty company went bankrupt so I spent 1900 + 3400 for a grand total of 5300 :) As you can imagine, I wasn't smiling at the time. Contrast that with my second warranty (I know, I know, don't put your hand in a fire twice) where I spent 2400 for the warranty and then got my transmission fixed for 4000 dollars, and it cost me 100 dollars (deductible). In summary: It's hit and miss, but make sure you don't pay more than 10-15% of the product price for the warranty.
