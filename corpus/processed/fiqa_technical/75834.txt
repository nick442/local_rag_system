I don't think asking a business to pay living wages is as cold as a business paying unlivable wages for work that keeps their business afloat. A business that is only profitable because they pay shit really shouldn't exist in the US. Look I'm not about destroying jobs- but I am about someone who works 40 hour weeks making enough money to reasonably cover their expenses without government assistance. That simply isn't the case with the min wage where it is now. It is insane to put the people who are creating businesses that can't exist without unfair wages above the interests of people who don't have the advantages necessary (for whatever reason) to land a non-min wage job. Maybe with the change to higher wages the gov *would* be forcing barely profitable businesses to become unprofitable, but if you are willing to say that then it would be fair to say that the current min wage is mandating everyone who works a minimum wage (full time!) job into literal poverty. And how would a massive population that is suddenly flush with spending money NOT invigorate the economy? People spending money is good. That is why a big healthy middle class is so good for a country to have. Let people who can pay fair wages pay them, let everyone else come up with a business plan that doesn't hinge on unfair wages, ffs. Min wage has been raised before and actual studies have suggested time and time again that the benefit outweighs the short term loss of employment. Tl;dr We cannot put needs of business owners ahead of needs of the people working for them. That creates a massively unstable & unequal society.
