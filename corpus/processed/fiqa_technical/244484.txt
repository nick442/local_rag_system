You really don't have business sense. Or you're not getting it. There's a difference between supporting something that hurts people vs supporting a harmless old tradition that you pay bc the older generation believes in it. I wish you luck in your business endeavors, but you're not going to be successful if you don't know how to play the game. Don't hurt people or the environment, but learn to be less of a emotionally guided sissy. There are a ton of awards people get just for the feel good sake. Heck even trophies kids get for sports. If there's something you can do that takes the client happy, and it's harmless, go for it.
