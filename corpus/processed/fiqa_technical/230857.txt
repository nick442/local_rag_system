Losings tens of millions of dollars but winning a bunch of awards - I'll leave it to others here to decide if that would make them feel that they are running a company that could really be called successful. I'd rather make even a few *thousand* dollars in profit, from scratch, while losing every possible award category my product could be eligible for.
