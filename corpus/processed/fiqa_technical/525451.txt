I find most ads completely ineffective. I feel that many of them try to hard to grab my attention without convincing me that: 1) I need their product; and 2) that their product is superior to the competition in terms of value and quality. Sometimes I watch an ad and am absolutely bewildered because I don't even know what was being advertised. It's as if these marketers think that witty humor and catchy music will convince me to buy some unknown product at an unknown price. And there are some ads that are just poorly placed. There is not a single Arby's or Golden Corral within a 100 mile radius of me yet I see a commercial for one at least 3x a day. Also I'm guessing I'm not the only millennial with loads of student loan debt that is adverse to spending and does some quick research before making any major purchasing decision.
