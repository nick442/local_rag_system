"Okay, yes! That would seem to make sense. So something like a Dupire local vol model. In the context of term structure modelling, you can also incorporate a volatility surface into the pricing of European and even exotic options (e.g. through a SABR or an LMM-SABR for exotics), which I suppose means by your criteria there are actually varying degree of ""arbitrage free-ness"" when it comes to picking a model. By that I mean there are varying degrees of what your model takes as ""given"". If it takes the market price of risk as given, it's an equilibrium model. If it takes the observed term structure as given, it's an arbitrage free model. If it takes the volatility structure as given, it's something else. Nawalkha, Beliaeva and Soto wrote a paper called ""A New Taxonomy of the Dynamic Term Structure Models"" in the Journal of Investment Management that basically coincides with what we're saying. So yes, it sounds right to me."
