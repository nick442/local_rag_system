This makes me sad. I'm extremely happy with my OG EVO 4G & I actually like Sense. I've not owned a Samsung device, but I can't say I'm happy w/some of there track record, nor do I like TouchWiz at all. And Motorola, wow, I don't think I will ever purchase another Moto device after the short lifespan of my old Razr and the crime against humanity that is the software on my work provided Droid4.
