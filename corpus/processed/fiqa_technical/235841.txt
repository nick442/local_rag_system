"Over-simplification of the problem. To get a well paying job requires a degree these days. Not everyone has the money to pay for college without a loan. Does that mean they shouldn't be able to get a well paying job? That isn't including production increasing and school prices increasing while wages stagnate, exacerbating the issue. Real responsibility would include our responsibility to nurture and build a great nation, education, and value for EVERYONE, not just ourselves and those we decide ""deserve"" it."
