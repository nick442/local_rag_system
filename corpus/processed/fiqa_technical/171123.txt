>I would imagine that given any lack of compulsory regulation, that Americans are using whatever means of payment that suits them. I'd agree, it's almost entirely about competition and consumer protections in areas like banking outside of the US rather than compulsory regulation pushing people to use particular approaches. I run a company in the UK, processing cheques is expensive and awkward (its a manual process, it costs money at basically all points of the process and is more likely to result in a failed payment) for me compared to almost every other method of payment, so I prefer (and actively encourage) the use of electronic payments instead. I can do that because my bank doesn't charge extra for processing electronic payments, in fact it's now cheaper to process them than cheques. That also makes sense from the banks perspective given it costs more money for them to maintain, offer and process cheque payments (to the point that they are already essentially converting them into electronic payments by scanning.). It's not Americans being backward, it's US banks. I doubt that if you had safe, secure, cheap and reliable electronic payment facilities, with the same level of protection and control as with a cheque, most Americans would take the same approach as they do elsewhere (After all, its convenient.).
