I didnâ€™t see a single policy rollback in that article that would have hurt workers in any way. I see a bunch of pointless wage and reporting requirements that when eliminated will help reduce compliance costs for businesses. I see a rollback of Federal wages, which is great for the taxpayer and the real economy. I see overtime rule eliminations, which the Federal government has no business interfering in anyways, as wage agreements are privately and mutually agreed by both parties. I see a rollback of fiduciary rules, which had they been implemented as planned, would have eliminated the ability of many lower income Americans to get any financial advice (advisors have to get paid somehow). The safety related regulations are already handled at the state level, no need for the federal government to interfere. Mandated paid leave is another policy that hurts workers by increasing wage expenses and reducing employment.
