"I think there's a measure of confirmation bias here. If you talk to somebody that started a successful business and got a million out of it, he'd say ""it's easy, just do this and that, like I did"". If you consider this as isolated incident, you would ignore thousands of others that did exactly the same and still struggle to break even, or are earning much less, or just went broke and moved on long time ago. You will almost never hear about these as books titled ""How I tried to start a business and failed"" sell much worse than success stories. So I do not think there's a guaranteed easy way - otherwise we'd have much more millionaires than we do now :) However, it does not mean any of those ways is not worth trying - whatever failure rate there is, it's less than 100% failure rate of not trying anything. You have to choose what fits your abilities and personality best - frugality, risk, inventiveness? Then hope you get as lucky as those ""it's easy"" people are, I guess."
