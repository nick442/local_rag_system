"If I recall, Duke and Dynergy were both heavily involved in the Enron-style defrauding of California back in the late 90s where they'd split their business into various ""independent"" sectors, the parent company would charge sub-companies lots and pass those costs to the division servicing energy to CA while claiming ""thin margins"" justifying high energy fees. I wonder if this is a pre-cursor to try to do the same thing to the midwest that they did to CA just before the elections in 2000. Drive up energy costs dramatically to incite anger at the existing administration, perhaps targeting individual states?"
