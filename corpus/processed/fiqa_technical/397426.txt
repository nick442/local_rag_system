This is a good point and where I think we should start the conversation. We have three coins: the penny, nickel, and dime, which have so little value that people question whether it's even worth the time to handle them. I think we should consider just getting rid of all three and start pricing everything in multiples of 1/4 dollars. There are some things, like gas, stocks, etc.. that may still need to be sold in smaller increments, but do those things really make the costs and effort of minting and handling pennies, nickels, and dimes, worth it?
