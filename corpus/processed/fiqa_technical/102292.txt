Softbank was really outclassed by Docomo a few years back until they became partners with Apple and the iphone. At first, Softbank couldn't give the phones away. But now they hold a much bigger market share because of the iphone. I still loves me some Docomo and the Galaxy III though. Unfortunately none of my friends have the same opinion :(
