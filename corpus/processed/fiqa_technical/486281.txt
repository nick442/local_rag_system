Exactly. I’ve heard people bitching about people saying there are no jobs. I literally heard someone say, “I see now hiring signs all over. There are jobs everywhere.” That’s not a job that you can live on. Making 10 bucks an hours at Barnes & Noble is good for a kid but not for an adult. What people need are jobs that require little to no skills but will teach them and pay them well in the meantime. Working at target is not going to be enough. We used to have a ton of low skill jobs in this county.
