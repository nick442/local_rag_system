> They can buy a jar and put coins in it. because that's all there is to shooting a cover shot for a top-rated magazine, right? Time buy a lot of stock. Companies buy stock out of convenience. If you wanted a pro photographer to photograph a jar of coins at sufficient quality for a high-end magazine cover, expect to pay in the region of $2-3000. $30 is way too low, but if that's the price he asked, that's the price they're gonna pay. Nobody asks a vendor if you can pay him more than the stated price.
