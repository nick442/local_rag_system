"just tried it and it worked well. However I would like to add more info to be precise: The above steps are correct between 1 and 5. And that's it. It works well, however HSBC says that ""your Credit Card balance won't be updated until the next working day"". Actually it took 2 days for them to process it and I called them perhaps I made a mistake but everything went good and now my balance is zero (so give 48hours for them). thank you for this write up ledeje."
