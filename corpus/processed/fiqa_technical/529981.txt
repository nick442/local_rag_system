In my experience, even if you are invaluable to the company, you won't be dutifully compensated or recognized. It is very rare that a company has a good enough performance assessment system that actually measures this with any measure of accuracy. The end result is that the only people compensated are those that make themselves close to management, AKA Brown Noses..
