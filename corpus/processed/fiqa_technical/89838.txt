They are. For example, they both have LTE equipment and labor contracts with Ericsson. The deal basically means that they can mass-order LTE network hardware from Ericsson, save on cost per unit, and ship them between Japan and the US as needed. Hardware that supports multiple frequencies does exist. Both carry the iphone and Sprint can help secure better devices for Softbank while Softbank can provide an easy way for OEMs, previously unknown in the US, to cross over. When Apple demands that carriers make large orders of iphones, Sprint and Softbank can both make the order and pass inventory between them. Language related issues are not a big deal these days.
