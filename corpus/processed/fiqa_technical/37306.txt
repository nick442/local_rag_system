"I used Quicken, so this may or may not be helpful. I have a Cash account that I call ""Temporary Assets and Liabilities"" where I track money that I am owed (or that I owe in some cases). So if I pay for something that is really not my expense, it is transferred to this account (""transferred"" in Quicken terms). The payment is then not treated as an expense and the reimbursement is not treated as income--the two transactions just balance out."
