"This line of thinking is wrong. You don't control time, you control place. The secret to winning is to ALWAYS BE OUT THERE. If you're constantly 24/7 selling your wares, you're going to get ""lucky"" and make a few great sales. Being at the right place at the right time means ALWAYS BEING IN NEW AND DIFFERENT PLACES UNTIL YOU HIT THE RIGHT TIME. This is why food trucks do so well. You travel until you hit the ""right place at the right time"". You can call this luck. Sure to some degree it is. But the real secret is just to work harder and longer than everyone else. That's how you get ""lucky""."
