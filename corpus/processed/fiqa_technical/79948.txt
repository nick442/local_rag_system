It's a pretty good tip. People are often telling you the answer but not explicitly. Example: You call about bad service and demand a refund. The employee tells you: I'm sorry, sir, I can't give you back your money. But maybe he actually said: I'm sorry, sir, *I* can't give you back your money. Maybe someone else can? I'm sorry, sir, I can't *give* you back your money. So not give but trade? I'm sorry, sir, I can't give you back your *money*. So what can you give?
