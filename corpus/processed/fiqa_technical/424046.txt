I think this is more like Uber's Stalingrad than Uber's downfall. Uber is fighting a war of attrition in every market at once. Early last year when they secured $3.5 billion in capital from the Saudi Sovereign Fund their victory appeared certain. Since the #DeleteUber campaign began, Uber's competition has raised over $10 billion (Didi $5.5b, Grab $2.0b, Lyft $1.6b, Ola $1.1b, etc.) while Uber has raised $0. Even if Uber closes that high profile $10 billion deal with SoftBank, it only gives Uber $1b in new capital. Uber is over-extended, and now is a good time for smaller companies to grab market share that Uber cannot defend.
