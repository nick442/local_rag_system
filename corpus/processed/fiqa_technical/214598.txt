"> In no way did I attempt to explain your experience. > This means that cross walks are abundant, sidewalks are clean (on **the specific area I am talking about**), and it isn't littered with garbage or broken glass. Recall my comments above ""They get used to walking in the street because of the poor conditions of the sidewalk. Debris, broken-glass, overgrown."" I will not that you have now added the conditional ""the specific area"". Previously it was "" our city is extremely clean, the sidewalks are perfect"". The conditions in the area where you drive through may not reflect the neighborhoods. If the residents are conditioned to not walk on the sidewalk in their own neighborhood, they probably won't walk on the sidewalk elsewhere. And if your neighborhoods are also extremely clean with perfect sidewalk, I would contend that they're not part of America's Poorer Neighborhoods.

Specifically the map [""Where Commuters Run Over Black Children on the Pointes-Downtown Track""](http://www.flickr.com/photos/50628274@N00/9451562183/) My pictures are from Detroit. One might drive down one street [and see this view](http://i.imgur.com/LojigNi.jpg) and believe the sidewalks are fine, not realizing that [this is the sidewalk on the crossing street](http://i.imgur.com/KH2GuoG.jpg). Edit: I took the pictures above, those are my lawn mowers and that is my car. Edit2: Coincidentally, the lawn mower in the nasty sidewalk photo has appeared in Governing [here](http://media.governing.com/images/870*580/03_+Detroit+198.jpg). That's not me."
