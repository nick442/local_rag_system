"Additionally, the original commenter I was responding to was making an argument that ""they don't make money therefore they're a failure"", which isn't a bad argument to make if you're talking about *revenue*. Companies that make no revenue are generally considered to be failures, so in that context, he would be correct to say ""they're a failure because they make no money"", and you wouldn't really need any other points to back up your argument. That being said, plenty of businesses, start-ups especially burn through more money than they make. The lack of profit doesn't necessarily make them a failure provided they are still generating revnue, which Tesla is, and a lot of it. So, if you'd like to have a discussion about whether they're making *enough* *revenue*, or whether they're poorly re-investing the *revenue* they are making, and how those factors might determine whether or not they should be considered a failure, then I'd be happy to participate. But if you're only interested in making replies that try to condecend to me because you're too quick to jump to conclusions about what I've written, then have at it I guess. Whatever floats your boat."
