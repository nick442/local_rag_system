You are permitted to withdraw the deposits from the Roth with no tax or penalty any time. To Dilip's point, the Roth is a good place to keep the investment, and what you might consider is a 'self-directed' account. This type of IRA or Roth IRA permits a choice of investments that are not typically handled by banks or brokers, including Real Estate and the type of Angel investing you seem to be considering. Note - the rules are tough, you need to be very careful to not be self-dealing, or dealing with certain related parties.
