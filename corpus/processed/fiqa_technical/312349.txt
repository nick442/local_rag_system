Making the company isn't what the fuss is about. Charging yourself 'fees' through that company so that you don't how to pay out the director whose contract is on the *net* of profits is what the fuss is about. I'm surprised that with millions of dollars on the line they don't sue, setting a precedent for these sham fees for all studios.
