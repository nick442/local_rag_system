Ah. See, this is where you have already misread me: > . . . you attempt to construct a government and a society around false economic morality. Why does morality have to be part of the actual solution? It doesn’t. Yet it can take into account moral values and immoral values. The solution SHOULD be utilitarian - use that which works. But not the utilitarian that throws out things that don’t quite work. No. It need to be a utilitarian method with foresight to see promise, and to understand the weakness of intolerance. Our current system is actually promoting separation, building its own downfall. A new system needs to actually be built to create unity through diversity, not for moral reasons, but for simple survival and growth. And no one said people weren’t paid. That was all you, bud. I was simply saying they were able to put aside differences and survive through major setbacks to accomplish great things. Sticking around during tough times requires either fear of the alternative, or a belief in the company or the goal. People are NOT always selfish.
