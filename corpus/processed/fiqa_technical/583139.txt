I'll be upfront with the fact that I don't personally like unions. That being said, I can see JaZepi's argument here, so I'll explain it with the usual caveat that I might be misunderstanding, and am not trying to assert that this is exactly what JaZepi meant. Unions aren't only effective when a job can't be done elsewhere. Picket lines give a company a black eye. Unions get news time, and can join together to spend real money on advertising in some cases.
