No Joke. The 9/11 terrorists stayed in short term rentals for a week before carrying out the attacks. These rentals were hotels. I think hotels are probably facilitating terrorism by offering terrorists short term rentals. The FBI should investigate their complicity in the 9-11 attacks. I think this ad is a deflection from their clear guilt and complicity in the 9-11 attacks.
