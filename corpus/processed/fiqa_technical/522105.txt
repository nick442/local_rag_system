Actually quite the opposite. I've had three PS3's in the last 2 years with a decent library of games to go with it. I just don't pretend that Sony is very innovative or even competent these days. They JUST got a decent online store going in the last 2 weeks with their Day One full games when that should have been priority at the launch. They've completely misunderstood and misinterpreted online culture because they've been pushing physical media Blu Ray so hard in the last few years and that has been their only real focus. The world already switched to digital distribution and now they are going to have a hell of a time play catch up. Edit: They've also neglected to capitalize on what they do have to a great extent like pushing a full library of ps2 games and cherry picking the re-releases of ps1 games. They don't own the properties, but they aren't exactly pushing their 3rd parties too hard about it either.
