No way, other genres have obsessive fans as adults - fantasy and sci-fi come to mind although I think things like t-shirts, mugs etc would do well for most popular films, people just don't wanna take the risk I guess. In Japan for example the anime industry lives off of obsessive (male, usually young adult) fans.
