Also from Chipotle's website: > It means that whenever possible we use meat from animals raised without the use of antibiotics or added hormones. Again, they aren't claiming to be organic just stating that they don't want to have pigs that are raised with antibiotics. You're putting the organic standard on them they're just saying they will do this whenever possible.
