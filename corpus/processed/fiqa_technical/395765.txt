College professor here. I often think about the fact that all the information I teach is available online. Students are paying a premium for my course- what of value do I bring? **Filter** There is a lot of good information online, but there is also a lot of inaccurate information. I filter out inaccurate information. **Structure** I organize material in a way that makes it easier to digest **Elaboration** I provide context and examples. I'm able to explain complex topics in several different ways in case students don't get it the first time. **Motivation** I explain *why* students need to learn something; I hold them accountable for deadlines. **Social interaction** I get students to talk with one another and see material from multiple view points. **Feedback** This is, in my opinion, the most valuable thing I provide to students, and I invest *a lot* of time in it. What are students doing well? What are they not doing well? How can they improve? This doesn't mean intelligent, motivated individuals can't learn from online materials as well as in a classroom- I believe they can. But the classroom environment does provide some advantages over teaching yourself material online.
