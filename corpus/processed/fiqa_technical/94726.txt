> The logic behind QE is as follows. A central bank, which alone has the power to create (and print) money, wants to spur inflation, so that companies will be encouraged to borrow money and invest it, creating jobs. That is not the logic of QE. The logic is that assets must remain inflated enough for banks to survive, and the rich, with the trading profits, made by trading ahead of central banks QE, will pump up other assets with their cashflow, and support banking solvency and profitability as they participate directly in the bond profits, and indirectly, by having their loans secured by general assets paid back due to asset inflation and stability. There was absolutely no honest hope of QE trickling down to the productive economy. No reason for new production, as its only effect is a few at the top that can afford bigger cars and homes. Bank stability helps jobs much better than bank failures, but its more about keeping investment/loan spigots flowing than about increasing production/investment demand.
