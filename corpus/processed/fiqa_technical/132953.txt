>the cost of not doing cyber security is nothing or at worst, a slap on the wrist. First off, that's not true. Companies have lost billions in sales after breaches. You might mean the legal penalty isn't huge, and that's somewhat true, but the market penalty is massive. HOWEVER, even if I was to grant you that, your answer is non-responsive to putting them out of business. Putting them out of business doesn't do any more than hurting their business badly.
