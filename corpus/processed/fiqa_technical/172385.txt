There is no 1 2 3 to being successful. Everyone's story is different but generally there is some composition of connections, networking, dedication and opportunity involved. Anyone offering easy steps to being financially successful is a scammer and anyone willing to buy into it is a chump. Go out and build a network, learn and offer product/service that has demand is the most general you can be.
