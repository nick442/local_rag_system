I appreciate having an attorney’s thoughts. Clearly, we have different optics. Mine is as a consumer, who has never actively sought out being a member of a class in a class action suit, but have had it foisted on me. In each case, the settlement was either a very nominal amount (e.g. $1.29) or a coupon or credit for future services from the company that allegedly had wronged me. In virtually each settlement, the attorneys got handsome fees and the firms were protected from future similar suits from anyone who had not gone through the process of opting out. In one case, however, I and all other members of the class (except the lead plaintiffs, I presume) were to get nothing, while the attorneys were to get literally a half a billon dollars. The notion was that members of the class had “eaten the evidence,” the same evidence that somehow justified $500,000,000 compensation to the lawyers. Of course you recognize that as the Subway/Foot Long Sub case, where Subway was guilty of the monumental crime of selling foot long subs that were not necessarily 12 inches long (oh, the horror). So let me ask you: From your optic, how do we protect consumers’ rights while eliminating the incentives for frivolous suits, or suits in which the consumer gets nothing of value? (And I include the “coupon setttlements” as consumers getting nothing of value, as they require the consumer to further patronize the perpetrator of the alleged wrong doing.).
