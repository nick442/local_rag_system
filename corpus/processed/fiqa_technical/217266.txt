In general, if this is in the United States, call your local bar association. Tell them you need a lawyer to help you collect a judgment. They will make a referral. The lawyer should know who can buy the judgment in return for cash. You don't need to give details to the bar association, but you should plan on giving more details to the lawyer about why you need the money. Since this is your ex-husband, your divorce lawyer might be able to help. It's unclear in your question whether you've already explored that option. The divorce lawyer might modify the divorce agreement to give you an asset instead of a monetary claim.
