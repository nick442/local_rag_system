Via PM: >FYI, I wasn't trolling. If you're going to be running your mouth about an involved, complex, controversial topic, I'd like you to be informed about it. You're obviously not, which isn't a bad thing -- why would you be? If you ever have any questions about electronic trading, I'll be happy to help. Look, chief. You're clearly butthurt that this marginally legal gravy train of free money will likely come to an end soon. But patronizing me isn't going to take that butthurt away. Feel free to have the last word, but please stay out of my PM inbox. Take care.
