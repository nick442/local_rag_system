"GRAS is a lot different from ""determined to be safe for consumption"" The former is a specific category of food additives and ingredients, the latter is based out of your conjecture and paranoia, especially comparing it with trans fats. At worst, the soy leghemoglobin is a potential allergen. If the impossible burger weren't ""safe for consumption,"" you wouldn't be able to buy it."
