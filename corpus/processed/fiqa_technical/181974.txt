Walmart can afford to pay more, they just choose not to because it's legal to keep their workforce underemployed. The profits Walmart posts every quarter exceed the drain on public services their employees create. What really grinds my gears is that paying an employee a fair wage tends to attract much more talented and dedicated workers who will be much more productive than the warm bodies currently running the place.
