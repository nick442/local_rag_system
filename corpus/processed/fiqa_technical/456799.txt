>how can one argue plastic's inability to store value comes artificially/by opinion? That's backwards. Gold's *ability* to store value is artificial. Plastic's value is naturally determined by the market. It's cheap to produce, and abundant. Therefore, the market dictates it's going to be cheap. Gold is artificially priced because it still retains many of its characteristics as a store of value for things unrelated to itself. People, for example invest in gold bullion, driving up the price. It's abundant, though costly to produce; yet its quantity and cost of production don't determine its price. Investors do. You don't see people investing in plastic bars.
