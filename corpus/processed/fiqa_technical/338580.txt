[Spectacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectacles_%28product%29) are glasses/sunglasses with a built in camera/video recorder, which look surprisingly un-bulky. The price is just around $120, so a bit pricey. You can get [a crappy kids spy version for only $60](https://www.amazon.com/SPY-NET-Stealth-Video-Glasses/dp/B004X4X3N0) for the last couple years. The price is probably worth it for the lightweight, more reasonable look, and probably better quality, but it is probably seen as just a novelty for most, which doesn't garner such a price point. Their focus on Snapchat also might have been narrowing to the market. (I had no clue and just looked into it myself. I got my kids one the spy glasses a few years ago.)
