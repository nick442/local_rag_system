> In the 1950s people talked about what we'd do with all our leisure time as a result of automation. But here we are 70 years later and we're still working 40-50 hours a week for the most part. True! Also before that, when the steam engine was invented, when the automatic mill was invented, when computers where invented, etc. But all those engines, machines and automation do not have intelligence. They just do repetitve work. Robots and AI is totally different thing. What job do you think only a human can do, but an intelligent robot can't?
