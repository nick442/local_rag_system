>Think about charging cables on your phone. Is there one kind? No. No one can agree on the standard. This is a bad example. There are a couple of different standards for phone charger cables, most use micro USB, Apple phones use lightning. Simple. >If you are ok with 1 chip, why not 3? Why not 5? There are a few different standards for RFID/NFC cards, the implantable chips are compatible with most of them. Many people do have more than one implant, it's quite common for people to implant one in each hand. >Do some of them track your location? Maybe? It depends what you mean by 'track your location'. There is no way to implant a chip inside a person that will let you remotely tell where they are like a GPS tracking device. They let you track someones location the same way any RFID door entry card does. Eg: Employee #372 entered lab 6F at 13:04.
