To charge money for investment advice the only prerequisite is the 65. Find out what licenses your father has. You can cover the 6, 63, 65, 66 and 7 with the 66 & 7. I would suggest: Life and Health, 66, 7, CFP. In that order. But you might also be able to get away with the L&H, 6 and 63 (this is more common among older product sales based advisors) to get up and running.
