Are you still in high school? The job these people perform are generally menial pencil pushing garbage. We don't need the best and brightest going there and we've never had it. These people hate their jobs like everyone else, but the jobs they do are almost unneeded. The reason they are supposed to get better benefits is because they are too stupid to plan for their future. If you don't believe that, perhaps you should get one of those jobs. It's like the better folks are looking out for the simpletons. And that is a fact.
