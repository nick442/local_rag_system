I think it's pretty clear they need a quality smart phone line since that's almost all people are buying anymore. I don't know why they aren't making Android phones other than the market is already saturated and it's hard to stand out. The Windows Phone is almost certainly their best bet, but can they hang in there until MS's push to the win8 platform. If they can I expect the Windows Phone to do very well. Most Joe Consumers will be like OH well I have windows at home so I know that, and I doubt it will be any less intuitive than the Android interface or any more boring than the iPhone interface.
