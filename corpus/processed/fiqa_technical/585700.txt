"Maybe. I've been applying to jobs that require things like SQL and high level excel. I have some experience with these but I kept getting passed over for ""more qualified candidates"" so I get the sense there is a surplus of overqualified candidates, not recent college graduates. Also Linkedin stats will sometimes show as high as 50% of applicants having graduate degrees. And again this is for entry level business/data analyst positions. IMO the job market feels absolutely saturated with qualified candidates. I am looking around the NYC area however so maybe that just comes with the territory."
