"So you being born where you were with the opportunities you were given, just because you made the most of them you feel that luck wasn't any part of it? And a child born in a very poor, impoverished location without those opportunities should be expected to succeed just as well as you, and if they didn't then that means they just ""didn't work as hard as you""? I'm sorry, but fuck everything about that sentiment. Sure, you worked hard, pat yourself on the back. But dismissing everyone else in the world simply because you think they just didn't work as hard as you completely misses the Lewis' point. You were lucky to even have those opportunities, you should at the very least be thankful that you were given those opportunities."
