Honestly, having seen their trial and cancelation process, it seems they're betting that the Planet Fitness model will work for cinema tickets. It's cheap enough that it seems like a great deal, but in practice most people won't even see a movie a month and won't bother to cancel. Every time I've been about to sign up for a subscription cinema ticket, I've challenged myself to actually go to the cinema at least twice a month for 3 months. I always drop off!
