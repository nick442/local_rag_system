Walmart's success is built on the backs of these so called low skill workers. Last time I checked Walmart was making huge profits every quarter so maybe the people who are doing all of the hard work deserve a living wage. Also there are several trained skills Walmart employees have. For example to work in produce and the deli you have to be trained in safe food practices. A Walmart employee also has to have time management skills. Employees are often are assigned multiple tasks in several departments. Also the computer systems must be learned. If I handed you a telzon I doubt you would be able to check to see if an item was in stock and if it wasn't how to order a new one. Also anyone can be a cashier but can anyone be a fast efficient cashier. You are also putting your body at risk especially when you are tasked with unloading trucks or stocking shelves. Several of my ex coworkers have work related injuries the most common are bad knees, backs, and shoulders. In short if every Walmart worker in the nation went on strike Walmart would find it impossible to find enough skilled workers to fill their rolls. Sure they could replace them easily but it would take months for the new employees to learn the necessary skills and while they are learning Walmart would have incredibly long lines and lots of unsatisfied customers.
