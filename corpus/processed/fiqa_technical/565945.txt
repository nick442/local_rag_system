I don't know about the Saudi part of your point, but generally these are estimations based on the ownership stake of X person's main enterprise (e.g. Amazon, Microsoft, Berkshire). Even if Bezos made millions one year investing in, whatever, McDonald's franchises, it's a rounding error compared to his ~$80bn stake in Amazon, so they don't need pour over tax returns to get exact info.
