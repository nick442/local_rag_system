"This equation fails to account for a society's willingness to create value. If you steal from those who create value and give to those who do not, you destroy the engine that creates value in the economy. This redistribution idea is not a new concept, and it has already massively failed. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921%E2%80%9322 > The Bolshevik government had requisitioned supplies from the peasantry for little or nothing in exchange. This led peasants to drastically reduce their crop production. According to the official Bolshevik position, which is still maintained by some modern Marxists, the rich peasants (kulaks) withheld their surplus grain to preserve their lives;[6] statistics indicate that most of the grain and the other food supplies passed through the black market.[7][8][9] The Bolsheviks believed peasants were actively trying to undermine the war effort. The Black Book of Communism asserts that Lenin ordered the seizure of the food peasants had grown for their own subsistence and their seed grain in retaliation for this ""sabotage"", leading to widespread peasant revolts. -- > In July 1929 it remained official Soviet policy that the kulak should not be terrorised and should be enlisted into the collective farms. Joseph Stalin disagreed with this, saying, ""Now we have the opportunity to carry out a resolute offensive against the kulaks, break their resistance, eliminate them as a class and replace their production with the production of kolkhozes and sovkhozes.""[13] > On 30 January 1930 the Politburo approved the dissolving of kulaks as a class. Three separate categories for the kulaks were designated: The first consisted of kulaks to be sent to the Gulags, the second was for kulaks to be relocated to distant parts of the USSR (such as the north Urals and Kazakhstan), and the third to other parts of their province.[14] > As part of being forced onto collective farms, the peasantry were required to relinquish their farm animals to government authorities. Many peasants chose to slaughter their livestock rather than give them to collective farms. In the first two months of 1930, peasants killed millions of cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, and goats, with the meat and hides being consumed and bartered. For instance, the Soviet Party Congress reported in 1934 that 26.6 million head of cattle had been lost, and 63.4 million sheep.[15] In response to the widespread slaughter, the Sovnarkom issued decrees to prosecute ""the malicious slaughtering of livestock"" (хищнический убой скота).[16] > Stalin requested severe measures to put an end to the kulak resistance. In 1930, Stalin declared: > In order to oust the 'kulaks' as a class, the resistance of this class must be smashed in open battle and it must be deprived of the productive sources of its existence and development. .. That is a turn towards the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class."
