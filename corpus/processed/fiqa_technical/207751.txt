"Automation, starting from steam engines (most hard labor is gone), mechanical looms (there goes all fabrics made by hand), cars (there goes horses and buggies), computers (there goes most clerical work), still have not cause catastrophic unemployment today. New jobs and new industries were invented instead. But, I agree: with robots and AI, it will not be easy to find new things for people to do, especially most people who are not very skilled and educated. **So, the solution MUST BE restrictions on the use of Robots and AI.** For example, all interaction with people (customer service) must be done by humans. Or, every group of robots working must be supervised by a human. But no limits on Robots and AI when it comes hard-labor and basic work: agriculture, yard maintenance, cleaning, etc - they can be done by Robots without any restrictions. In any case, the costs of running a business will be so much lower as almost all the undesired work is done by robots, so people can create and have more and more specialized businesses and services. P/S1: We need to restrict Robots and AI for other reasons too. For example, we can't have a country or a person have a robotic army to kill other people. But mostly, if we do not restrict, people will become lazy, spoiled and mindless. P/S2: Some people are unemployable in a future society: not bright enough, not reliable enough, mental issues or disabled. For them, I can see Basic Income as the only solution. **P/S3: read the science fiction book ""Dune"" by Frank Herbert, of a future society where ""thinking machines"" are not allowed, and the reasons why they were not allowed. I will let you guess why they were not allowed.**"
