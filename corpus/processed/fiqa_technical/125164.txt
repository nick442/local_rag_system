Two kinds of lending going on. The first occurs when the Federal Reserve purchases government securities. This creates reserves at the Federal Reserve in another bank. The second kind of lending comes when this bank lends out the money. This is the multiplier effect. The reason for the excess reserves now is that banks are gun-shy and afraid to lend. Their money is safer at the Fed than with commercial and personal borrowers. When this changes (either by a recovery, or by the Fed penalizing banks for excess reserves, which it can do but hasn't) then we'll see inflation, and a consequential rise in prices.
