There is already large demand for new jobs. There is also a large labor supply available for jobs. When the buyer (employer) meets the price of the seller (employee), a job is created. The reason there is not 100% employment is that not every employee is willing to work for what they can get, and not every employer is willing to pay what an employee is willing to work for.
