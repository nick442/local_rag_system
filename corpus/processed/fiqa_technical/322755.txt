Man.. I feel like this is a messed up world where your comment is downvoted and the guy who added the 100k in loans is upvoted. I didn't get into the engineering program at the school I wanted to go to so I went to community college for a year got good grades and transferred into the college I wanted to get my degree from. Spent 3 years working part time while getting my degree and graduated with 16k in loans and a job waiting for me. I don't know why this can't be normal. I'm obviously not some genius, I couldn't even get into the school originally.. I just worked a little harder than I was working before because that's what it took.
