> Not to mention that pnl is really all you have to judge a trader Annnnd this is how I know your only experience is retail trading. Voice trading still represents a large amount of volume in the market (especially in OTC products) and having existing relationships is a guarantee for better points. I see the reality of this every fucking day. Not to mention traders performance is also susceptible to in house analysis and risk management.. both of which at a major firm are determined and managed by different individuals (research and risk officers). It's not like Two Sigma welcomes you in, gives you a $500 mio FI portfolio and lets you do whatever the fuck you want. Hedge fund traders operate under the strategy that was profiled to the investors. Traders are there to execute profit earning transactions within the guidelines of the overall strategy of the firm and within their risk profile.. Meaning if you're managing a pension fund on a global macro strategy at one firm and achieve moderate returns of 15-20%, you're going to be viewed far more favorably than at another firm making 20-25% managing an alternative investments/listed derivatives fund.
