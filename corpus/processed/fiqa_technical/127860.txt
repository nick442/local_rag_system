What?! Did you read my comments about verifying information? You have turned it into vilifying sources. If we want to vilify sources, just take a look at the crap the news pulls every day. The other day I was watched big an interview on Fox News that asked,”How will the Republican Tax Break affect students?” The guy responded about how he wants to help students but never once mentioned how the Tax Breaks would affect them. The interviewer never called him on it, and moved on as if the guy had answered the question! At least comedy doesn’t pretend to care. I voted for who I wanted, and I didn’t vote for Hillary and Trump.
