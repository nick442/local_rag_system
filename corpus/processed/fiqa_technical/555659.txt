You cannot really help someone who doesn't want to help themselves. Show me an addict who is suffering and asking for help; trying to hard to stop, and I'll help. But to the addict that is sitting on the bench drooling with needle mark on the arm, they are a lost cause until they decide they are ready for help. You do you, if you want to take your hard earned money and help those that I deem 'unworthy' by all means do it. If it makes you feel good who am I too stop you. However, don't turn your optional charity into forced taxation.
