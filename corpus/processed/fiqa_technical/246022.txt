They're not. Literally by definition and existence. Cow milk is designed by nature to grow a baby calf to a four-legged, 800+ lb beast of a creature. A human baby has its own, natural, species-correct source of this kind of sustinence. As an adult human (or any human for that matter) there is no reason to consume what is effectively mass growth hormones and steroids from a species that is not yours. Would you breast feed off of a cow? Would you let your child? Why not?
