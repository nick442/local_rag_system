Ya BK is definitely not the enemy here. It was a smart business decision and if the US doesn't want to lost key businesses and industries to overseas they need to work with companies to come up with a tax structure that's realistic rather than charging damn near half for the top tier marginal rate and calling companies unAmerican for wanting to leave.
