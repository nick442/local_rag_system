I honestly can't believe two million people care enough to pay 12.95 per month and is that a recurring charge? Wouldn't you just get your family tree and then never visit the site again? I'll be honest and say I don't know their business model well and I can't see myself ever being interested enough in investing in it to bother to figure it out.
