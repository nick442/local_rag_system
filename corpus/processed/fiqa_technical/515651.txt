The benefits Apple offers are pretty amazing. 15% discount on stock (you can allocate up to 10% of your paycheck to stock purchases). 25% 401K matching (apple matches 25%. You can allocate up to 25% of your paycheck to the company 401k). Excellent health/vision/dental/etc benefits to anyone working 30 hours a week or more. Employees are usually given an iPhone or iPod to have, so that they are seen by customers using Apple products. Best Buy and Staples probably don't do all of these things for their salespeople.
