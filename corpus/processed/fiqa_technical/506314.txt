I am from the US so I can’t speak most of your questions, but I did work in the UK for a few months and did a good amount of networking while in London. I would use LinkedIn searches and just message people at firms I wanted to work for. 90% of the time they never respond, but it’s a numbers game and you have to keep going for it. PM me if you want to talk in more details about it!
