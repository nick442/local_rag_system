The latest version of Office for Mac is much improved, but still falls well short of the Windows version. Biggest issue is keyboard shortcuts - they are all either different or missing. Everything takes soooo much longer to do manually. Plugins are also another issue. The MS charts are horrible and I can't find a good charting plugin for Macs. You can build models on a Mac, and I sometimes do, but if you do a lot of serious modelling you'd be well advised to install Windows.
