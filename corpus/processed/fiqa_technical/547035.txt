Overall level of debt doesn't matter what matters is debt to cash flow or economic reasources. Sure debt is higher now, but so is GDP. Debt to cash flow looks healthy in the government (ex PR, IL, etc.), consumer, banking, and corporate sectors of the economy. I think your falling for the Representativeness behavioral finance bias. Just because the last two crashes were caused by major bubbles doesn't mean the next market downturn will be. Prior to the tech bubble the US economy didn't experience this type of boom and bust economy caused by asset bubbles. I think you have to consider (my baseline) that we may just be in a slow nominal growth environment with modest inflation. This may continue for several years if so the Feds terminal fed funds rate may be lower than historical rates. If that's the case investors should be willing to pay more for each unit of earnings i.e. Higher than historic valuations. I could be wrong, but that's the baseline I'm most comfortable given all the facts that I see.
