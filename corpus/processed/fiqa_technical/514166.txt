I'm with you, it is my favorite fast food joint. I travel around North America often and it is the place where I get the best value at the best price. Burger King is gross, I've given it enough chances. The Big King.. ewww. Taco Bell always leaves me disappointed. The other US chains (Jack In The Box or Hardys) also somehow end up in a greasy mess. But McDonald's has been consistent.
