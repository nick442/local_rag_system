> ES_F June today the most recent 5 min bar has 809 volume. while the september has 10616 volume on the same bar. on my rolled over contract, the ratio based adjustment has happened last week (9 bus days prior to expiration) > 1. Commision p/l should be subtracted as actual actual. absolutely BUT, initially, it is interesting to see if there's a good positive bias in the strategy. then we check whether comm/slippage eats it all. if so we try to play it in an index/etf whatever that charges less c&s/. agree ?
