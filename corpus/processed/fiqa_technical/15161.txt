What's the future of oil and its economic impact. 1. On one side, it's nice that some countries have decided to ban gas powered cars in 20 or so years along with the likes of Tesla and home solar power having some success. 2. But, we still need plastics and possibly a host of other chemicals produced from petroleum - so there will be demand, but of a smaller (?) or different kind. 3. There would be a huge upheaval (I imagine) in the industries in the current oil supply chains and also countries (Saudi Arabia for e.g.) and the global/ middle eastern politics too (?).
