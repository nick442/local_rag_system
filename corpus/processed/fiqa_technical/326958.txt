No, it's not a joke. Single women don't have families yet, and married men are more stable than their single counterparts who are chasing tail and partying more. Women are going to get pregnant and have families, it's unavoidable. At least the single woman doesn't have that YET. And frankly, men should be taking paternity leave as well as women, so that's a moot point.
