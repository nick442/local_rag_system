>Many of the people who under-estimate TV do not realize the amount of money, talent, research, staff and infrastructure needed to produce top-level high-quality shows and programming. >It is easy to stream a TV show or movie AFTER it's been already produced and broadcast, but do you really think the internet will give us a Mad Men, LOST, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones? I highly doubt it, and that's a big reason why TV is here to stay. I agree, I don't think the industry will die. It'll definitely continue to undergo fundamental changes, but at the end of the day, they're still making content people want to pay for. So conglomerates like TWX, DIS, CBS, and VIA are probably not the way to play this. Maybe betting against the local broadcast stations would be a better bet, I think names like GCI own both local tv networks AND newspapers.
