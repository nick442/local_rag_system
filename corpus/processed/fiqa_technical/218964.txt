I have a couple of questions regarding Bank Loans. 1.) can they ever trade above par? From my understanding, most get called due to refinancing. 2.) if a bank loan has a floor attached to it that's tied to LIBOR, say 100bps, and that floor is pierced, does the floor automatically disappear, or does that specific loan need to be refinanced before the floor can be done away with? Additionally, should an investor be more cautious when investing in a bank loan without a floor? With regard to the second half of my question, I would think an investor would demand a higher yield without the assurance of a floor.
