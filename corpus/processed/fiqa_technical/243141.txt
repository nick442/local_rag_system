"It's funny seeing people freak out about budget cuts. ""dismantling our institutions"" lol. The government shutdown a few years back. In order for people to ""feel"" it, Obama shut down national parks and monuments. Just so people would notice! Believe it or not, we could do away with a lot of government organizations. Issue is politicians propagandize people into thinking our core institutions are under threat if there are budget cuts."
