"No, not really. Frankly, I hate buying tools from those places. They're adequate, but nothing that I expect to last that long, much less pass down to my kids. Their power tools bear the names of great makers, but are often shittier versions designed to sell in big box stores. I've burned through so many shitty tools from places like that, but still have 30 year old power tools from Craftsman. Home Depot or Lowes are the ""ug, fine"" of hardware stores."
