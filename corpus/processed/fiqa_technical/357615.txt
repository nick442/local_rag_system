I stopped paying that $1000/year charge for cable seven years ago. Today I watch about an hour of television a week. Some weeks I will watch one sports game. Meanwhile I've been able to spend on the order of $10,000 for healthier, more productive activities. I've noticed that people don't talk about what they watched on television much anymore, so I'm not missing out on social interactions.
