Keep in mind that if you do agree to an exclusive sales agreement that your business will be at the mercy of the retailer. They say you cut your price 10%? you do it because you have no choice. They want you to take back unsold inventory? You do it because you have no other choice. Good luck ever raising prices as well. Depending on what you are manufacturing you could also be at the risk of the retailer white labelling your product in china and under cutting you. Not saying it's an entirely bad idea, just be careful
