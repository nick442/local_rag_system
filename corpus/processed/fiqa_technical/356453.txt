"Last week I dropped and shattered the screen on my Nexus 4. For a quick replacement I bought a brand new unlocked Moto E from amazon for $129. I forgot that Google bought Motorola, until my new phone came and had a screen protector that had ""Motorola, a Google company"" printed on it. The phone is damn nice for a budget model, as it's unlocked, doesn't have any carrier crapware preinstalled, and is running android 4.4 vanilla. It even has gorilla glass. What it's missing is a front facing camera, or a flash for the rear one. But one thing I like better than my nexus is that it has a micro SD card slot so I was able to add 32gb to the built in 4gb. Overall it's a really nice phone, and for only $129 compares to the $400 I paid for the nexus 4 a year and a half ago, I'm quite pleased with it."
