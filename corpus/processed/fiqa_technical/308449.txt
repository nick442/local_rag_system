I have better things to do with my life than spend awhile looking up class offerings, times, and schedules at UIC to prove you wrong. What I do have time for, however, is supply advice to this person who asked a question. My advice to him, as someone who has gone through a CS program, is to get started early. Classes bump into each other later. I can tell you in mine, Programming 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> data structures -> Languages -> algorithims was a chain that you could not break. two of those classes were only offered at certain times. It looks like pretty much all of those classes are offered at UIC and I would expect it to be pretty much the same. Once again please stop assuming that the degree is like finance and it's spread out and wide. CS is an ENTIRELY different beast as it goes much deeper into building on its foundations.
