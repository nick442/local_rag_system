I apologize to you too :) the first comment I made I thought was pretty funny so I felt a little surprised when I saw it the next day. Yeah, China has improved and most people who have office jobs or are small business owners play. Apple actually tried to use the hunger tactic of selling iPhones, they would release them in every country then finally starve china so when it's released everyone flocks. Then Chinese people mini revolted and apple lost like 2 billion or smt, and had to apologize. Mob rule is pretty powerful sometimes ;) Where in Australia did you live? I was in the Gold Coast before also moving to the states.
