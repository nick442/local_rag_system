Do you work with low-skilled employees? Specifically, do you ever have to manage them? I am going to make the assumption that you do not based on the comments you are making. It is impossible to say ALL of anything is a certain way. I'm not suggesting that at all. I'm going to specifically talk about averages. It seems like you've never been around the average. The average minimum wage employee doesn't have a high school education. It is fairly safe to say that they continuously are not developing skills that provide value both to themselves and others. If a person refuses to provide more for society, should society fill the gap? You suggest that people who are poor didn't get there because of their own right. Are people who are self-made millionaires (on average) good with finances? Why would that be? If yes, why do you assume those that are successful are so because of their own merit but cannot be blamed for failure? Seattle is a nice place. My exterior painter is doing a job there right now. It's a 3 month job. He is painting 1,000 apartments. He took 7 guys with him that he pays around $1,750 a week plus room and board. He had to take 7 guys with him because he can't find workers up in Washington. Can you imagine that? People in Seattle have not developed the skill of exterior painting. That's the reality of your job market. Even further, companies do have massive incentives to move to cheaper locations. The starting salary of large corporations varies wildly based on cost of living. Goldman Sachs will offer nearly $100k a year starting to work in the NYC branch compared to $65-70k in Houston.
