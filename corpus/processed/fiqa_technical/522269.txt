How is suggesting to them that they smoke cannabis instead of taking addictive pills that destroy lives a bad thing? There is a huge opiate crisis in the country. It's a massive problem where I live. We don't have a cannabis problem. People who think the choice of an addict not getting high and getting high are fooling themselves if they think 99% of addicts are going to choose sobriety. That's like preaching abstinence only education. Kids are going to fuck. In places where medical marijuana has been introduced the use of opiates plummets because they go for whatever drug is the path of least resistance. What I recommend is that people who are addicted to opiate and can't get off of them because they want the high, but the high keeps them physically addicted is that they replace that high with something that doesn't keep them physically addicted. That isn't calling them weak or stupid or any other thing with a negative connotation that you've concocted in your head that I didn't say. It's smart and it works in places where that is an option.
