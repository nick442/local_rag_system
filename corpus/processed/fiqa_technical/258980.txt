> There was good logic at the time, if Microsoft wanted Windows on a tablet, then they had to make a version of Windows for the RT chipset. No, they didn't - *Intel released an Atom phone a month later.* That sort of thing doesn't happen by surprise. Intel would've been hammering out the chipset for most of a year and selling it to Xolo for months. Microsoft must've known Android/x86 phones were coming, and yet still plodded along with their asinine plan for three separate versions of Windows that looked interchangeable but had no software in common.
