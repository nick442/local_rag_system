">It's secret so that it can't be torpedoed by politics while in the negotiation process. That argument is dissected quite well in this article about ISDS.: [Commission ISDS reform plan is an echo chamber of business views](http://corporateeurope.org/international-trade/2014/07/commission-isds-reform-plan-echo-chamber-business-views) These deals are NOT about trade, they are about the big corporate donors getting things - lots of bad things- which they could never get in legislation. A laundry list of very bad deals for the people of all these countries all rolled into one. The previous trade negotiator admitted that they were secret because there are lots of things in there which the American people would not want. For example, all three of the ""agreements"" contain provisions that effectively make real single payer health care impossible. That will limit state efforts to ones that lose lots of money. They try to freeze all ew chemical and environmental regulations, overruling state laws and chemical disclosure food safety, and labeling requirements. They try to continue to deregulate banks and fiancial instruments, increasing the risks not just of disasters - also of disasters that the US taxpayer will be asked to pay for. I'm now hearing something about new traps which will send much of the whelling and dealing to London, however they could still put the US taxpayer on the hook for their huge losses - of EU banks, similar to the Cyprus and the EU situation.
