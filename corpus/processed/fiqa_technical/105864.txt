As a parent of under 13 year old kids, I think it could possibly be a great idea. As long as there are appropriate parental controls (the article mentions allowing parents to control who their kids can friend), it could be a great way to introduce kids to online interaction in a slow, safe way. I think it'd be cool to allow kids to have a limited facebook accounts that lets them exchange messages, pictures, etc. with their grandparent, cousins, etc.
