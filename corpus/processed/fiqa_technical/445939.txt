There's two types of categories at play that define currency types - but I think the first is more like what you are after. The first is there are essentially three currency types now recognised - see them described here: http://finance.mapsofworld.com/money/types/ The second is currencies can be categorised by the type of economy from which they are generated (reserve/commodity/etc) - see them described here: http://www.forextraders.com/learn-forex-trading-course/major-currency-pairs.html
