> all the ports for slave trade were on the far West horn There was an eastern slave trade as well which was actually much larger than the western slave trade. There were several ports for the slave trade up and down the entire eastern side of Africa. Regardless, a better analogy would have been Madagascar. When Africans first settled there in ~1000AD, they ran into a native population (originally from SE Asia) similar to how the Europeans ran into Native Americans. Now, Madagascar may be doing slightly better than Zimbabwe, but it's still doing pretty poorly.
