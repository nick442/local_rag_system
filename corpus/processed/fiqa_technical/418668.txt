Sales talent is very rare. The sales process for B2B is not like your door to door vacuum cleaner sales man. Usually, procurement puts out a sale for bid. Sales teams have to compete against one another for the business. Usually, its a 4-5 vendors competing for one spot. One team eats, the rest go hungry.
