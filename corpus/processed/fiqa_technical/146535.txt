I think what ended up happening with this is the canadian banks issued some high risk debt that is in line with the bail-in requirements. So the interest payments are more, but they could lose it all in a bail-in situation. There was actually some debate about the sale of the debt not being fairly handled, but from the sounds of it the notes sold pretty quickly. So there doesn't seem to be much risk to depositors and investors don't seem to be worried about the additional risk. Also at the time of the banks becoming compliant with the Basel regulation I think most of them jacked their service fees to help with raising the additional capital requirements. http://business.financialpost.com/2014/07/21/rbc-responds-to-complaints-about-issue-of-nvcc-subordinated-debt/
