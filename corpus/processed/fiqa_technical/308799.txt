> You make it sound like consumers literally have no choice in the matter. That's absurd. In a way, people don't. Have you ever wondered why M&Ms are so brightly colored. The reason is simple: to get you to eat more. [Studies have shown that mixing colors together gets us to eat 23% more](https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Influence_of_Assortment_Structure.pdf). I don't think you would suggest that the average person would choose to eat 23% more sugar just because it was presented well. There is no rational reason for this result so it can't be a matter of conscious choice. Hell, even [our sitting president is a testament to the fact that facts don't matter, emotion sells](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/20/trump-supporters-became-the-media-by-privileging-emotions-over-facts_partner/). > The fact that many people don't make an effort to be responsible consumers is no one else's fault. But it is. Let's go back to Amazon. How many of those product reviews are written by corporate shills? How many descriptions and pictures deliberately mislead the consumer? How many products and apps submit you to Amazon if you're going to give a 4 or 5 start rating? > It's really not hard to control the impulse to buy a tabloid or a snickers bar. If that were true, then those impulse buy racks would not exist.
