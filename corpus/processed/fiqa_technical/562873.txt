I can say with 99% certainty that you are a consultant of some kind. Am I correct? You are using the same arguments as my consultant friends trying to tell me that this research is too vague and open. I appreciate your your viewpoint, but you too are aware of many CEO's that operate in markets for us financially mortal people. Ryan O'Leary (Ryanair), Oprah Winfrey (magazine/tv-show), Richard Branson (any Virgin service). I agree that most people will not know who the CEO is in most instances is. But I don't buy your argument that it has to be in the multi $1,000's for people to know the CEO. Look at Anita Roddick (Body Shop). That is why I want to explore this particular field. Regardless of who the CEO is, I want to see if the CEO's displayed behaviour will affect a consumer in his/hers decision making process.
