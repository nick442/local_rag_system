It could be that your friend is being scammed into recruiting you as another victim. So it is vaguely possible that this isn't malicious on their part. However, it is a scam if they are asking for your credit card info without a completely clear and good reason it's necessary. Which they have failed to do. That is reason enough to assume it's a scam, illegal, or both. Run. And seriously consider whether these are really people you can trust on anything, never mind money. At best they're gullible.
