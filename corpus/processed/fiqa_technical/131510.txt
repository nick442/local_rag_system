An idiot wrote that story. Right out of the gate they are plain wrong. Interns must be paid (federal law) unless they are SOLELY learning and not performing any work to the benefit of the company. The author should have at least researched one fact. Any fact would have done fine. It's a purely ignorant article. Source: I've owned multiple business for the last 20 years.
