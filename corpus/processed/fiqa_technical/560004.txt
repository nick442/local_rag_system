"Actually, I use SwagBucks (main site) all the time now. It's not a coupon site, but it is a site that I use to save money. For someone like me who does a lot of searching, the ""SwagBucks"" add up pretty fast and can be exchanged for gift cards. The Amazon ones are the best deal ($5 account credit for 450 SwagBucks), and I get one or two a month. I avoid coupon printer programs, because of how they ""install"" on your computer."
