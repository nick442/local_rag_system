Basically the banks (Countrywide was the worst about this) failed to uphold lending standards when they were giving out mortgages because it wasn't in their self-interest-- after the banks would give someone a mortgage the banks would make their fees off the mortgage and then bundle these mortgages into securities. The banks then had these sub-prime mortgages that are now bundled together as securities, then Moody's/S&P and other ratings agencies gave them AAA ratings despite nearly everyone in the industry knowing they were time-bombs waiting to go off. Goldman Sachs and everyone else knew what was going on, but they didn't want to get stuck holding the bag, per se, so they committed fraud by knowingly misleading their clients to buy these securities. The problem isn't that we need more regulations-- it's that the regulations we have aren't even being enforced. Obama has prosecuted 1/3 as many financial crimes at Bush/Clinton/Reagan.
