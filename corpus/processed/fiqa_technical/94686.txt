"I am not an expert in this stuff, but my understanding is that the debt is in the form of US treasury securities, which mature at set rates and are paid at maturation. So technically, the US Treasury ""pays off"" a portion of its debt whenever the debt securities mature. Thus, if China (or any country) buys new Treasury securities at a slower rate than its currently held Treasury securities are maturing, the amount of US debt held by China will decrease. This is what I hear China has been doing recently."
