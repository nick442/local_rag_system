>My issue understanding this is I've been told that banks actually don't hold 10% of the cash and lend the other 90% but instead hold the full 100% in cash and lend 900%. Is this accurate? That's the money multiplier effect being poorly described. Okay, then it makes total sense as long as that description is not accurate/ poorly described. That description is what just *effectively* happens, spread out between all the banks, assuming that everything legally possible is loaned out? Another way of saying it would be a bank can loan $9 out for every $10 deposited to it. It *cannot* loan out $90 for every $10 deposited.
