You may find it difficult to remove the PMI under any circumstances, banks will give you the run-around for quite a while hoping you get bored and continue to pay it. We got rid of ours by refinancing with a different bank, but at the time it was possible to get the new bank to pay all the fees if you worked through the right people, now it may be worth it to just keep fencing with the bank in the hopes that you run into someone with a little decency.
