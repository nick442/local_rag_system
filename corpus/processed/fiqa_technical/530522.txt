Alright I'll bite. You haven't defined what starting a company means. I can do that without a product technically. Let's start by defining success. Do I need to sell one thing or a billion? Profit ok or just revenue? Now let's define what hard is. Is it lots of hours? Lots of dollars? Is it using the skills from a degree that I worked hard for? You're making blanket statements which have no boundaries. The amount of effort people put into starting successful companies ranges wildly. If my dad gave me a billion dollars and I started an unprofitable company then technically I've met your parameters. Easy! I guarantee that's happened more than 5 times. Flappy birds was a successful company. Relative to uber it was easy. Relative to scratching my balls and playing Xbox all day it was hard. Can you see why I'm mocking this conversation?
