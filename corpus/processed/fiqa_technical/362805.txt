I worked in constituent affairs. A normal day for me ranges from finding low-income homes, handling unemployment insurance checks that get held up, finding open rehab centers for people who are having trouble finding treatment centers. Is it remotely connected to a court case? Now I have to find a way that is completely sterile from the legal proceedings. Do I give help to the one person calls who is being kicked out of their home in 4 days and is sick, or do I have to find some shelter for the people with children first? I love my job, but pray tell, with my 28,000 a year salary, what special privilege do I get by trying to maximize assistance for people with minimal resources? I am interested to hear this so I can go to work and demand them.
