Yes, for sure. I always like to be called out on incorrect opinions. I've written business blogs for 5-6 years now - on topics ranging from investing to industry to wellness - and it's really helpful to get feedback on my thinking. While I consider myself pretty knowledgeable, there are other very smart people out in the world who can sometimes adjust my thinking.
