Easy answer -- pay down your debt. Why easy? Because you can't afford the house. The other posters mentioned it; I'll tackle it too: Your $1445/month mortgage payment estimation is just that - mortgage only. Why haven't you included home insurance or taxes? According to that last graphic, those are $1930 and $1910 per year. That adds $320 to your monthly cost. $1445 + $320 = $1765/month. More than what you're paying in rent, and you say you have little enough left over after that. And that's not counting CMHC insurance like Chris W. Rea mentioned, or maintenance, which is something renters always underestimate. I know I did. And don't even get me started on the fact that the (currently super low) interest rate is fixed for only 5 years. I know you really, really want to buy a house, and you really want to stay in that expensive area you live in. And you're trying hard to make the numbers work. But the fact is, you're setting yourself up for bankruptcy. Realistically, you have these options: 1) stay in the area, forget buying for the foreseeable future, continue renting, pay down debt and then save for a proper down payment 2) stay in the area, but make a smaller, cheaper place work 3) move to a cheaper location 4) figure out how to make more money. That's it. Sorry to be blunt; this is the reality.
