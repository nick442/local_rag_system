Fair point. I think malpractice insurance is more to protect the patient than the doctor, even though the doctor pays the premiums The government requires it so they can't kill or injury a patient and then just declare bankruptcy without paying damages. If claims were allowed for negligence that insurer would be creating what's known as a moral hazard issue and there would essentially be nothing stopping corporations/executives from constantly screwing over the public. That insurer would be bankrupt in no time.
