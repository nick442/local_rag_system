The core idea behind this statement is that there is always money for what you prioritize. If you try to use whatever is left over after your bills for savings, you probably won't save very much if anything. In practice, you decide on a fixed amount of money you will save out of each paycheck and put that aside in an investment or savings account, then pay your bills out of what is left. Essentially it is a way to counteract the tendency of your lifestyle rising to exactly meet your income and leaving nothing for savings.
