In addition to being hauled before Congress, Mylan agreed in October to pay $465 million to settle federal allegations that it falsely classified EpiPen to overcharge Medicaid.

The government let's them do this and the taxpayer get fucked and then pays part of the fine for fucking them. The tax code needs to be rewritten such that any settlement with the government over misconduct is entirely off limits for deduction.
