No a better way to word that is saying I won't invest in ford solely because he wants a 40 hour work week. Yeah sure environmental responsibility plays a role but at the end of the day it's about value. There are a ton of environmentally friendly companies out there should we invest in all of them too? If I created a company out of thin air that installed solar panels would you said that what I do is a huge thing so it should be valued a lot? Without looking at the financials of the company? Come on I'm not even really knowledgeable in business or finance but I feel like what I'm saying is just common sense.
