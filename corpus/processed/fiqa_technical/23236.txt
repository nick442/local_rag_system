Thank you very much for the response! I re-read my original post after your statement and realized that you are right, I did seem rather vague, naive, and a bit lost out there. I did some research (not a lot) but I don't think it was really reflected in my post which is why I edited my comment. Thank you for your responses. I did look at a lot of the links you posted. I think I really didn't word my thoughts properly in the original post. I understand the basic differences - which seem to be that strategy is working on corporate vision while finance is managing a company's money. Honestly, I guess I posted this with the hopes of just seeing some more personal and detailed responses, and really wasn't exactly too sure about what I want myself. I appreciate the links you've posted though and this is a very detailed response so thank you very much! Edit: Oh, and I upvoted your first response. I think you could have criticized my naivety a bit more nicely but I don't think you deserve the downvotes since my original post did seem very naive :/
