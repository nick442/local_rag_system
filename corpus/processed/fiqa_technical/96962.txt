In the UK if you come into the possession of the information in a way that isn't available to the general public that's insider trading. It even states this in section 7, and uses the example of if you observe something like a burning factory as a member of the public, that's not insider information as anyone could have seen it. If you attended a meeting or somehow got hold of private information not yet made public, then it would be considered insider information. Its possible the OP got this information through public observation but considering the nature of the information it's highly unlikely
