Private companies can serve the campaign donation needs of Congress, the USPS can't. That's the driving force behind privatization in the US. Raising campaign funds is the one thing Congress is good at. Government agencies aren't allowed to make political donations, but they can be replaced with private companies that can. Replace well paid workers (who might donate to Democrats) with corporate executives who donate to Republicans. And minimum wage workers who can't afford to donate to anyone. Taxpayers get to pay even more, because competition only lowers prices in profitable markets, while government provides unprofitable but necessary services. For example, the USPS is required to provide universal service, which is costly but contributes to a better society and a more robust economy. FedEx and UPS don't want to service rural locations; cities and suburbs are more profitable.
