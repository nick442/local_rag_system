I especially hate this whole distribute tips and pay the hard workers pretty much nada. Explains so many things about our most recent visits to Olive Garden. No wonder the waiter couldn't hold on to our request for a refill, which we'd never even had to request before, long enough to bring it back to our table until the second request. He was probably worrying how he's going to eat that day, poor thing. Also explains the table nearby sitting waiting to be bussed while people line up outside waiting to eat. I wouldn't hurry either for $2 an hour and a crap share in the tips. I guess we'll just have to buckle down and try harder not to eat out for a while. Except at the two family-run local places that don't hire any outside workers. At least I can hope the family isn't screwing any of their members.
