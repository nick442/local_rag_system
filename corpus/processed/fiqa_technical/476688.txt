I actually argued this with a friend few days ago that this internet based companies are not just monopoly in US but all over the world. Amazon comes to a new location it starts beating retailers by price and what holds it off is actually tradition of people. In the long run i don't think tradition will hold this sort of new habits and this could make even grocery shopping done by internet. What needs to be done, or my suggestion, is taxing all these internet companies. This way amazon won't be able to have that much price advantage and would be luxury where you pay more for (especially for basic stuff like groceries) making them come all the way to your apartment. I personally like shopping in real life either it is clothes grocery books but since it is actually cheaper for me to buy from amazon, i always order my books from it.
