"Cash is a pain to deal with. You have to have change ready for that dick in seat 1A who doesn't have anything smaller than a $20, then by the time you get to seat 39F, you've got hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars. This means that the flight's turnaround time now includes counting, securing, and transporting money, not to mention dealing [with the inevitable problems that an increase in money will bring](http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/image003.jpg). The alternative is having a little handheld machine that, for under $1 per transaction, reduces turnaround workload to ""push the 'sync' button."" It makes complete sense in that context, I believe. (Also, if you're flying, I'd say the odds are very good you have some sort of credit-card-like instrument on your person. This might just be my own perspective, though. I've accidentally fucked over taxi drivers by forgetting that mobile credit card terminals are not ubiquitous.)"
