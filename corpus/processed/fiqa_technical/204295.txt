You make a accurate point. I would like to add 2 points. First off many people realize they do not need debt. If they have a stable job and the car is paid off and the rent is reasonable they may never need to go into debt ever again unless to buy a home. Second off. The market is always swinging. So next time we are in some sort of financial bubble people who had bankruptcy will be able to borrow like the rest of society. I worked for a time in the finance industry and I do recall many many loans to people who declared bankruptcy.
