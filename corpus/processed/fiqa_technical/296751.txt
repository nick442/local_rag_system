We've expanded in our current location several times. We started with just 33 stations, this past Friday we had 80 people in the store playing. If you mean franchising, that's such a huge risk and it rarely works out the way you'd expect it to. I'd be more interested in consulting and if needed being on site to help with certain things but I haven't had anyone offer to pay me yet, at least none that have actually paid me.
