I don't think anyone will take it as scrap metal, because it is not allowed by the Australian law: CRIMES (CURRENCY) ACT 1981 - SECT 16 Defacing or destroying current coins or current paper money A person shall not, without the consent, in writing, of an authorized person, intentionally deface, disfigure, mutilate or destroy any coin or paper money that is lawfully current in Australia. Melting it would thus be illegal and can be punished with a fine of $5000 or 2 years of imprisonment, or both. If you try to sell it for that then you might be accessory, so don't do it. I suppose that throwing them at the garbage will count as destroying or disfiguring it, since it will most likely happen in the process. So that may be illegal, so you shouldn't do it.
