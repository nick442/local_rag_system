This! The quality of life for most is deteriorating. Just because the poor can afford a hand-me-down Iphone doesn't mean their life isn't shit (kind of like that recent picture of the homeless guy with a smart phone). Yes in some ways their quality of life is better, with access to smartphones and Ipads, but what about the necessities like food and shelter? Those things are becoming ever increasingly more expensive. If the quality of life was improving for the masses, then we wouldn't be having this conversation about inequality now would we?
