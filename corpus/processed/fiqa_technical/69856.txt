Thanks man. Even the credit default swaps were initially an amazing deal for the banks selling them. They got to collect huge amounts of premium for awhile thinking they'd never have to pay out. For the stories we heard in the Big Short, I bet there's hundreds of people out there who paid premiums for years until they couldn't anymore and never got their big payout. It's crazy that you could basically take out an insurance policy on something you had no stake or equity in. It was literally a bet. The data supported the defaults too, though. Looking at [delinquency rates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS), Q1 of 2010 had a staggering *11.53%* of all mortgage payments being late. That's insane. Some people saw it creeping up and recognized that Q1 '08 was 76% higher than the previous year and was only climbing, and knew it was going to pop.
