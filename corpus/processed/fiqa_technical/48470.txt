Gladwell was writing about which university an aspiring STEM major should choose if the kid actually wants to finish university with a STEM degree. According to Gladwell, STEM students whose SAT math scores were in the bottom third, regardless of the university, were much less likely to graduate with a STEM degree. They're not dropping out of school, though; they're just getting different degrees. So, if your goal is to get a STEM degree and be a successful student, Harvard may not be the best place for you, particularly if your score falls into that bottom third. That Inc. author completely missed the point that Gladwell makes in his book. Either that, or he's intentionally misrepresenting it.
