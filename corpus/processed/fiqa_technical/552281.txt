"P/E is a pretty poor way to value the company as it exists today. The company generates free cash flow yield of 2.5-3.3% which isn't remarkably high, but it's not nearly as bad as the earnings yield of 1.1%. But let's operate within the P/E ratio for right now. The company sells $40 billion of ""stuff"" each year with a net margin of 2%. If they increased prices on every product by 1% (which really wouldn't be _that_ noticeable) their profit would grow 50%. Thus, P/E drops from 90 to 60. SGA expenses equal ~20% of their operating costs. Cut 5% of SGA and you get the same 1% increase in net margin. This could come from cost-cutting today, or by greater economies of scale in the future while keeping prices the same. So, yes, it's priced as a growth firm, but it doesn't necessarily need customer growth in the traditional sense to be fairly-valued."
