">5.) Target allowed the use of the coupons for gift certificates, negating the profit they would have made themselves. The customers did not create this situation. So you're stating that everyone who has ever taken advantage of a poorly programmed system to do something they shouldn't have in no way broke any laws? I believe there are many people currently in prison who may have a different perspective on that one. Ask the guy who guessed Sarah Palin's email password how that theory worked out. >Target also renewed the coupon system with full knowledge of the circumstances. The article is very unclear if Target was aware of the first thread (for the initial promotion) or the second thread (the second promotion). In fact, based on the narration of the article, Target's ""full knowledge"" doesn't come into play until it's discussing the second promotion (but I admit it is very unclear). It would be incredibly difficult to update a corporate system or put safeguards in place *at every register* over the course of a weekend if it was indeed the second thread that Target noticed. Their only option would be to either invalidate all coupons (and piss off *a lot* of honest people) or to take the beating."
