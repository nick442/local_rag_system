Yes, you can be on a different plan from your dependents. The only real benefit to having everyone on the sale plan is the Family Deductible and Family Out of Pocket Maximum; which are both generally two times the Individual amounts for the same plan. When you have just two people on the plan, this combination doesn't do anything. When you have three or more people on the same plan you can realize the benefit of combining everyone under one plan. Once one person in the family meets their deductible, any combination of the other family members can meet the rest up to the Family deductible; same goes for the out of pocket max.
