"Thank you. I'm so tired of the ""2 years experience required"" for an entry level position. Resulting in my resume going directly in the trash. I have a fucking masters in my field but ""academic internships"" and academic research apparently don't count as experience. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's almost as if these places are trying to hire their own staff. I can't get the job if I need the job already to get the job!?!"
