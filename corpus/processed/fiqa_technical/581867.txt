"The best advice I have heard from any of my professors is ""Think before you speak"" A moment of silence is Okay. Especially if it is a question that involves a great deal of critical thinking. Formulate your responses so they sound intelligent and mature. Asking the interviewer questions works too -- the more they talk, the better!"
