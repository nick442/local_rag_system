As an insider who experienced both, i can confirm. Walmart's culture is very.. rough. The executives i have met just act like their soul was stolen, theres no real interest in the company's future or its people. It feels like nobody really cares. Meanwhile at Amazon, the company has taken the relatively new silicon valley business model to heart. Amazon not only invests in expansion and growth, but it invests significantly in its personnel. There are millions of dollars rolling around, being invested in employee development and growth through programs like their tuition assistance and employee assistance. Amazon shows its employees that the company cares by investing in them, and that makes a huge difference in employee retention and productivity. I know people who have worked at one warehouse for over 10 years and never considered leaving because the company makes them feel wanted. That culture is built from the very top all the way to the lowest supervisor.
