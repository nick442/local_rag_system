And if you are saying I shouldn’t speak economics to you, then you are committing the logical fallacy of appeal to authority: that just because you are an authority in the field, you must be right. Authority ty is a good fall-back when you have no other methods to verify your decisions by, but authority alone doesn’t hold the reigns of truth.
