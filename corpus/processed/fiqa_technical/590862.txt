You're hysterical and I find your mischaracterization of me insulting and intellectually lazy. I fundamentally disagree with your position that more government intervention will do anything but further harm the people you want to help so bad. I know you're not able to comprehend this, most people with 18+ years of public school education aren't, but there are other decentralized, community driven solutions to these problems. Outsourcing every fucking to the state has demonstrably failed and will continue to fail in spectacular fashion. The problem with people like you is that you believe that, through coercion of the state, you can equalize every outcome. Attempting that you justify ever increasing tyranny until liberty is all but dead. The long of the short if it is, you can not legislate equality of outcome, even at the margins. The road to hell is paved with socialist good intentions, which history demonstrates if you care to look.
