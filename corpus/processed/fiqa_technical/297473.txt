If you put $500 into BTC at $5 you either would have A) Sold at the then ATH $20 or B) Lost faith when it tanked down to $0.50 a month later and been done with it. Everybody would be rich looking in the past. I held 300 Eth that I bought (75) at $4 and mined (225). I sold at $20 before the skyrocket to $400. Shit happens.
