"Lets be clear on this, because I think you maybe misrepresenting some of the costs. Now I'll agree that $20K is an extreme cost, but that is for 10 weeks. Each of these camps runs a fairly normal rate for summer camp per week ($1417-2350/week) Considering you have young children living away from their parents, and doing occasionally risky activities. (food, housing, supervision & INSURANCE) Most of these camps include: horseback riding, archery, cooking(""knife skills"", water skiing) which are extreme insurance hazards I'm sure. You are looking at $202-336/day. Try going on a vacation for this. Now the comments regarding ""rustic experience,"" ""striped down experience,"" ""small pleasures"" are all fucking douchey to be sure, but your disbelief at the costs seems to me that you weren't considering the details and time frames given. I dont have the money to send my kids away for one of these 7-10 week camps, but lets be clear, I'd spend $202 to send my kids away to camp for a day so I could bang the wife in the kitchen like we used to, and if I was rich I might send them away for 2-3 weeks."
