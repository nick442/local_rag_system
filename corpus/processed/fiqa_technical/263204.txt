">This is why people talking about kirkland ""whatever product"" is actually ""blank OEM"" is really harmful. Uh no its not. >There is a risk to quality afterwards when the manufacturer is so caught in trying to save money that they will cut every corner in order to save cost. Costco isn't Walmart tho. While Costco plays hardball to get the best deal they also understanding keeping quality. Where as Walmart doesn't care about quality, they know that shirt you bought for $10 will last like maybe 6 months and you be back to get another. Costco rather wants that shirt to last you a year or more and charge you $25 instead."
