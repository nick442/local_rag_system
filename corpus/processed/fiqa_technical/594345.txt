Saudi isn't going to listen to China. Albeit China is an important trading partner for Saudi, it doesn't have anywhere near the leverage America has. Actually, Japan has a better relationship with Saudi Arabia than the latter does with China. Saudi riyal is pegged to the dollar and so it remains as strong as it possibly can. The USD is simply the most stable currency, the petrodollar is an exaggerated reason as to why it is. US imports are almost the same as the China in terms of percentage but the US sells lots of weapons to Saudi Arabia. China doesn't have the amount of investment into Saudi Arabia like US companies do. China and the yuan are not substitutes to the US and usd.
