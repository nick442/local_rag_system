And what about all of the people who DON'T respond. Heck, what is the ratio of responses to graduates? Are you 100% certain that ALL of the responses (even really NEGATIVE ones) are being made available to you? And how in the world would you know? Selection bias is virtually ALWAYS towards the positive in regards to shit like this. That's not even taking into account that surveying only GRADUATES is in and of itself a bias (survivorship). *I have no doubt that you have HEARD of the terms, but it is fairly obvious that you really don't COMPREHEND the effects of those biases.* Have fun with that.
