I tend to disagree. I think Amazon will find that as soon as it tries to raise prices to make a profit that people will type 'walmart' instead of 'amazon'. See how easy that was? Services are a good business too but the competition there is also vicious. Further, the piper has to be paid eventually. Sure Amazon has great cash flow now but the assets they are acquiring are going to depreciate and need constant maintenance/replacement. They're building an extremely capital intensive business and all that profit-free growth is going to look more and more expensive as time goes by, IMO. People can argue all day..it's kinda pointless. You've probably made a lot in Amazon, I've made a lot in Apple. i prefer Apple because it's also huge AND turns a ridiculous profit. If I have to pick a company I'll pick the undervalued one with huge profits AND huge cash flow. That's a doubleplus good.
