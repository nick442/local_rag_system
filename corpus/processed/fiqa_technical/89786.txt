"You will receive a combination of Verizon shares and cash whether you chose option B or C. Option B means that your ""Return of Value"" will be treated as capital - ie: as a capital gain. Option C means that your ""Return of Value"" will be treated as income - ie: as a dividend. As your ISA has favourable tax status, you don't end up paying any capital gain tax or income tax on dividend income. So it won't matter which option you chose."
