"1. You don't know what an ad hominem is and you should feel bad. 2. That comment is in response to someone calling me a trumptard. Can you even read? 3. I didn't vote for Trump. 4. I still didn't vote for Trump. 5. You're laughably uneducated about claims and data. 6. Data has to actually support the claim you're making. 7. You have to prove that polls are the way they are for the reasons you say they are. 8. They made claims without data. 9. Those claims are still unsupported. 10. The data they ""actually provided"" wasn't for the right country. 11. You could not draw a conclusion even if it was the right data. 12. It says a lot about you that you're more concerned about my opinion than the person calling people trumptards and telling them to shut the fuck up."
