No program or government action will work for everyone on an individual level. There are over 300M Americans. The only thing the government can do is make broad stroke policy decisions that have the best *net* outcome for all involved. Our current system has created conditions in which healthcare costs are out of control. This is effecting both the sick and the healthy. Finding a system that works to get the cost under control for the average American, while, ideally, maintaining quality of care, is the ultimate goal. If that means we have to make a few sacrifices, like caring for the poor and unhealthy, to make it happen, then so be it. I believe there is something in the Bible about caring for the poor and the sick.
