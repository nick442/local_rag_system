Dude, let go of the Fox News thing. I could care less about them since most of the patriots left. Worry more about every other news site in the world that's reporting on muslims stabbing people and smashing them with hammers and running them over with trucks. You're not going to suppress the news, no matter how much you bash the news outlets. Sorry Brah! Who did you vote for in the US election? Now let's see how smart you are, when is the last time you heard of someone blow some shit up while yelling: a) Allah is great! b) Jesus is great! c) The buddha is great! d) Jehovah is great! e) Santa Clause is great! I don't want to give it away, but one of those answers should be sticking out PRREEEEETTTTTTYYYY clearly, if you don't still have your head up killary's asshole. (What's it smell like in there, Webb Hubbell?)
