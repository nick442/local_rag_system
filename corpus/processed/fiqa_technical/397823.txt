I have experience working with DeltaV (I&C automation software for industrial plants) and it's amazing how many jobs it used to employ to keep track of all that shit. Flow of a pipe every 100 meters? No problem, just check the screen. Automated fire control at a specific location? No problem it'll handle itself. Something wrong with an instrument? You already have the warnings and errors on the screen to tell you exactly what is wrong. No need to keep on expensive full-time engineers to diagnose a lot of the easier problems. You can do that right from your desk. The more routine shit you still see people doing? It's only a matter of time before that goes away.
