"This is an annoyingly misleading title. The article reads: > Clickmeter will continue to serve the 100,000+ users but will be positioned going forward for more sophisticated customers.

That's (in theory) a smart thing to do, but it's not the same as ""killing a startup that has over 100,000 customers."""
