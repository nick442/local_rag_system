"Take your top ten or twenty customers out to dinner (one at a time), along with your top sales people. Ask them why they do business with you and what you could be doing better. Don't make any promises, mind you, just listen. Back at the office, sit down with the sales people who were at the dinner and come up with a plan to make your top customers super happy, and then figure out how to package that to your mid-tier customers. Then ""fire"" all your worst customers. They probably bring more headaches than they do profits."
