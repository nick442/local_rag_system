So.. >caused Samsung to earn only half as much per pixel on its production compared to previous models ..but the resolution is what, 4x as dense, so still twice as much? Or even if it's double, it's still the same overall. Seems like a weird measure of profitability. Wouldn't you measure profitability by overall display unit volume?
