Successful technology contractors* make far more than employees. The contractor market is getting oversaturated because more people want to do it and employers like it less and less. Problem is, the only time big employers are willing to hire contractors are when they're really good, so you really only get well paid contractors who find consistent work, and then a flood of contractors that have to get whatever work they can find.
