"Meanwhile, lets look at the people of India. While this is broadly speaking, you can divide the population along the spectrum of wealth/income into two groups: those who have a middle class lifestyle (or better), and those who do not. Among those who have ""made it"", a strange trend emerges - a Western-like 2.3 children-per-couple rate emerges. Those impoverished millions maintain their disturbingly rapid rate of reproduction. This minimum income solution does not include the nasty problems where girls are hidden away until they turn 18, just to emerge without any education, still endangering their parents. China has a nasty problem of post-birth abortions for girls as well. And now, their entire country is on the verge of social collapse as reproductive rates have fallen from the sexual imbalance, much less from the inevitable population decline. But unless we Create a global government, it becomes up to each country to implement a minimum income on their own terms. Or it could be enforced via trade negotiations."
