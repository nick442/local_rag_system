"Canadian bubble is in a weird place. The problem with the market is it doesn't take into account the increase in quality. I lived in one of the frothiest places on the north side of Toronto. When I first moved their the same bungalow that sold for $1mm + was about 400-450k. What they don't mention in those articles is that there is a fair amount of LAND, and that the new owners will tear it down the day they take possession, and build a really large home on it. That is why you see single dethatched homes in Toronto outpacing condos by a huge margin. (or one reason anyway. we have our green belt/intensification issues, and in Vancouver, they have natural intensification issues thanks to the mountains and the ocean.) All that said, I was pretty sure I had bought at the height recently, but lo and behold prices continued to rise. I think the only thing that will ""save"" us is the insured mortgages. I mean there will be write offs, but not like what we saw in the US, as Canadian banks/and FIs are much more conservative. I think China is the wild card in the Canadian RE market, at least on the condo side. We don't have any good statistics about how many investors are off Canadian soil."
