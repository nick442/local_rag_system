..Hmm.Very fair point..I mean, this is theoretically what the earlier stated rule is for, but in this case, it probably wouldn't work..Maybe some sort of blanket exception for small/starting businesses, as certain places that have $15 minimum wages already have? Also, I should note that a teenager would probably be exempt from any such law in the first place, as they're already getting support from their parents and, thusly, already have a livable wage, as it were. This is why I mentioned that part earlier regarding part-time jobs, since people working such jobs already generally have another resource for basic needs. I should note I'm about to go to bed, because it's midnight where I live. That said, this has actually been a very enlightening discussion. You've given me a lot to think about. I'll do some further research and, if you'd like to continue this discussion in roughly eight hours, that'd be just fine.
