"If you base your predictions on the past - the market will crash at some point in the future. Historically, October is one of the worse months for the markets. People tend to use this to create click-bait for people like you. They tend to get compensated on page views. Thus, more clicks - more profit for them. If anyone could predict a market crash - they would likely just be ""guessing"" correctly. However, that does not mean there aren't some people that are better at guessing these sorts of things. The people I would look at are leaders of the field, Warren Buffet, George Soros, etc. Just FYI, there are rumors Warren Buffet is sitting on pretty large cash position currently. However, they are just rumors. If you want to know how market crashes affect things - there are plenty of examples to look at. 1929, 2001, 2007 just to name a few. Do some research of your own, maybe even actually try to emulate what ""market analysts"" do. Then, you can write the click-bait articles, instead of clicking on them."
