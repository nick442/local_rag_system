Tell you what, I live in Norway. Everyone can look up at least the declared taxable income of everybody, including his coworkers, his boss, the CEO, the Bishop, the cleaning lady etc. Same in Switzerland as far as I know. Sweden maybe as well, don't know. No increased levels of bitterness around here. Rather high salaries though, but that's probably more related to being a very rich country. (I personally don't even care enough to look but then I'm in a rather individual payment structure.)
