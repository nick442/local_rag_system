"No, you're glossing over some very interesting issues here (as did ZH.. very disappointed.. shocked, really). Here's the bottom line: due to the USA's particular brand of fucked up foreign policy, foreign relations actions in one part of the world have produced an unexpected outcome due to the USA's neglect to take care of business on the other side of the world. That outcome was one of Russia's largest state oil companies ending up with majority ownership of an American going interest, Citgo. Now it looks pretty fucking odd when Russia, a country currently experiencing USA imposed sanctions, ends up owning American refineries that could be used to basically make up for any economic damage (thanks, Hurricane Harvey) the state dept. sanctions might have caused in the first place. So, Goldman S. was authorized to clean up the fucking mess by creating a ""rehypothecation event"" on Citgo's assets to which Russia will lack complete (legal) credibility. It really doesn't get any clearer or more obvious than this. Meanwhile, South American good will is eroding faster than Florida coastline during a global warming tipping point."
