What most people who dislike globalization don't realize is that by letting companies do what is best to distribute their companies across the globe based on least cost to them, it actually equalizes the economies in the long run and eventually causes jobs to return to US as costs rise along with standard of living in foreign countries. As long as the USA competes well against other countries, especially on taxes to do business, to attract business to the USA there should be no long term fear of companies keeping jobs overseas.
