It's amazing that there is this assumption that Government does not contribute to a nation's economy. In the US, so many radical right wingers want to remove government taxation and spending entirely because they honestly believe that it has zero effect on the economy. These were the sort of people who were getting excited during the debt limit debate in the US a few years back. As for me, I would love to see American politicians decide on principle to cut government spending by 75% (no medicare, no NASA, etc). The resulting economic and social collapse would kill off that ideology for a few generations at least.
