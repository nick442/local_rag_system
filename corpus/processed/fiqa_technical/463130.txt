I would strongly advise that you do not use Western Union or any other wire transfer service for any money transfer, unless you personally know and trust the recipient of your funds, and the method by which you can communicate the details of the transaction. As was mentioned, wire transfers are irreversible and very difficult to trace to ensure the actual recipient got the funds. In some countries and situations, literally anyone can show up at any Western Union location, correctly recite the details of the transaction (which is proof enough they are the intended recipient) and receive the cash. If the vendor accepts PayPal, then simply set up a PayPal account, linked to your credit card, and pay the vendor that way. This can be done 100% online, assuming you have a valid card.
