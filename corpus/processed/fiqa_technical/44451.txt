I really don't see where you've done that sufficiently, to be honest. Again, people work together to build great things entirely for non-altruistic reasons. Personal achievement is not an altruistic driver, its exactly the opposite. Its greed. The fact that one would stick around to fulfill his need for personal achievement is only evidence that this person percieves the future pay out to be high. What I'm guessing you'd like is a system based on arbitrarily assigned moral brownie points. Am I correct in assuming that?
