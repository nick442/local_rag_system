I'd say figure out if you want to be in corporate finance or investment finance- do you want to work front office or back office? I knew a lot of people that want to be financial analysts in the investment industry, but depending on where you live those jobs may be few and far in between. Financial services/ sales can be one of he more lucrative areas, but you need to have the right skill set/desire for that. I highly recommend getting an internship, this will build experience and also help you figure out what interests you the most
