Hey, it's disrespectful to use that term in a derogatory way. It's implying that being gay is something bad. I'm not sure if that was your intent. If not, it's something to think about before using it next time. If you believe the negative implication, you might want to reconsider; or at least realize it will offend the majority of people.
