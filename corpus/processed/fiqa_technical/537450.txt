Fuck you. Fuck the HELL out of you. First, what if I operate a business that has industry-wise small margins? All manufacturing, for instance, operates on an average margin of 2%. How much is that tax increase going to be, again? 5%? Thanks, I guess you didn't want a manufacturing sector in the US after all. Second, what if my competitive advantage *is* a small margin? For many small businesses, that is their *only* competitive advantage in their start-up years. Third, when the HELL did being left alone and keeping the money I earned by generating wealth and providing services become a motherfucking SUBSIDY? When the hell did the money I earn become the government's by right?? Also fuck you, you disgusting self-important pimple. The risk-takers, wealth generators and employers of half of America are in fear for their survival; their livelyhoods, their life's work, and their retirement are all at risk from government meddling; and you cavalierly snark that they should just go out of business. May you live long enough to one day learn how it feels.
