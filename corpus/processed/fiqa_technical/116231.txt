If WMT actually acts on this threat, WMT could be screwed. AMZ has an opportunity here and one they will likely jump on. Pay the truckers some % more to side with AMZ over WMT or hell, give them a multi-year deal - AMZ can eat that expense if it means hurting WMT. End result is WMT has delayed/late/expensive shipments and this hurts their bottom line even more. These are dangerous tactics for sure.
