That is silly to say it isn't a reward for the quality of the waiter. WTF is a tip for then? Why do we not have base compensation without tips, with final prices finalized into all goods? No, a tip *is a reward for quality* **of service**. I give a 10% tip for horrible service (service, not food). I give a 15% tip when I don't notice the waiter/ess as part of my meal. I give 20% tip when service (not food) was exceptional. If someone sucks as a waiter and consistently gets poor tips from people who tip based on service, stop being a poor waiter. If someone is a good waiter and consistently gets poor tips from people (incorrectly in my opinion) tipping based on food quality, quit working at that horrible restaurant. If you want to argue that tipping is not a reward for quality of service, then I will abstain from tipping altogether because I paid for my food and I'm willing to get my own damn water and pick up my food from the kitchen if someone will let me.
