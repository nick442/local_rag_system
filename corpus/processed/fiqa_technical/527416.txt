If i look to the future ,i see the general retail revenue growing pretty slowly, but the online retailers growing fast. Why ? First, they grew historically around 20% per year for the last few years. Second there's a lot of big important innovation. Amazon prime, Tablets and phones as great sales tools and comparison tools(and they're becoming common), Ebay investing heavily in logistics to enable small non u.s. companies to sell onshore without big shipping costs, Online apparel shopping improving rapidly and maybe becoming competitive with offline shopping,using social networks for shopping, interesting new models to sell merchandise online like etsy, subscription shopping and the the general rate of internet innovations. Third, people are improving in their e-commerce capability and trust. On the other hand , i don't see any big growth opportunity for brick and mortar retailers.So it means they'll shrink. The problem is that retail is a low margin business. That means that losing 5-15% percent of revenue is enough to close you , because you have a lot of fixed costs(rent, employees, financing the goods).
