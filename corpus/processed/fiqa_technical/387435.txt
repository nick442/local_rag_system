"This is a very disingenuous argument. The tax subsidies for electric cars aren't for Tesla. They are for the development of an electric car industry in the United States, hopefully comprising many different car manufacturers, not just Tesla. It's very convenient to take the tax subsidies for a decade, establish your business, then say ""Well, we don't need these anymore so therefore nobody should have them."" It would be a massive institutional hurdle for a competitor to start-up under those circumstances, significantly increasing start-up costs. I'll cede that perhaps the subsidies can be used as advertisements against his company by traditional car companies, but the competitive advantage Tesla would have by reduced competition by ending the subsidies would grossly outweigh that (something Musk conveniently omits). The subsidies should remain in place until there is at least one significant competitor to Tesla in electric car production (and preferably several). It's not about one company. It's about an industry."
