Historically, it did work. I had a friend who had a dozen credit cards during college, and every few weeks he would move his balances around among the cards with balance transfers (all with a touch tone phone). Unfortunately for you, banks figured that game out and added fees for balance transfers that are applied at the time of the transfer.
