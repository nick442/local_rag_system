Sprint has a great brand, but needs cash to roll out their LTE network faster. Wimax was an unfortunate requirement of their spectrum allocation wherein if they did not use it, they lost it. So Wimax should really never have existed for Sprint, but they had to do it. So I think based on what Softbank has done in other markets this is a good thing. It looks like at the very least it'll put another $3 billion directly into the US LTE roll out-- which means a faster than previously announced rollout (which in terms of markets was pretty good despite the overall lacking of availability). I hope New Sprint pulls it together and gives Verizon & AT&T a run for their money. They werent going to last too long otherwise.
