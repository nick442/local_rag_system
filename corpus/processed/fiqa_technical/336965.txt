Not OP, but let's see: My money-market account is showing 0.25% interest rate. My savings account, 0.20%. And checking, 0.22%. It doesn't matter where I keep my emergency fund and what I keep my checking balance. It's making fuck-all for interest. And I need to keep a couple thousand in there because my mortgage hits for about $1600. And my monthly CC spend averages ~$3500 monthly. I simply can't keep a couple hundred in there.
