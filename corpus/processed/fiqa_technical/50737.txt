"One other aspect of this is that the bank will plan to eventually approach the merchant that they are sending paper checks to and say ""why don't you sign up with us and give us your ACH info, and we won't send you checks?"" And a lot of merchants will say ""sure"", because someone has to open those checks and take them down to the bank, and that isn't free. And that time while the money is in the mail, or sitting on someone's desk to be deposited, that is money that isn't working for you. So everyone wins."
