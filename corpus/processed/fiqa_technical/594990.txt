If you're talking about TRUPS (Trust Preferred securities) these are all but banned for new issuance under Dodd-Frank and other regulations. Although some companies still have outstanding TRUPS most have either matured, defaulted or been refinanced into some other form of debt. Its not really an available form of capital raising anymore.
