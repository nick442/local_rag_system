">ADDED: I'm pursuing a degree in Engineering. I guess that's why I'm stressing. I want to be out there in the feild doing tests, labs, sampling or research and development .. just anything but doing nothing. Or at least somthing that actually generates income for the bank. My department generates nothing because it's all compliance. I learned that my first day of work and that's when I knew this wasn't for me. :/ So do it. Put on some jeans and boots, buy your own equipment, find a ""field"" you find interesting, and go study/collect/sample it. You know what you want to do, you're just not doing it. WTF is up with that?"
