I have heard of Dort somehow. 'Nuff said there. Never been to Flint in my life, either. Far as starting a market, say, around where I lived..I'd chance it with adequate money to invest and do a decent job. Except - where the heck would I put it? No suitable buildings to even retrofit, as they've all been firebombed by the aforementioned homies. So, either I spend a mil to retrofit a shell, or I spend a mil to build a cookie-cutter storefront as cheap as possible, and after that, I still gotta worry about fixtures, lighting, registers, misc equip, and after all THAT, I still have to buy adequate stock to maybe get started and stay out of Dante's Inferno on the books. Nevermind zoning and graft and health inspectors on a refabbed building. No way, even in perhaps 20 years, to make back your investment in those areas. Reckon that's why you see established places hanging in here and there like little islands.
