I have purchased three properties. I will say the #1 rule is 20% things go wrong all the time. Seriously, renters are pretty terrible. If you aren't making 20% profit on the books. So add up mortgage, insurance, all costs. Then multiply that by 1.25. Whatever number that is is what you must get for rent just to break even. I can't stress this enough. If rental rates don't support you getting that kinda price then don't get into it. This is the break even number.
