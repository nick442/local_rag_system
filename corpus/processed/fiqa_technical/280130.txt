"Malcolm Gladwell wrote a 2006 article called ""The Risk Pool"" documenting exactly that. Businesses did not want that power in their workers' hands, despite it being more efficient and better for their bottom line. The unions went along with it because they thought eventually the costs would force them to come around. They did not, instead places crushed by their benefit obligations like GM got bailed out and/or went into bankruptcy."
