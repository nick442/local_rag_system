Major in CS. I'm 26 with a BS in Finance (with Accounting minor). I wish I went with a CS back in the day, but oh well. I'm learning programming and computer science on my own now while I work full-time. Fortunately, I'm well on my way towards a strong IT career since I work in business intelligence and big data. It can be a grind while working full-time though. Don't think you are not good at science classes. I used to think the same. They're not easy, which means you will just have to read and study more and better. Keep at it, develop leadership skills and organize study groups, meet with your professors and TAs if you must. Don't be afraid to ask questions, ever. Also consider getting a minor in something. It'll be harder but usually well worth it. Pick a minor in a field you find interesting. Every field and industry needs CS majors and you will make yourself that much more valuable. A major in CS with a minor in finance would make you look badass. But don't go with finance though, I suggest a science (any bio, physics or chemistry is good). You'll end up with a nice paying job. I consider my CS skills beginner, but I'm above average compared to the general population and already get paid very well.
