I disagree. When you start giving that person money to invest, you are made very much aware that there is no guarantee that your investment will see a return or that you will ever see it again. As long as the person managing your funds didn't do anything illegal to lose your money, then he was just doing his job as **both** the investor and he agreed upon.
