You are correct. The 65 is actually a longer test. The 66 requires you have the 7 first so you don't have strategy or product analysis questions. I have heard some say the 65 is harder because you are registering with the state as an investment advisor so don't need the 7. Regardless the biggest thing is know Uniform Securities Act inside and out.
