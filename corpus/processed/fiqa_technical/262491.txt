>Oil is important because without it US can't go to war That's may be a reason but its far from the main one. Without oil the whole economy shuts down instantly. People can't get to work or stores to buy stuff. We can't run diesel peaker plants for electricity demand as easily either (although that's changed some due to natural gas). We use so much god damn oil that if supply is cut off for a day or two, everything stops. While grain is very important, that doesn't happen with food commodities. We actually grow so much extra food that we turn a lot into oil. If food was short, we'd stop doing that (I hope). Lastly, we scrutinize it in the media because our main supply is external. A lot comes from Canada sure, but the middle east is a major component of our supply. If those lines are cut off, prices surge. That *used* to hurt us bad because wed have to buy from more expensive sources (offshore, south america, anywhere else really). Now, small bumps in price are helping the US economy because of shale gas production in PA and Ohio. So oil is a very political commodity on the global stage. Look at Venezuela right now with low oil prices cutting off demand for their more costly oil. TLDR Oil is the feedstock for our economy and its a scarce resource.
