(I'm a bot) ***** > Target Corp. said Monday that it is raising the minimum wage for its workers to $11 an hour starting next month and then to $15 by the end of 2020. > Target&#039;s hike to $15 an hour far exceeds not only the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour but the hourly base pay at Wal-Mart, the nation&#039;s largest private employer, and plenty of its other retail peers whose minimum hourly pay now hovers around $10. As part of its $2.7-billion investment in workers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. had raised its entry-level hourly pay for workers to $9 in 2015 and then to $10 in 2016. > Target said its minimum hourly wage of $11 is higher than the minimum wage in 48 states and matches the minimum wage in Massachusetts and Washington. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/72jfa0/target_to_raise_its_minimum_hourly_wage_to_15_by/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~216691 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **workers**^#1 **wage**^#2 **year**^#3 **retail**^#4 **pay**^#5"
