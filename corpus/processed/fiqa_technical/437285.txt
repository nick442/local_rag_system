I thought that was strange too. BoA is infested with criminals. They wouldn't know a sustainable business model if it bit them in the ass, and they are losing all of their customers because of it. As they fall, everyone at the top is going to suck from the company everything that they think they are entitled to, and the expense is going to fall on the shareholders. Maybe he was predicting a pity purchase, or a bailout, but there is no way that he thought that this was a good long term move. Very uncharacteristic.
