You are looking at this all wrong. You got nothing to lose here and everything to gain. You arent being paid and you arent good at selling. This is a time for you to try and overcome your hangups. You have no pressure now since you arent being paid. Realize this and become more relaxed. Explore different sales approaches and at the end if the day figure out what works best. Most of all you are only a sophmore. Use this as a learning experience for future jobs. You can decide how you want to use what you have learned there. You might want to use what you have learned to help you stear clear of similar companies in the future.
