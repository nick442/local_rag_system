PCI requires that any Point of Sale is receiving patches & security updates. XP has been end of life'd since 2014. Its close cousin, POSReady 2009, will be supported through April 2019. So if this XP system interacts in any way with cardholder data, it's almost certainly not PCI compliant unless Santander has some enterprise agreement to support XP past its end of life. XP and 2009 don't support TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2, which is going to be a big deal on July 1, 2018, when PCI mandates that TLS 1.0 is disallowed.
