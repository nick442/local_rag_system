A lot of articles about this kind of thing ask you to do the simple math: $5k < $15k. If you've got a trustworthy mechanic, and you're looking to save money, it's simple, you're looking at $10k in savings, not even counting interest, higher insurance, etc. On the other hand, if you're just lusting after a new car, and don't mind spending the extra money, then why not? As you mentioned, however, if you think you'll get at least the value of your repair back, you might as well get the car repaired for $5k, so you'll be able to get around town. If you still decide you want a new car, then you'll have a trade-in worth $6500 instead of $1500.
