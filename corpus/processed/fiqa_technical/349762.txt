Frisco really hits all the marks except public transport. Compared to the other candidates, much lower cost of living, excellent schools, close to an airport that is a major hub and a 3 hour flight to anywhere in the us, highly educated population, verrrry family friendly, the city is brand new, and on top of incentives, taxes are ridiculously low to begin with. Amazon also has a couple of huge warehouses in the dfw area.
