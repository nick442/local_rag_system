This is true Giant and Specialized do have their own stores, however, not all of them are self owned. They still sell some of their bikes to independent bike dealers. What if we take this idea a step further for component manufacturers like FSA, ENVE, Reynolds, Ritchey, or 3T. If any of these brands were to go direct to consumer how could they do it without upsetting their distributors?
