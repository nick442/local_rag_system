"I would get a new outside unbiased accountant who WILL show you the books. I might consider heavily hiring a new manager who is willing to work with you. Perhaps an audit might be in order? Regardless, if this manager continues to ""talk down"" to you, this is when you tell him he needs to be prepared to work with you or work something out. In the meantime, I might consider looking into interviewing my own candidates for the job. Where there is smoke..there is fire. You want to have candidates ready for if they bolt when you have the ""talk."""
