It shouldn't, really. Investors and companies thinking about an IPO shouldn't be scared. I mean, Facebook is a company with no real way to profit from its technology. They have the user base, but has no way of profiting off them. Yet anyways. For them to come out with a near $100 bln valuation, only making a few bln in revenue last year (and little profit), it seems that the market is just adjusting to their respective value to investors. Now, if a company wants to IPO that's awesome, just make sure: * The company will be relevant to daily life in 10-25-50-100 years, etc. * The company can turn a profit without uncertainty. * A company that can grow. Meaning if you buy into a $100 bln valuation, that it can be realistically seen as to growing into a $200 bln company in the next few years. * Preferably, traditional investors like companies that make or deal with a physical product. * The company has leadership. CEO Zuckerberg of (FB) may have created the social network technology, but that doesn't mean he's fit to run a $100 bln public company. I mean, the guy couldn't even dress in a suit for his important meetings pre-IPO. * Preferably companies that can/will enter emerging markets. Cue Coca-Cola and bottlers. * The list goes on but I'm bored of typing. Anyone can add/argue or critique anything if they would like to. If you have all that, you shouldn't be scared of IPO'ing or investing in at IPO.
