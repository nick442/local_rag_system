Since it's not a public company it would be difficult for anyone to value these options or predict their future value without a lot more details on the finances of the firm. Once the firm goes public you can use the Black Shoales equation to get a present value for the options. And once they've got several months of trading data you can get a very rough estimate the future stock price with it's beta. But with individual stocks predicting future values can really be a crapshoot.
