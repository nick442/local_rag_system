"As has been said before: Tell stories. I got a job with an awesome hotel company because I told a story of how I worked for my dad when I was 5, making change and telling his customers to ""have a good day"". This story showed my lifelong commitment to hospitality and the kind of spirit I would pass on to their guests. So find a story about yourself that shows how you embody a key tenet of the spirit of your company and tell that story. Smile while you tell it, remember it fondly, and use that to sell just how PERFECT you are for them."
