"According to [AppData](http://www.appdata.com/) a quarter of a billion people play Zynga games per month. Not exactly sure how that constitutes ""waning."" The reason these games are popular is that they are basic and easy to understand and progress. The reason your walls are polluted with Farmville posts is the very reason social gaming is real-- people who play are addicted as smokers. You'll see more and more in game advertising happen for a few reasons: It's easy to track, the audience is captive (can't DVR and fast forward through ads), and it's easy to microtarget your intended audience. Plus once real money online gaming comes (and it's only a matter of time) ZNGA will be the go to company. Don't get caught in the negative hype."
