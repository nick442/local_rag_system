Yes anyone can credit an NRE account from outside. Most Banks in Dubai should be able to do this [The charges maybe higher], there are other remittance services offered from leading Indian banks like HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis etc. A purpose of remittance needs to be provided, ask your Bank / Service Provider in Dubai and they should be able to tell your friend more details.
