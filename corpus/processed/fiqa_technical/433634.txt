After the deal, which is expected to close by early next year, Burger King and Tim Horton said their newly combined company would have about $23 billion in sales and more than 18,000 locations. The corporate headquarters will be in Canada, but Burger King will still be operated out of Miami. So it can be considered an inversion. Do you understand how companies avoid taxes in these deals? The US taxes all your revenue at 35% and then gives you credit for foreign taxes paid. In many other countries, they just tax you for domestic revenue, not world wide. So previously, Burger King had to pay 35% tax on all revenue world wide, and then got back credits for taxes paid in say, Canada or England. Now, they will pay 35% only on US income and the foreign tax in those countries it operates, which can be much less than 35%.
