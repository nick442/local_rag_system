"Yeah, I don't think ""millennials"" are the ones to win over here. I had the opportunity to dinner at Applebee's twice, once in 1999, and then in 2013. The Applebee's in Miami, Florida, was a cheerful place, the food was good and fresh, and the local chef had an exclusive hot wings recipe. We had a great time. Now fast forward to Applebee's in NY, 2013. Weird place, awful attendance, tasteless food. Now, I don't know what happened there, but you can't usually justify your lack of managing and hard work on ""tendencies"". Innovation and offering more than expected can do wonders for your business."
