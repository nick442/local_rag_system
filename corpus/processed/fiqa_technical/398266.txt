He is just convincing people who likes to listen less science because thats what everyone is doing to influence the majority. Thats how companies sell products or ideas to make people buy products. Seeing how many people referring that documentary after starting a vegan diet I think they did a good job regardless of the bad science and fact stretching. People who are interested in science of the plant based/vegan diet can read books like the China Study of C. Campbell. I don't know how many average Joe will spend time to read and digest that.
