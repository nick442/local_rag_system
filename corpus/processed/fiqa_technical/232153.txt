"I think it would take a societal introspection in regards to wealth. ""How much is enough"". In the US (and in parts of Canada) we have, today, rampant poverty. The middle class is in debt because of wage stagnation and the inflated cost of living. Who is going to buy goods and services when few have disposable income? I don't care how rich you are, you only buy so many cars, jeans, houses. ~~You're~~ Your money just sits there making more money. So at some point many companies WON'T be able to pay current compensation packages. When that happens ""talent"" has no choice. They take a reasonable and realistic compensation package (still orders of magnitude larger than the average employee) but not 10's and 100's of millions of dollars, unless that compensation is actually tied to something more than short term shareholder value creation. Which is exactly the problem today. HP anyone?"
