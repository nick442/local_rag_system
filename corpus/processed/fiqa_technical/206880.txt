Lets be real here about this economic stuff. The uber rich do no work, get all the money, through stock ownership and a tax system thats made for them, by them. The working poor do all the work, get none of the reward. Either you need universal basic income or you need a 15 dollar min wage. UBI i think is better. Edit: the middle and upper classes do hard work. But at least they get a piece of the pie
