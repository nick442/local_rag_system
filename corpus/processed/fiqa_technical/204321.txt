Well, if they have Whole Food locations to ship from, seems pretty easy. It's just a shift in resources. Whereas before you paid checkout clerks, you now pay 1 clerk to watch 6 self-pay stations. If delivery is available you might be able to assume that the number of people coming into the store would be less - and certainly the numbers of items they're purchasing would go down. So you can reallocate labor to delivering orders rather than checking out customers. Granted, I don't think this type of change would be sudden, but certainly over time as millennials begin to manage their own households . .
