It's not clear the cost of funds is a annual or monthly rate. If it is a monthly rate the answers do not converge and you lose money assuming the customer spending is linear. Let's assume you spent $100 a month (evenly spread out). You generate $1.50 in interchange fees. What's my cost of funds within that month? Subtract that from your interchange fee number. (I think calculus might be the best option for calculating this). There's your notional income off of $100, which can easily be solved for $260/year.
