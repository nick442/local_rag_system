"I refuse to vote for Mitt Romney but I don't see what's wrong with his position in this instance. Homes are way too expensive currently and helping people with underwater mortgages would be akin to propping up unsustainable home prices. The only way to fix the housing market it so value homes at a value that people are willing or able to pay. Given the wage deflation going on in the USA coupled with a good portion of an entire generation of new home buyers saddle with a mortgage sized student loan debts, it's ridiculous to think current home prices represent the ""bottom"" of the market."
