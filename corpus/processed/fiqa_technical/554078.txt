A lot of qualifiers there -- e.g., 'comfortable', selection bias, etc. But regardless, this is a bit of a strawman: I'm not at all arguing that success isn't correlated with effort; it's a question of the degree of correlation, and the amount of attribution. I'm in a nascent engineering startup myself, and I would hardly be motivated in *any* commercial endeavor if I believed there wasn't a correlation between effort and outcome! I would actually grant you that engineering is probably one of the better examples of meritocracy out there today -- but there's a lot of caveats to that, and many engineers I know in large corporate environments are an underclass to much less technical, much less hard-working superiors. And from personal experience, high-level academia breaks down rapidly beyond the undergraduate level.
