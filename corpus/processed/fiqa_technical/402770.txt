While my kids are definitely into video games and such, they are also still very much into toys. If Toys R Us has what we're looking for, we'll go get it there. However, that is usually not the case and we end up ordering it online. Additionally, the price difference on a lot of toys is usually significant enough that we'll lean towards an online purchase over in store. I get why it's more expensive and I try to buy local but I'm also not made of money.
