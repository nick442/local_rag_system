Sears has been around for over a century with little impact to local Main Streets. Their stores aren't in every community like Targets or Walmarts, and they don't attempt to be a one-stop shop for all your needs. Sears isn't a threat to mom and pop shops.. and that's probably part of why they're struggling while other big box retailers are not.
