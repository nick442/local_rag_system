A/R-A/P are accounting side, doubtful they will need knowledge of SQL. That is more the trading floor/Risk Management sides or people using large volumes of data from my experience. To be honest 1-2 years of experience is used as a deterrent for people like you, that just graduated. Use any contacts you have at all, and if those are exhausted go and speak to someone. I can assure you that speaking to someone will get you much farther than just submitting an application online. Good luck and make sure the job is a right fit for you.
