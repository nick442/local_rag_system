"Parents, especially Boomer parents, remember that ""trade workers"" are always short-term workers, the first to be laid off while the office accountant and the engineer keep their jobs. Welder/Fabricators, machinists, mechanics and such spend a great deal of time out of work; have to move around the country often chasing work; and, they usually have to accept indirectly supporting their employers monitarily (having to purchase and maintain expensive equipment which gets worn down during work) which means they actually make less than is usually stated. The only ""trade workers"" who have done well long term are plumbers, electricians, and HVAC -- but this only works for them when there is a large pool of potential customers like a healthy middle class. With the middle class vanishing, they will not do as well either. Same is true for dentists, oddly enough. Don't think the trades are a safe harbor for work income -- they never have been."
