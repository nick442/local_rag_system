"Reddit is mostly for links (title+link), look at this very post or at /r/all. Self-post on the other hand is title+""your text, which could include links"", like posts in /r/self. I didn't see pure links on Steemit, it's similar to /r/self, full of unique posts. That's what I meant, it's maybe better content-wise, but not for me, I am a bad post writer :)"
