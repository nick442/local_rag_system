"It all depends on your loan contract, and the way most are written, the 10 day thing will not help. However, assuming that the contract is written in such a way to allow this, the difference will be negligible. By ""saving money"" I assume you mean the amount of interest paid. There is really two ways of doing this. If you carry the loan to term paying the indicated amount on the due date you will pay $6,140 in interest. An increase of over 33% to the cost of the car. Yikes, that is a lot of money. You should seek to minimize your interest expense. One way to do this is to reduce your rate. Applying for a new loan that is at a more reasonable 6% and continuing to pay the ~285 per month will reduce the term to 59 months and only cost you $2,245 in interest. A large savings. Even better is to work a second job and earn an extra 1,000 per month. Then bundle it with your 285 payment and shoot that at the loan. This way you will only pay $965 in interest, and have it paid off in a year. Once you do that, you can stick $300/month or so in a savings account or other investment and pay for every other car in cash. Making choices like these leads to building wealth. So the question becomes do you want to spend the rest of your life on the hamster wheel of car payments, or do you want to spend one year in pain so you make smart choices in the future? The choice is yours."
