>As it turns out, the idea that your parents paid less for their house than you will is only true in absolute terms People carrying a similar amount of mortgage debt doesn't solidify this conclusion at all, as people have not been buying houses because they can't afford them. There were about 600k new home sales this year vs about 800k in 1985; despite population differences of 323m vs. 238m.
