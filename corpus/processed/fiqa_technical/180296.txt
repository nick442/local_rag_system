Ok, fair enough. But Russian news agency posting about dangers of more sanctions is about as surprising as tobacco company writing about benefits of tobacco -- of course they'd write that. It just. doesn't add any useful information. And the article doesn't contain much aside from the quote anyway, and a link to RIA Novosti. If this was an article from Economist, or another reasonably respectable source that is not normally aligned with Russia, and if it had a bit more analysis, it would have been an interesting read.
