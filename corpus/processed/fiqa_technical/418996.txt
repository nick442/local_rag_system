">One key aspect of that is that -- via the ""in the door ahead of time"" -- even IF the company requires the HR process to be followed, the job spec can be ""constructed"" to match the pre-qualified candidate, and his/her resume can go to the top of the stack (already being in the manager's hands with a hearty recommendation/endorsement from one of his critical team members: i.e. ""HIRE this guy/gal!"") I've seen that happen many times. It happened with the position I'm in currently. I started out as a temp. Originally the job ad was some aimless posting about needing a new accountant, the accountant didn't even need a college degree if they had equivalent work experience. Then all of a sudden one week the posting changed to a copy-paste job of my work and educational experience (much more demanding than the previous ad)."
