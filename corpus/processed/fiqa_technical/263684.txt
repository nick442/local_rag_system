"I have no idea. It's astounding. A buddy on Facebook was asking if he should stay with Verizon and get the iphone 4. I said, ""why? It's a little kids screen with capped bandwidth?"" It was a rage-fest of people defending the iphone AND Verizon as if they owned part of the company - I don't mind the iphone, mind you, it's just reminiscent of Chevy vs. Ford- But to defend a company that charges you more and has a cap is just.. scary."
