"As others have said, that's really just when losses got marked. For example, let's say I buy a cupcake for $1, and someone else says ""hey, I want a cupcake too"", and tries to buy it from me for $1.50. Then someone else bids it up to $2. A baker says ""wow, there's a lot of demand for cupcakes"" and starts making cupcakes instead of bread. Then someone says ""I should buy a cupcake, as they keep going up in value, even though I only really value the tastiness of a cupcake at $2. I'll buy the cupcake for $2.50 and then sell it for $3!"" Prices rise to $2.50. More people do the same thing. Cupcakes start going for $10 a cupcake, and tons of people are stopping whatever they were doing before and just baking cupcakes. A few years down the road, cupcakes are selling for $15 a cupcake, and some people have many cupcakes as investments. People are borrowing money to buy $15 cupcakes with the hopes that they will turn into $20 cupcakes. Now, everyone is valuing their cupcakes at $15. There are maybe a million people, and they average 1.5 cupcakes per person, so we thus claim that we have $22.5M in cupcakes. Finally, someone says ""Wait a minute. I have three cupcakes. I don't actually want to eat *three* cupcakes, and we're running out of people to buy cupcakes. I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to actually sell these to anyone. I'll sell my $15 cupcakes for $14.70 and make a bit less money but be sure to sell the cupcakes. And I really don't want to *eat* cupcakes at all if they cost $15/cupcake."" Everyone else repeats this, and cupcakes plummet to $0.50 in a month. Now we value our total number of cupcakes at $750,000. Now, did that month cause us to lose $21.75M in wealth? Well, the way we were accounting for the cupcakes, certainly that's when we made the numbers reflect our assets not being $22.5M. However, we'd actually produced far more expensive cupcakes than society wanted; the claim that we had $22.5M assumed that people would keep buying cupcakes based on past price increases rather than because they actually wanted cupcake. I think that it would be also fair to claim that our wealth was never $22.5M in cupcakes, because there was never a point in time when even the total population wanted to spend $22.5M on the consumption of cupcake; instead, its purchasing was driven predominantly by the desire to gain from the appreciation of cupcake based on past appreciation. The dark month when cupcakes fell is just when we realized that we didn't have $22.5M in cupcake value."
