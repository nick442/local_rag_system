Lot of factors in play. We use a lot of local produce but we need the volume to support, so if all you have is a few pallets it's not worth the logistical cost to get it out to the stores. We also inspect all of our produce so it's not as simple as delivering it direct to our stores because we do not know the quality. Smaller farms will usually try to get with a packer or broker so they can sell as much as they can without having to do the business side themselves.
