Oh crap that came off wrong the last full republican in my family was my grand father and we barely religious I think the last time we went to church was for Christmas because my sister is big in the church. I'm honesty most rural people would prefer if the government was hands off. I will agree that a lot of people just vote strait red which irritates the piss out of me. And trust me we hate our representation with a burning passion but we are fight the far bull headed right and left in our politics out here
