I place 90% of the blame on Carly, and then the board: that bitch was primed by her contract to gut and fillet the company. When a board links a CEOs remuneration to annual profit, it makes unscrupulous individuals do things which have clear and obvious negative long term impacts, but which will hike the annual profit for THIS year and another YEAR or so, but then turn badly negative. Because Carly is a little bitch, and wanted to extract as much money as was humanly possible from her position at HP, she embarked on the most disastrous set of actions possible. The direct result is what we see now. CEO compensation should NEVER be linked to profitability for an individual year, but to their performance throughout their tenure, and then beyond. It's my belief a CEO should take a base salary of no more than 50 times the MEAN worker's salary is. NOT the average. Because that simply encourages the board to enrich the management team, rather than the workers. If the company is profitable for a single year, CEOs should receive a large bonus - say no more than 20 times the MEAN salary at the company. AND 3 years AFTER the CEO leaves, he'd be entitled to another round of payments base on long term performance of the company. This means CEOs have a duty and a very large responsibility to ensure that their replacement is actually a better CEO than they are! When board members leave, there's no incentive to them personally, to ensure their replacement is even capable, let alone excellent. The other issue I have with CEOs is their stock options, or stock grants. I believe all companies should have strict rules about stock ownership by the board. They must own a certain number of shares, and those shares must be purchased before they join the board, and demonstrably NOT by any mechanism which the company pays for. Directors and officers with no personal investment interest in the performance of the company are a concern.
