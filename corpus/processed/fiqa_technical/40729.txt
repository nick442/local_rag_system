Goddamit, Benzinga and their clickbait headlines. OK, Rant over. The bit about having zero hobbies unrelated to work (1) sounds like classic Wall Street, nothing new there and (2) seems like a great way for most of us non-superheroes to burn out. I read fiction, play with my kids, work out, etc. More sustainable for a great many of us I would think.
