Since you already have established a set of expenses, most importantly your rent. Blair Hodgson DuQuesnay said, “You don’t want to spend more than one-third of your take-home pay on your housing, whether that’s rent or a mortgage. With almost everything else, you can work from there.” She also recommends that your static bills — housing, utilities, and other fixed expenses that recur monthly — don’t take up more than 50% of your budget. If you can keep them even lower than 50%, like, say 40% or 35%, you’ll have even more spending money for everything from food to clothing to savings. So basically, it is time to start to be worried if you are exceeding half of your budget on your expenses. Forbes has an excellent article on how new grads can plan to budget their money.
