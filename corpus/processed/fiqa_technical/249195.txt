"My point was basically anti-capitalist: my landlord is a leech, and a rich leech who dodges their property taxes at that (did I mention my landlord is **MIT**?). There's no actual reason my building *needs* a landlord other than ""because capitalism"" and ""because MIT and Harvard are always sitting there waiting to buy any property that comes onto the market in Cambridge""."
