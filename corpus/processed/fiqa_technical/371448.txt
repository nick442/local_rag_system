Fair enough. Many different programs to collect forecasts from various populations have been done, and are in fact still currently being run, so I have no info as to how or why what you're doing is any different. This kills a lot of my interest. My gut feeling is this is some soft social science / liberal arts approach to forecasting. Given no evidence otherwise I'm not really interested but good luck I guess.
