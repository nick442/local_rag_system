You probably have a UMTA/UGMA account. While the money in that account belongs to you, as long as you're a minor (which is until the age of 18, in California) - you cannot directly access it. Instead, your parent(s) or guardian(s) or any other trustee manages that account for you, with your best interests in mind. While you may want to spend that money or give it away to your boyfriend or whoever else, it is very likely not in your best interest to do that. That is why your dad refuses. He has a legal responsibility, which is called fiduciary duty, to ensure the money is spent in a way that is best for you. If the fiduciary just lets you spend the money away - you could later, when you're no longer a minor, sue that person for the breach of trust. When you're older and a bit more mature you'll be able to make your own decisions and do whatever you want with that money. But as long as your parents have the responsibility to act in your best interests, it is likely that your boyfriend will stay in Pennsylvania for a while.
