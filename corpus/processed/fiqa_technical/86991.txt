I see what you mean, but I still believe that for as knowledgeable as these guys are it was basically a hopeful and deceptive way for them to dump the bad mortgages that they pushed their employees to give to people. They can play dumb all day and I guess that's how they got around this but it's pretty shitty all around. If you're saying they did something wrong and the public is saying they did something wrong then I wonder what Ben Bernanke was thinking or how nobody, even before shit hit the fan, had any questions about what was going on. The whole thing smells fishier than fish.
