I work in a bank and see these people first hand. It’s kind of sad really. They come in to open a business account. Full of excitement for this new “business opportunity”. After a month or two of holding wine parties with their friends and family and making some sales they realize they can’t be hounding their friends and family to buy from them. Their excitement turns to tempered optimism as they try to come up with more ways to drum up business. After failing to do so they come back to me, defeated and close their business account. They’ll never tell me exactly why they closed, it’s always “Oh, I just don’t have time” or “I’m working too much at my regular job” but I know. It was a scam all along.
