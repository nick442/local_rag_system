"What options do I have to transfer money to UK from Pakistan ? You can do a SWIFT / International Wire. Most Banks in Pakistan will allow you to do this. Note: Pakistan still Manages Forex and it is not freely convertible. You would need to comply with Foreign Exchange Act. You have to fill Form ""M"" giving the details and purpose of remittance. In these 5 years they bought 2 properties on my name for me worth around £12000 x 2 = £24K, based on currency conversion rate of that time. You would need to pay capital gains on this sale in Pakistan. You would also need to declare this gain in UK and pay taxes accordingly. Some relief can be claimed under DTAA [Dual Tax Avoidance Agreement]"
