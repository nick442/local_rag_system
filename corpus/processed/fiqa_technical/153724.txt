So I'm not an expert regarding this topic, but the languages i have heard thrown around are vba (excel), R, stata and python. Out of these, I think python is the base foundation and then Vba for excel. Whatever you do, research into these fields. For example, I use to think IB was the end goal without even knowing wtf they do, everyone just kept on talking about. They are just high powered salesman. Also, sadly the truth is if you aren't from a prestigious school high finance is out of the question. Don't waste your time. Also, don't think it's something you are missing out on. Their lives suck was from what I hear and plenty of money can be made elsewhere. My friend went to cal, got into boutique Ib, he quit after a few years stating his life was miserable. Fuck that. As an economics major you will find out that happiness is important. Spend your time wisely. Career choice is a big decision.
