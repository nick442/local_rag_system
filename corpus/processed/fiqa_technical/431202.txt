This is exactly what needs to happen for the benefit of the country. Don't make this a republican vs democrat thing. The mortgage interest deduction causes artificially high home prices and discourages building small affordable homes. Home purchase prices falling means builders might start building smaller, cheaper homes again. If it causes a housing crisis, it will be for those who bought 3000 sq ft Mcmansions on what used to be farmland. Removing the state and local tax deduction means there might finally be incentive for cities to consolidate local townships and increase overall efficiency again. The ultra-wealthy townships that keep poor people out through high taxes will decrease and join other larger local governments. This would be a huge plus as far as tax reform goes.
