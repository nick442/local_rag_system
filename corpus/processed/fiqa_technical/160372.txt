Merging? If anything the opposite is happening. Oil companies are moving in the opposite direction, separating their upstream (extraction) and downstream (refining) aspects. ConoccoPhillips just did this and others will follow. Refining isn't very profitable and involves lots of danger, red tape and headaches. I look forward to the people who complained about the evils of mergers and vertical integration now complaining about how spinnoffs are the new evilest thing ever.
