"In personal finance, most of your success is determined by personal habit rather than financial savvy. Getting in the habit of making regular deposits to your savings account will have a much larger effect on your situation than worrying about which account pays the highest interest rate (particularly as neither one of them matches the current inflation rate, which is over 3%). So go ahead and put your money in a savings account, but not because of the interest or safety, but because it's a ""savings"" account."
