> 1)They are the product (or maybe even part of the cause) of suburban sprawl. They encourage car usage and, by virtue of their need for large open areas to be constructed, are often far from where most people work and live. As a result, patrons have to drive large distances from their houses/jobs to the shopping centers. > 2) The parking lots are tremendous waste of space and hugely damage the environment. Outside of major cities with public transit infrastructure, where ARE people allowed to go then? And not even for shopping, but pretty much everything outside of the home in these locales requires cars/driving. That's just reality. And, actually, I think it would be better to concentrate businesses into one dense area like a mall and then people aren't driving all over hitting up a bunch of different stops. And, >4) Once they are built and then closed, the space where the centers sat is basically abandoned and turns into blight. Depending on the businesses that were housed in the mall and the businesses that were supported by the mail (especially gas stations), these sites could be toxic. I think this would be considered a sunk cost. The malls are built. If they go under now, then this bad stuff will happen. If anything this is an argument why this news is bad for the environment.
