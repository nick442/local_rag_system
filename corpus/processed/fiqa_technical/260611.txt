I don't think BB sells $300 suits. I think they're going to be more like +$800, but it has been awhile since I've looked. As far as shoes, yeah, I meant Allen Edmonds for AE. They're like the entry level for nice shoes. They're not cheap tho. The benefit to them is that they look a little nicer, and should last much longer if you take care of them. AE sells their factory seconds at: https://shoebank.com/ Ive gotten two pair from there and haven't been able to find the defect. As far as which black shoe, that's up to you. You cannot go wrong with their park ave's, but they might be a bit formal. I have the Mora's, but I wouldn't recommend monk straps for your first pair. Maybe consider a dark brown shoe. It will look a little more natural with the Navy suit, and is arguably a bit more versatile. The stand is always a good option.
