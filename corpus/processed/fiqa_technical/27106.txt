"To claim medical expenses on your taxes they need to exceed 7.5% of your AGI, and then only the amount over 7.5% is deductible. That's not much. There is no ""floor"" if you use an FSA as it's all pre-tax. If you're concerned about use or lose, then allot less next year. It's all what you're comfortable with."
