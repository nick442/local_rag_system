Doesn't most of the time either in this job market. Losing a job over 40 is a pretty big deal. Even bigger when there's a real danger of being out of work for an extended period. Honesty as a young person you have no idea how rough it is on older people to reboot a career..on top of losing more than half of your wealth and having way fewer years to recover. There's a lot f kids right out of college that can't get jobs and that's true, but when the economy recovers there'll be a lot of you in the same boat, meaning the hiring pools won't be able to be as sticklers about no experience. Just like when the economy recovers and banks want to start lending to homebuyers in bulk again..so many people ha e bad credit from the collapse that they won't be able to set Ã¼ber high standards across the board in lending or the simply won't have a big pool of eligible applicants. At some point millenials will be hired en masse as the economy recovers. The same is not nearly true for a forty something with a big unemployment gap. Over 50, forget about it almost entirely.
