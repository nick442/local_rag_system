Many times, specific CEOs are hired by the board in part because the board members will also at times in the future possibly be in the running to be the CEO of a company, and the previous CEO's they voted for in may wind up being on the board of the company they want to be CEO of. So one hand makes damn sure it's washing the other. It's a very incestuous process and not uncommon for CEOs of one company to be sitting board members on another.
