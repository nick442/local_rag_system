">If you don't like it you can either vote for representatives that will remove these sorts of welfare payments If you support this position you are a heartless social darwinist. > or you can supply the workers with better-paying jobs. Jobs do not just ""happen"" they exist to fill consumer need. You could do some Keynesian government job expansion if you would like to temporarily and artificially create more jobs, but this is only a bandage and is not a desirable nor a permanent solution. In order to do that you have to have real growth in the economy and a government cannot do that on its own. It requires those who have capital to invest it in new ventures."
