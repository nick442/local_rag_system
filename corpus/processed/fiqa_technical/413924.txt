I could be wrong but by acquisition all it does is kill competition that a company faces. By killing competition is it explicitly implied that they reduce innovation within the company? If they aren't faced against competition they aren't forced to compete and innovate. But is this always the case? Is there any reason why these companies would invest in R&D after their acquisitions? Also what would this mean for the consumer, by acquisitions and reduced competitions we we as consumers have no choice but to pay up whatever they charge. I wonder if governmental agencies would place a cap on the prices they charge?
