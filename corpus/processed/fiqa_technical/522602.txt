Look. I don't contest that Sony is an *immense* company, nor that they make a lot of shit. You're obviously right, and the stuff I wrote sounds ignorant from your perspective. Got it. And I'm not saying Sony isn't selling a bunch of hardware -- the PS3 has slowly made up for its ridiculous launch -- but things are changing. Sony isn't the market leader it once was. The kids don't *all* have Playstations anymore, neither do they have Walkmans. What I am saying, though, is that once I have Netflix on my PS3, why should I buy a PS4? Sony could have been their own damn Netflix, but they end up making just the machine Netflix runs on -- and making it physically painful to get Netflix to install and run. *That's* my point about software killing hardware.
