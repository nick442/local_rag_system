Marriott is an international company that has developments abroad which can act as a buffer for volatility. People aren’t going to stop traveling, they just won’t come here and Marriott can take advantage of that with their properties abroad, but there are plenty of other companies that can’t. You may not buy it because you’re too busy sucking Trumps dick, but you’re missing one other important fact. Guess which countries we get the most tourists from.. I’ll give you a hint one of them eat lots of tacos and the other likes maple syrup. We get almost half of our tourism from Mexico and Canada. Mexico accounts for a full quarter of our tourism. http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/view/m-2016-I-001/table1.asp The argument isn’t about the economy overall. It’s about the tourism sector. Trump is lucky that Obama set him up with a strong economy, but he still manages to threaten it. And he’s really threatening the tourism sector of our economy. I’m not going to hold your hand while you suck Trumps dick. You’re going to have to pull your head out of your ass yourself. If you want to remain skeptical it’s your right. You can remain ignorant all you want. After all, Trump rose to power on people’s skepticism of experts. If that’s the road you want to follow good for you but do the rest of the country a favor and go fuck off to some deserted island where you can shoot yourself in the foot without hurting the rest of us. This shit isn’t hard to understand. You just can’t admit that your hero is actively fucking this country over. Like I said, do your fellow countrymen a favor and fuck off. The country would be much better off if all you Trump supporting idiots removed yourself from politics and stopped trying to intervene in issues you don’t understand.
