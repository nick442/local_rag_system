Don't try because it's a moving target. A thriving economy on paper can be entirely valuation based. It tells you nothing about distribution of wealth in the economy. The majority would be destitute and we could still be talking of booming times if speculative markets can find creative ways of growing valuations of existing assets with credi growth. All that is needed is for two people to bid a painting to 100 million for the painting to have contributed positively to a growth in the value of goods and services in the economy. The same is done with intellectual property and corporate valuations. Good times are times when capital gains can be seized on account of expansionin of credit or government spending. Recessions are closer when governments try and pull in more than they spend and when lending can't expand. Government spending is increaasing these days despite talk of the contrary.
