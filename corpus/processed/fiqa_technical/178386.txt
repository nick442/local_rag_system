"No, it doesn't look like you can use the employee benefit to pay for parking near your home. The definition for ""qualified parking"" is in the Internal Revenue Code Section 132 (""Certain Fringe Benefits"") (f) (5) (c): (C) Qualified parking The term “qualified parking” means parking provided to an employee on or near the business premises of the employer or on or near a location from which the employee commutes to work by transportation described in subparagraph (A), in a commuter highway vehicle, or by carpool. Such term shall not include any parking on or near property used by the employee for residential purposes. Parking near your home is explicitly excluded. Your employer's human resources department can probably provide information on the details of where you can park and get reimbursement."
