It depends. CPA (or CA as it is known in the commonwealth countries) can be looked upon favourably in advisory positions in an investment bank (M&A/ECM). It is a good grounding and a detailed knowledge of the accounts is very useful when it comes to understanding a company and valuing it. CFA is more useful if you're interested in a) becoming an Equity Research analyst or b) going into funds management.
