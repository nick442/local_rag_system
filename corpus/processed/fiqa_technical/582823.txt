30billion is spent in venture capital and women only get 1.5 of that but what if men are seeking funding at a rate 30:1 compared to women. Then that statistic is much , much different and actually sounds fair. The fact that there is no data for that when it is extremely relevant leads me to believe it is intentionally left out.
