"The issue with college is the current ""business model"" which is to get as many asses in seats as possible. Colleges were initially designed to teach a select few, and not intended for mass attendance. The day colleges went from being institutions geared towards attracting like-minded people interested in intellectual pursuits into education factories crumbling under the weight of administrative bloat is when the classical concept of a college education died. We don't educate people anymore, we process them to fit a particular mold in the labor pool. That being said, if you are someone who is genuinely interested in educating yourself, college is still the way to go. Just be aware of what you're getting yourself into, and understand that a degree is not a ticket to employment."
