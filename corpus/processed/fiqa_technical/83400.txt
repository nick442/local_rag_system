">millenials will all of a sudden start making a **shitload of money** in 10-20 years. Somebody has to empty the bedpans of (not to mention ""wipe the arses"" & give sponge-baths to) the bed-ridden nursing home & hospitalized Baby Boomers. Just make certain you charge enough (and only accept ""tips"" in the form of cash -- like $100 bill for a *good* sponge bath, or a thorough ""wipe""). That way it really COULD be a ""shitload"" of money. (Because what goes in must come out.. and what goes around comes around, and all that.) ;-) --- >Many will be stuck in menial jobs their entire lives, simply because noone would ever give them the experience needed. Yes, but ""menial jobs"" does not necessarily mean ""low paying"". Ask your garbage man (or your plumber, if he'll bother to give you the time of day to ask the question that is). When just about EVERYONE wants to be a college professor, and NO ONE wants to collect garbage; guess which one will make better money? Someone has to collect all the garbage those college professors generate (and if that someone is ""rare"" then he can charge those professors a lot). Its all about supply vs demand."
