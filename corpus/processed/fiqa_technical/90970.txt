It is not what I think that matters it is what a statistically significant number of people at any one time think. Credit scores will be obsolete the moment enough people stop paying attention to them regardless of what I may think. I don't spend any real time with outrage as it inhibits problem solving. Laws (and regulations) often follow the collective will more than they advance or shape it. Governments often only react when they have no other choice politically. But most government regulations wind up being like Tipper Gore telling Frank Zappa to tone it down and he telling her to go fuck off.
