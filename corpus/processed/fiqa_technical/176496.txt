"I think it's because reputation is extremely important. Have you heard of Arthur Anderson? There were five large accounting firms, appropriately named the ""Big Five"". It is now the ""Big Four"". Arthur Anderson were the ones handling the Enron financials. Anyway, what do they really have to gain from colluding with the firms they are auditing? Continued business is one possibility but in the grand scheme of things it's not going to be that much money, at least not enough to risk the damage to reputation. Even if the firm being audited threatens to take business elsewhere if they don't fudge the financial reports, it would only be a credible threat if the other firms were willing to collude with the firm."
