This doesn't shock me. I actually look forward to it. I find that TV quality has taken a real nose dive in the last 10-15 years. The Learning Channel is just pregnant teen midgets, the History Channel is now about truck driving hillbillies and aliens, and discovery is .. well I don't even know what it is anymore. It seems those channels are changing to favor those who still like tv - and the people still watching tv enjoy teen pregnant truck driving midgets.
