After their residency, doctors aren't OVERWORKED, they just work hard, like most other professions, and don't have time to perform their own clinical studies to vet the medications that are provided for them to prescribe. No hospital/practice/doctor has time for that except maybe a very select few. The only law against nurses that I'm aware of (I'm sure there are others so feel free to fill me in) is the one that requires that there be physician oversight for certain procedures, which makes sense because if doctors weren't necessary for anything except surgery, there would be no doctors except surgeons. And the limit on medical schools is a fascinating point. I hadn't heard about that, and I think that it's quite bad for costs. The only upside is that it ensures that the quality of doctors stays as high as possible, but I can see how that comes at a serious cost.
