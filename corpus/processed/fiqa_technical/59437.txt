There is not a permanent deficit. The budget was balanced when Reagan took office. He ran up a massive deficit. Clinton balanced the deficit he inherited. W then ran up a deficit again. Obama inherited a trillion dollar deficit and reduced it to 400 billion. Now it is going to go up again. I am seeing a pattern here.
