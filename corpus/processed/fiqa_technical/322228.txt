If you want to do asset management or investment research, look into the [CFA Program](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx?WPID=Programs&PageName=Homepage). If this looks like your cup of tea, I advise registering for and taking the June 2018 CFA Level I exam. You will receive all the books you need to study.
