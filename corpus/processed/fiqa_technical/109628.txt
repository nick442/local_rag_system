Say your bank gives you a loan at a fix interest rate. They can loan money themselves for a floating interest rate. So they try to find someone who will pay, or take, the difference between the fix and the floating interest rate on your loan. That's an interest rate swap and there is nothing evil about it per se. Derivatives are like knives, you can use them for live saving heart surgery or just butcher a kid in a back alley. The inherent danger lies in the fact that it is easier to create than to understand complex derivatives. This can lead to both sides believing they made on the derivative transaction, a logically impossible situation. Therefore it is always good when derivatives are traded in a transparent, well-regulated market, where current market price is determined. But then the expected profit margins are small, so investment bankers will always try to find more exotic derivatives (think of a blindfolded kid using chainsaws for brain surgery). We need standard derivatives or we have to re-think the whole finance world from grounds up, without any guarantee we'll find anything working any better. We don't need exotic derivatives, they're almost exclusively there because people shoot for bonuses.
