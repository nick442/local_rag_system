Of course this ignores that fact the companies remit some pretty hefty VAT (Value Added Taxes) when they sell all there stuff. There is a 20% VAT on what they sell, then subtract the VAT of the stuff they buy, and I'll ballpark they are sending a good 10% of Gross (So 300 million Pounds) to Her Majesty's Treasury every year. Not bad for selling overpriced coffee.
