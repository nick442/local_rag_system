>And a lot of people that have communist party wealth are afraid that there will be an uprising against them so they are preparing escape plans. My guess would be more along these lines (albeit maybe a bit less dramatic). There were a lot of dubious things that Party members did over the past hundred years to stash away cash for themselves. Siphoning off public resources, investing with them, and as long as the investments made money, keeping the results, for example, played a significant role in some of the complaints that farmers had about local officials. If they keep money in China, and there's some sort of fallout or charges that go through, my guess is that it's a lot easier to seize a corrupt official's resources. On the other hand, if you just bought a bunch of land in the US..that's a lot less easily-seizable and harder to immediately get ahold of for Chinese officials. There's also the more legit possibility that China quite arguably has a real estate bubble in investable real estate, and the result is that if you want to invest in land and reduce your risk to a bubble deflating, you want to do so overseas.
