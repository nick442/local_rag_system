The thing is, one of the primary reasons tickets cost so much (the entire price including fees) is because the bands require more money than ever. Competing ticket vendors usually only cost a few dollars less than Ticketmaster. So, there's not really much of an alternative (on the whole .. I'm sure some bands out there would play for less money under certain circumstances) .. until the next shift in the music business becomes clear.
