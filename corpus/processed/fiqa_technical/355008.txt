I just don't think thats such a rip off considering what it is you are getting, but you are calling it unrealistic. A fresh double cheese burger with unlimited toppings/sauces, hand cut fries fried in 100% peanut oil (..and they really do not skimp on the portions for fries its usually enough fries for at least 2 people its usually like 1/2 a paper bag full of fries), and a drink where most of the five guys i have been in have the soda machines with 1000's of drink choices, and to top it off there are free peanuts. You say their food is awful, but i don't really see what there is to complain about. Its 80/20 beef that is never frozen, fries that are cut fresh right in front of you and fried in quality oil (peanut oil is fairly expensive as far as cooking oils go), ive never had issue with the freshness of the vegetable toppings. Am I missing something here? I think that's a pretty solid value for $12.
