almost all unions want the business they are in to survive. Most of the stories you hear are such an extreme outlier or just plain made up. Believe it or not, everyone in the union, wants the corp to survive to pay them retirement benefits. They dont want to rape the corp like corps rape resources. They want fair pay. They want pay to go up when the company does better, just like companies tend to demand pay cuts or fire people when the company does worse. quit treating people like a commodity and instead treat them like actual people helping your actual corp to actually grow.
