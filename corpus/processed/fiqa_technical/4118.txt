I didn't say they didn't do anything wrong. I said that criminal fraud is both difficult to prove and expensive to prosecute and therefore jail time was never a real possibility. They could have other regulatory transgressions that the government his hitting them for. Or more likely, it is just a shake down where the regulators promise more harsh sanctions or bad publicity that would actually cost BoA more than $16 billion in the future. The fine is a way for both parties to save face.
