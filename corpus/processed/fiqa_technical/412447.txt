I think rather than simply being about a surge in demand for craft and local food, this might be a short-term consequence of millenials' delaying the start to their families. I went to chilis, applebees, ruby tuesday's, and other mid-tier, dine-in restaurants when I was a kid for what could be the same reason as every other kid: the food was better quality than McDonald's but still relatively cheap, the atmosphere was family friendly, and you could trust the continuity of the foregoing across different cities. Millenials like local and craft vendors when they have the money to spend, but they still love the hell out of some Popeye's and Chick-fil-a, which are anything but local. Why go to RT's if you don't have the problem of having to feed a bunch of picky kids who wouldn't know the quality of local fare anyway? Just my take.
