"This will do nothing to prevent the market being a casino as there are plenty of players in the market capable of out witting you at lower frequencies that HFT. In fact most of the money small investors ""lose"" do not go to HFT strategies, but to lower intra-day and multi-day strategies that are just smarter than you are. I really am confused at this anger at HFT. It is very poorly informed. The people stealing your money are lower frequency hedge funds. HFT steals money from THEM. In any case, the market was *designed* to be a casino because without speculators liquidity really *does* dry up and people lose faith in the market."
