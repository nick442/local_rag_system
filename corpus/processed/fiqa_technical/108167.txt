"This reminds me of what Digg did when they tried to force ads on to users and displaced part of the social aspect of Digg. The users left in droves. I'm sure they were thinking ""surely all these eyeballs must be worth a fortune!"" They in fact were not. Social websites will likely never be big business. As soon as they try to fully monetize it all falls apart. They all think they can get the same ARPU as Google. They can't. There is one Google. There is only one company that arrived first at the full-scale realization that during a search is the best possible time to place an ad. When the primary interaction sought is social then every ad simply gets in the way. And that friction builds as the company tries harder and harder to inject the ads between the user and the social. Having said that, Facebook can do fine. They will likely make enough money to keep the servers running. They'll just likely never see Google level ARPU."
