Either you use absolute standards to calculate poverty or you use relative standards. If you want to use relative standards it's an obscene argument, there will always be poverty. If you use absolute standards you cannot arbitrarily exclude the rest of the world. It's about purchasing power, not nominal incomes. You are discussing nominal incomes and using a relative standard of poverty. You mine as well just say 'I enjoy being unhappy about the world and have set forth to define the world in terms which make it impossible for me to be happy about it. Not trying to start an argument, that's simply economics. Not even saying you don't have serious and relevant gripes. But this article is not going to help present those issues in a way that they can be taken seriously. I would recommend reading some material on developmental economics. Become informed so you can define the argument in intelligible language.
