The goal of a good IPO underwriter is to set the price such that it brings as much money as possible to the company. * Too low: Early stock flippers get the money that should be going to the company. * Too high: Not all the stock gets sold. By that definition, **Facebook should be recorded as the most successful IPO of all time**. The problem is investors have gotten used to incompetent and/or corrupt underwriters that set the price too low. The company gets screwed, but the underwriterâ€™s buddies make some quick cash on the flip.
