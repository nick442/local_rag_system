from my experience working in the family business, the first step is to make sure you HAVE the authority, one of the problems I encountered was that we were given managerial positions were we not empowered to do anything, which created many problems which comes to my second point, make sure you have clear roles and responsibilities, you have to know what you should be doing, if you don't, find out asap what you and your other managers are supposed to do, and lastly, make sure there is accountability and every family member and employees must be treated equally so that if your employees or you yourself don't do something you are supposed to do, you can be held accountable for your actions, you won't believe how easy family members get special treatment, how family members miss deadlines and nobody cares, and how family members are managers when really they are just daddy's spoiled puppets being there to be peons (not to think), and Facebook more than usual. I recommend you read all literature you can get your hands on on dealing with family Enterprises and how to deal with common issues, good luck, I for one am desperately searching for jobs outside the family business because I can't take it anymore.
