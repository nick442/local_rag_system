"The only reason taxes are ""needed"" is because the people are to ignorant to know there are better more moral systems out there. For instance instead of stealing hard earned money from people tax the money they spend ie federal sales tax. ""How is that any different?!"" Because a sales tax isn't theft it just raises the price of products you want to buy, this way there is no tax dodging and no imprisonment for keeping what you earned and what is rightfully yours"
