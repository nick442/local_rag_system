>What do you think of the argument that corporations shouldn't pay any tax, since investors pay tax on the dividends, and if the corporations paid too, that would be double taxation? Nobody that's actually serious makes this argument (at least not the way that you wrote it). Some people argue that corporate taxes should be eliminated and that capital gains and dividends should be taxed the same as ordinary income.
