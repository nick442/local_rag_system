> The solution is a progressively higher tax on second, third and fourth properties. And an elimination of tax on first properties. This has some flaw to it -- but someone else smarter than me will figure it out. I'll try to think about one flaw. If you tax 2nd and 3rd properties then possibly the renters market would go up to cover the cost of the tax that owners of multiple properties would have to pay.
