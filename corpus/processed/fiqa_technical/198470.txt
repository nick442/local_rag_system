"And what exactly have the effects of that been? Hmm? It seems to me that you just disproved your entire point. The fed created a ton of money, it quadrupled the monetary base. And inflation never hit 3%. In fact, most of the money never left the banks. It's sat around for almost a decade as excess reserves. Basically, the fed ""printing"" money didn't do anything except the bare minimum. The vast majority of that money never even made it into circulation; they aren't even real paper dollars, there were not paper dollars printed. They've never been anything more that an electronic accounting trick on a fed computer to give the banks confidence in their balance sheets."
