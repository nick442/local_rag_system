"Well, they probably don't offer health insurance at all. That means they will have to pay for administrative costs, which are likely negligible for a company that already has HR infrastructure. But the kicker is this: ""employees may not be forced to pay more than 9.5 percent of their family income "" So..if you are paying a someone $2.13 an hour plus tips out of a tip pool (let's say that ends up at $10 an hour -- probably a little high but it will suffice) at 40 hours a week: $1700/mo - SS and taxes..lets say $1500 and they get a $450/month PPO plan (employee only), the company is looking at paying $300/mo per employee. More for those with families. Since they are only paying employees $362/mo out of their own coffers since the remainder are tips, their labor costs increase by about 70-80%. Of course, this only happens to employers that treat their employees like garbage. Personally, I'd wonder if what they are doing with their tip based wage is even legal. Sure doesn't seem like it should be."
