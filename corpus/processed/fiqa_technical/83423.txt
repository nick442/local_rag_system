+1 for using the time constructively. Anyone who sits around doing nothing, and waiting for someone to tell them what to do is not going very far in the world. Not a comment on the OP, as I don't know if he sits around doing nothing, or spends all the time doing really boring work. The latter sucks, and all I can suggest for that is either quit or be the best at the job that you can (but not so good that they don't want anyone else to do it).
