Private industry is not inherently more efficient; it's all about incentives. Competition creates efficiency. Bureaucracy reduces efficiency. A large poorly run company without real competition has no incentive to be efficient. Give a large company a 30 year exclusive contract with no strings attached and they will almost certainly perform worse than the government. Write the contract such that it has to renewed every 2 years and their pay is based on performance, and maybe it will be more efficient. Of course corrupt politicians don't write contracts like that.
