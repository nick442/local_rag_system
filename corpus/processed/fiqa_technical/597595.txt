"**Q: ""Why aren't you giving your grandmother children before she dies?""** A: Stop being selfish, it's my life and I decide what I want to do, whenever I want to. **Q: ""I bought a house at 23. Why are you still renting?""** A: I want to be very wealthy, and not have my own house owned by a bank for 3/4ths of my life. Worry about your own life. **Q: ""Who is going to take care of your parents when we they get old?""** A: I'm going to be doing that, and my parent's retirement will help. I'm going to be able to do that because I decided to be financially intelligent rather than indulge in selfish personal pride and temporary happiness. **Q: ""If you don't have X by age Y, then there's something wrong with you""** A: Fuck you, I'm rich. Have fun with your wife and kids while you slave away hoping for a raise someday and pray for the weekends to come. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- I've used all of these except the parents getting old situation. Stop letting other people dictate what's important in your life. If your parents are mad that you won't have kids or get married, fuck them. You got a nice loft, an AMG Mercedes, a Lexus, saving for a Lamborghini, and enough money in the bank to make people feel inferior just by looking at your account balance. Not to mention that's it's completely possible to have casual, safe sex with many women nowadays. But hey man, make your family happy and appease society. Lol, hope it works out for you."
