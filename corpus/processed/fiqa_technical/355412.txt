"Oh sorry maybe I misread your question. The article didn't have anything concrete. I just watched the video to see the there was some clear examples or data but I didn't really catch anything. He said something about Trump not wanting to create jobs and said ""Chinese are working on AI"" because the gov't announced a plan. But he offered no real data for his views at all from what I heard. I'm not a specialist in economics so maybe I missed something obvious that someone else can clue us in on"
