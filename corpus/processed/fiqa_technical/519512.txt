True. Unless the government steps-in and make some regulations. For example, all customer service (talking to other people, also over the phone) must be done by humans. Also, humans must approve every decision and diagnostic done by AI machines. Every group of robots must be supervised by on-site human. Etc. However, I am against taxing Robots and AI machines. The bottom line, with Robots and AI doing most jobs that humans don't want to do or are not good at doing, humans can be happy if they have basic income, which can be very low because Robots and AI reduce the costs of goods and services tremendously.
