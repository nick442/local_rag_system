I think you've confused what I am saying here, as are others. I'm not making an argument where I say either private insurance vs. government management vs. single payer is best, because to me you are just arguing whether its more effective to shovel coal, wood or crumpled up paper into the fires of cost inflation. The systems in the US, and all other OECD nations are actual quite similar, despite the semantic hair splitting of partisans (With ACA our system is quite indistinguishable from that of the netherlands). My point is that none of these systems contian costs, therefor none of them solve the core problem. To put my point another way, As long as you fund health care through a financial product like insurance, whether it be public of private, you are going to see this level of inflation, just like we saw in housing prior to the sub-prime bubble, and just like we are seeing now with college tuition.
