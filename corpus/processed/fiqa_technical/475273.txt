If someone invest certain amount on my company and after a year I am able to return the exact capital with the profit, what will I do to that investor? Did the investor receive shares in the company for the money that was invested in the company? This is the big question here as if so then there isn't the need to return the money but rather grow the business so that the investor's shares are worth more. Will that person still invest in my company? You may need to consider what you mean by invest as generally there are a couple of ways to finance a business: Equity - Ownership of the company is sold to raise money to run the company. Debt - The company is lent money that is to be repaid over time. Investing is usually the first case not the second. What if I have enough profit to continue my business, do I still need that investor? You wouldn't need the investor. However, you may want that investor as they could provide more funds, connections or other benefits to the company that may be worth considering here.
