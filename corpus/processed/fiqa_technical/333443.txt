> Your question is expressed as a run-on sentence, which I'm having trouble parsing. Maybe you could restate. The one in the title? If yes, here it is restated: *As I currently understand, we owe much of our national debt to ourselves. The reason for this is that people are being charged interest that does not exist in the system. Therefore, if we tried to pay the debt (like some conservative politicians are fighting for) it would be a massive transfer of wealth from the 99% to the 1%, since most of the debt is owed to the 1% (banks).* So I was wondering if this conclusion/summary/understanding is flawed in some way.
