If there's a general trend, be it debt, incarceration, drugs, whatever, black folks tend to take the worst of it. Prior to the 80's, 70% of tuition costs were picked up by the state, and the overall costs were reduced by schools running sideline businesses like farming and applying the proceeds towards costs (Google 'land grant universities'). They were typically managed by tenured faculty, and a summer job could pay the difference. Now the schools are run by businessmen and investors, with the goal of making as much profit as possible instead of education. The state now only picks up 30% of the cost, and student debt tends to average about 30k+. 10 years of summer jobs would barely make a dent in that.
