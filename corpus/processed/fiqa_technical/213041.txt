So am I to understand that giving AAA ratings to financial instruments backed by toxic mortgages had nothing to do with this problem? That selling mortgages with one hand and betting on those mortgages to fail with other is a reasonable business practice? No doubt the push to give more poor people government backed loans exacerbated the problem, but making that claim that that was the only problem seems about as valid as claiming that Goldman Sachs was responsible for everything.
