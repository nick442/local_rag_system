Or how about Applebee's food sucks. Same as Olive Garden or Buffalo Wild Wings. I would rather spend the same at a mom and pop shop or maybe a little more for something not made out of a bag and microwaved. If I was going to do that, why spend 12 for a meal? Just go to Taco Bell. Perhaps failing restaurants and brands should stop blaming millennials and come to terms that they are simply out of touch. Sorry Applebee's, your more expensive than panera and your food is shitty.
