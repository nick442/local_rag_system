yes . the 20% are well-off and don't understand the problem of the 80% that's why Trump's policies are actually beneficial to that 20. Add to that some ambivalence in the next 20 (say half of that), leaves only another 16% or so of votes to pick up from the ignorant and fox-brainwashed rustbelt and voila he gets 46% of the vote and the presidency.
