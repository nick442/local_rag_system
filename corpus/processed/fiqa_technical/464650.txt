The closest thing to purchasing prospects we did was buy an email list that contained the names of several thousand people who fit our profile. Personally, I am not in favor of doing that. The companies you are buying from really don't understand what you want and you end up getting a hodge podge of information that never really gets you anywhere. Outside of that I am sure there are other services that provide prospecting, but the best lists are always developed internally. Good luck!
