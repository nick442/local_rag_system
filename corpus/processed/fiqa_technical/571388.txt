Lyft isn't farther behind because they want to take care of their employees, they're farther behind because they've raised less money, because they were second to market. Both are running at a loss trying to grow, but Uber's got more cash so it has expanded farther. Lyft has taken the high road to build its brand and because Uber's made it easy. Uber has branched out into other service (parcel and food delivery) in order to build its brand and grow further. Both companies realize they're in a commodity industry - there is little non-price differentiation in the service provided - and they need to achieve massive scale so that they can start to turn a profit. But right now, it's Uber's game to lose, at least between the two of them. Somebody else getting a large lead in self driving cars could crush both of them pretty quickly.
