"Regardless of if the 'higher profits' are create from higher volumes and more workers, the key word there is PROFITS - not 'revenue', not 'income' or any similar word. PROFITS - a word used to describe the amount left AFTER paying expenses - such as the salaries of those additional workers (if any). The point is, the worker deserve a share of those profits. It is their work that has made them - in addition to the work of the CEO, of course, but still..the CEO could not have created 'better margins' or done 'better deployment of capital' if it were not for the efforts of those workers in the first place. This is the main problem with the economy right now. No one feels the responsibility to those who have helped them succeed. They keep using a 'slash and burn' financial strategy - slash salaries and benefits and burn up your labor force to extract every dollar you can for the top. The only problem is, now they're running out of things to slash and the workers they've burned have nothing left. And they wonder why the economy is in the crapper. I keep being reminded of a quote from Ladyhawke as said by the evil bishop: ""I raise their taxes, only to be told there's nothing left for me to tax. Imagine."""
