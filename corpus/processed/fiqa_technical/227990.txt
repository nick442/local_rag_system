I'll probably be downvoted to hell for saying this, but why is it considered so normal that so many people are overdrafting their account all the time? Whether you're poor or rich, there are a plethora of free tools out there to help you manage and keep track of money. Wells Fargo is doing shady shit here, but if you spend 14 seconds watching your money every day (so you know what your buffer is), they would never be able to do this. Pay fucking attention to your money and you'll lose a lot less of it (in all areas of life).
