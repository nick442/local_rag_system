I've operated our family owned lan center with PC's and consoles for the last 4 years and some change. If you ever want to discuss your business plan, target demographic or any other aspects of the business please feel free to contact me. www.level-up-augusta.com http://imgur.com/gallery/S67t0 I've talked to current owners, people in various stages of planning, and others that are just testing the waters. The facts are LAN centers don't fail any more or less than any other small business. There are plenty of ways to make this business model work.
