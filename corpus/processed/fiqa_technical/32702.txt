I know you're making a joke, but I really think Tesla could kill off train transportation entirely. If you can get in a car anywhere in the country and travel anywhere else in the country, more or less in a straight line instead of following the few rail routes available, then it just comes down to price. If they're able to make long distance travel affordable with cheap, renewable electricity charging up the cars, then Amtrak will be history.
