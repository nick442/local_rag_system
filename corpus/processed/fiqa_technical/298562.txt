The better question is, since MS is on the way out, who will take their place? <crickets> Apple doesn't have an exceptional server platform, and Linux (as much as I love it) isn't going to take the world by storm on the desktop. I think that you are right though. Until there is a replacement, they will continue to be the go to.
