"Yes, the ""speed bump"" explicitly can not impact the reports to the SIP. Two years ago this would not be a big deal, because the SIP was stupidly slow, especially under load. So, you send your report to the SIP faster than you publish your own market data feed, and the SIP just takes forever to publish, meaning your own market data feed still gets to the clients first. Now that the SIP is blazingly fast this is no longer the case. You still, as an exchange, have to publish to the SIP first (or, within microseconds of jitter, at the same time) but if you have some sort of artificial delay on your market data that is longer than the SIP processing time the SIP updates will arrive first. Doubly so if the consumers are colocated with one of the SIPs. Edit: For what it's worth, [Matt Hurd has a pretty solid write up covering NYSE American, but it pertains to IEX as well](https://meanderful.blogspot.com/2017/05/nyse-american-attack-of-clones.html) [BATS also comments on this phenomenon in their SEC comment letter on NYSE American; see footnote 1 on the first page](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysemkt-2017-05/nysemkt201705-1718167-150440.pdf) (pdf). The link is somewhat recursive, since it points back to another of Hurd's posts, but still just as accurate an assessment."
