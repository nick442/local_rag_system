So I recently had to help with the installation of 16 televisions and two were defective. One would not stay powered on for more than a few seconds and the other had a bent frame/bezel. Have always had good experiences with Samsungs previously but in this instance the bad sets were Sams and the few LGs purchased were flawless (one had questionable CEC support but that was easily resolved with an external IR blinker). These were all purchased at a local store and while it was inconvenient to make trips back to the retailer and get grilled about the issues, it was resolved more quickly than it ever could have been with an online retailer (and this store was price competitive with Amazon, cheers to you Fry's).
