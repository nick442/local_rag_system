> Taskrabbit is available in London. There were a couple of other startups in the UK before taskrabbit launched but their websites seem to be dead now. I know it is available, but that is not the same as adapting for a new market. London is not SF. I suspect the employee ruling on uber Wil come down on task rabbit/udesk too.
