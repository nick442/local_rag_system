The first thing to do would be to decide what action will change the states. Take one example, “moving clothes from washer to dryer” (or whatever). If there was something you could print with a bar code on it for a given load, you might scan it when it moves from the washer to the dryer, then update some trivial database that the customer app could look at. Is that what you’re asking about?
