Same here. I work with realtors on a weekly basis and they all have given me this advice: if you have parents/grandparents/rich uncle, etc., that might be leaving you money when they pass, swallow your pride and kindly ask for it now. Get into the market as soon as possible because this catch 22 is not going to change anytime soon.
