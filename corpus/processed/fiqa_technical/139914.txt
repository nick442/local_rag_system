The way you would limit downside risk is to buy a put option, allowing you to sell anytime within the next n months for the current price (assuming american).

This type of strategy is also known as a ""protective put"". http://www.optionseducation.org/strategies_advanced_concepts/strategies/protective_put.html If you wanted to be more refined you could use Ak's bands, although you have to be looking for that specific outcome.
