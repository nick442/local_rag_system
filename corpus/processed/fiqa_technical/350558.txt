"I particularly enjoy **coming back** to those with a bit detailed breakdown, a plan, saying ""this **will not** be done in that time"". It takes stature in the workplace, but works wonders. I have seen tasks taken from me and taking longer to be done by the other guy. The other way around, not so much."
