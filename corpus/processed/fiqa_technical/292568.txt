I'm right in the middle of Gen X. While I don't hate Applebee's, I never go. They're on the expensive side and all of the small local restaurants will serve a better meal at half the price. I'm also cooking more at home. I recently bought a high temperature grill from a restaurant supply company that I'm installing at the house I just bought. It's the same thing restaurants use, so I will have the same food for 10%-25% of what a restaurant charges. The bottom line is that Applebee's charges too much for their product. The product is OK, and I've had really good service at Applebee's. The servers are usually nice and competent. But I can't pay $15-$20 for a meal I can knock off for $3 or get at a local reataurant for $10.
