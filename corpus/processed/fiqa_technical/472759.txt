What's it like being all the way up on that pedestal without having a clue what you're talking about? Are you dizzy? Do you have to apply extra Sunscreen to your upturned nose? When you read that one Wikipedia article, and 3 Forbes links are you just overwhelmed with the strength you just acquired, or have you felt this Supreme power all along? We have so many questions! Please answer them with vague, nondescript platitudes and more questions please. That would be awesome.
