Journalism is a dying profession. As the internet proliferates, the speed of information advances and society has less need, and even less patience, to wait for professional story tellers to communicate to us. As a clear example of this, look at how main stream media sources (i.e. CNN) regurgitate people's twitter feeds in everyone of their headline articles.
