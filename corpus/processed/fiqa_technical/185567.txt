> The United States has more Nobel prize winners than any other country by a long shot. We also have the third largest population in the world, and the highest GDP in the world by far. We spend more on defense then the next 7 countries together. We spend more on [health care per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) than any other nation in the world. We also have the [highest expenditures as a percent of GDP](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.TOTL.ZS?year_high_desc=true) than any other nation. Needless to say we spend a LOT on health care also. The point being if we *DIDN'T* have the most nobel peace prize winners, with all the money we spend on R&D, then there would be some serious issues. > We have arguably (in spite of the fda) the best medical services in the world. Again, you need to travel. While, yes, we spend more on health care than any other nation, and we do have arguably the best health care services in the world.. that is mostly only true if you are very wealthy. When you break it down on results per dollar spent, the US doesn't even break the top 20. When you break it down on infant mortality, and life expectancy, we have been on a backward slide for a while now (although those rates improved for the short while that the ACA has been in effect, as have the net increase in costs). At the end of the day, the cost of health care has grown 3X faster than inflation, and 20X faster than the average income for over 30 years now. So, no, [health care in this country is not the best to the average person](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries/). And yes, Space X has been able to estimate a savings of $300M less.. Commercial does a great job of expanding on the research and knowledge that has come from government sponsored R&D. You see that in every modern technological advancement - from the internet, cellular phones, GPS, medical procedures, etc. There are so many modern inventions that have sprung from government patents and government research programs.
