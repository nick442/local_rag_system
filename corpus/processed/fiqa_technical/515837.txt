Happened with my family. My wife could not work for an extended period after birth of our first child. At the same time I was injured and due to the injury the doctor would not release me to return to the same position so I was let go. It was a good paying job at the time. To top it all off if we both picked up minimum wage jobs working we lost all food benefits and could pay our bills but not afford food. We also had to work around each others and our parents schedules so we had someone to watch our baby. If we were paying 100+ a week for childcare while working we would have been starved.
