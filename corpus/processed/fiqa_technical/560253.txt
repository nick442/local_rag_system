In addition a lot of people are simply rather uneducated on the subject. For me personally, the debate of whether or not it causes OD (which it obviously doesnt) or if it causes side effect A or B really is moot. Why do some people believe they have a say in what another human being does in private with a God damn plant? I don't understand the mind set. Nay, I don't understand how we all got struck by this collective God complex.
