I'm a little confused on why this article is even on /r/business. First off, this is a purely opinion piece from someone who seems to have only ever written opinion pieces. Not to mention gives you a feeling that she's trying to tell her buddies in college how cool she is for being such a hipster. Second, there's practically nothing that discusses the business of TJ's. Yes, there's vague mention of it having a strong following and staff that knows the products, but that's about as much as is mentioned. Seriously, this just seems more than a circlejerk article than anything. Can we please keep these type of links out of /r/business?
