I don't believe I said anything about the stock market going down, which happens regularly. It's not like municipal bond markets crash very oftenâ€”once every few generations, maybe. So her being off by a couple years would be insignificant. Not saying I think it's going to happen. I'm just posing the question. If the municipal bond markets crashed within the next year, she would be vindicated.
