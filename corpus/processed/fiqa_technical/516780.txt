"Summarized article: Barnes & Noble Inc. revealed on Wednesday that the tampering of PIN pad devices in 63 of its stores was a well-organized scheme to steal financial information. Criminals had planted a ""bug"" on a single PIN pad device at each store to capture credit card and PIN numbers. Affected stores were found in California, Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Once Barnes & Noble learned of the breach on September 14, the bookseller halted use of PIN pad devices in its 700 stores. The retailer's College Bookstores were not affected. Barnes & Noble is currently working with the FBI and with banks and payment card brands to identify accounts that may have been compromised. * For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit"
