Neither party gives an F about the consumer. The real issue is class action lawsuits, in which the consumer gets shafted and the lawyers make a killing. Real class action reform would not come in the form of favoring arbitration over lawsuits (or vice versa) but in requiring that attorneys’ fees in class action suits be paid in the same form as the payment to consumers and requiring that people opt-in to join a class, rather than having to actively opt-out. Ending payment of attorneys’ fees in cash but consumers getting coupons (which are only good one buys more of the alleged wrong-doing firms’ products/services) would ensure consumers get a fair shake. This would hurt the lawyer lobby, and thus most Democrats (and many Republicans) would never support it. Requiring people to opt-in to class-action suits (rather than go through a long process of opting-out) would reduce the number of frivolous class action suits. Again, this would hurt the lawyer lobby, and thus most of our politicians wouldn’t support it. In short, it comes down to most Democrats favoring the lawyer lobby over the business lobby, and most Republicans favoring the opposite. Neither cares about the consumer/citizen.
