"The Facebook ad sales aren't ""concrete"" enough for you? Look dummy, we know for a fact that Russia interfered with the election. No serious person disputes that. What we don't know is how far their efforts went, but that's what we should expect because until he's done building his case, Mueller isn't going to reveal what he knows. At this point, while it's still somewhat reasonable to be skeptical about the extent of Russian interference, denying that it happened at all just makes you look stupid or insane."
