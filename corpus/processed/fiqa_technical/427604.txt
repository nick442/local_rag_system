Jamie Dimon, calling bitcoin a fraud for price bubbling is hilarious considering JP Morgan literally got bailed out by US tax dollars for investing in trash mortgage loans. Ok. Knocks aside, I'm just buying low. The problem with financial analysis on bitcoin is that inevitably, financiers don't know anything about computer science, and they aren't in the business of making applications. Bitcoin is an application of an interesting concept: the distributed ledger, and the ability to have a distributed ledger verify and lock the ledger. The problem with this analysis is that he doesn't have application knowledge to infer the positive externalities of having a distributed ledger, and most of those use cases for the applications are in their infancy, or haven't been though of yet. Blockchain is an idea that can later power other tools. It's like when the Microsoft CEO said Apps aren't useful on phones. He didn't see the big picture, because the use cases weren't defined yet, and the same thing is going on here. We haven't really fleshed out all the possible use cases of a distributed ledger with a decentralized oracle. Does it work for payments? Yes, bitcoin is proof of that, and the fact that it's been bailed out a total of zero times by American taxpayers is so far a strong indicator that it works. Are there other applications that are being developed? Yes. Are there some applications out there that are absolute shit? Yes. Are there some applications out there that are absolute gold? Yes.
