"Sovereign immunity is the state's ultimate ""get out of bankruptcy free"" card. After all, the state has a hand in defining what bankruptcy even is in their state. Federal law is a framework, states customize it from there. The state's simplest tactic is to simply not pay you. And leave you scrambling to the courthouse for redress. Is that an automatic win? Not really, the State can plead sovereign immunity, e.g. Hans v. Louisiana, Alden v. Maine. You could try to pierce that sovereign immunity, essentially you'd be in Federal court trying to force the state into bankruptcy. This would pit State authority against Federal authority. The Feds are just as likely to come in on the state's side, and you lose. Best scenario, it's a knock-down drag-out all the way to the Supreme Court. You would have to be one heck of a creditor for the legal fees to be worth your trouble. States don't make a habit of this because if they did, no one would lend money to them, and this would be rather bad for the economy all around. So business and government work really hard to avert it. But it always stands as their ""nuclear option"". And you gotta know that when loaning money to States."
