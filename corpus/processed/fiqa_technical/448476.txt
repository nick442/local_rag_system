"Yes we lose some client business to algos - specifically the DMA (direct market access) side of things. I haven't seen much HFT impact on what I do. I see the movement towards algos/automated trading and DMA over the next 5-10 years, and block traders like me going extinct eventually. But this all assumes liquidity, which is not there in the product I trade. So you still need a dealer who knows where the blocks ""live"". You want to buy 5% of that issue? okay good-luck trying to do that in the market. No algo will help you do that without moving the market against you."
