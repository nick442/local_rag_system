The last thing I bought there was a barbecue for my dad. I needed two accessories that were on display with it as well, but they didn't carry them instore. So I had to go online to order them.. from two different places. And one of the part numbers I was given didn't match anything, so I had to call on the phone and spend about 15 minutes with someone figuring it out. It was a less than stellar experience.
