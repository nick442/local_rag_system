>u telling me there were that much savings and reserve in the system? Yes. You're telling me there wasn't? The loans were bundled and *sold to investors* to get more capital to loan. It was not magically created as you seem to think. [There were about $4trillion saved in the US at the time](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/WSAVNS). The mortgages were sold all over the world, where there is easily more trillions of savings and reserve. You still have not addressed M2 being around 10x M1. You keep floundering but not addressing anything of substance.
