"I took a chance on a 2015 Volt after swearing off American cars back in the 90's. It's a great car. The reason I took the chance was that the Volt was a project that was supposed to ""save GM"" back when American auto makers were about to go under a while back. They poured a ton of R&D money into it, and it paid off. I'm very satisfied with mine."
