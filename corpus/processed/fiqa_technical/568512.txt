Are you referring to my standard that companies should not be corrupt if I'm going to give them my money? I think that's a pretty good standard to live up to. Don't be corrupt, and I'll give you my business. If you are corrupt, dishonest, if you victimize your customers, or if you take advantage of other businesses for profit in a malicious fashion, then I'm not that interested in doing business with you.
