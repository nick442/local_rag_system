Awsome thanks for the tips! I had the chance to choose in the Emerald Aisle at National which car when I was in LA..and they had base model Mustang vs Camaro vs Challenger..and in the end I went with a 300C but next time I'll try for something a bit sportier. I've heard that the visibilty in camaro is bad and the challenger is a whale..so Mustang may be best choice between the 3
