Yeah. The drive to do this kind of thing at a federal level is pretty much dead unless there is some kind of for-profit road company that can start privatizing roads. Then they could open up the gusher. I feel conflicted over it. I remember during the Stimulus Act a lot of roads were repaved and they're now all shit again. I question why crushed gravel and oil is really the very best we can do when it comes to roads. I know some roads that get scraped, then paved and STILL are full of bumps. They inevitably start cracking and failing almost immediately. Also, no matter where I go in the US the tech being used to resurface roads looks positively ancient. I've seen other countries use very advanced machines that resurface and pave quickly in one pass.
