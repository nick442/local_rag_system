Why? You will rarely find a good deal at a liquidation sale...liquidators will come in and raise the prices well above what they ever sold at (higher than Kmart's average retail price) then slap some fake % off sale on it. The real deals are in the last couple days when everything is 90+% off..and even then, you might not find a great deal. (Kmart near me went out years ago..went on the last day and picked up a bunch of supplies they used in the store like copy machine toners and flipped it on ebay).
