Oh, I can't wait! I need to upgrade that bladeless fan. Seriously, **the Dyson fan does have a blade, at the base,** and it wastes tons of energy trying to push the air through a narrow circular opening on top. Also, Dyson solved a problem that was solved more than 100 years ago using a cage over the blades. And the 100 years old solution also allows to easily clean the blades. Try to do that with a Dyson or Tower fans.
