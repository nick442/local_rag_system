"To the topic, and answering some of the questions below.. People ""drop out"" of the workforce in a number of different ways: - Ideally, and most constructively, people go back to school. This might be line-cooks or fast-food workers pursuing a culinary or hospitality degree, or liberal-arts majors whose publishing job has evaporated going for a Law or MBA. If you have a desire to go back to school, a job-recession is a good time to do it. - Often, it is something where one parent in a two-parent household decides to stay home with the kids, when they can no longer earn more than day-care or pre-school costs. If Mom's job prospects are paying $12/hour, minus taxes, and child-care costs $10/hour, it often makes sense for her to stay home, at least until the kids are in public school. - Sometimes it's just genuine early-retirement. Some real-estate salesman in his 60s who was hoping to earn for a few more years sees the current glut of short-sales and foreclosures, and how hard he's going to have to work for every dollar, and decides he can live with Buick instead of Cadillac in his golden years. - Some of it is ""semi-forced"" early-retirement, where bagging groceries doesn't pay any better than social security, so an older worker decides to make ends meet. - The worst and ugliest component, and sadly a common one, is premature/unnecessary disability claims. Down job markets produce a spike in claims of permanent disability. They are not all entirely fraudulent, but inability to work due to vague-ish chronic pain, psychiatric problems, back/neck injuries from fender-benders, slip-and-falls, etc go up in recessions. There is a certain ""watching daytime TV with lots of lawyer commercials"" effect among the unemployed, and one way or another, people are vastly more likely to end up on government or insurance-based long-term disability during a bad economy."
