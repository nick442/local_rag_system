"Forbes is simply a well-distrubted content farm. Forbes doesn't write articles to ""inform the reader"" or ""make a coherent argument."" Forbes writes articles simply to get attention from crowds to increase readership to increase ad revenue. Forbes' business model is quite simple: (1) hire a bunch of pseudo-intellectual ""executive writers"" and have them scribble whatever idiotic idea comes to mind. And since these ""executive writers"" are such genius, they don't even to do research. The end result is a magazine and website written in doublespeak. (2) have an outsourced bureau in India construct lists of the ""words richest"" and ""most expansive"" things/people^1. This way the publication appeals to the not-so-bright-and-rather-gullible-mid-level-executive manager^2 who is looking at ways to get ahead in his job so he/she can afford to buy Rolex watches and Armani tuxes so they can appear to be rich, powerful, and successful. These mid-level-executives try to implement all the bad ideas they pick up reading in the work place. Of course this nothing new. The majority of business/investing magazines operate in the same manner (e.g. Smart Money, Money, Entrepreneur, etc). Think of Forbes as Cosmopolitan of business periodicals^3. Think of Forbes as Paris Hilton in a crowd of other attention-hungry socialites in front of a bored paparazzi^4. In general, magazines are full of pointless and misleading information--the business of magazines has been marginalized into the business of cheaply putting words (and pictures) between advertisements. Forbes isn't about providing its readers with smart analysis; Forbes is about making a cheap magazine and filling it up with ads. So writers are judged on sheer output, not quality^5. Today an article made it to the front page of reddit titled *89 Business Cliches That Will Get Any MBA Promoted And Make Them Totally Useless*^6 --I found this article to be wonderfully meta, since it implies that people who follow what they preach are useless. This gives me hope. Of course if things continue to degrade magazines will likely be entirely picture based by about 2020^7. Please make it a point to only read/watch/listen/buy media that at least attempts to produce quality and unbiased content. If companies stop getting paid to manufacture shit, they will hopefully stop making shit. **tl;dr** Forbes is a very elaborate content farm 1. Bonus points are awarded for lists that also tie-in three or more cleavage pics 2. there are quite a few of these people 3. Cosmo: ""10 ways to bring your man to orgasm"", Forbes: ""10 buzzwords you need in your resume"" 4. My point being things will naturally become quite obscene/ridiculous/dumb. 5.

In which case, we can only hope that either: magazines go bankrupt, 2012 Apocalypse predictions are correct. edits* grammar elaboration being anal"
