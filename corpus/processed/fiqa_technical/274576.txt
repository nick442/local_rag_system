"This is incorrect. The timeline is as follows: Party A sends a message to an exchange. The exchanges receives the message. The exchange broadcasts the (anonymized) message to party A, B, C, etc on the multicast feed. The exchange broadcasts the (private confirm) to party A. (The last two steps can happen in any order.) It's impossible for anyone to ""beat A to the punch"" because they don't hear what A did until after it's done."
