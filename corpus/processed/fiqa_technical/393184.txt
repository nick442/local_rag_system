"> Soon, you will be able to choose poverty just by deciding to not getting enhanced. Do the Amish live in poverty? > A lot of these arguments seem to be, ""Well, it might be better, therefore it *will* be better."" We cannot know what will work unless we explore the potential space of that which *might* work. Demanding perfect solutions before researching solutions is just retarded. > Right now genetic variability is what gives us long term viability. Will enhancements reduce both? No. Genetic variability is *not* what gives us ""long term viability"". We actually are already losing that as it stands over time, just from globalization and the mathematical principle of reversion to the mean. ""Will we all become super susceptible to the same disease?"" -- That's simply acetious. The entire point of 'enhancement' is that we find strategies for actually improving upon the innate qualities of human existence. The thing about technological solutions to problems is that they produce superior outcomes but require more technical knowledge to achieve. Sure, we might have new diseases -- software bugs, and so on -- but we'll also be more robustly tolerant against traditional diseases. Also -- what exactly do you think all these enhanced people are going to be doing? Keeping things the same? If the concern is about only the rich getting access to enhancements.. consider how much more towards charity work an amplified-intellect would achieve over traditional intellect. And so on. Early on, I'm sure that only ""the 1%"" will have access to anything resembling realistic improvements. But the thing about such a condition is that it's inherently oly metastable *at most*. Technologies improve over time and become cheaper, more stable. Let the richest and wealthiest be the ones who have the access to it when it's unstable/unreliable. Once it becomes like owning a smartphone, *that* is when it'll spread to everyone."
