There are markets in which there isn't a lot of choice to enable downward price pressure, like drugs and healthcare. Also, consolidation always results in reduced consumer choice and, sooner or later, increased prices. That's a big part of why they do it. In healthcare in the US, there is huge consolidation among specialty practices in order to force insurance companies to pay more. E.g, every pulmonologist and allergist in a 30 mile radius from here was bought by the same practice, so now the HMOs are forced to pay the rate this practice dictates. No small practices have started here in the past 20 years; all the new MDs just join the big existing practice in order to fill any increased demand. These practices often pick and choose which insurers they will work with, and they don't take medicare. But this is one example of how markets get demented and harmful (lethal) if not regulated; there are many others.
