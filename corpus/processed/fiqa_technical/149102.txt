Assuming that partial payments are held (without interest) until enough money has accumulated to make at least a full payment, and assuming that overpayments are applied toward principal, a strategy of making three $ 96.00 payments per month will shorten your amortization period by less than one month. These calculations assume that the interest rate is 12.5 percent APR, compounded monthly (with an APY of 13.2416 percent). Instead of 71 payments of $ 285.56 plus a final payment of $ 285.38, you would make the equivalent of 71 payments of $ 288.00 plus a final payment of $ 28.10. If you make one $ 96.00 payment every ten days, you will make an average of 36.5â€¦ partial payments per year, instead of 36 partial payments per year. This will speed up your loan amortization by about another month-and-a-half over the course of the 72 month loan. One month of shortening is due to the extra principal payments, and the other half-month is due to interest savings. To a second approximation, this strategy is similar to paying $ 292.00 per month for 69 months plus a final payment of $ 195.38. In other words, this strategy will probably involve about 212 payments of $ 96.00 each, possibly with a small 213th payment.
