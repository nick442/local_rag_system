I'm not an economIST, but it always seemed to me that if **more** people had **more** money, then **more** exchange AND savings would happen, and that in a market based economy that hinges on buying and selling things having more disposable income to dispose of in the marketplace was a good thing. Always seemed that socio-economic population curves should follow a bell curve that way.
