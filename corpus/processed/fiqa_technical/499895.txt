">I mean, if this were the mortgage market, you would be arguing to banks ""What the hell made you think this homeowner would keep paying you 6% interest on this money when you're not providing any kind of value twenty years later?"" Small difference: if the homeowner stops, the bank can take the home. If the employer stops, the retiree is left with no choice but to try and sue. Perhaps track down some other people whose payments were cut and sue together. As you observe, it's the disparity of strength between the parties that makes some people uneasy about this."
