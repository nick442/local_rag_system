Hmmm. I assume to be accepted into a PhD/masters program without a masters one would have to be an absolute stud though. I come from a school that isn't too hot on academics. It is a large public research institution, but it's not a UT or Notre Dame type school. I guess I should talk to my professors about the whole process.
