"My best tip is to keep getting the interviewer to keep talking. If you can't think of any questions, build your questions off their answers, show them you really want to know more, it works well for you in the fact that it makes you look curious, and it wastes time in interview before they get anymore difficult questions. They expect any intern to be an idiot in the beginning, it will take you quite some time to learn about the company, but the team knows that already, they're looking for ""value added"". Talk about how you can add value, how your experiences in the past can help with any work the company gives. And make sure you learn how to tie a tie, learn the Pratt knot, make sure you're presentable, and most Importantly, be friendly and say good morning to everyone you pass, everyone loves a friendly intern"
