"If you tried to live a 50's lifestyle (a lot more home cooking, much less electronics, a smaller house, a single car etc.) I think you would be able to afford it. Also, I know of several people where the husband works and the wife stays at home - its do-able, its just hard to ""keep up with the Jone's"" bacuase you have half the money"
