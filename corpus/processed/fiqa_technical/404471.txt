"Well said. And I get it, really I do. Rational means something very specific in the theoretical model of EMH, and it's not the same way that ""rational"" is usually used. When a person actually gets to the point where he can trade on the stock market, you expect they would have information like ""know which stock you're trading"". Maybe these people didn't. And even if we assume people have perfect information, they still make mistakes. Regularly. Repeatedly. Sometimes predictably. And those mistakes can overwhelm the right-price-finding effect of EMH."
