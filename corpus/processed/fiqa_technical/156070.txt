I worked in two open office space environments. It is hard to focus when people are eavesdropping in and commenting on your desk conversations and phone calls, and you'd just like privacy to do your work without scrutiny by prying colleagues. When you are in a coffee shop or coworking space, people have completely different companies or projects to focus on. I'd rather a quiet working space, but I'd also rather coffee shop/coworking over an open office space any day.
