FedEx pays what it pays because unlike the Postal Service, they are a competitive entity that earns peoples business. > In response, the USPS has increased productivity each year from 2000 to 2007,[58]through increased automation, route re-optimization, and facility consolidation.[57]Despite these efforts, the organization saw an $8.5 billion budget shortfall in 2010,[59] and was losing money at a rate of about $3 billion per quarter in 2011.[60] They've tried that. They've tried to modernize really, really hard.
