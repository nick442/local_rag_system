I wonder if these two concepts are compatible or mutually exclusive: * The minimum wage should provide a decent living standard above the poverty line * We should have as close to zero unemployment as possible If those two statements are not compatible with each other, then I don't see how prohibiting eligible members of the workforce from an opportunity is at all desirable. Yes, this would mean that some individuals would be earning less money than it would take to make a decent living, but those individuals know who they are -- we don't. Which means that they have the ability to make choices concerning their lives that we shouldn't try to anticipate. If minimum wage is not a decent wage for what they need, they need to adjust their situation to change that. Minimum wage was never intended to be a livable wage, only the lowest amount you could pay someone. I would argue that if someone has been stuck earning minimum wage for more than 2 years, they're doing something wrong. Either they're not trying to advance, or they're not looking for a better job.
