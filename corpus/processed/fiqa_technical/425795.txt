"I largely agree with you; but there's *no way* to make a true apples-to-apples comparison, because we've never had a ""flat"" across-the-board tax rate, and we never will. And obviously, in the degenerate cases of taxes at 0% and 100%, revenue drop to zero. Given that, the closest we can come to evaluating the potential effects of Trump's proposal is to look at what happens when major shifts in tax policy have occurred in the past; and since 1943 (when something approaching our modern tax structure first solidified).. The short answer to that is, ""nothing at all happens"". The *explanation* for that is a more interesting issue (though it boils down to ""if you tax X, people will Y instead""), but the implications for fiscal policy are both fascinating and terrifying: Effectively, if the government spends more than 15-16% of GDP, *regardless* of how they structure taxes, they're spending against the deficit."
