yeah no worries, it's tough right, because uber provides an incredibly valuable service, but i'm amazed at how they're able to get away with not vetting their drivers, but at the same time that sort of lack of regulation is what allowed them to expand so rapidly and provide a (usually good) service. Austin TX banned uber and drunk driving rates went up - (https://fee.org/articles/without-uber-or-lyft-austin-experiences-skyrocketing-dui-rates/) Clearly this needs to be worked out, and it's been pretty clear that the management at uber has been incapable of making mature decisions in a lot of areas, but it's also a positive disrupter because it allows a lot of people who are between jobs or out of work to be able to continue to bring in an income without being beholden to the cab companies that hold the medallions and charge the drivers for use of the cars and licensing. I don't know the answer, I think that by providing the matchmaking service there is a level of accountability that is required for uber's vetting of drivers that hasn't yet been reached, but at the same time I think that the primary burden of liability should fall on the drivers themselves unless there's a reorganization and the drivers become employees instead of contractors.
