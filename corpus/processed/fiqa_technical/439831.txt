That's just one type of strong culture. Take an investment banking firm. Super strong culture - you wear a suit and tie, work long hours, and has formalized hierarchy. This is the other extreme of strong culture. Companies do it because it becomes a self selecting group of individuals, and plenty of research shows that these employees tend to stick around longer and are generally happier. Employees that don't fit that culture eventually weed themselves out and find a better fit somewhere else. We can also compare companies like Facebook to Amazon, both are tech companies, but both have strong but different cultures. The employees that last longer and get promoted are the ones that best fit that culture.
