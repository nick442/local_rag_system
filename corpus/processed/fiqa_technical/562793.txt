"You can, but it doesn't mean you should. You don't actually ""withdraw cash"", the bank gives you a cash loan (called a ""cash advance"") on your card. It will be at very high interest (higher even than your credit card), and they'll also slap you with a bunch of flat fees. Also not all ATMs support it. Better to just carry cash."
