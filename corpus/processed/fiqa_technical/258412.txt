I'm not sure if this is what your looking for but my favorite piece of work was credit card fraud and ways banks are preventing it. Topics included: -Family's at risk (who has the most risk?) -Credit card strip vs chip -Cost on chip scanners for local businesses -Apple Pay and the likelihood of getting hacked -Insurance and how it will cover a business with out chip readers -example of chipotle and target getting hacked -bitcoin and is it an easier source I wrote a paper about 4 years ago, and it had multiple finance topics involved into it. Hope this at least gives you a direction of what your looking for !
