"It is indeed, mostly because the various factors you need to take into account will change depending on the company. An Australian mining co funding a new settlement or harbor has nothing in common with a small European packaging company looking to acquire a competitor, except they both need to raise money. As far as I know, to become ""proficient"" in that field, the only way is to go through heaps of case studies, which won't be found easily outside of the financial world (sell side research, conversation with experienced buy side analysts/PMs/traders or sell side cap markets pros). It is niche knowledge with a narrow focus and a high potential for value added, hence, not really widely shared. The good news though is that it isn't really that complex, it just takes (lots of) work and being in the right place (internship or entry level position in a market or M&A oriented bank)."
