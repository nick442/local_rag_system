"I can see apprenticeships making a comeback. I know of very few apprenticeships these days (I'm guessing most of them were replaced way back with certifications?) The most obvious one is Tattoo artists. To actually work at a tattoo place of business (not a dingy house basement), you must serve for a year under someone who is a legitimate, experienced tattoo artist. You will make half of what the tattoo is priced and the person getting the tattoo is well-informed of who is doing the tattoo. Sometimes they get a discount because of it. After a year, you are certified, and can begin working by yourself and setting your own rates, with a portion going to the business (you usually ""rent"" a room in a tattoo shop). I'm sure these standards vary depending on where you are, but with economics turning the way they are, I think apprenticeships can cover some of the downturn we are experiencing. I'm not sure how much it would cover, but it would cover something, however small. It also weeds out any dabblers who aren't serious and might otherwise produce terrible results."
