Cool. In that case, shooting for the publication on the thesis might not be the best thing to focus on due to the timing etc. If you do shoot for a publication with it, you might want to try for the ABS 3 range or higher. Either way, you'll still want to do really well on the thesis so your advisor can write a good letter and speak to your research capabilities. That's great to mention it as part of your research interest and background as well. The top comment on here is really spot-on. It's not too early to start to dive into some of the finance research (ABS 4* journals and then the journals cited in these journals would be good to start) to be able to identify/discuss your potential research agenda when you apply, and to also hit the ground running with your research. A top pub in doc school and ongoing pipeline would basically be a requirement to land at one of those schools fresh out of your program. It's good to keep in mind that you can move up after your initial placement, but it is difficult. Ideally you'll want to place at the flagship level initially after your program.
