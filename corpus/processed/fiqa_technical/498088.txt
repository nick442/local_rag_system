I've only worked for one firm but thankfully our CIO is technically inclined and has a technology background. Agree on the project management aspect. I'm the tech lead on projects and the PM essentially just acts as an escalation point and needs to ask me for updates/decisions that need to be made. All they really do is watch the budget and schedule and change it as I direct them to.
