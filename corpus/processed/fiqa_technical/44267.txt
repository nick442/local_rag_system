>I'm gonna go ahead and drop this, because obviously your preference is for nobody to show up and lend a hand to anyone, as nobody is benevolent. That is a ridiculous statement. I have no idea how you come to this conclusion. You make the assumption that because I don't approve of theft, that means I want no one to help anyone. That's insane! But not surprising from someone who makes a living from that theft.
