"Total Return is the percent change in value (including andy dividends) of an instrument. The ""trailing 12-month"" means that your starting point is the value 12 months ago. So the formula is: where V is the value of the instrument on the reference date, V0 is the value of the instrument 12 months prior to the reference date, and D is the amount of dividends paid between the two dates."
