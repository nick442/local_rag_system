California has a GDP 60% larger than that of Texas, and this is only one quarter, so I really don't think cherry picked data for a 3 month time span proves dick. And why don't we look at Kansas' growth, the real dream of supply side economics (while the state is being crushed by debt and an inability to raise funds). The point being if a state is run so poorly that it can't even provide basic services its only a matter of time before businesses leave to go to states that can provide things like roads and other infrastructure.
