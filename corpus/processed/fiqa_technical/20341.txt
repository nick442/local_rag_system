Ok, so let's just think about the IQ curve for a minute. We know that over 50% of the population has lower than average IQ. We know that toward the lower end of the curve, people are really dumb. Some of these on the very low end have federal assistance due to their handicap. It is not politically correct to call them retards because they are a natural product of nature special ed instructors say. So, let's play the banking game. Pull up a list of all of the customers activity and graph out the frequency of those who overdraft. Hey, would you look at that, there is a curve and some of these people are overdrawing a lot more than others. Most customers overdraft rarely or not at all, but there are a few who do it all the time. These are the retards and the banks prey on them. These are the same folks who get 50% interest pay-day loans. Never-mind the fact that banks have been given money by FED. Never-mind that they can park their money overnight and earn great rates for free. Never mind that the US government, soon to be replicated by governments all over the world, has stolen tax dollars from the population at large and given it to these banks without a moment of hesitation because they are too big to fail. No, the problem is that these retards cannot balance their checkbook, therefore, it is their own damn fault. And for those who prey on the weaker, the down-trodden, the mentally challenged. Good for them! If you're too stupid to balance your account, then you deserve to be raped by big banks and the governments who are in bed with them. Now, get on the other side of the IQ curve you fucking retards!
