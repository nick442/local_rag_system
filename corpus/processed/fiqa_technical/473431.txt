It's not the city it's the Port Authority. It's a special multistate police force. The PA is the reason the tapanzee bridge was built in such a dumb spot. The bridge had to be built 25 miles from the statue of liberty so the state of ny could collect the tolls. If it was built within 25 miles the PA is in charge.
