As an American living in Canada, you don't get it. The USA wants all of us expats to pay taxes twice. No other country but one does that. If the USA would follow the rest of the world and not tax profits again after being taxed abroad, these companies wouldn't leave. We could be having a better conversation here, but it's meaningless buzzwords of patriotism and boycotting. Burger King will have growth and profit internationally. It makes more sense for them to focus on that. If they end up with 20% of their profit from the USA, why would they pay 120% taxes? Obviously it's not quite as simple as that, but you get the general idea. The last thing our politicians want is us talking about eliminating double taxation. Just as you can't be tried for the same crime twice, you should not be taxed twice. When BK pays local taxes in whatever country they're in, whether it's lower or higher than the US is irrelevant. Taxes have been paid. End of story. Doesn't matter if it's a lower rate or creative accounting. It's done.
