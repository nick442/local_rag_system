@garbonauda Thanks for the explanation. I was just going by a McDonald's and a gang of McDonaldnista's forced me into a McDonald's and required me to purchase a Big Mac. The article makes it sound like this is a great victory for South American socialist democracy! LOL. I'm quite sure that there are at least a few Bolivians who developed a taste for this quintessentially American fast food. I actually prefer their processed, pressed, pork patties shaped into bones and rib meat. Add some barbecue sauce and a couple slices of pickle, remove the excess onion, mmm-mmm good. Well, at least the first two. After that, ugh.
