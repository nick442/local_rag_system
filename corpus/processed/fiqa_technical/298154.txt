I used to be both a customer of theirs, and of NetBank. When ING bought NetBank, I felt like they handled the transition very poorly from a customer-service standpoint. I felt like they didn't really value me as a customer, and they didn't do anything to make the transition easy for me. For that reason, I decided to pull my money out from all of my accounts I had with them, and I have never looked back. I now get considerably better rates with a high-yield rewards checking account at my local brick & mortar bank. I am still able to pay bills online, or mail checks into my local bank if I don't want to physically go to a branch or ATM.
