There's also no way we'll ever walk around with computers in our pockets that can calculate a trajectory for a lunar insertion orbit in less than a second yet we all do. That we've gone through two major employment revolutions (industrialization, mechanization) and there's still in general enough things that people have to do that we can rely on employment to drive the economy I don't see that being a guarantee that this will continue for a third and fourth rounds. So we pose a 'what if?'. What if there is another revolution in automation and we no longer need people to move things around, sell things or clean? That covers all of retail, shipping and most service sector jobs. Even if we still need some people in the loop we could see what happened to manufacturing where employment drops 10:1 or 100:1 because all the grunt work is now done by machine. What happens when there's no more jobs that you can do without a Bachelors minimum education? There are a lot of people who just aren't cut out for those kinds of jobs and would hate having to do them - not to mention do them poorly. What does that world look like? Yes it's the stuff of Sci-fi right now but so is today's world to people only 40 years ago.
