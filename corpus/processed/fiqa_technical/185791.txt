Depends on where you live. I live near RTP, and our tech sector was hit hard. IBM is the worst for job cuts. Even when business was booming in the area, it was hard to get an entry level position. By entry level, I mean basic networking A+, CCNA level stuff. When everything went pear-shaped in 2008, my friends in the IT industry were dropping like flies. Most of them had 15 years or more in experience, were highly sophisticated, and current in their skillsets. I know things are a little better in the Midwest, and towards Cali. The only place I know is in an economic boom by experience is ND. $1500 signing bonus at Sears. If you do skilled work, you get paid a premium. Housing was two years out on a waiting list. Just ridiculous.
