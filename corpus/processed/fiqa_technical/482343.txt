"The rate for ""checks and transfers"" is set by each bank multiple times during the day based on the market. It is as opposed to the rate for ""cash/banknotes"", also set by each bank, and the ""representative rate"" (שער היציג) set by the Bank of Israel. These rates can be found on the websites of most banks. Here is Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi. The question is which bank's rate will be used. It might be the bank that issued your card, El Al's bank, or the credit card company (ie Poalim for Isracard or Leumi for CAL). You will need to call El Al to verify, but since these are market rates, they shouldn't be too different."
