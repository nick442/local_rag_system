I usually go at dinner time, 6:00pm-6:30pm, usually it's fresh but last week I went and the burger was just wet and gross and couldn't eat it all. I agree lunch time is usually safe but I don't understand why it wouldn't be fresh at dinner time either. It's like trying to get back that first high I just can't seem to get there anymore :(
