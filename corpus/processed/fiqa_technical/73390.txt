Where do I stand with this? The money was not your's. So co-operate with the bank to get this sent back ASAP. It is good that the equipment is still with you. Yes Bank would need evidence that you were a victim and not party to this crime. Co-operate with the relevant authorities and get this resolved. It is a lesson learnt where luckily no money was lost, but quite a bit of hassle and personal time lost.
