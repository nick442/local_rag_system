So they're saying that Apache published a security flaw, script kiddies in china started scanning populare sites for an opening, and they found the hole in equifax. They then spent **months** exploring it, before they sold the opening to another unnamed group who exploited it. Why would anyone jump to a conclusion that it was state sponsored? > some investigators inside Equifax Ohh.. This is just an internal group trying ot justify the company's massive fuck-up. Okay. Got it.
