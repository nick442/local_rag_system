Sounds to me like this restriction is limited to banks as issuers of convertible debt, which may affect their compliance with capital requirements, but is unlikely to affect the overall market for convertible debt. Also the restriction is limited to retail investors, and I think most convertible debt offerings are not aimed at retail investors, so this restriction seems pretty limited to me.
