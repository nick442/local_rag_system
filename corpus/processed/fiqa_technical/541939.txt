"IMO: If you look long and hard enough at your data you're going to bump into these kinds of ""patterns"". There is no ""curse of 7"". â€œLooking at the chart makes you want to hide under your desk when you see it, but remember this is only a sample size of 11, and the average performance is greatly skewed by big drops late in 1907, 1937, 1957, and 1987. Also, consider that 1907, 1937, and 1957 were all recessionary years, and equities had run up 40% for the year in August 1987, so a pullback was not surprising.""
