"I'm really not. Want a different job? Develop the skills and/or education for that job and apply. Again, your life is in your own adult hands, excuses about circumstances, fairness, ""privilege"", etc, aren't going to change the fact that you are responsible for the outcomes in your life. The sooner you accept that, and stop blaming everything listed above, the sooner you'll be on the road to a better life."
