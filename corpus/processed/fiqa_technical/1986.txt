"> We may have an oversupply of retail square footage True, but many will be repurposed into ""showrooms"". The future of retail still includes brick and mortar. Consumers still prefer the sensory experience- the sense of touch for many shopping sectors. So, what we may find is the customer can go to the store, see the item, but the item will be delivered same day or next day to the customer's home. This will allow the store to have smaller spaces as they dont need to carry tons of inventory as a local warehouse will have the inventory. The store exists as a showroom to showcase the product and it could also be a place for the customer to pick up or drop off some items. The buzz word right now is ""experiential"". Stores need to be able to provide experiences that digital stores cannot provide. When I first heard the word ""experiential"", I immediately thought about now closed Sports Authority. Every time I went there, the store had tons of square footage, but it was mostly filled with clothing, sport wear, sports equipment that I can find at Walmart or Target, or I could order it from Amazon. There was absolutely no differentiator. Looking back, the stores I have been to always had so much square footage that there could have been a mini rock climbing gym, simulation activities with tennis, golf, etc. Those are experiences that can just continually draw people, especially kids. If retail does not provide experiences like that, it will die."
