I would say the Japanese economy is a bit different to Greece. It's still quite large. It's been in recession or stagnation for the last 2 decades or so. One major problem for Japan is its aging population. Japan has the oldest population in the world (average is 42). This is a problem in terms of old age pensions, decreasing workforce, etc. in addition to low birth rates. Many young people have fewer kids, or [just none at all!](http://gaijinchronicles.com/2010/08/31/plight-of-the-grass-eater/) While that doesn't sound good, the difference with Greece is they're close to bankruptcy, Japan isn't. Also Japan gets to somewhat control their currency, or at least, their economy is the primary thing affecting the currency, unlike Greece which is in a monetary union and so are not able to devalue their currency.
