"Ehhhh, I'm not sure. My stance is this: they're not really designing games as much as they are making digital products that plug into the brain in insidious ways. The number of people with psychology backgrounds who can work at an IT-focused company has got to be pretty small, so whatever industry they're in, ""social games"" or whatever, is seriously talent constrained. I don't think there are any serious competitors to Zynga, just a bunch of people trying to crack a similar formula. While only 3% of their users generate virtually all of their revenues, as facebook's installed base climbs upwards of a billion users, 3% of whatever fraction of those users who use zynga products will continue to be non-trivial. As facebook's currency becomes used for more and more stuff, and I fully expect this will happen, users who wouldn't kick money into facebook just for farmville will have balances remaining in their facebook wallets, and be more inclined to buy that fertilizer or virtual goat milker or whatever, meaning a new revenue stream from another type of user. Beyond that I'd think that their best customers might actually be brick and mortar retailers, companies that are buying Zynga gold to bundle with their physical products as a value add. Now, does all of that make them worth $7bn? I'm not sure, but it does make them a significant player. Mark Pincus is a brilliant, evil man. I wouldn't dismiss his company too easily."
