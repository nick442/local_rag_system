Part of the purpose of a tax haven is retaining more capital for reinvestment. Then you have more control over how, when and where you pay taxes. Once the capital has been retained in your haven you can strategically deploy it to other favorable locations on the globe. Should you ever want part of it to hit a personal account in the US you'd have a tax liability. But at this level you could just put your ownership of that account up as collateral on a loan and buy your boat that way instead.
