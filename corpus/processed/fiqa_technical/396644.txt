"There are plenty of examples of ""indigenous"" colonization, though strictly *African* examples are hard to come by because people people have just always been there, and there isn't much in the way of geographic barriers in sub-Saharan Africa to cause a sharp delineation between one group of people and another. Still, they had no [shortage of kingdoms and empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kingdoms_in_pre-colonial_Africa), of which [Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Empire) was the most powerful and longest-lived, even successfully fighting off European colonists for most of a century before falling to Italy in the run-up to WWII. But elsewhere, Madagascar was colonized by several different waves of people over about a thousand years. Similarly, Japan seems to have been colonized in several waves. Taiwan was first inhabited by humans about 5,000 years ago, but the Han Chinese didn't show up until the 17th century or so. The colonization of the United States is rather unique in that it's one of a few very rare cases where the occupiers were actually determined to exterminate the native population. While the Spanish and French settlers certainly had plenty of conflicts with the natives, they were still able to work out a social structure where both were included, even if the natives were on the bottom."
