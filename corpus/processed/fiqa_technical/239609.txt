Every year in September/October I see a huge rush of European and Asian tourists to the desert Southwest. Americans are back in school, prices are half what they were in the summer. The tour loop goes from LA to the Four Corners area and all states n between. Vegas is always a stop, as are all major National Parks. This year Vegas and CA are legal. It will be interesting.
