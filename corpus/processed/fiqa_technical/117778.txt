"This was purely an attempt to cash in on an overpriced fad. ""Designer"" juices are a craze that leads people to buy insanely expensive exotic ingredients like fruits and vegetables, as well as spending hundreds apiece on blenders and different sorts of juicers. In fact, this has driven up the price of those kitchen appliances very substantially. There are juice bars selling designer juice blends for $12 a serving, each claimed to promote something such as memory, focus, deep thinking, concentration, relaxation, muscle tone, reduced anxiety, and more, all based on pseudo- or junk science."
