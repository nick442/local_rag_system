I worked there for a year and a half I hope these people find better jobs.. it won't be hard it wasn't for me. The way they pay you commission HA now there's something that should be illegal. I got a class action in the mail last month from something they didn't pay us for. $90 I'm not sure what symbolically I can do with he money wiping my ass with it seems too played out. Lambert just saw the opportunity I don't blame him it was a dumpster fire when he got it. I knew there was no future in it before I got the job, I mean who the hell goes to Sears anymore. It's basically a thrift store but dirtier and I'd rather go to a thrift store you might find something cool and different.
