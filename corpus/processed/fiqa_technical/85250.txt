I feel sports gambling is just as efficient as the stock market. The only difference is variance really. The patriots could be favored by 7 and win by 24. Or they could lose by 3. Anything could happen in sports. I feel a better niche is in competitive video game gambling. Like tennis, skill is a much larger factor in most esports. The favored team will win more often than in American football. Also with the relatively small amount of bettors and those who bet having limited knowledge of the esport, there can be much more advantageous odds for betting. Imo.
