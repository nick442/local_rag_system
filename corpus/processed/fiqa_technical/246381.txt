The difference is that if you end up owing more than $1k in taxes come April, you **will** be mandated for withholding next year (that's at the federal level, I don't know CA law in particular); and if this isn't the first time you've done it, you may owe additional penalties as well. Your actual tax liability comes out the same either way; you're *probably* better off just letting Uncle Sam have an interest-free loan for a few months and getting the difference back in April, than risking it; but if you've done the math and know you'll only owe exactly $999.99, you can do what you want. :)
