Thanks for the news articles. Perhaps you could weigh in on this [study by the National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1253709/) that looked at the NHS study you keep bringing up? Specifically >Glyphosate exposure was not associated with cancer incidence overall or with most of the cancer subtypes we studied. There was a suggested association with multiple myeloma [cancer of the plasma cells] incidence that should be followed up as more cases occur in the AHS. Shouldn't this also be taken into account when talking about if Round-up causes cancer? The science seems far from settled at this point. Everything you've linked concerns non-hodgkin lymphoma. I understand why Monsanto would ignore the data that does indicate a problem and focus on this singular, just now being reviewed study. Why are you?
