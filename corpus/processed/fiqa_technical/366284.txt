"I'll concede that you're probably speaking in good faith- I genuinely believe that you're original statement was one that meant to point out that the ruling class seek to squeeze all the value they can out of being the ruling class, which includes maximizing the size of the rest of the population to drive down wages and get the most labor out of payrolls as possible to maximize profit. I can concede that completely and never suspected that you felt otherwise. That said, ""reasonable"" people are often unequipped to deal with extreme or academic scenarios using reason alone. My entire point of digression came from the use of the term ""commodity,"" as it refers to things of value who's value arises from their ability to be traded at a profit. Your statement regarding people fitting this definition was true in the time of feudalism- pushing that definition back to the idea that the labor of people was tradable (but people owned themselves) was a major improvement in human rights (happening for different people at different points in history). I drew a point of contention because it's an *important* and *historical* point of contention that should never slip backwards ever, without being pointed out."
