"> People with failed businesses also often put in crazy long hours and submit themselves to huge financial risk. That's what you have to do just to start a business. It doesn't predict success. Yes, but most people that start companies are unrealistic, poorly connected and barely average intelligence (if at all). I'd say perhaps 0.5% of entrepreneurs are really in the ""top tier"" where differences are shaped more by luck than anything else. Not sure if you've ever dealt with real life entrepreneurs, but I daresay you could make some pretty good estimates about who might succeed and who might not after talking to a random sampling of 50, and no - it wouldn't be because you can smell luck. Work ethic is kind of a baseline, and something shared with naive dreamers and total idiots, as well as unlucky realistic geniuses."
