"My problem with their Words with Friends app was, every time I opened it, it said, ""We noticed you're not logged in. Wanna do it?"" The reason I purchased it was to avoid being bothered by ads, and yet I still got, ostensibly, a Facebook ad each and every time, which slowed the launch to a crawl. They couldn't have been happy enough, I guess, just with whatever data they were extracting. Sadly, my friends now think I am not using it because I was losing to them, but that's why they shed me, at least."
