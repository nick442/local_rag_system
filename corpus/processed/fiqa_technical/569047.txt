Are you asking me for my review? The iPad3 feels *generally* buggy and slow. The iPad2 is faster. It also felt like a proper evolution of the iPad. The iPad3 doesn't. It doesn't feel like a better iPad2. It's noticeably heavier and slower, and mine has crashed twice in the last week. The fact that I have an iPad3 and iPad2 side-by-side leaves me disappointed. The Playbook is lighter than the iPad3- it's about half the size. The picture isn't as nice. It doesn't have Skype. The user interface is nicer. It has a better spreadsheet and email client and ssh client. It doesn't require a separate SIM (it tethers to my phone). It has a good *feel* to it, and is comfortable in my hands. It hasn't crashed on me yet. On my commute I use the playbook, and not the iPad3. The iPad3 gets used largely for Facetime and Skype while at my office. I generally *enjoy* using the Playbook over the iPad3.
