Good point. I argued this morning with an asshole that illegally parked his truck and blocked traffic on my street for 30 minutes during rush hour; he told me if I had a problem with it I could call the cops. Automated trucks won't be able to replicate his dickhead attitude of lack of concern for anyone else on earth.
