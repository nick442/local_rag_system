I work in manufactoring. It's not 2% margins for us. If you're in a dying service/business with a unpopular product well that's just the market. Who forced you to go into that industry? Free market is just that free, you shouldn't be subsidized for a product that can't compete or isn't popular. Truth is harsh. You're angry, but your energy would be spent better finding viable alternatives rather than trying to save a sinking ship. If 5% will sink you, then you're already not doing well before these changes back to normal level tax.
