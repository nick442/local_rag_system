You don't need a fictional markup for this to make good sense. It's quite reasonable that a small software company would have different internal needs than any number of SMB verticals that they service. The cost of an internal development effort to create a custom one-off version of their own software is probably significantly higher than the cost of just buying an established product that's a good fit.
