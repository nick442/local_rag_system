"I am forgetful and a parent of 2 young boys. It's way easier to order something walking through the house while it's fresh in my mind than trying to remember to go online and order stuff once they're in bed. * I clean litter boxes, realize were low, on my way out the door with old litter in garbage bag I yell ""Alexa, order more of our cat litter"". * Doing dishes and grab the one of the last pods for the dishwasher ""alexa order more dish washer detergent"". In the world of being a parent, I go from one task to the next when not playing with my kids, and i get distracted very easily. My wife and I make it a point to not be on our phones when with our kids, so I can't just open my amazon app and order from there since it's usually on the charger when I'm home."
