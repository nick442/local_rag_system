With only $2000 in the account, I wouldn't worry about investing it. Instead, I would roll this over into a new HSA account with a different provider. Find a provider that doesn't charge ongoing fees, perhaps with a local credit union or bank. Although you won't be able to add money to it, you can withdraw as you have eligible medical expenses, until it is gone.
