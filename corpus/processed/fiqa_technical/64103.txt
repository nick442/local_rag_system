"I took @littleadv 's recommendation that online apps only ask for citizenship due to post-9/11 legislation. I applied to 2 banks in person (one big, one small), and at the dealership. None of my in-person applications ever touched on the issue of citizenship. I even applied in person at the same bank that insta-rejected me online, and told them up front, ""I applied online but you rejected me because I'm not a permanent resident."" The banker nodded, said ""that shouldn't matter here"", and continued processing my application. I did find it very hard to get a loan. I have a credit score in the ""excellent"" range, but have only 1 open credit card (for 5 years). Apparently, most lenders want to see more open credit before writing an auto loan. The big bank said outright ""We want to see 3-5 credit cards open"". However, the dealership did find a bank willing to extend me a loan. So: The most reliable way for a non-permanent resident alien to get an auto loan in the US is to avoid online applications. Also, if possible, establish a wide credit history before you try."
