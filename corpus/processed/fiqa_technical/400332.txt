Really? His desire for food makes him no more willing to pay? I doubt that will hold any further than a test environment. If he was starving and only had a little cash, I could see he would have less desire to pay. But when he has wealth and is starving, stubbornness may be the only holdback. How many people charge more for water because their oasis is the only one around? You think the travelers they see won’t ever pay? They may not WANT to, but they will if they have no other choice. The value is immediate. Unless you are thinking of some other sort of pseudo value, value is what you are willing to give for what you will get at any particular point in time. A man dying of dehydration may give much more than a man sated. Once the first man is sated, what he would probably give is less. This is called “Diminishing Marginal Utility”.
