Kinda. I'd be interested in seeing broader studies because minimum wage also influences other pay as well. I work in the medical field and most insurances base their rates off of what Medicare/Medicaid pay in each geographic area. By artificially setting the min wage too high you're going to influence the jobs that require marginally more skills and experience than min wage jobs. Obviously this influence has less effect the higher skilled and experience the position is but nonetheless influences them. Moreover there are other things that minimum wage influences such as here in California the government thought it was a bright idea to require servers be paid the regular minimum wage plus tips instead of the lower federally legal server min wage. This has had the effect that there are significantly more servers than low to mid skilled workers in CA because you can easily earn $20-30 or more per hour. Not to mention they get OT for every minute over 8 hours they work. Not to mention IIRC Cali requires that salaried employees must be paid twice min wage. So yeah while it doesn't directly affect a lot of people but it indirectly affects a lot. But ask me if I think raising the min wage is a good idea . . . Fuck no.
