"The market price of a stock is based on nothing at all more than what two parties were last willing to transact for it. The stock has a ""bid"" and an ""ask"" each is the value placed by a counterparty. For the sale to occur, one party must meet the other. The stock transacts and that is the price. For a stock to ""go up"" people must be willing to pay more for it. Likewise, for it to ""go down"" people must be willing to accept less for it."
