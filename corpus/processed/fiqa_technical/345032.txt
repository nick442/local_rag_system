"Much more than that. Last I looked at this, I saw the DJI have fat tails (i.e. non-Gaussian) to the order of hundreds of days. The effect becomes less pronounced the larger the interval, and the curves show that it becomes more Gaussian. If you plot the return distributions for 1-day, 2-days, etc, on a semilog plot you end up with curves that look like leftmost figure of figure 1.3 (edit - sorry, I got the figure wrong): http://fedc.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/xplore/ebooks/html/csa/node235.html The Gaussian curve on a semilog plot comes out as a parabola, i.e. the black curve. Non-Gaussian fat tails ""fan out"" like the green, red and blue plots. The fanning out occurs even when dealing with returns over a couple of hundred days, but the effect becomes less pronounced, suggesting a convergence to Gaussian."
