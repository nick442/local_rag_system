"The article appears to be making the opposite point it thinks it is making. The author appears to be talking about income disparity, but if more and more people are making 6 figure salaries - to the extent that it's no longer a ""rich people thing - that would mean income disparity is shrinking, at least if you only look at salary alone (and not equity - which is really what wealth is about). The top 1% or even 10% **should be** making vastly more than the middle class - that's to be expected. Otherwise, why would they be 1%? From time to time, the income disparity folks don't seem to understand their own points."
