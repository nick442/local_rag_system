I don't need to be a civil engineer to tell you that building high in areas prone to earthquakes are more expensive. While a wooden frame house is cheap and fairly earthquakes resistant. Most houses in Auckland are detached houses. You can put a lot more townhouses in the same area, and there's no restriction in doing that in Auckland. So clearly something else is going on.
