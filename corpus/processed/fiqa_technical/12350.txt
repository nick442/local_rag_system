The real test of AAA's analysis is whether other insurers follow suite. Setting insurance rates is a balancing act between being high enough to make money given the expected payouts, and being low enough to not get undercut by competitors. If other insurers follow AAA's lead, then their analysis is probably right. If other insurers stay low than AAA probably made a mistake. When you price insurance on a given car it's not uncommon to have an outlier that overpriced that car.
