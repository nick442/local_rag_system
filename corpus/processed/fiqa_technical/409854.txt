"You may want to hold onto the $5000 and keep it in savings. Interest rates are for crap, even in ""high yield"" accounts, so you can rightly not consider it investing. You should be graduating college soon. It would suck if an emergency crops up to prevent you from graduating. I assume that you are going into a high paying career given your nice income from internships. Your best investment is yourself at this point. Completing your education, and obtaining your degree trumps all. You could use that extra 5000 as a hedge/insurance policy/emergency fund to help insure you graduate. Also you are likely to have some moving expenses once you graduate. That 5K could be used to help cover those costs. The worst case is you graduate with no emergencies, you get a nice signing bonus and relocation package, and you still have the $5000. Well you still have until 15 April 2015 to put money in your ROTH for 2014. This holds true for every tax year. Given your current financial status, you are likely to find yourself soon contributing the max to your 401K and ROTH. Once that happens, money beyond that can be invested into mutual funds stocks that are not tax advantaged, real estate, or some other choices. Well then you have some things to think about."
