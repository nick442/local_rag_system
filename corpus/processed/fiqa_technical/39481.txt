"Unfortunately, where I live, minimum wage is what is available to High School graduates. We have an abundance of minimum wage jobs looking to hire, and no docks, and few greater than minimum wage jobs for people right out of High School. And minimum wage isn't enough to support a person here. I think school costs have gone up for more than just loans for everyone. Our colleges have administration bloat, huge wages for the top few, and are being run like businesses rather than schools: profit over people. Their educational license still stands, but they work to increase their profit rather than increase their quality of education. I understand that there is a large ""blame game"" going on about why people are poor or undeserving. They are lazy. They are drug addicts and gangsters. They are entitled. Any excuse we can come up with to not help the other guy. The other issue is HOW we help the other guy: Do we hand them money and say, ""Go out and succeed""? That's been our current method. But both of these issues again fall to education! If we can improve education so it teaches people how to have an impact on their world, how to find something they can do well, and how to succeed, then we can resolve the other issues. Right now, our schools teach basic skills: Math, Science, Reading to the extent that the students can past the tests. But the world is not built on Math, Science, and Reading. They are important, but more important are social skills, resource allocation and utilization, self-learning, testing and verifying. Teach them the basics! We need them! But teach them to be self-controlling, self-responsible people. I know this is part of the third paragraph, but I find, on the outset, we may seem like we have completely different views, when in reality, it is simply where we put the emphasis, not the actual view itself, that differs."
