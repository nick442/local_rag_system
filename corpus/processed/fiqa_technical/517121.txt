Along those lines, Applebee's has to take into account competing with just staying home and making this food yourself. Their menu doesn't exactly require a Michelin-star chef to make it.. A person could reasonable buy steak and cook it for probably the same amount of cost as Applebee's (factoring in additional time and effort).
