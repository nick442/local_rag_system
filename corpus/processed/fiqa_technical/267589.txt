These stores are definitely just test locations to help them figure out physical retail. Next time you go to one, look up. There's an obvious constellation of tech in the ceiling - likely tracking the behavior of individuals and how they move about the store (e.g. using the Amazon app on their phones and triangulating their location based on wifi/bluetooth.) They're not trying to turn a profit yet, just trying to collect data.
