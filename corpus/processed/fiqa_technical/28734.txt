After filing a Chapter 7 (the more common form in the USA) you have to wait 8 years to file another Chapter 7 but only 4 years to file a Chapter 13 (repayment rather than liquidation, at least in theory, in practice it does not always look that neat and tidy). Chapter 13 you can file a new 13 two years later, but there are not many reasons you would. This is the new law. Under the old law pre-2005 you could pretty much file Chapter 13 as often as you like. In fact my last firm did have one client who managed to fall behind on their house before them chapter 7 was even completed and ended up needing to file a chapter 13 while their chapter 7 was still pending.
