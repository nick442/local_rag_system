">Nazis weren't socialist The National Socialist Party - that's what Nazis is the shortened form of in German. >Just because they had socialist in their name doesn't mean they were socialist. So then the ""Democrats"" doesn't mean they're democratic, and we'll vote the same type of people in again then? I mean, if we can't trust what the party name is, we might end up voting them in again under a different name."
