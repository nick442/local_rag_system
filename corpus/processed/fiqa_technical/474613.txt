From a macro standpoint - innovation and regulation have major benefits to an economy and society. In the case of greenwashing by understating the impact of electric cars; sure, that's a problem now, but as they innovate further to invent newer, cheaper, more efficient batteries, it will hopefully sort itself out. No matter what, it's a heck of a lot better then spewing crap into the air (and personally, they're a ton more fun to driver).
