Employers seem to only take, not give now. I'm a salary worker and I work unpaid overtime and afterhours. A lot of this was to get over a peak of work (Had to work a lot in a short period of time to fix problems that were creating more work). However now I have been granted some flexibility and I have taken time out of my workday to do whatever I need as well. It's often the minimum wage employees that I see abused the worst, they are easily replaceable by their employer and punishment for violating workers rights is a slap on the wrist.
