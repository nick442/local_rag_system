Ugh, that makes me sick. If he's teaching his students the same way he's teaching the reporter, then that just makes me ill. He's just taught the reporter how to cheat the system by figuring out the right answer without ever doing the requested task or understanding the problem. Instead of solving that simple algebra equation for one of the unknowns, he's taught the reporter to plug in some semi-random numbers (that happen to work out correctly in the original equation) and the check to see which of the offered answers works out when those same numbers are used. You can see for the first attempt that the reporter chose v=1 and w=2. That's why there's a check next to both (a) and (c) -- they both work with that pair. Then the reporter was told to choose another point, and he chose the second most obvious --- v=4 and w=5. That isolated solution (a). The test is supposed to test an understanding of algebra, not an understanding of basic math. So when he says the system can be gamed, I guess he means he's helping students to game it. Here's a news flash for you, Mr. Reporter: you're still bad at math, and that one-on-one session just made you worse.
