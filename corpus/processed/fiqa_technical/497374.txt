Average hours worked actually increased that month. This is a better measure of job quality that simply the portion of jobs that are full or part time. It means that most of the full time jobs lost that month were low hour full time jobs and/or most of the part time jobs that were gained that month were high hour part time jobs. Cynics can always cherry pick, but if you look at the more meaningful numbers the economy is still slowly improving.
