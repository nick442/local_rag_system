An equity tax does seem to make some sense. It would probably help to stave off deflation as well because it would encourage growth and investment where people would otherwise choose to sit on their money or worse. An equity tax on currency or liquid investments of even .5% APR would have a huge effect on the behavior of corporations. Sadly the largest of them would have the resources to avoid the tax by keeping all of their money out of the country.
