"Yes sir, I'm working on compiling your ""precise evidence,"" and I'll have it printed and bound for you on the double. In the meantime, you can look here as a starting point and try to find the part where the Fed has allowed interest rates to adjust freely, and maybe you can learn why rates are artificial: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_responses_to_the_subprime_crisis As for ""cahoots"" and independent banks and whatever other off-topic nonsense you're babbling about, there was nothing said about cahoots or independent banks. The interest rates paid for and to US banks are affected by the monetary policy of the Fed. There is no collusion, or ""cahoots,"" required for them to follow a common policy of artificially-low interest rates, which was the point of the earlier post."
