Agreed. A philosophy of isolationism and provoking trade-wars with former trade allies is the preferred approach for the Trump administration. However, closing borders to imports is likely to have a very high offsetting cost for US exports. It all seems very shortsighted. Just based on what Canada and the UK are likely to do in response to just this decision alone, will certainly cost companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin a lot more in exports than they will ever gain through this maneuver.
