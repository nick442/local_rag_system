All the shit people attribute as being 'cool' about blockchain (immutability, decentralised, and so on) are a direct **consequence** of bitcoins having monetary value. Without a token that people are willing to sacrifice resources for, all those nice features go out the window. In other words, bitcoin (the 'currency') has to have value for 'blockchain tech' to have value. If you understand this basic logic, you will know what to do next.
