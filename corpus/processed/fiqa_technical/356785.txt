Leptokurtotic is a term I haven't even heard from my friends *with* math **player hating Degrees**. I had to look it up, and this was annoying. I view using it as some sort of complicated power play to keep me off balance, and it makes me confused and subsequently angry. I am not sure why. In dumb person speak, I've always been under the impression that fatter tails are natural in social distrubutions. And have always been seen as prevalent in free markets of any form, regardless of leverage.
