Make the price match the cheapest similar product, then advertise the hell out of it. If it's in a specialist section, put some in the general area too. Keep it towards the fish kits so that when people are buying a bunch of stuff for a new tank, they can get cheaper food. If the price/lb is right, most people will feed their fish anything. You can also extend the life of your overstock by keeping it in cool storage. Maybe a basement with an AC. Shy away from 'buy more than one to save' deals, those are just annoying. Just post the price along with some indication that it's a 'low price'. For pricing, figure out how much you paid for the lot to find your ideal minimum return, then multiply it by 50-80% depending on your maximum loss. Divide each of these numbers by the number of units to get the ideal price for your situation. Don't forget to fuzz it upwards to account for storage costs and other minor overhead. Repeat for each product.
