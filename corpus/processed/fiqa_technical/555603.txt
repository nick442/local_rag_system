The first two times I took my practice exams munis and options were around 60% (but overall I was still at 73%). I focused on just those and this last time they were both at 80%, but everything else dropped (still wound up at 73%). I take it at 8am, so I think I'm just going to try and skim the vocab then see how it turns out tomorrow.
