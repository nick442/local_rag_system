"> Go on, try walking away without signing your credit card receipt at stores where they present it for signature, and see what happens. That's true.. if the amount is over $25. Did you notice it? Actually, at Costco is over $50. And you know what else is true? That yes, they require you to squibble something, but you can write an obvious incorrect signature and nobody will care. You have no idea how many times the screen with the electronic pen did not work right, so I just put couple of lines.. >> know what I am talking about because I deal with credit cards a lot, professionally, in IT. > You and everyone else. Big deal. Different credit card processors have different requirements for their customers (merchants). Just because different processors have different requirements makes the whole process impossible to manage or comply with. Go figure out the requirement based on the card presented. >> The credit card companies don't really care. > I think the real lesson here is nobody cares. The merchant cares, because they are ultimately responsible for paying for fraud.. which is the main reason why credit card companies don't care.. and many merchants too because they have insurance.. The bottom line is that everyone would not mind to enter a PIN to get the transaction through, but a stupid ego trip of the credit card companies who don't want to be ""like ATMs"". That's it. So they came up with chip in the card, which made the process slower and more expensive, and does not solve anything except fake credit cards (copied credit cards)."
