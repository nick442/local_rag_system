Premise: For me, if wal-mart is doing well, consumers are doing well, and it isn't doing well, then we're probably screwed! Look at this scary graph! This is what pisses me off about economists (extreme reaction to extremism.. get over it). One metric will be chosen to indicate a factor, then when there is a change in that metric, all kinds of loosely supported inferences are made about the general economic welfare of the country. Maybe more people are just shopping at trader joe's and Aldi?? Wouldn't it be more useful to look at an index of all grocery stores and make a judgement off of that?
