"That sounds great, and don't get me wrong, I'm having fun and learning a lot at this internship, I don't regret accepting the offer in the slightest. The thing is, I also wanted to improve my ""technical"" skills (if that makes sense) over the summer, and right now I'm wondering where exactly to start. You mentioned coding and excel, is there anything specific that I should know, or a good place to start? I know some basics of C++, HTML and CSS, and some excel stuff like Vlookups, but nothing beyond that really. Is there any specific language I should learn, for example? Or something more advanced in excel? If I'm not at work, I'm sitting at my PC at home, so I feel like I should be doing *something*."
