I'm in the same boat, except I was (am) going to do a masters in BA. I wouldn't be turned off by the requirements. Just call and negotiate. I imagine the majority of people never put in more effort beyond e-mailing a CV. I would aim for smaller companies, since there, there is a higher chance to reach out to the actual decision-makers of the firm, not just HR. Also, if I were you, I would read up on things to have some leverage and have something to talk about at interviews.
