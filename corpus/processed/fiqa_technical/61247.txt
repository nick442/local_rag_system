"Well, that's good and bad more regulation, but your not an agency your something better(IMHO) If the lawyer says yes, I'd scrub all mention of the word ""agency"". Being an ""employment business"" is part of your USP. You will presumable have to educate on why this is better, but you may as well use the protected words your entitled too and report any UK agencies calling themselves an employment business to try and undercut you. Check with your branding/marketing advisors this could be key (Oh and please PM, your launch page/teaser when you get to it)"
