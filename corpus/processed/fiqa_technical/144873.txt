"You are not wrong: in 6 years on reddit, this is the biggest circlejerk I've witnessed, other than Sagan. It's really sad that you're getting downvoted, because it would be nice to see a back-and-forth discussion of the future of the company. I happen to think that Tesla is doing something admirable, but, yes, they're doing it with substantial subsidies, and they're simply not providing an affordable product. They're doing the right thing, but they're not working miracles: they're producing a low-volume niche product that will help how people think of cars. This reminds me of a discussion of Leica lenses, in which somebody smarter than I am simply wrote: ""Any number of lens manufactures can produce a superlative 50mm f/2 lens for $1500."" Come on, folks. Elon Musk is not working miracles. He's just doing the right thing. Tesla is not some genius-ubermensch-paradigm-exploding supercompany."
