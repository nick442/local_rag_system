"Why does this seem so hard for brick and mortar electronics retailers? Their only edge is the store and staff and precisely where they *repeatedly* gut themselves. It is baffling. Sometimes you wonder if anyone beyond a certain level of management lives in the ""real world"" as a consumer versus some disconnected budget-less world of executives. How do they visualize a bunch of untrained low paid abused employees running their stores? How do they visualize the customers' response? It is like they can't understand fundamental human interaction/behavior."
