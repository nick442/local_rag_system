The shop I interviewed (not really an interview, I just spoke to the guy) has a branch office near where I live and the guys who trade there are industry veterans (bond traders/daytraders/options traders at other firms/etc) and are willing to let me learn from them/guide me as I learn to trade. That's really why I'm doing it, trying to learn as much as I can about different styles of trading. I jsut graduated undergrad so I'm looking to break into prop and learn from the wise and battle tested.
