After completing 4 years of undergrad in accounting, I was planning to complete my CA. But I haven't been able to get a job with one of the big four here in Canada. Currently working in corporate sales. I think having a CPA/CA/CMA/CGA whatever is quite beneficial in the finance industry. Of course it's not mandatory for the most part and CFA makes a lot more sense, but it gives you a better understanding of how numbers/ratios are actually created. If anything it will give you a leg up from other people. It certainly won't hurt to have. Do you mind me asking which firm you're with?
