I think you take some pretty big liberties assuming I think people deserve failure. If you assume I think that, please note that this speaks more to how you view people who are not wealthy than I do. That aside, I think you're using lucky in a way that most people do not in this instance. Is it lucky to eventually achieve a reasonable goal with decades of consistency? Sure, in the ways that I mentioned - nuclear war didn't break out, no fatal traffic accidents happened, etc. Do you think that is what people usually mean when they say people who have more money are just lucky? Or do you think they use the term lucky to mean there is no merit basis for the difference? Side note - I'm not saying everyone with money has it because of merit any more than I am saying everyone without money deserves to be broke. If anything, I'm disagreeing with the semantics used to discuss wealth and income disparity, partly because it is divisive.
