I think you swung there prematurely, I don't believe he was making a case for deep tax cuts for the rich. And no, I'm not a pro 1%er. This tax proposal will turn out to be a boondoggle like everything else we've seen so far from this admin. It's a solution unto itself, not actually trying to solve a substantial problem for the majority of citizens. It's always hilarious to me that, somehow, tax cuts for corporations will somehow motivate them to hire idle workers because they have a little more cash in the coffers. When did supply and demand go away?
