There's a strong argument to be made that entrepreneurial investments are the only ones that *should* increase in value. Tulip mania of any sort doesn't add value. All other sources of returns - holding risk constant - are constantly trying to get cheaper financing, through financial engineering or a greater supply of capital due to the magic of compound interest. That's why you can get a mortgage at 6% instead of 16% like in the old days.
