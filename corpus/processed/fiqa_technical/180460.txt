On aspect of this is that your liability in civil suit can vary substantially based on where you live. A judgement in one jurisdiction may not follow you to another (eg I believe in Vermont they do not honor out of state judgements), so there is an option to simply allow a default judgement and not worry about it. This a pretty complex decision to get yourself the best deal. You need a lawyer to help you make the right call.
