Wut? You realize the south is the most dependent on government aid right? Not to mention all the oil business that does exist is heavily subsidized by the government and those oil states STILL receive higher than average values of government assistance. Go ahead and keep complaining about government assistance, see what happens when people are literally starving. Do you think they will just willingly starve to death rather than grab a gun and steal your food?
