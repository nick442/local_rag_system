"What's funny is this scam was like a plot the villains used in some American comedy movie about politicians I can't remember the name of. They were trying to bring entire factories of Chinese people here to work. Made a big joke out of it saying they called it ""insourcing"". Funny that it's actually a reality that has already destroyed wages for construction workers, and IT."
