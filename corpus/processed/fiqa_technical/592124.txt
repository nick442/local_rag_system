Of course handing your passport to an employer is pretty silly. However, maybe these employees volunteering for an RFID implant just want a useful piece of technology for free. There's a lot of misunderstanding and paranoia surrounding these implants, none of it is justified. I don't think the idea of offering this for free to your employees is a stupid idea, the improvements to security and the reduced amount of hassle associated with lost ID cards would make it worthwhile.
