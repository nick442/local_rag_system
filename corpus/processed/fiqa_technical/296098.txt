I'm not trying to sound mean here, because my intention is to encourage you to take the leap into entrepreneurship, but yes..your fear is completely irrational. The reason you see and hear about those mega-lawsuits is because they are sensational and controversial. They're actually pretty rare, and usually prohibitively costly to file. No one's going to successfully get an attorney to try and collect on a large amount of amount of money that you don't have. Most small business lawsuits are a result of either gross negligence on the business owners part (which would be justified) or terrible or misleading service (again justified). If you're going to do honest business, take responsibility for the work done, and do your due diligence to manage what goes on in your four walls, you'll be fine. Go for it..assuming you have a good business plan, and know what you're getting into. Of course.
