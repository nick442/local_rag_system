When they started implementing safety procedures for stopping people from getting sick probably about two years ago now I want to say. When their stock was tanking and the ecoli outbreaks were happening. Yep, that’s why I get chicken now. It doesn’t taste like “steak” it taste like bland boiled beef that’s thrown on a grill, cause that’s what it is
