I will never advocate for being high at work. We can both agree on that front, my main point is that it is stupid to care what people do on their off time. I can respect many of your arguments, but I just want to be clear I think smoking and driving is bad. What I think is acceptable is getting high on your own time in the privacy of your own home. Therefore in my mind it should have 0 impact on insurance of any kind, and employers shouldn't care what you do on your own time. You're entitled to your opinion, and it is very clear that it differs from mine. I would just hope that in the future you don't use a broad brush and attack everyone that smokes weed
