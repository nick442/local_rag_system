If you turned off the political news since Trump was elected, the vast majority of Americans would see no impact to their lives. What this proves is that the government isn't as essential as we think it is, and the government can survive things like Trump. What amuses me is that those who demanded greater federal government control before Trump are backpedaling like mad. If Trump shifts the balance of power to states and away from the federal government, I believe that will be the greatest benefit of having Trump elected.
