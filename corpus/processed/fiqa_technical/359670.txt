Life is a lot more difficult if you accept the constraints that are sold to you. 80 hours per week for a $90k salary is completely unacceptable, imo, unless you're absolutely in love with your job and it's all you want to do anyway. You can earn money in proportion to how much value you create for people if you offer something of value. A degree in isolation, even from the best school in your field, is completely worthless though.
