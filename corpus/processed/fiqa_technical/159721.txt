I dunno. I don't see prop 65 moving *any* opinions, either yours or the people you complain about. An aside, there is definitely factual research that says Roundup ready monocrops are worse than other styles of farming (depends on what metric you focus on). And Monsanto is one of the last sources of information I trust given their behavior as a corporation. It's actually pretty reasonable to be skeptical of Monsanto irrespective of fringe beliefs.
