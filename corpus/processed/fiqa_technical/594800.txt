You can't prove any part of your last two paragraphs. Since this is the internet I'm inclined to not believe what you say (shocking). I can provide a million examples of how the private sector is doing a higher quality and cheaper job of all of the things that government does. Edit: I'm a college graduate living paycheck to paycheck, please don't advocate for higher taxes because trust me it won't help me or anyone you think it will help. (Because it never does)
