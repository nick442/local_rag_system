> I can't find any instance in modern history where workers won the fight against a machine that was going to replace them. Are you kidding me? This is what Unions do all the time: prevent any kind of new efficiency, automation, outsourcing, etc. I am absolutely not pro-Union. Actually, I hate Unions.. or what became of them. Anyway, Unions are quite successful in what they try to do..
