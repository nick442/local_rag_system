I like Obama and hate Trump, but let's be accurate. These rate hikes were planned before Trump got elected, actually started happening before Trump was elected, and they would have continued to happen regardless of who became president in 2017. That's how the business cycle works. Did you expect the rate to stay near 0% forever?
