"So what is the implication of ""creating"" 12 loddars like that? If enough loddars are created in such a way (basically as IOUs for IOUs, if I'm interpreting this correctly), will we have inflation? What keeps this in check? Is it credibility of whoever issues the promise for loddars? And when those loddars are destroyed -- because of the wildfire or whatever -- is the individual that is ""owed"" them just screwed? What is an example of this happening in the real world? Would be if a company makes a promise of some payment, and it turns out that it can't be fulfilled? That company would still ""owe"" that money to someone, right? Sorry for the string of questions tacked on to your great post, but I feel as though you made a very illuminating point and then just stopped. Thanks for taking the time to explain all of this."
