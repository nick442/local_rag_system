The data shows the economy is following the same trendline over the last year. So yes, it's doing better than a year ago. It was supposed to do better, all the trends were already pointing up in 2016. The economy is a big thing that has inertia, and it's continuing to follow the path established under Obama. The question is whether Trump has anything to do with it. If the trend accelerates, then Trump should get credit (it hasn't). If it slows down, then it would be Trump's fault (it also hasn't). The stock market has rallied since Trump was elected, presumably in anticipation of a tax cut. I don't think it's an indicator of economic health.
