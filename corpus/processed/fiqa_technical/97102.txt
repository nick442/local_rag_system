I'm a die-hard Tesla fan who doesn't yet own a model 3. I fully expect to pay at least $45 for the model 3 I would want. I'm not sure expectations have been tempered yet. How many people will be expecting all the bells and whistles for $35k minus the rebates? Even for just this next car release in a few weeks, their actual demand and production ability are volatile.
