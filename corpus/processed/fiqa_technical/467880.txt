The sun rises over East Asia and with it Monday comes. If this week is anything like last week you would have done well to save your energy because I am sure there is lots of fun and games to come. What pillars of American society shall we crush this week, what foundations shall we witness crumble to dust, what shall we trod over in the coming days Oh . .don't worry poppets Whats the worst that could happen?
