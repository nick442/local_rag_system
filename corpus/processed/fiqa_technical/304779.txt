The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. Sixty-six percent of registered voters in the city are Democrats.[12] The only significant pockets of Republican strength are in Staten Island, as well as wealthier sections of Brooklyn and Queens. New York City has not been won by a Republican in a Presidential or statewide election since 1924. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_New_York_City
