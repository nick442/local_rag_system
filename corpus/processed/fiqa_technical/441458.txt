"This is the most glorious tap dance and broke hobo routine I've seen. Look at my empty pockets, look at this business model, I'm just trying to fix a broken market. Meanwhile he's organized contracts with big data brokers, as people will fall for his poor harmless Joe routine and give full access to their demographic data to combine with those ticket purchases? Netflix would buy that data in a heartbeat, to know what new movies to bring to platform, studios want it to hedge bets and assure funding from overseas with 3rd party data. Advertisers want that data so they can match advertising to these releases, merch, etc. You think this ceo accidentally said ANY of this? It's as fake as the ""butter"" on your popcorn."
