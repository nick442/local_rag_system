“The Nobel Prize winner argues that an economy dominated by large corporations has failed the many and enriched the few.” We need to apply that thesis to the current duopoly in our political system. Having two extreme parties, with the number of “safe” seats in the Congress and the Senate far outweighing those in swing states or districts, means that the two national political parties dictate our political discourse. For those safe seats, the parties also essentially anoint representatives and senators, with the elections being a mere formality. Term limits would help, or at least change the current dynamic, as would barring former representatives and senators from lobbying for five years. Finally, making Congress subject to the laws it passes would also help. But the parties will never agree to modify the current system; both parties benefit too much from it.
