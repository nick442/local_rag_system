I think in these types of situations where your knowledge is limited concerning the workings of the firms, the only thing you can do is explain why you want to be a quant. Discuss your love of math, the challenges/thrill of figuring out markets, the future of trading, etc. Quant firms are full of really smart people looking for intellectual challenges, and the money is just the cherry on top. While I don't work in finance, just reading about firms like Renaissance staffed with ex-IBMers and professors, it seems reasonable to assume the above.
