"I really dont understand your argument man. Most people ""escape"" in alot of ways alcohol being the most popular why dont you find issue with this ? >Or that tons of people here use and don't want to see that its not necessarily a good thing. Im assuming u live in the la area as do i almost 60% of this state voted for legalization and 60% of our nation approves of legalzation according to polls http://www.gallup.com/poll/196550/support-legal-marijuana.aspx Fact is a ton more people feel the opposite way that you do. There is absoulety no compelling evidence that suggests that mj is more dangerous than legal substances like tobacco and alcohol in fact quite the opposite. So i honestly have to say your stance is quite baffling i tend believe people like just dont personally enjoy mj."
