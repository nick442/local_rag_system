Libraries pay the author for the books. Also, before Internet distribution, people would buy books, regardless of whether it was in a library or not. Going forward, if a book is available for free on the internet, why would you go buy it? What incentive would the author have to keep writing? I'd hate to see Malcolm Gladwell & Seth Godin stop writing because they couldn't afford to anymore.
