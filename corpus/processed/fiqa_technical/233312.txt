The bootstrappy argument doesn't rub many people the right way because they've been taught by the baby boomers how the world worked *then*. The baby boomers have had life very easy for them relative to all of the other generations in American history. We're coming down off of that high and the world has changed. The world of being able to get a good career and being able to pay for a house and raise a family, all with a high school diploma, is long past. That world, and those rules/wisdom, are obsolete (for the most part). Despite this, we're still being taught that **that** is how you make it to retirement. Its so easy! Just give your money to these Wall Street people and they'll use it to make more money for you!
