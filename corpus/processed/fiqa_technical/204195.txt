"Yes, but that's not what I'm getting at. Your story made sense up to the ""enterprising person"" part. The notes represented obligations secured by apples (or rights to future apples). Regardless of the secondary note trading, at the end of the day, one could approach issuer of the note, the apple farmer, and redeem (or attempt to redeem) the note for the underlying apples. The enterprising person's notes are different. The holder of the new notes cannot approach the priest and demand anything. The story doesn't explain this critical transition, which is probably the most important part. You suggest the problem in your response above when you say ""it's just no longer pegged specifically to one grower's apples."" The new notes aren't ""pegged"" to anything. That's a huge but unexplained shift, a shift I called a ""gap in the internal logic of this story."" [Edit: In other words, with the apple notes, there was an option. One could trade the apple notes with others or get apples. With the new notes, there is no option. You must trade the notes. There is no underlying good or service to redeem.]"
