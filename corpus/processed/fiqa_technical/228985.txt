I wrote a story on Reddit about being a black man not able to catch a cab in DC, Uber pays people to post online about how they're better than taxi cabs. They spammed my post with promo for their service. They also downvoted my comments that asked them why they were promoting during that specific time, and then they downvoted the entire thread once it stopped going in their desired direction. I then realized how diabolical they were at controlling their internet promo/image and decided to not use their service ever. There is a big difference in providing a cost-effective and high quality service versus just promoting a service online. i don't think they know the difference. The minute their competition dies, I'm quite sure they'll go back to being the same as everyone else. Also I'm pretty sure they're in this thread already.
