I'm not supporting either one of these representatives of money and power. They basically represent two sections of the ultra-wealthy who have opposing viewpoints on how fast to screw over working people and to lower our standard of living. Obama thinks it should be done slower than Romney, but ultimately agrees. See what happens when we pass over the fiscal cliff. It's gonna be shared sacrifice time, and by shared they'll mean its time for our social services to go bye bye just at the time when the wealthy are better off than ever and the corporations are sitting on $2T in cash and not using it to hire.
