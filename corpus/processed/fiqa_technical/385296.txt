Yeah, I suppose I mean that a lot of people were pushed into going into college with no idea of what they actually want to study, and ended up with a bachelor's in English Lit and a minor in Theology. Lovely people to enjoy a conversation with, but there is no way in hell they'll be able to pay their tuition without inhuman hardship.
