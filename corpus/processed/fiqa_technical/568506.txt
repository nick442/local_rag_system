"No one wants this? Um, isn't that what ""market forces"" are all about? A bunch of new entrants into the economy making those high wages may very well offset higher food prices, which forcing a population in a society of +85% obesity to make more economically informed food choices may not be such a bad thing. Farmers don't pay because their entire business model is based on exploitation of illegal laborers. Remove the illegal labor and the model collapses. This is analogous to implementing strict PED testing and player stats falling off of a cliff for the entire league."
