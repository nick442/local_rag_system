They are behind in speed and specs but nlt design and functionality. I prefer my girlfriends 2 year old xperia arc to my dual core motorola. The sony is only a bit slower but takes way better photos is much more comfortable to use has amazing headphone jack sound quality and gets great battery life. also the screen is like 100 times better. The motorola is basically. . Just little faster. But the arc is perfectly fast. So yes they are a bit behind but priced reasonably.
