It adds no REAL value to the company long term. Sure, existing shareholders will make some money on the rising share price after ratios are improved but at the rate these companies are doing it, don't you think it's too much? To me it shows uncertainty for the future and stifled growth. Personally I think shareholders should have the option to vote on approving repurchase plans.
