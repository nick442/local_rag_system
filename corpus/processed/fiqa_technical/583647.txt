If I have a slave and I let him stop being a slave at any time as long as he pays me 500 dollars, is he a voluntary slave? He's still here, right? He can leave at any time as long as he pays me. Oh, and I can change the conditions under which I *allow* him to leave at any time, unilaterally, without giving him any notice or allowing him to dissent. Totally voluntary, right?
