CUs are now starting to adopt some of the bank's tricks, like using a longer float during online bill paying and for outside transfers. Also for overdrafts they are now starting to kick into fees or automatic loans rather than transferring money from your savings account. I've been a member for decades and my CUs weren't doing this previously.
