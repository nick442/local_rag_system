I tried it, and it was awful-- essentially thickened sour cream with a flavorless pimento blend mixed in. Focus testing aside, if you introduce Queso to a test restaurant, and it's not immediately one of the most popular things on the menu, you should know you have something wrong. It's as if they never had anyone compare it to a proper Mexican restaurant or one of their direct competitors.
