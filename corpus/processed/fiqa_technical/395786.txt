I am very familiar with the Bloomberg terminal service and agree that their info on securities & markets, especially fixed income, is unparalleled. However, their news and editorial departments espouse the viewpoints of Michael Bloomberg such as being permabullish in the face of data, pro gun control, pro immigration (legal+illegal), pro Israel, and pro Sunni monarchies (Saudi et al).
