"Pot is not some sort of ""sacrament of the creative"". It just happens that, out of the large percentage of people who have tried it, some also happen to fall on the 20% side of the Pareto distribution. It's like saying ""all the really great leaders of the world have been beer drinkers"". It's just stupid. Stop saying things like this and people will regard you as less stupid."
