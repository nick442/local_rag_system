what he doesnt mention is that when American was GREAT was largely the 50's and 60's . a period characterized by stellar tax rates. in 1944, FDR set the top marginal tax rate at 94% (for anything over today's equiv of $400k salary), and a corporate tax rate of 70%. Cutting corporate tax rates, when ppl don't have any more to spend, will only create bigger CxO pay packets. What is happening today is that the extra profits are being used for buying back stock (not reinvesting bc nobody can buy more). That benefits only the top 0.01% of the population. But the real worry is that these inflated stock prices are a mirage. Inside the companies are not doing any better. Soon its all going to collapse like a pricked balloon. Made worse by the lowering of tax rates. So much for MAGA.
