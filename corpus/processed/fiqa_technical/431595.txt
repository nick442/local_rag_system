"It's just a question of priorities. In short, yes. You could do the job successfully and workout 2 hours a day IF AND ONLY IF working out is your primary (and essentially only) non-work activity, and you therefore prioritize the hell out of it. You have 168 hours in the week (a figure all junior bankers know all too well). You do the math on working hours, sleep and working out and see how much is left for EVERYTHING else in your life. Not much. Perhaps this is obvious by now, but you'd have to be a complete fool to spend any time cooking, cleaning or doing laundry. You will be making at least $150k w/ bonus -- would you rather spend your vanishingly small amount of non-sleep/work/workout time cleaning, or attempting to maintain some friendships? Outsource the crap you don't want to do. That's the only way to make analyst life work, especially if you want to devote material time to staying in shape. By the way, when people say they ""work"" 100 hours, it starts to lose some meaning. Basically at some point you just flip the counting around and calculate how much time you're sleeping / out of the office and assume the rest is work. That 100 hours definitely includes meals, probably travel time to/from home and probably could include a workout during the day or early evening."
