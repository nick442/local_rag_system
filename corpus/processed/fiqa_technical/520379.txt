My take is that he can avoid a big tax hit by leaving it as and giving the untouched fund to the heirs. 100% correct. By withdrawing now he'll be subjected to the income tax on the gains. Since his gains are almost the whole value of the account, he'll actually find himself in the highest bracket, not the lowest as Joe suggests. Not only that, but his SS income will become taxable as well. Capital gains are included in the AGI. By leaving as is, the heirs will get stepped up basis, and the whole 700K will not be taxed (its below the estate tax threshold, and the basis for the heirs will be the value at death).
