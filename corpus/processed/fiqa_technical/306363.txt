"Would they go up at all? Perhaps, that's not unreasonable but not proportionally. If the minimum wage goes up some workers might choose to move out from living with relatives or roommates so there would be some increase in demand but we wouldn't be ""overflowing with potential tennants"" and if rents started going up these new entrants to the housing market would likely fallback on their original housing setup with would moderate the impact. As far as gas goes, while I don't have specific numbers in front of me, I think it's a reasonable assumption that US labor costs are a relatively small percentage of what you pay at the pump so even if those costs went up you wouldn't expect prices to surge."
