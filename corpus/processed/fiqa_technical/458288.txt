"Agency is restricted by real life geographic and financial opportunities. Credit and finance is a very important consideration, which influences ability to obtain current and future opportunities. If you grow up in a good desert, for instance, you'll likely have poorer health and very likely poorer education and development. If you have to scrape by and save and are able to go to college or obtain am opportunity for funding for higher education, you have to balance your day to day costs which peers with better financing opportunities will not struggle with. You may encounter narrower networking opportunity from your name, class, relations, and probably fashion, style, cultural norms. This ""free agency,"" is free only within the structural confines of your geographic and financial place. https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2015/11/are-food-deserts-to-blame-for-americas-poor-eating-habits-contd/415944/ http://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2016/02/19/a-college-degree-is-worth-less-if-you-are-raised-poor/amp/ https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/the-hoarding-of-the-american-dream/530481/ https://www.google.com/amp/www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-high-cost-for-the-poor-of-using-a-bank/amp"
