"They lose money on those (much higher rate of theft) and it still requires one or two employees to oversee, plus they bottleneck much faster than regular checkout because people are idiots and will try to roll through the self checkout line with 20 bags worth of groceries in their cart.

The amount of theft from people ""forgetting"" to pay for the stuff in the bottom of their cart must be mind boggling."
