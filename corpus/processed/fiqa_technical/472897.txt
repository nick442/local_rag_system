"That's the spin, but in practice it's meaningless for 90% of dry product. If they apply this to certain product categories it will lead to higher costs due to more product getting thrown away. Like I said, for fresh products y'all just don't buy shit that doesn't look perfect, and having stuff on the shelves past what we currently have it will make what's out there look bad.. unless we just ignore what ""use by"" actually means and do it the old way regardless. Which is probably what will happen."
