I think raising it is ok but not to 15 dollars thats ridiculous. I am a minimum wage worker i work 30 hours a week currently plus high school so from my point of view i think we should raise it by maybe 1Ã— or 1.25. I only pay two bills a 125 dollar car payment and 240 insurance pluse my expenses for gas. Those are my only expenses that i can not cut and even after just that i have very little left to save. But with a dollar or so more an hour ot would increase my saving potential by alot and give me a little more breathing room. I am an untrained and inexperienced qorker i do not deserve 15 an hour but i feel like 8.25-8.50 is reasonable.
