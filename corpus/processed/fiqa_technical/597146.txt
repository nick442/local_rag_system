Directly? That's hyperbole. Its not like she was managing the data or even the method of safeguarding the data. She was managing the person who was supposed to secure and keep securing that data. That doesn't make her blameless, but I wouldn't say she was directly responsible. She was tangentially responsible as the person ultimately in charge of Yahoo operations.
