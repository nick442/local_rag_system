Maybe I'm cynical but I always figured welfare was societal insurance against pickpockets, hold-ups, break-ins, and in a worst case scenario, outright riots. If you explain it to these bozos that way sometimes they get it. Or they start going on about increased police presence without understanding they're just paying more taxes in another form. Sometimes the money people need to be economics people. There are plenty of things with a monetary value that they don't seem to grasp until the shit hits the fan. //I don't study economics myself but come on -- it doesn't take a genius to realize that EVERYTHING has a cost, regardless of whether you can understand it.
