"> No one cried when car replaced Horse carriage Your broad point definitely stands, but this statement is not correct. A TON of people cried when the horse/carriage started dying - leatherworkers, cow (leather) farmers, sanitation workers. ranchers that raised & bred horses.. those industries were *gigantic* at the time and all took a huge hit. And it definitely sucked for them - they didn't do anything wrong, but their means of livelihood were eroded and practically destroyed - and not for depleting a resource of some kind (like maybe a mine running dry). But the relevant question is - what happened to the value of their product and is anyone at fault? The answer is that it's pretty simply no one, and you just have to chalk it up to ""times change""."
