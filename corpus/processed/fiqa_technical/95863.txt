I don't have the same brand, I have the Breville pressure cooker (which is similar but has an extra temperature sensor on the lid), but you don't know what you're talking about. Those buttons for different foods are just presets for pressure level, cooking time, and pressure release setting. Otherwise you can just manually set those options. Electric pressure cookers are amazing. All the benefits of a traditional pressure cooker but added benefit of computer control. I can make amazing black bean soup (with dried beans) in short time. Make a full flavored chicken stock in the fraction of time that the traditional method takes. Want some chicken pho super fast? Use a pressure cooker. Pork chile verde super fast? It does that too. Risotto in short time without having to constantly stir? It makes great risotto. My brother has the Instant Pot brand pressure cooker and it seems every bit as good as the one I have.
