It would be interesting to do an anonymous survey of upper management, to find out how many of them actually thought the retail stores would turn around. It seems hard to believe they were deluding themselves, it seems more likely they each were trying to fool their own boss, or the shareholders, a little longer, so they could keep their jobs a bit longer, and pretending that their subordinates fooled them.
