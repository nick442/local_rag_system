Common investment advice recommends paying off all debt before you invest. This is certainly not debated when the debt is credit card debt or other high interest debt. Some would argue this doesn't necessarily apply to school debt or mortgage debt, however its not clear what to suggest. Since any investment you make is unknown whether you will win or lose money, and every debt you have is guaranteed to be a loss via interest, its almost always a good idea to pay off all of your debt first.
