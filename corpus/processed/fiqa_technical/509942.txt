Dealhoud, You are on the right path but this is actually an Equivalent annual cost problem. You have to take it a step further and divide the NPV by the Annuity factor. You need to calculate the annuity factor and divide the investment by that amount. Annuity Factor = (1-(1/(1+r)^n )) /r We know the annual cost of the the current forklift = $5K. We need to figure out the Equivalent annual cost of the new forklift. Investment / Annuity Factor + annual Cost = EAC. Therefore $20K / (1 - (1/(1.04^10 )) / 0.04 = $2,465.82 + annual Maintenance = $4,465.82 therefore it makes sense to replace the old machine.
