One of the main advantages is that duplication from a few sources is no longer a vector. The two big examples, the lesser first, card skimming and breaches like Target's. The chip essentially generates a unique transaction code, and that is generated inside the chip. So even if you installed a chip skimmer, you'd have to beat the merchant to using the code, and it would only be good once. The same is true if you get something like the Target breach. Instead of a giant dump of card numbers, you get a giant dump of used codes, which aren't very useful for getting money. Even if the risk of stolen cards goes up, it should be a huge advantage for the banks. Additionally, a number of the banks are now implementing quick and short term freezes, like the Discover It card app. You simply click freeze in the app if you aren't sure where your card is, and unfreeze it when you do. The assumption here is that people are more likely to freeze it and do so sooner than if they have to wait for a new card in the mail. Theoretically, there's nothing stopping a consumer from keeping the card frozen all the time, and unfreezing it when they walk into a store, except the impracticality of it.
