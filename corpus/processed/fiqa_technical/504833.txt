Another simple case of reading comprehension. Both from your graph and from my post. If you're contesting that high interest rates means lower inflation, that means you have no idea how 99% of the currency is created or about the quantity theory of money. The CPI index is more of a measurement of how much money the average consumer is spending than it is the value lost of the dollar. If the average consumer spends 2% more than their basket of goods will get 2% more expensive. If wages go up 2% they will spend 2% more. CPI is a fucking joke, and anyone who believes it is either a lamen or a shill.
