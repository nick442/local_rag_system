"And I honestly would geniunely wish you congrats for finding such a job. Your value as a worker varies drastically by company, sector and location. Different companies will have very different market value data. For what it's worth, I lose candidates to counter offers like this from competitors all the time. We aren't an evil company simply because we can't pay you what our competitors can. My original point about applying for ""that damn job"" is to encourage those hesitant about applying to jobs that seem outside of their skill reach."
