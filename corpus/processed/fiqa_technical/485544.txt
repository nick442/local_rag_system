Yes, neat way to say it. One thing which also occurs to me is about the level of perception of the participants. Even in the same model space, with the same rules, people could pursue different actions, one's actions are a function of one's perceptions. If you don't see the red light up and stopped cars up ahead because you are focused on the cars in your immediate vicinity, you may be making maneuvers relative to them such as jockeying for position, unaware you are speeding towards a crash. if you saw yourself as separate from others, then merely seeking your personal immediate benefit might be all you could understand to be an option. What I'm getting at, is the more one understands the overall nature nature of the system, the less one is apt to pursue local maxima.
