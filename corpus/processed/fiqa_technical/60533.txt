I think a lot of it is our spending and the things and services we now consider needed or at least normal. Our grandparents didn't have cell phones, cable, xboxes, organic food, laptops, DSL service, 2 cars per family, yearly vacations to Europe, aging parents (and grandparents), day care, 3D movies. I could go on and on. Cut all that stuff out and you could probably live on one middle class salary.
