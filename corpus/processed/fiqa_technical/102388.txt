> if all man made CO2 magically ceased to be created that the climate would still change. Climates change, always. This is true. Even if we stopped contributing to global warming immediately, the climate would continue to warm for 4 or 5 decades, but this is because it takes time for the planet to heat up. And yes it's true that the climate does change, but usually at a slower pace. Species are going extinct at about the same rate now as they did back during the extinction of the dinosaurs. This isn't all due to carbon ether, there are many other environmental pollutants and issues. >poor people (through burning of wood for heat and to cook with) actually have a much greater impact on CO2 levels than to rich people. That's just false. Burning wood is definitely less efficient, but overall poor people release less carbon that wealthy nations.
