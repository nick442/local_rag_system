Well this is where quite frankly from my layman's view, Cat is just trying to use the loopholes that the big IT firms use, goolgle etc.. They just weren't smart enough to transfer their intellectual property (blueprints etc) to Ireland and then claim that they owe every penny they make to the holder of their intellectual property in ireland etc.. it's all nutty, but honestly Cat just didn't do it right.
