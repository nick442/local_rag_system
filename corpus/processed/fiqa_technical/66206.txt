Don't think it would happen - at least not for the next 4-5 years - they just put a pretty significant investment into BAMTech to invest in building out stronger online offerings, and are presumably working on an ESPN ott (over-the-top) platform that's gonna roll out later this year (although we know how flimsy timelines are with major networks). If the strategy doesn't work, or if Iger is hesitant to bet on switching to a more progressive technology (the future for cord-nevers, for sure) for the sake of appeasing shareholders, really the only turnaround strategy they have is the one they're pursuing currently - keep increasing carriage fees to cable/telecom providers so that they can continue to afford the rights they're stuck with for the next decade. If subscriber loss accelerates, or even continues at the current level they're at currently, ESPN won't be able to afford the cumulative rights fees by 2021, in which case we'll see what happens.
