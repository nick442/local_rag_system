Good luck with that. Vancouver is up 8.8% in value this year. Volumes are down a touch but demand is outstripping supply so it is back to bidding wars and selling 10% over asking. I sure as hell would not buy an $800k home in Chilliwack. Those areas where people have normal jobs.. that is sketchy. But Vancouver proper? There is too much money here and too many homes owned outright. Any bump means people de-list their properties and wait it out. We had a bump last year with the new foreign buyer tax, people de-listed and now prices are rising.
