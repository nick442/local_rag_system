I don't think actual variety is a bad thing. Idk if this is a business lesson from Apple Stores of the late 90s/early 00s or comes earlier.. I think they teach the paradox of choice lesson badly. What's lousy is a ton of options of nearly the same exact thing with no clear delineation between them. That's what confused the average person in consumer electronics and Apple was offering a bunch of overlapping computer lines with no clear distinctions and stuff that simply wasn't selling in numbers to justify the expense. Of course, if you're a shop, and 10% of your shelf space makes 90% of the sales, then cutting down on some of the 90% of shelf space or replacing it would have merit. But people come for variety, just look at clothing boutiques.
