I have read this at least a dozen times, and watched several documentaries on it, but this is the clearest explanation yet. Thank you. I had not really considered the possibility that the fed is not the evil monster it's usually frame as before. Now I'm not sure how bad it is due to these conflicting viewpoints. The worst case I have heard against it (repeatedly) is that it's a privately owned corporation. And that it's for-profit. What is that about?
