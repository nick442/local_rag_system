> The point was these places have entire under classes of their population that are allowed to literally die in the street. the us gov't was >10x smaller before 1900. but the US had the richest poor, and a very low income disparity. how is that remotely possible given your beliefs? you assume that a gov't that doesn't take from the rich and give to the poor will result in a lower living std for the poor. you don't know economics. the soviet union had a system where the rich and poor were forced to be relatively equal, but everyone was poor as hell!
