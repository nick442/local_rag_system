So, I'm in IT Operations and my work life balance is also shit. 50hr weeks are my good weeks. I'm always on call. Always. At any moment I could be on a 24hr conference call. I make less than 2% of my CEO's pay and I'm by no means on the lower end of our company's pay scale. CEOs are making more now than in the past, including when compared to the average working salary [source](http://web.mit.edu/frydman/www/trends_frydmansaks_0808.pdf) and [source](http://www.epi.org/publication/ib331-ceo-pay-top-1-percent/). That's just to give you perspective. Honestly this guy's email is manipulative and should be taken with a grain of salt. His argument for pain is that he's worked hard, didn't have any fun, and had to restructure his debt on his ginormous house? What about the folks that work two and three jobs to keep their shitty apartment in the inner city of Chicago? How about the pain of not knowing of you can feed your children this week or the next despite working those three jobs? Those folks just spend all their money on liquor and fancy meals. That's why they're poor. I've heard this argument before from the mining heiress in Australia. Poor people are poor because they are lazy and drink too much. That's a convenient narrative for rationalizing his greed and opulence no doubt originating from the deep analysis he's done on the socioeconomic causes of poverty. I'll buy that for a dollar.
