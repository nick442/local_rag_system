I think this has been clearly explained to you already. I agree with others that you are hating on Tesla because you need to hate someone and it's been all of five minutes since you last raged. BUT.. In case that's not the case and you really just don't understand let me try and explain it. The batteries are exactly the same, yes. The difference between them is one is limited by software and the other is not. There are trade offs to each choice. Limiting the battery to 20% of it's capaciy means you can recharge to full every day and do little to no harm to your battery. You will of course have a limited range. With the unlocked you 75kwh battery, you get more range. Now Tesla warns you not to charge beyond 90% of the battery capacity or you begin to damage the battery. However you get more range. Let's also be clear here. The battery packs limited to 60kwh have a REDUCED price of 8500 for the vehicle. If you want to upgrade you pay the 8500 difference, but you are also woke for tax rebates and incentives which make the upgrade cheaper. The short: the 60kwh version is cheaper, you'll get a longer life out of your battery, and if you decide to unlock the full battery capacity, there are tax incentives making it cheaper in the long run. Finally, your reference to this being a pay to win business model couldn't be more wrong. From just what I've said here you're wrong. This gets more cars into people's garage's and driveways as well as simplifies production reducing production costs. It also provides more options to the consumer at a reasonable price.
