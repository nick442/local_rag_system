Like I said in my original post, you could have two part time jobs paying at $15, restoring your hours, paying more. Again, the condition for this is the overall employment level (jobs availability). I say successful people, to show this is a widespread opinion verified by those who are successful, but being widespread it's believed by many people, including those getting min wage. It's a pretty simple concept, do you really think min wage people wouldn't get it?
