>where does Keynesian economics say that there is no demand? Keynesian economists, like Paul Krugman, say so. If the correct application of Keynesian economics says the US has insufficient demand, while the country's balance of payments has a deficit of several hundred billion dollars a year, then the theory is seriously wrong. OTOH, if there is no lack of demand while unemployment is high then the theory is also wrong. Where is the right interpretation of Keynesian economics that would account for both a sluggish economy and a big balance of payments deficit? The only explanation I can imagine is that production costs are too high.
