Bezos is a fucking hypocrite. GODS I hate him! The man who patented one-click ordering. The man who patented affiliate programs. The man who, only two months ago, hired a pile of patent sharks. The man who has been exploiting the patent system while simultaneously decrying it since his company got off the ground. Hey Jeff, we get it--you want patent law reform to give you more money and power. Well fuck off.
