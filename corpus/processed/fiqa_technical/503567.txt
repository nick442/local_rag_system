The fact that you're still calling it BW3's tells me that you remember when it used to be good. ;) A lot of restaurants (even fast food) go through the same downward cycle. When they're new, the food is good and always fresh. As they get older, management looks for ways to increase profits, usually by cutting costs, and quality suffers.
