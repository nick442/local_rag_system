I'm new to investing but let me present you with my logic. Let me first say I bought at 38.01, and while I don't regret buying in, I suppose i DO regret buying in at 38.01 when I could have gotten in when it was in the 20's. There is sort of a counter-hype lured me in. With so many establishments saying facebook was built on hype and was going to burn a lot of investors, I actually thought it might go up. On top of that, I believe in the company. With their customer base, they can literally choose segments of the market and dismantle them. Paypal? Boom, gone with a facebook payment system, Craigslist? Boom, gone with a properly implemented facebook marketplace.. (all hypothetical at this point ofc) there are so many different arena's facebook can delve into with the enormous customer base they have. And that's why I jumped in.
