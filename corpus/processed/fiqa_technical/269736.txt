The coupon should save you $10 either way, assuming that you meet the criteria for using the coupon. You're figuring out the discount based on the cost of the food alone. You should be including the tip in your calculations. Yes, they're tacking on something that is otherwise optional, but that's because enough people forget that the server works just as hard regardless of whether there's a coupon involved or not. So, restaurants build the tip in to keep employee morale up, which in turn encourages them to keep a good level of service up. I guess it gets down to how much you tip. If you typically don't tip -- which would be rather impolite -- then yes, you do lose money with a $60 meal. If you tip 18%, then you save exactly $10 ($70.80 - $10.00 = $60.80). If you normally tip 10-15% -- a customary range -- then it's somewhere in between. Edit: Following littleadv's discussion on this question, I am assuming that the 18% goes directly to the waitstaff and is more or less expected. If it doesn't (in which case one might choose not to tip at all because it would just line the pockets of the restaurant owner) then you're absolutely correct in figuring out the value of the coupon by treating the 18% as a tax.
