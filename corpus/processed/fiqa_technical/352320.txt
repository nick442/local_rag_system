> I can't imagine how some students feel when they graduate with nothing. I don't recommend it. (I graduated during the recession.) Technically, I was better off than some, because I was working at Walmart part-time during college, and they let me go full-time when I graduated. That kept me somewhat afloat for the year and a half it took to find a better job, though I did have to defer student loans for awhile. (My dad died the summer after I graduated and I was helping with my younger siblings.)
