"Actually, the main reasons to put incomptent people in certain roles are: 1. They will never advance and be a threat to your job. 2. They will cause problems, so you will need to hire more people to ""manage"" and fix issues. 3. They will accept the job despite you underpaying them. A real skillful person will not take an underpaying job. 4. You have no choice because HR ""calculated"" how much will be the salary for the job and you know that it has to be at least 50% more to get a person who knows the job. (I know that from experience, hiring many people to work for me.)"
