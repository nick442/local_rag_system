I know some people see Obama as a lesser evil, but personally I prefer to vote for as little evil as possible and that is not Obama. Many of the things Obama allows or orders is a continuation of bad policy, most of all extrajudicial and extralegal assassinations and killing of people around the world, not least of all drone attacks and the dozen official and secret conflicts we're involved in today. I will not give my personal stamp of approval for a person that does that.
