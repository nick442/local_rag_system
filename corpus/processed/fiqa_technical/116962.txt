This is exactly how monopolies are made. Allowing a business to use one extremely profitable business to undercut competitors in other areas (at below cost mind you). This should be illegal practice. Google should be hit hard. While I understand your stance, I don't believe it is creating an equal playing field in the economy and it is hurting it badly. For example, no startup out there is going to create an online maps startup (even if they have an awesome idea that would make maps better) because they don't have the ability to monetize and survive. Google gives their's away free using their near-monopoly on online advertising to subsidize it. You talk about the only exit for a startup being acquired by a larger company. That is EXACTLY the problem. You're creating unbeatable ecosystems. Google/MSFT/Apple/FB will only grow..startups will only have 10-20 companies to exit to. They should be able to survive and grow and compete on their own. Groupon was a company that tried to do that and you can see how they're doing. The tech world is turning into that very oligopoly that you try to caveat. People just don't realize it. We should break the stranglehold. If people paid for services, then their would be more entrants into the market as they could monetize quicker and the best ideas would win vs. the best connections to VCs and having an entrepreneurial track history which is how the bay area works. Startups wouldn't be SO DEPENDENT on financiers..they could monetize their actual client base.
