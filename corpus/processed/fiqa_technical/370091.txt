Oil adds to the costs because it takes man-hours to pump and refine that oil. Materials add to the costs because someone has to put the hours to mine them. Bad weather adds to the costs because someones job is now more difficult and it takes more hours. It forms a kind of net, and at the end of the day everything is just man hours (+ some percentage as profit/taxes). Land is probably the only exception here as it's quite purely priced by supply and demand. And there are no labor involved in producing it. (actually it's kind of ridiculous that it's possible to own land, against just renting it from government) “Buy land, they're not making it anymore” - Mark Twain
