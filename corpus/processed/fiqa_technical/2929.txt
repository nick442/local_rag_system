">Yeah but they don't go to work high. Exactly. >The millennial smokers I see often smoke a few times a day. I'm familiar with the phenomenon. Hell, when I was in college I went through a phase like that myself. Most people learn to self-regulate before long. >Come to LA where I live and TONS of them have the stupid fake ass marijuana cards. Medical use my ass, loser use is what it should be called. I lived in LA for years and had a card. I actually have several medical conditions that justify it, but that's beside the point that marijuana should simply be legal. Alcohol is legal even though it is a far more dangerous substance than pot. I don't have a huge problem with people circumventing a senseless restriction on a harmless activity. Plus isn't it fully legalized in California now? >I wouldn't call daily smokers happy or successful. Someone that is happy or successful can unwind without the use of drugs whether its weed or alcohol. .. HAVE used is different than use daily, you do understand that, right? You don't have to be a daily smoker to test positive. People who only smoke once a week are likely to fail a drug test. There's no reason to think that those people are unhappy, unsuccessful, can't unwind without drugs, or any other negative generalization you might want to impose. >""NPR had a statistic that about 1 in 3 Millenials live at home with their parents, 1 in 3 live with a friend or relative and the rest have their own place or live with their SO"" I don't dispute those statistics, but they're about Millennials, not pot smokers. Millennials' economic difficulties are more likely to be caused by the economy than they are by any widespread drug abuse, which allegation I have no reason to think is supported. And even if Millennials do use crazy amounts of drugs, so did the Baby Boomers, whose economic prosperity does not seem to have been impaired in the slightest."
