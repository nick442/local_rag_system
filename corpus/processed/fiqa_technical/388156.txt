Well, there are also cases where inflation actually helps you, individually, as a consumer. For example, if you have a mortgage or any other debt, debtors benefit from the value of a dollar today decreasing tomorrow. In a very general sense, psychologically you want to avoid deflationary periods as well as it tends to seize up an economy (why would I spend a dollar today if it will be worth more tomorrow?). Sure, the absolute value of a dollar decreases over time, but this is intentionally designed to diminish the value of hoarding cash today. Standard income should rise approximately with the rate of inflation, so from an absolute purchasing power standpoint you should remain approximately neutral.
