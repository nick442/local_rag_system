A Kindle's screen displays text much better than most mass market paper novels. Every time we moved prior to starting to mostly read ebooks we had boxes of books that we either gave away or threw away. I rarely re-read books. You can actually lend more and more books. You can also borrow them (from Amazon if you're a Prime member and libraries if they participate). Dedicated e-readers have batteries that are pretty tough to kill unless you keep the wireless on for several days. Textbooks actually suck as ebooks in my opinion. More annoying to take notes in, probably can't use the ebook version on any tests, and I'm more likely to need to page back and forth through a text book than a novel.
