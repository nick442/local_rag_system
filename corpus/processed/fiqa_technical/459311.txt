The fact base evidence is reinforcing the understanding that dramatic increases in minimum wage is detrimental in the short and long term for marginal workers. I suppose we can stick on head in the sand but I would rather call it the way it is. The politicians jumping up and down demanding increased minimum wages are only looking for the short-term publicity. By time everyone realizes it was a rotten deal the politicians will be long gone.
