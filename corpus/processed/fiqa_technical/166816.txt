"The [BBC article](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-40338220?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=news_central) is rather better on this topic: >The first charge, conspiracy to commit fraud, relates to ""advisory"" fees paid to Qatar. The second - ""unlawful assistance"" - could be more serious. >It relates to a Â£2bn loan advanced to Qatar after the fundraisings were negotiated, the implication being that there was a money-go-round at work - Barclays was handing Qatar some of the money it was using to support the British bank."
