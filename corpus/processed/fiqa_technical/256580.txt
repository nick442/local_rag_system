"The article is filled with terrible arguments. The entire point of corporate tax reform is to stop having a situation where startups and small businesses (which are net job creators) are paying 40% corporate tax rates, whereas large established businesses (which tend to be net job-destroyers) pay 6% effective tax rates due to the tax advantages of debt. The author simply glosses over this and keeps repeating ""CORPORATIONS ALREADY PAY 20% AND NO NEW JOBS ARE CREATED!"" Then the author also tries to point towards cronyistic tax deals as evidence that tax reform isn't needed, when that's exactly why it is needed. High corporate taxes result in a situation where large companies can lobby for lower taxes for themselves, but smaller companies lacking political influence are stuck paying the high rates. Illinois is a great example of this phenomenon; their corporate taxes are sky-high so large companies just threaten to move every time they want lower taxes; so you end up with the ""large company tax"" which may be like 2% and the ""small company tax"" which may be something like 8%. Overall, it's clear the author has ABSOLUTELY NO UNDERSTANDING WHATSOEVER of the issues involved with corporate tax reform. The US corporate tax system is terrible precisely because it rewards debt-driven growth and cronyism, while punishing real economic growth."
