"The Forbes article IRS Announces 2014 Retirement Plan Contribution Limits For 401(k)s And More spells this out pretty clearly. For your wife - ""an IRA contributor who is not covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to someone who is covered, the deduction is phased out if the coupleâ€™s income is between $181,000 and $191,000."" So, with your wife not covered by a 401(k), and your income below the stated limit, she can deduct the IRA contribution. When your income gets beyond that limit, she can make a non-deductible contribution and convert to Roth, if she wishes."
