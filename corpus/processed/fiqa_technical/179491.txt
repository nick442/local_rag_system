Vancouver.. just off Robson. I've never seen it out the door.. yet.. I'm sure it happens, every time I go it's literally all the way to the door.. just one or a couple people short of being out the door. Every single time I go. Food is great, I love that they don't take cash, I love sofritas. I like Chipotle!
