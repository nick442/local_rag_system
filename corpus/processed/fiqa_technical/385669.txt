"It can mean either. When A owes B money, then A is in debit with B and B is in credit with A. What the (Credit) means in this case depends on whether it is meant from the perspective of the utilities company or meant from the perspective of the customer. When the UI is user-friendly, it should describe the situation from the customer perspective which would mean you have credit with the company, but in that case the button ""Pay now"" would be really confusing (should be something like ""Request refund now""). A case of bad UI design. You should use the provided ""contact us"" link to ask a customer representative for a clarification."
