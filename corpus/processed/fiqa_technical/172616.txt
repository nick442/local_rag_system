"I'm reasonably familiar with the field for a non-specialist, certainly with the 14 qubit example and the D-Wave stuff. I've experimented with quantum lambda calculi, which relate to my own interests. But an article much like this could have been written back in the mid-90s. The fact is we don't know yet what limitations, hard or soft (e.g. economic), will be encountered. Although the article admitted that, it just felt too hyped to me overall. To be fair to the author, it's not just him: e.g. he quotes Seth Lloyd saying that quantum computing ""allow us to understand the universe in its own language"". Which, btw, is nonsense when you consider that imposing qubits on some underlying substrate is actually just encoding a specific approach to computation, and has nothing to do with the universe's ""own language"", whatever that means."
