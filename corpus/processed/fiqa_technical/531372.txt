Windows phones do not suck. And the xbox is the market leader, and xbox live is amazing. But I do use a droid. MS just needs to figure out how to play WP, and I think with Win8 coming out they finally might have something. I simply love my SGSIII too much right now. But I'm never loyal to a brand. When I renew I look at everything.
