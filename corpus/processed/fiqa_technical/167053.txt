That doesn't mean this is a bad decision for Toyota which you seem to be implying -Mazda could do certain processes better than Toyota and vice versa, so they can combine their capabilities -Mazda isn't a small company so the capacity and/or money spent on a new plant is still more with Mazda in the pic To give an example to your point directly: If Toyota made it alone let's say they projected they get 1B profit / year. If Mazda made it alone they project 100M profit /year. With the combined capabilities of Mazda and Toyota, let's say the plant is projected to make 1.5B/ year. Then if the deal is Toyota keeps 1.2 and Mazda gets 0.3, then both parties benefit despite the fact that Toyota could make the plant itself Mutually beneficial, unless these guys are just making dumb business decisions
