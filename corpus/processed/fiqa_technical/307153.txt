"The economics of it say that you need to win 30% of the homes you pass in order to break even. Google has only entered markets where there is already a cable incumbent plus the phone company probably offers service although their market share is surely smaller so there are 2 solid providers and 1 marginal provider, at least. For a 4th provider to come in, they could really only hope to break even and that would be very difficult considering the marketing clout of the competitors. At that point, you're talking a generic product and you can really only compete on price and possibly better service. Competing on price is a fools errand in this case as the competitors will match your prices until you go broke. Look at how Comcast and TWC ""miraculously"" boost speeds in cities when Google shows up. For a different example, look at the airline industry and what has happened when a low cost competitor brings service to a city that has an airline fortress hub. The big airline will double capacity on the route and match every price until they break the upstart. The day (literally) the new airline folds, they cut service and raise prices."
