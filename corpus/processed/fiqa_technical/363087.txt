Depends on the role. I've worked in a back office and middle office setting at an investment bank working 8:30am - 5pm, no weekends. Also worked in sell side research and hours were more like 7am - 9pm, light weekends unless we were initiating coverage which then became a heavy work weekend. I currently work on the buyside as an equity analyst and my hours are more like 8am - 5:30 pm, no weekends. So depends on the role.
