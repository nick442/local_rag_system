I just pulled up the app, did you click on Amazon Videos in the menu thing? When I click on the tick I get a big green button to start playing episode 1. No issue on my phone whatsoever. The watchlist is useful if you want to watch it on a PC later. Since I have one hooked up in my living room, that's actually kinda useful I guess.
