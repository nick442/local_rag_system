The best thing you can do here is work with the IRS to the best of your ability. You can attempt to call them, attempt to go to one of their local branches in your area, or just hire an accountant to solve the problem. Just be mentally prepared to write a check. You could attempt to figure this all our yourself, but then a lot of tax law is open to interpretation. This is why I would recommend seeking the IRS's help if you DIY. Once you have addressed the issue to the satisfaction of the IRS agent, this will no longer be a problem. Provided you have a good attitude (which you express in your question) and are honest, I have found them very easy to work with. You will be a refreshing change of pace to the actual tax cheats. While I understand that you are not seeking advice on what got you your situation, I would like to offer some encouragement. Good for you for learning from, and addressing your mistakes. Doing this will serve you well in the future.
