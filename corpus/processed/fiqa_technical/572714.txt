It depends on how complex your return is. If the only reason you are not using the 1040EZ is because you are over the $ limits, you probably don't need the audit insurance. Look at the sources of your income. A W-2 per person, some 1099's from your bank, and you take the standard deduction because you rent, you probably don't need it. If you are a day trader, and you claim to have a home office, and your return runs dozens of pages, it might not be a bad deal.
