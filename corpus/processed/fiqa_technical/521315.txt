Do you really think that toll booth collectors deserve a 58k base salary? I mean, sure, pay them for the hours they work, but that is a job that requires no education and is already being done by computers. I can't know of many jobs where the skill/pay ratio is so badly skewed. Fuck me, sit in a booth all day working as a cashier and you can make more than teachers, PhDs, professors, public workers, construction people, and on and on.
