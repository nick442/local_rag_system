What I am taking away from this comment and the reply to it is that a greater level of communication with the client to understand that what and how we support them so they have a greater level of respect for the work we do. Your work relies on the technology to function and as such we do make you money, because without us your crew can't work. We have a number of clients who get that, but we also have a few that act extremely rudely to our staff when we are trying to help. The condescending attitude of how dare we not go faster, because they have important things to do gets tiring. I would never see our doing our jobs as a favor to a client. We're in partnership in the business relationship.
