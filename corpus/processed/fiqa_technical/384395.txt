Few months of loose fiscal policy? It has actually been 4 years and we are on QE3. The FED have been and still are increasing the money supply. (Which is textbook monetary policy during a recession). However, when there is more of something, it is worth less. Inflation and a weaker dollar are coming no matter who is president. That is his only argument.
