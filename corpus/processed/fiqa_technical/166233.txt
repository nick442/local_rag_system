I did some poking and found this: https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-management-regulation-fmr?asset=90778 The original article I used elsewhere in this thread was not correct. When I was involved with this personally it was around 2000 or so, it looks like they changed that policy sometime in the mid 2000's.
