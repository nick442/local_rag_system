So let’s rewrite it this way: “The rich are paid by the government to allocate the resources necessary for you to travel, live your life, and contribute to society.” That would be more honest, and would show that big business is not the benefactor creating our utilities. Big money is the current avenue we use to get the work done. They neither create the job, nor pay for the work in the end. They are a middle man that is convenient. And they are using convenience and money to leech what they can from We the People, and the government.
