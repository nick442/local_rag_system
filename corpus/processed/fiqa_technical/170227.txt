"It is important to distinguish between being forced to do something because of a natural law (""I am forced to eat in order to stay alive"") and being forced to do something by the actions of another sentient being (""Wal-Mart is holding a gun to my head and forcing me to work for $10 an hour or be shot""). No one is forcing anyone to work at Wal-Mart even if that person is ""forced"" to work there because there are no other employment opportunities available to them."
