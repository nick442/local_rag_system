I like Trader Joe's, but I first noticed these aspects of the business model in about 1984. Some of what they sell is good, some is bad, and all of it is put in the most romantically humble packaging. Service is excellent. If only Saab understood the affluent pseudo-hippie market as well as TJ's does. Boy, some of the prepared meals they sell really suck. Those burritos: gack! And the produce has the power to turn you off food entirely, if you catch them on a bad streak - for a while, the nuts were virtually inedible.Still, the cheddar popcorn is more addictive than heroin.
