With non-GMO ingredients, health specs to meet and often a crazy hectic back of house/kitchen, I'm surprised they even stuck with it. I miss working there, but from what I'm told by former coworkers, the queso is a bigger hassle to make and serve than the chorizo. When I get back I hope to taste it and see if they made the right call.
