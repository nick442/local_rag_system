"While I totally agree with you, talking to free market people, you have to address it this way. Their point is that they should pay what the market bears, not what you want to make. That is fair. But that market has shown they need to pay more, but they ""can't do it"". Roofing is a perfect example. Charge $6000 for a roof, materials cost $2000. Labor costs $800. The rest is additional expenses and profit. Even if you have to give your roofers a 25% raise that is $200. You aren't going out of business even if you have to absorb the increase and you can't tell me you can't raise your prices by $200, when your competitors are all over the board. I guarantee that if the cost of shingles go up, the cost of a roof is raised, no second thought. The problem is that they think their competitors are still paying the old rate. They are no longer competitive if they give a raise, they are no longer competitive."
