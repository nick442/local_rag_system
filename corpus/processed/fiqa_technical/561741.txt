You kind of have to take what the market is offering. The easiest way would be for you to have a system by which you could purchase the entire business and then dispose of the FFE and other liabilities as part of the sale. Then you could pick and choose which of the clients you want to add to your portfolio of clients and those you would release back to the market. The valuation of the transaction is the trick. Taking the new client and managing it profitably is presumably something you feel you are well-suited to do already.
