Since your comment on @JoeTaxpayer's answer says that you are still under the 2012 contribution limits if the extra money is left in your 401k account, I do not think that there is any problem for you if the money is left in the 401k account. As I understand it, your salary is $X for 2012 of which you contribute some percentage per paycheck to your 401k account. Your contributions would have totaled $Y for 2012 if the glitch of extra money being out into your 401k account had not occurred. In the absence of the glitch, your W-2 form would have reported $X as gross wages, $(X-Y) as taxable wages and $Y as 401k contributions. Since an additional $z has been put into your 401k account, but not deducted from your paycheck, your employer could do one of two things. The extra money could be withdrawn from your 401k account by your employer. If this is done, then your W-2 form will be as described above. The extra money is not withdrawn by your employer. Your W-2 form will still report $(X-Y) as taxable wages, but $(Y+z) as the 401k contribution and $(X+z) as gross wages. Since $(Y+z) is less than the maximum 2012 contribution, everything is fine. In your position, I would very much prefer the latter alternative over the former, not just because there is a larger contribution to the 401k account with no change in tax liability, but also because there is always the possibility that HR/Payroll will screw up the withdrawal of the excess contribution so that it appears as a premature withdrawal by the participant. In this case, the participant not only has to pay income tax on $z but also a 10% excise tax for premature withdrawal, without actually getting even a penny from that $z taken out, which will go right back into the employer's coffers.
