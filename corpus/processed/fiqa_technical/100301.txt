>First, federal labor law bars even non-union employers like Google from punishing an employee for communicating with fellow employees about improving working conditions. The purpose of the memo was to persuade Google to abandon certain diversity-related practices the engineer found objectionable and to convince co-workers to join his cause, or at least discuss the points he raised. Google can come back saying something along the lines of he didn't take correct steps or what have you to do this. I haven't seen a confirmed story about how his manifesto got leak or that he made it well public. >In a reply to the initial outcry over his memo, the engineer added to his memo: “Despite what the public response seems to have been, I’ve gotten many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude for bringing up these very important issues which they agree with but would never have the courage to say or defend because of our shaming culture and the possibility of being fired.” The law protects that kind of “concerted activity.” If this true, then he does have a lawsuit om hostile work environment. >The employee was also fired after making a complaint to the NLRB. Your article doesn't say that. Only says he made a complaint then he got fired and not because he made the complaint.
