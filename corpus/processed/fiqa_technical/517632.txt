We're in our fifth year of business. We never had a business plan and never took out a loan. We started tiny, and grew to be small. Many of our competitors have left the field, mostly due to debt and a local market that can be very hard to predict. I like this guy's focus on entrepreneurship for low-income people. For most of us, if you can start a business that ends up being a fairly decent-paying job for yourself and maybe a couple other people, that's good enough. Jobs for average people are disappearing, but those with the dedication and discipline can scratch out an alright living running their own show.
