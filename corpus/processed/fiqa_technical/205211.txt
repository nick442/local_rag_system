"1 - Delete ormake private your twitter or facebook accounts (you have more than one, yes?) that are explicitly politic. 2 - Take any declas off your car. I am talking about the ""Ban ChikFilA"", the PFLAG one, the Marriage Equality, the Save the Dolphins. 3 - Avoid flirting with anyone, male and female. That can wait for later. Story time: I was working for a very conservative institution, and in couple of occasions I was approached by a married man trying to get into my pants, and received flirtatious advances from a married woman. Most of all, they hated my political affiliation (which they got from a blog I used to write)."
