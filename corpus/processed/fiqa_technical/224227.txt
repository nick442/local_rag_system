"Amazon is looking for tax breaks..not only from the location of their new site, but also from WA State. WA stands to gain more long term tax revenue if Amz changes it's mind and decides to stay so they will likely kick in tax breaks to minimize the # of employees shifted to the new office. Also worth noting, they specifically say ""North America"" in the search so Toronto, Montreal, and Mexico City could all theoretically be in the running too. (Vancouver BC is out because it is just too close geographically to Seattle.) It really depends on their search criteria and long term plans."
