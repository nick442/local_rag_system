Or it could be that Uber's model is not sustainable and preys on the ignorance and precarious situation of people. That the driver burn rate is a good indication of an unreasonable pay. And we're not even touching the fact that drivers are pretty uninsured (yes I know about the 1 million coverage Uber provides. It's a supplementary coverage, meaning you first have to submit claim through your own insurance first).
