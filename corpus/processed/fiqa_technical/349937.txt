">If there's no demand, as the Keynesians claim While I agree with everything else you said, where does Keynesian economics say that there is no demand? I mean just because economists argue this, doesn't mean their theory argues this. This isn't like saying ""republicans believe"" (which is still technically incorrect since it would be difficult to speak for all republicans) because Keynesian economics is an established theory while ""republican"" is not."
