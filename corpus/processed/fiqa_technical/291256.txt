Intuit has a pretty good write-up on this subject. As you noted, you are allowed to exceed your limit by $2000 (though this overcontribution is not tax-deductible). Also, your contribution room accumulates. So, you may be able to contribute $18k for the 2015 tax year, but if you have unused space from previous tax years, you can make use of that, too. If you discover you have indeed overcontributed, you may be eligible for a waiver. The CRA looks kindly on honest mistakes. Consider talking to a tax accountant, and then calling up the CRA and discussing it with them. If you are not eligible for a waiver on the excess, you need the form T1-OVP. This lets you declare the excess contributions and pay the tax on it. You also need to withdraw the excess from your RRSP and may need to provide evidence of this withdrawal. Again, strongly consider talking to an accountant and to the CRA (who are surprisingly polite and helpful on the phone). 1% penalty per month can quickly get expensive and now's the time to ensure you have your ducks in a row.
