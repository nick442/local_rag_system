"Yes ROI is legitimate, in my opinion. My old boss used to say 'change the paradigm' all the time though, and only used it when someone came to him with a problem and he didn't want to deal with it. ""Bob, we have a problem with XYZ"" ""No no no, change the paradigm. This is an opportunity for you to shine. Go get em!"" Maybe my experience with a horrible, horrible boss that abused a lot of these phrases and thought he was Jack Welch's long lost son just made me bitter any time I see marketing bullshit. :)"
