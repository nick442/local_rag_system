I'm not expert here, but a method used by quite a few people I went to school with was to save as much as possible before starting and continue to save as you go. Better explained, if you are able to save a years worth of tuition, or in a better case, save even more, you can pay as you, or in this case your child, attend(s) classes, and continue to add money to that account. If your child can hold down a part-time job during school, as many college students do, they can even help by saving some money into that account, and it can allow them to exit college free and clear of any loans, or at least mostly clear, should you fall a little short. It's not the best option, but given a short time frame, it can work, and I've seen it work.
