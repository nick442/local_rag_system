I understand I am being a tad simplistic. But we can all pull a Wikipedia article out of our ass can't we? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis Similar price increase ($3 --> $12). But lets just compare the effects by looking at the length of the article and not the content. I concede I am again be a tad simplistic. But the oil shortage nearly escalated into a full blown war, crashed the stock market, and all these other implications. I think that supports my original argument to OPs question, dont you think u/raybrignsx?
