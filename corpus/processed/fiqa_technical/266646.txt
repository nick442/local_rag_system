It's more about ending the policy of perpetually low interest rates, which makes borrowing/debt artificially cheap for the private sector. Higher interest rates will encourage savings and thus a rebuilding of capital for wealth generation. The effects would not be immediate but would have a better end result. Federal savings could help the economy too if taxes were lowered correspondingly. Or even if taxes weren't lowered and the government didn't borrow as much from the fed, the money supply would increase less and prices would be lower than they otherwise would, increasing the purchasing power and therefore the wealth of the citizenry.
