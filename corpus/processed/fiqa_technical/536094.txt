Exactly. My unit is short staffed nurses. I get payed double for every extra i work and that's not including over time. I do it because it's short lived until new staff are hired and trained. If my boss was not the boss she is, i would not do this. We are not short staffed because of her. We are short staffed because we are constantly learning and pushing ourselves to the next level and for many that means higher education either a doctorate program in nursing or medical school. We all work on a great unit where we learn every day. We work together every day. We are a team. We do not code patients on our own. We do it together. There is no other place i have worked in healthcare that is so clearly a team than where i am now.
