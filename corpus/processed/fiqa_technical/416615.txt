">If you're argument held true in court, no one could sue anyone successfully. That is my point. Admittedly, my above example is very simplistic - but it was designed to simply illustrate my point. And no, buying a shares of Google or Exxon or whatever other equity would not make you lawsuit proof..otherwise all you would need to do is open a brokerage account. I won't go into this on post but I would be happy to type out a few real examples - they involved Trusts, Holding LLC's and even suing yourself.. This whole conversation started by the article about Robert Kiyosaki getting sued by his partners, getting a judgement against him and instead of paying his former partner - he BK's one of his companies to get out of debt. Rich Dad's estimated personal net worth? [$80 Million](http://www.forbes.com/sites/helaineolen/2012/10/10/rich-dad-poor-dad-bankrupt-dad/) How many books has he sold? JUST the Rich Dad Poor Dad book has sold over [26 MILLION copies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Dad_Poor_Dad#Publishing_success)..and obviously that doesn't count future sales. (he has many books, DVD's educational material, seminars..etc) Rich Dad is also very diversified and has [other business interest such as mining companies, oil and gas, solar, venture capital..etc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kiyosaki#Business_ventures_and_investments) The above referenced Forbes article goes on to say: ""Rich Dad Co. CEO, has informed them that Kiyosaki would not be putting any of his personal fortune toward the settlement. As for Rich Global, Sullivan claimed it only had a few million in its coffers."" So here is a case of a legitimate lawsuit, it was heard in court and Rich Dad was ordered to pay $24 Million to his former partner(s). He claims he can't pay it and files for Corp BK.. Yet his personal net worth is over 3x that amount (not to mention the net worth of his new company) - not to mention future sales. Thanks to some financial and legal gymnastics his partners get screwed out of their share of earnings. I fail to see how this isn't an example of abusing the system. Rich dad isn't even offering to pay out on future sales or even trying to negotiate a lower settlement. He just pulled out the BK card and FU - his debtors will get pennies on the dollar. It seems that our ""perspectives"" on ethical business practices are at opposite ends of the spectrum. In my opinion, utilization of the BK laws in this manner which effectively makes one completely exempt from liability or financial responsibility is exactly what is wrong with the Unites States (at least one reason). If you can't (or refuse) to see this or you truly think ""this is just good business"" then.I don't know what else to say other than you are part of the problem. ******************** Oh and I never addressed your other point.. >first you would be breaking the law for driving without insurance. No problem. I'd pay the +/-$500 ticket and keep moving - while you drink your meals through a straw."
