And who said high finance isn't criminal half the time? Did any one important go to jail for inflating the housing market and defrauding people in 2008? Of course not.. But back to your point about paying people a lot of money to save lives which is repeated ad nauseam. It isn't relevant because it assumes smart people only discover things to make a lot of money. Ya go tell that to academics who spend their lives in labs etc discovering things and building science from the ground up, I wonder how much they get paid vs. pharma execs. And even if it proves true to some people I think most would agree that say doctors and drug inventors who actually save lives should be paid well but that's not the people we are dealing with here. We are dealing with financial vultures who just make money off of this because they can and nobody is there to regulate them.
