I'd rather cut off a ball than move to Texas. Bunch of fake cowboys circle jerking each other's fake greatness in a godforsaken wasteland baking in the harsh sun. No ma'am. I'd rather not live in place that idolizes a perverted idea of a long dead rebellious republic. Guess I'm too American to want to live in Texas.
