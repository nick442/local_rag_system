So now that you realize you are wrong your response is stop crying? I'm sorry I don't like to see my fellow man being stolen from. Also as a 1099 worker you are still subject to income tax and jail time if not paid. That's the part of this you don't fucking get. If I don't give the government my money I get kidnapped and thrown into a fucking cage.
