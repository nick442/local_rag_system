Yeah, and what blows my mind most is that there was a very easy out for regulatory relief that would have actually brought us closer to compliance with BCBS rules. In the US the threshold for Basel rules is $50B in assets, while under Basel III and in most of the world its â‚¬250B. Just adopting this standard would give small banks relief. As an aside, the new law would also make it harder for the Fed to adopt the Basel III finalization rules, which are incredibly advantageous to US banks and which we fought hard for.
