"If they'd just let me cast stuff from an app like I do with 90% of the stuff I watch off Netflix I'd probably watch stuff a ton more from it. Netflix + chromecast is so brainless that I can just toss on any old thing without investing much time or effort. Watching Prime stuff is, like I said, an inconsistent hassle. Like.. I just fired up the Amazon app on my phone. Oh, there's the new Tick show right at the top. I click on it. The only option is to add it to my ""Watchlist."" What's that noise? What if I just want to watch it now on my phone? Where even is that watch list useful? I really feel like Amazon is too worried about selling their relatively cheap hardware. If they just let me actually watch their content, I'd be able see some actual value in it. And yeah, the hardware is cheap, so why not just get a fire stick? Because then I have another fucking power cord I have to route through my wall and another input to manage on my TV. I already have a streaming device for everything else that offers a consistent and stable experience for every other stream service I use. Why can't Amazon just play nice?! Oddly, I think they want to sell their hardware to help push their content.. but I'm _trying_ to watch their content already!"
