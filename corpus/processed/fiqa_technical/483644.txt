"You cannot recharacterize a distribution from an IRA the way you can recharacterize a contribution. It the latter case, you are in effect telling your IRA custodian to treat the contribution as having been made to a different kind of an IRA from the very first day that the contribution was originally made. As described in JoeTaxpayer's answer, you can put back the distribution into the same IRA account or establish a new IRA account (of the same type) and deposit the distribution into the new account. Note carefully you have 60 days (not two months) to complete this maneuver and that postmarks don't count: the money must be deposited into the account, not just received by the custodian. Also, the 60-day clock starts on the day that the distribution was made by the IRA custodian and not the day you received the money. If you choose to put back the money into the ""wrong"" kind of IRA as described above, you can take a distribution from the ""right"" kind of IRA, and effectively achieve a kind of ""recharacterization"" of the net distribution, but the mechanics are more complicated and the deadlines a lot tighter."
