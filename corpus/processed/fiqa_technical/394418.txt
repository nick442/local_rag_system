"My guess would be that they sell your debt to a collection agency and don't really bother with pressing charges for 500 dollars. A collection agency can do multiple things to hold you accountable for your debt. I hate to bring it to you but it only makes sense that you should try to resolve this debt given that ""not being careful enough"" is not facebook's responsibility. I also assume they won't let you run any further ads on the same credit card. Edit: What you could possibly do is call facebook and be honest with them, tell them it was an accident and that you can't pay the current amount. Maybe they'll waive the debt or give you a settlement offer."
