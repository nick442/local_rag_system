I'm the last guy to argue in favour of increasing the protections around creative works, but I don't think I'd categorically agree that the best artists have regular jobs. My favourite books were all written by pro authors, my favourite games by pro developers. Even when I listen to indie music, the best ones are playing the touring game, making them pros. Arguing against DRM doesn't require deriding professional creatives.
