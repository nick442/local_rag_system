> You don't need to tell me your charity plans. you don't need to tell me i have no empathy. i'm well aware of what it's like to have no money. but using the gov't to force people to give you money doesn't help in the long run. > menial workers are NEEDED in a society, and therefore they should be able to make enough money to survive in the society. agreed. but the gov't's use of policies that people like you support is the problem. i realize you mean well, but why is it that in the soviet union, which redistributed wealth to an extreme had a population that was equal, but all equally poor? even the poor in the US, with a relatively tiny govt, were rich compared to them. obama and his fed are the main reason for this economic downturn. and in an economic downturn it's an employers market. that's the problem for these people. but we don't fix it by redistribution. we fix it by letting the economy get better. by stopping 0% interest rates, high taxes, and crippling regulation. the US gov't practically didnt exist before 1900. it was >10x smaller than now. how were the US poor the richest poor on the planet? how is that possible w/o the govt giving them money?
