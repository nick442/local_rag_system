Are you being willfully obtuse? Of course you can do both. However, had you never been taxed you'd have that same money to spend as you see fit, such as giving it to charity. Mind blowing right? Oh so you know how to spend that money better huh? Maybe I say I know how to spend your money better than you. Fuck your charity for down syndrome. People with prostate cancer need it more. Here's your tax bill :)
