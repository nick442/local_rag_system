It is different this time. But I think the risk of asset prices rising is almost as equal as them falling. QE caused asset price inflation, but QE was only to calm/support the market. They're probably not going to stuff that QE money back into the central bank for a very long time either. Maybe, they'll just keep rolling over the bonds out to maturity, while relying on deficits to inflate away the assets at the Fed. https://youtu.be/o8LAUQwv77Q My bet is the main risks going forward are political risks, and continued modest inflation among things not measured by CPI.
