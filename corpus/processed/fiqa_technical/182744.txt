">Mike Pence Sums up Trumpcare Perfectly: ""No Money, No Healthcare"" He never fucking said that. Here's his actual tweet: >Before summerâ€™s out, we'll repeal/replace Obamacare w/ system based on personal responsibility, free-market competition & state-based reform If you want to draw ""No Money, No Healthcare"" as a conclusion, fine, but you can't assign it as a quotation to Mike Pence if he never said it. I have no love for Mike Pence, but I do respect the laws of punctuation and basic journalistic integrity. If someone is really that bad, which he likely is, then you should be able to damn him for what he actually says or does. You shouldn't have to resort to simply making shit up."
