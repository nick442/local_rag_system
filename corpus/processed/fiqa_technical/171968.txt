>-service (many products rely on the company maintaining a server for them to talk to, so you don't know if a product will even work in a few years, which is bad for smart appliances that people expect to use for 10-20 years. This is one of my main gripes with smart home devices. While the functionality can be enhanced with more nuanced and complex control, and also control from basically anywhere in the world, the lifespan of these devices are going to be so short. And we are paying an arm and leg for them. You can get a basic thermostat for what, less than $50 and it will do the main function perfectly well and last you as long as you will live in your home. A smart thermostat will have planned obsolescence. It's functions will start to work more poorly as the software gets automatically updated over a few years. Then you have to pay the same 4x price again.
