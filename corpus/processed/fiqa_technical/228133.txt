"Best answer I've heard when asking this question is ""because they can."" Traditionally Australia was remote enough, and it was justified due to the cost of shipping and importing.. but now that's not the case and they're still sticking it to you, and you're still paying it. Even digital media (music, video, software), the poster-child of an item that has zero difference in delivery cost, cost more in Australia and there is absolutely no reason for it outside of the fact that you're going to pay it. Sorry dude.. Start finding ways to fight back. Find a US based VPN and route your purchases through the U.S., maybe save some money that way? Make your physical purchases overseas and ship them home when you happen to leave the country (if ever). Have friends do so when they leave the country.. Good luck!"
