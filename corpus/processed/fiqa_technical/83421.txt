Here in Denver, the local Kroger chain went into grocery pickup in a big way about 18 months ago. They carved off part of the retail space at the front of select stores and installed coolers & storage lockers for holding orders placed online, and also grabbed a couple of close-in parking spots and put in hard-wired call boxes on yellow stanchions so people could drive up and announce they were ready to have someone wheel out their groceries. About three months ago they quietly removed all the visible equipment, although I think the storage areas remain. I'm just not sure how profitable it was for them.
