> They have enough nationwide 800 MHz spectrum for good voice and LTE coverage and penetration, and they have enough 2.5 GHz spectrum to outdo every other carrier in capacity. I didn't know this (non-American). Fair call. > The argument about tower count is largely irrelevant with today's mobile data demand. In the long run sure. In the short term I'm going to disagree with you. If I ask you to deploy 800mhz over a city and 2600mhz over a city for coverage purposes. You'll definitely have the first project done before the first (all else equal). Its like acceleration vs top-speed; the 800mhz car gets you to acceptable speed faster than the 2600mhz stuff, but in the long run getting to their top speeds take both players the same amount of time > The argument about accuracy is also ridiculous considering the performance at the edge-of-cell and in the sector nulls; you're going to need multiple sites regardless if you want acceptable coverage for everyone. I don't think it is ridiculous when you consider the planning required for a small city especially, if you have to do Greenfield deployments. But whatever I agree with your net conclusion T-Mobile is screwed. Sprint not so much.
