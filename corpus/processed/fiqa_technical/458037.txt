Well you can fudge the figures all you like, the fact is the Fed grew its book from US $800 billion to US [$4.5 Trillion](http://www.econdataus.com/fedbal.png) This money has remained tied up between the Banks and the Fed and none of it has come to increase liquidity in the real economy. There has been no growth in wages, jobs, purchasing power. This 4.5 trillion is funny money that has benefited the few on paper and had no impact on the real economy or addressed structural and systemic issues in the financial system. It has simply been used to show the banks as solvent and capitally adequate against an unlimited credit line from the Fed and the Fed is getting ready to pump all that bad shit back into the economy. People don't have money . .thats why there is no inflation
