Your line of reasoning is why you should have a timeline on a prediction. It's been, what, 12 years now of near constant assertions that huge inflation is just right around the corner. How long should we wait for it? How many people's jobs, skills, health and education should we sacrifice right now to keep the inflation, which there is absolutely no sign of whatsoever, at bay? Keep in mind that idling all this productivity assures more poverty, and more deflationary pressures as people can't pay their bills, take out debts, buy homes, or go to college, let alone make a better place for their kids to grow up in.
