If you are allowed to do that then you have a lot of options. Mainly, look at competitor offers and think about consumer utility. Papa John's is a bit different though because i see them as catering to middle class when really I think those people have dropped their consumption of papa John's sort of goods so really, papa John's should be targeting the same demographic as pizza hut/dominoes. However, if they do compete in that sphere it is an open announcement of where they stand and I think papa John's thinks too highly of themselves in that regard. Imo, offer something similar to Costco take out pizza 9.99 for a x-large supreme and that should do a bit. However, lower amount of toppings, but same variety etc. That's pretty much what dominoes did with their large 3 topping carry out. They just lowered the amount of toppings volume wise.
