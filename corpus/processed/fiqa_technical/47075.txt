> A: I shouldn't have to leave just because thugs say they run land. They don't own the land I'm on, private persons do. Those people should be the ones saying whether or not I can be there. Good luck arguing that in court while defending non-payment of taxes. Might want to look up Wesley Snipes court case - not like this hasn't been argued before. > B: I actually can't leave for free. Of course you can't. You didn't exactly live here for free either. Imagine if you woke up from unconsciousness at a hospital that just saved your life - would you *not* get billed just because you weren't conscious to *agree* with going to the hospital?
