Dude. 50,000 engineers. If the entire UM ONLY produced engineers, Amazon only wants the top 10% of them to begin with. So it would take ten years of those engineers staying in town in order to provide an adequate local supply. Amazon had a hard time staffing to similar levels in Seattle, which everyone and their brother wants to move to, because it's beautiful and clean and well-run in comparison to most American cities. It also had Microsoft, Nintendo, Boeing, and a number of other software and engineering companies in town at the time. I really WANT this for Detroit or Newark, because those cities are really suffering beyond what they deserve, have a housing SURPLUS, and could become great again. But I don't feel like it's likely.
