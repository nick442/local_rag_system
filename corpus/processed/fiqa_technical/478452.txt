Yes, and . how that _prevents_, abolishes, negates or in any way opposes what I've claimed? Markets are dynamic systems (they are after all multi-player non-cooperative non-zero-sum games), and as such they can have attractors (stable closed loops toward which the trajectory of (the state of the) system progresses, and if enters into, formally can't escape, since they are closed loops). Thus intervention is usually needed to *maintain* competition, which is called regulation. Regulatory capture, abuse of regulations, abuse of regulatory power, and so on are problems in the greater model (in politics), where constant input sort of guarantees that it has no (stable) attractors, because as long people exist, at least some of them will have a habit of revolting. The question is, is there a more efficient way to ensure existence of markets and ensure competition on them? And maybe some sort of anarchism is the answer, but sadly we're not doing enough experiments and research into that.
