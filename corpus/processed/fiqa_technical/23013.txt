"I manage a bunch of rental cabins in a rural area that only has access to phone and internet with CenturyLink. We have 16 accounts with them. They are, by significant measure, one of the worst companies I've ever dealt with (worse than Comcast). I've long wondered how long it would take for the rest of the country to figure this out since Comcast and TWC tend to get all the anger. CenturyLink is far worse. Sheer management-level incompetence where it takes 10-15 minutes to find an account in 4 or 5 different CRM systems, passed back and forth between different parts of the globe. Zero remorse for missing appointments and, apparently, no ability to record that appointments were missed and fix/make up for it. I could go on and on. Do everything you can to steer clear of CenturyLink. PS. And yes, the phantom ""what the fuck is that!!"" charge suddenly showing up on your account has happened to us too. PPS. Another awesome thing - the DSL packages they sell in rural areas that flatly do. not. work. Rebooting routers a dozen times per day. Speeds (when working) of .3 or .4 mbps. Half of the internet accounts we pay for are worthless."
