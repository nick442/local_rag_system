Charles ponzi invented the Ponzi scheme (also known as the pyramid scheme) in the 1910 area before ww1 I believe. He got a bunch of people to invest in postage stamps and get other people to invest as they promised a huge return. Charles kept the money for himself and when people started wanting their money back it all came tumbling down. There is a movie on Netflix about how Charles got caught and the man who caught him. This is different than the Direct Selling industry (also known as multi level or network marketing) which is a legal multi billion dollar industry with brands like Mary Kay and Amway. There are three parameters that make a company an illegal pyramid: 1) only money is distributed. There are no products or services being rendered. 2) you can never make more money than the person who sponsored you into business. 3) you get money from the registration part of signing people up. Personally I am part of the fastest growing and most successful organization that utilizes this model. It is an organization called World Wide Dreambuilders, a mentorship and training organization that teaches people how to make a profitable business that distributes Amway products in a legal way with high integrity. Honestly 80% of the industry is people trying to hype up and sign up their friends and family and it's pretty lame. I can only speak for the Seattle area but my sponsor is making over $150k a year and has a strong organization with over 100 people in it. He built this business part time and is about to walk away from his day job in September and its freaking rad. Hope all this answers your question.
