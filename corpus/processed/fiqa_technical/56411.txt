What a bizarre explanation of what's really happening here- or more specifically, what isn't happening. This will solve some logistical issues related to multicenter treatment and certain tests that are outsourced to more specialized institutions, but had absolutely nothing to do with speed or accuracy of molecular profiling of cancers. Current modalities absolutely do not take 8-10 weeks to complete. They take a couple days at most. The only context in which any of this makes sense is one in which you assume full genotyping of all patients in the very near future, with a robust improvement in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of cancer. Let's say we have a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who we want to test for egfr mutation status, to determine whether we need to initiate erlotinib therapy. We don't need or want the full genome. All we need is specific exon sequencing. Talking about a nationwide network of information only makes sense if we plan on having bioinformaticists go nuts exploring genes that we currently have no understanding of with regard to pathogenesis or treatment of cancer. Saying this will speed diagnosis is like saying a faster internet connection will help you build a computer way faster. It's nonsensical.
