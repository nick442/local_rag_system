My dad is the head of his department at a major hospital and I've listened to him bitch about hours for the last 15 years+. The reality is that with meetings, administrative work, teaching/research responsibilities (when he was at a hospital at a university), etc., all of his work combined often adds up to 80ish a week. His actual shift work is significantly less than that. As far as IB goes, I only know what I've seen. I don't live in NYC and I am not in IB, but I know people who are and the stories have been overwhelmingly in favor of the 80-100 hour weeks. My friend lives in Houston (Houston! Not even NYC!) and he comes home at like 2 am most nights (studying for mcat + stressful job). He often beats his roommate, an analyst at a 2nd tier bank, home.
