With Apple the money is offshore. That is why they borrow and at now about $100B of debt but have about $250B in the bank offshore. But you do have to be careful because the money offshore is NOT yet taxed and so it is not really a 1:1. With Google it is less than $4B so not really a big deal but can not answer why not just use the onshore cash to pay it off. Google has plenty of money onshore to do this. I believe Apple over the last year had 4% onshore low point and high point was 7%. Google it is 40% or 60%. I know it is 40/60 split but can never remember which way.
