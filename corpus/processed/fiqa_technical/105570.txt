Require it to survive? hat has that got to do with anything? That is absolutely not the point at all. It is a bridge to the next job. People should not have to sell their homes and move on, especially in this environment, simply because they went without a job for several months more than they expected. If you don't want to collect what is owed to you, then that is fine. Do not assume that counts for others. I know people who live in rich households who pay rent and do not eat at the table with others. They show up in these statistics and could use the help even though it may not seem like it. That isn't the point. And it really isn't clear what the point is when the proposal appears to be causing people to mix their lives up in order to save the government a couple of million over the course of a year. What is disingenuous is to set up an unemployment insurance system and then expect it to be conditional based on all kinds of criteria. One thing you might not be keeping in mind is that the existing system has a error rate of around 20% varying a bit between states. That means around 1 in 5 that are owed insurance payments and sign up never get anything, and around 1 in 5 that are owed nothing for whatever reason end up getting full payments anyway. The more criteria you add to the mechanism the higher that error rate goes. You are quibbling over details that the existing system lacks the capacity to handle.
