"I'm genuinely curious.. what colleges are ""lying to youth"". I went to a public university in Nebraska, all of the mean/median salaries and employment rate of recent graduates for each major were clearly posted online. They were not lying, just reporting the statistics for students to see and make informed decisions themselves. I think people generally love to have someone to blame, but I don't think universities should take that blame."
