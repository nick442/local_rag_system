"nuclear plants + nuclear fuel rod storage facilities together take up a lot of space. also to go back to one of your earlier points, I tried looking up the comparison in mining between nuclear and solar panels, but couldn't find anything. however I think they are similar, not one being more or less than the other. the processes are not too dissimilar, you have to get what you're mining for then wash it down and purify it with chemicals. But if you saw the amount of land that was displaced to get one piece of uranium that wouldn't even make up an entire fuel rod you might not think solar had the heavier mining load. besides, solar generates electricity while the fuel rods have a set amount of energy, so solar will end up paying for itself rather than having to mine for more of a radioactive element once your fuel rods are spent. not sure I explained that last part too well but solar starts at 0 and goes to ""infinity"" in terms of how much electricity is generated while nuclear fuel rods start at 100 and go down to 0. so I think solar is the better bet edit: I also agree that energy is really hard to solve. every source has their drawbacks unfortunately. except cold fusion lol"
