Well, if the bond notes are the only currency around, then the electric company will have to choose from at least one of the money supplies to accept as payment; bonds will be the cash. Whichever firm they choose will just see their money demand go up. Second, It will most likely be implied that those people choosing to go into a certain money supply will want to look for a produced good or service in the economy from that firm before taking on it's notes. If the supply has too much inflation for everyone, than they can all move to another one that ensures their capital value.
