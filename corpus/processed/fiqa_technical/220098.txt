I still Love reddit to pieces, I’ve been here for well over 11 years. I love that it’s no longer just geeks talking to geeks,. But, even the geeky subs are filled with inane comments now. They need a filter for “Inane sub-thread.” I’m thinking about writing a Machine Learning plug-in for Chrome that removes them. I just don’t have the time right now. I would make it FOSS so someone can rewrite it for other browsers, and the reddit team could use it.
