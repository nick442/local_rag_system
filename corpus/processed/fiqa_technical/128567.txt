Bingo. The problem is most people associate the warranty as “warranty vs. total replacement” ($300 now vs. $3,500 later) instead of “warranty vs. repair” ($300 now vs. potentially $300 later). The fun part is when they still charge you. Edit: Your grandma has had the same appliances for 15+ years without needing any repairs.
