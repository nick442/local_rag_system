Yes of course. I'll come to your house tomorrow with 8 armed friends and then we'll decide wether or not we will redistribute your wealth among us. Don't worry, you will get a vote as well so it will be democratically justified. Sounds good? The social contract you're referring to only applies for services that protect you from violent interference by other individuals (e.g. Police, courts, military) and only as long as everyone contributes an equal share and gets an equal withdrawal. Redistribution of wealth IS violent interference by other individuals. The state is made a tool of the violent mob. If you're going to use the social contract in order to justify redistribution of wealth, make sure you attach a generator to Jean-Jaques Rousseau's corpse first. I'm certain he will spin in his grave.
