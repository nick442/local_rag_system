At the end of the day - it is not moral to hire someone to put a gun to someone else's head to pay off your debt. The ends should never justify the means if you are an honorable person. I believe in personal responsibility and freedom. Capitalism is the reason why people fled to the US and why t has become the wealthiest country with the best standard of living in history in record time. Your telling me Europe is doing great right now? Is that a joke? What about socialist countries like Venezuela and Greece?
