"Ok this is random but now I am super curious -- how can one argue plastic's inability to store value comes artificially/by opinion? As a man-made good, are there not any finite restrictions on its creation? It reminds me of the Golgafringians of Douglas Adams' *Life, the Universe, and Everything* when they attempted to make leaves a currency. Or do you argue something along the lines that plastic's value is artificial in the same manner as the dollar -- whether it is paper or plastic it can represent a promised/existing product despite its potentially infinite nature? And yeah, I know ""potentially infinite"" is a TERRIBLE term given the finite nature of anything on earth required to make plastic..but I couldn't come up with a better term though I am sure one exists"
