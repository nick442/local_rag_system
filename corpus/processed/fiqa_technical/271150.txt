Depends on how you supplement the major. I had people taking things like 'marketing' or 'business management' with their finance majors to get good marks, but they didn't get internships like I did because I was willing to take statistics, economics, risk management, accountancy etc.. In general you want to have a strong math background, a good understanding of economics, and accountancy. Also if I could go back I would have done computer science at least at first year level to get a feel for coding and modeling. Edit: I should clarify I don't have a permanent job, I'm just speaking from my experience of holiday internships with investment banks.
