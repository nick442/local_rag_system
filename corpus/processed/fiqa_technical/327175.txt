Like most major decisions in life it entirely depends on your goals. Do you know exactly what you intend to use the degree for? Are you aiming to go work for Ernst & Young? Do you want to be a finance director at some Fortune 500 company? Do you want to start up your own financial advisory or accounting shop? Going to school for school's sake is pointless after youve gotten your associate's/bachelor's degree. It's an investment. For the investment to be worth it you need to know exactly what youre investing in and why. So Step 1: come up with a very concrete career plan. What kind of job exactly do you want next and what industry/company do you want it to be in? Then figure out whether you need the extra degree to make that plan possible.
