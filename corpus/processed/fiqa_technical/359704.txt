"Free hint - If you're using some non-traditional definition of a common English word in a public forum then you should choose another word. But whatever. Please explain what exactly you were referring to. I mean ""rather"" isn't even that important. The real important phrase is this: ""in most cases, people end up paying more in taxes"" There aren't multiple ways to interpret that. ""People end up paying more in taxes"" means there are two scenarios - one with more taxes and one with less. You've claimed that the first of those is tax-deferred accounts and gave a reason why. But what is the second scenario? >NOWHERE Exactly. You're totally wrong. That's all I needed to hear. Have a nice evening."
