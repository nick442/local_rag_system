">Why do so many ventures fail? They are allegedly started by smart, capable people and funded by people with ""experience."" Marketing. It sucks but it is true. You can start a company as an engineer and make the greatest piece of software since sliced bread, but unless you can sell it you're fucked. This is why I avoid investing in startups. Some of the greatest startups fail and some of the horrendous ones succeed; life is unfair."
