Having an interview next week with a few companies, one of which is a bank as a financial analyst. Now the main job description is on detailed financial analyst, audit firm experience, 3 yr exp and review of customer/segment. Was it investment banking? Interview wise what I need to prepare for? I have prepared my project experiences and examples relevant to what they are finding for in power point. What else should I be prepared for?
