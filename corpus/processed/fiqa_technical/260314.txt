Come to think about it, Iran seems most cooperative and seems to be a great supporter of De Nuclearization, yet also wants to destroy Israel and has aspirations of being a Regional Power. I think they don't have the tech to build a bomb or they would have by now and because they can't, they accepted this deal and don't want it scuttled. I think they simply don't have the capability to build a Nuclear bomb and put it on a missile.
