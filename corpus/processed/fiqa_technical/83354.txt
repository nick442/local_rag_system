"I'm looking for you to use something more credible to back up your assertions. >The increased use of tasers among police who actually have tasers? As opposed to them potentially having to use firearms in those situations because there's no better alternative to stop a dangerous person from harming themselves or others? I'm sure that some officers user tazers as an easy solution, but if you insist that this is always the case then you're patently wrong. >The increased use of SWAT teams by police forces with SWAT teams? As opposed to the increase use of SWAT teams due to more situations requiring such level of armed response? ""Causation does not imply correlation"", or so you should know if you've been on reddit for a year. The slippery slope is your implication that any improvements in police response capabilities somehow automatically lend themselves to overuse and, thereby, abuse. Give the police a less-than-lethal way of dealing with a threat? Clearly they're going to start tazering everyone's grandma. Give the police better ways of dealing with dangerous criminals who arm themselves better than some militaries? Almost certainly the police are going to use this gear for routine traffic stops. Reading your naive perception of the world makes me concerned that you may think yourself actually fit to vote."
