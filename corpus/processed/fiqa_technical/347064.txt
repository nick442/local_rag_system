"Nope, you don't get what I mean. If you put a statement that is not only incorrect, but shows bias, you will get laughed at by anyone. Export means that you take something and then sell them to someone else. That's a positive, and actually exists (though still not quite the correct terminology, it is more apt). For example, the Philippines exports maids to the Middle East. That helps the Filipino economy, unlike what you are saying. But the other thing is that by saying ""export"", you are already assuming a net loss of jobs, which would not only goes against 90% of economists beliefs, and is the equivalent of starting an abortion debate with, ""why do you kill unborn babies"", and when anyone corrects you, you claim pedantry. You already showed your bias and pretty much invited a circle jerk by using those words. Which may be fine reddit, where the hive mind laps this up, but ask anyone who's gone beyond studying Macroeconomics, and you won't be taken seriously. The choice is yours, do you want a circle jerk, or do you want to engage in an actual conversation?"
