Sorry, this post is horribly misguided. First of all, any boat or yacht is a terrible investment. The depreciation is horrendous. Secondly saying you lease as otherwise youâ€™re tying up capital stupidly is incorrect. It depends on what your marginal cost of capital vs that of companies leasing. When you lease you also compensate the lessor for its cost of capital. If your cost of capital is less than that of the lessor then you would be stupid to get the lease. You would be better off paying the 250mln out of pocket and borrowing it from the market yourself.
