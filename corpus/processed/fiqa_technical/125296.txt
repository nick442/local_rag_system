Wa Po is not brainwashing people to buy Amazon goods or defend Amazon against monopoly charges. If they were doing that, I'd agree with you. But they are not. They are presenting evidence of crimes committed by the Trump campaign in their collusion with the Russian government. They are giving insight to the daily dysfunction of the Trump administration. Trump is appealing to the middle class who lost their shops to Amazon but they lost their shops to modern technology. ATM machines have replaced a million bank tellers. Trump isn't against monopolies. He is lying when he acts like he cares. He is giving the telecoms an awesome deal for nothing in return.
