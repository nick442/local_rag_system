How fucking retarded are you? >Maybe if fuckers like him could manage their house then government wouldn't have to bail them out and there wouldn't be a need for as much regulation. But no, he's going to keep gambling and expect tax payers to cover his losses, and then has the audacity to bitch about it. Fuck him. Literally look at what you posted, and how none of it is even true. What does Citibank have anything to do with what you posted you dumbass? And you ask me a question that you can google? Fucking lol
