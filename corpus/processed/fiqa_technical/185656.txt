I have never been requested to send a voter registration card. What on earth for? It sounds as if you don't have a credit report available on your SSN, so they're having trouble verifying your identity. But the most I have ever been requested to send to an online bank (ING Direct in my case, and I too didn't have a credit report yet when I opened an account there) was the Social Security card and a driver's license. Once you have a proper credit report information (a couple of loans and a couple of address changes), they can compile the data into a set of verification questions, which would be used to verify your identity. If you do send stuff - make sure to fax it to their 800 fax number, do not send via email. It may also be that their user database is compromised and someone is phishing you. Make sure they're the ones asking for info (and getting it) by calling their phone number (take the number from their web-site, not the emails).
