They aren't lazy they just don't want to do back breaking work for minimum wage. To get Americans into the fields we would need to pay over 25/ hour which would triple food costs for consumers. Which no one wants. So the farmers don't pay that and so the crops rot in the field. Supply and demand isn't a closed system.
