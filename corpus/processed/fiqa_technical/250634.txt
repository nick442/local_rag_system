"It's because of poor dieting and lack of exercise that they became fat in the first place. Somehow I doubt the ""best efforts"" are truly that serious if most of the dieting regimens include some supplement or other. Ultimately, it's just people being lazy. Instead of eating processed garbage with tons of preservatives, eat real natural foods. Instead of sitting on your ass watching tv or playing video games, go out for a run, a bike ride, or even work out in a gym. No excuse."
