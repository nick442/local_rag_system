"Uber absolutely is a taxi company, in the UK taxi model. Uber are doing with an app what every British minicab company has been for decades doing with a phone call. I appreciate that Uber are ""regulation busting"" in the US, or presenting themselves as such, but when the dust settles a deregulated market is a race to the bottom (as the British minicab industry long has been)."
