By handicap - I believe we should have a very simple safety net bimonthly check to help their guardians pay for their housing/food/healthcare. We should aim for this to be as small as possible while still covering everything and have the majority of pay be from charity. Lack of skills - nothing. They need to learn skills to survive just like everyone else. If you steal from the skillful to give to them there will be no incentive to learn skills and we will have less productive people in the country which leads to more poverty and lower standard of livings. It's also not moral to steal from one able person to give to another.
