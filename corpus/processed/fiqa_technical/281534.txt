As far as I know theres no single tool that does all that well. You'll have to keep your investments separate from your daily expenses and money goals. There are a few tools everyone uses. I'm partial to budgeting apps. You can try ynab, everydollar, goodbudget. I wouldn't recommend mint as I personally don't trust my login info with a third party. I don't care who owns them. Just my opinion. I'm working on my own budgeting app. Ideally I'd like to include investments. But thats V2. If you'd like to keep updated on that let me know. Oh, what type of phone do you use?
