Ask any smoker that has used the bubbler at smoke shop st Pete and they will tell you that it is a far more pleasant experience than glass pipelines. In terms of size, they fill up the gap between large glass pipes and the smaller bones. It was exactly this demand that caused its development. Just like a bong, you could use water as an air conditioning agent below. It's smaller size works to its benefit. You will hear a sound much like that of a hookah when you breathe in. This is because smoke passes through the water and is cooled and afterward breathed in.
