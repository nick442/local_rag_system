"Just to comment on this, I protested against the Iraq war, but I do understand why they went in and took the decisions they took (even misguidedly) Afghanistan was a month after 911, there was strong public demand and support for it, few protests Unfortunately that administration became obsessed with Iraq and abandoned Afghanistan to a skeleton force - which had disastrous consequences for the country But there was no specific malign intention in either case - more a gross misread of the situation There were intelligence failures (they aren't infallible) plus heavy political pressure on those agencies from a quite hawkish administration The Malaysian ""tribunal"" had no real legitimacy and was basically formed by a controversial PM who was quite anti-Western"
