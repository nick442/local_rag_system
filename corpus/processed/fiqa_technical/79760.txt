It's not taxpayer money. It's from the ill-gained profits of Ticketmaster. The legal expenses will come from Ticketmaster as part of the settlement. Each plaintiff gets $1.50 per ticket bought up to 17, they are not asked to pay for the attorneys. If Ticketmaster chooses to raise prices they will lose sales and hopefully another company will find a way to compete with them and cut into their market share. Again the individual class member (anyone who used Ticketmaster the last few years) did no work aside from signing their name to the agreement and now want to bitch about getting a free coupon. If you think you could have won a million dollar judgment for being overcharged by a few dollars you are simply delusional. The legal system is not meant to reward people for being screwed over but to restore people to their rightful position and to punish wrongdoers.
