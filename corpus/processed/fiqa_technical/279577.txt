"Welp, considering he did drop the TPP and exited the Paris agreement those particular ""bullshit"" lines were proven quite true. The courts and congress have held up his immigration policies or those would have been implemented as well so again, not lines. And the cutting of funding for UN and other global political organization is also very real as well so I'm not 100% sure what your are getting at here with this. As far as me being ""had"" I am again not quite sure what you are getting at as I specifically said they could turn out to be campaign promises or, as you so eloquently put it ""bullshit lines"". So far, to the extent these things are wholly in his power he has actually done quite well towards attempting to implement or pushing for implementation of most of his policies he espoused during the campaign. Although, I will certainly agree with you that US politics is largely filled with bullshit lines designed to appeal to right or left wing bases while both parties continue to ignore them or flat out contradict them while in office. Unfortunately, this all has very little to do with whether or not we should be surprised by Zuckerberg attending a tech meeting. Which again, was my original point."
