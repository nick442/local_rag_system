"Lol ok buddy. You googled some hysterical left wing editorials and I'm suppose to buy it as Trump being ""anti-science?"" They did that same shit with Bush and Reagan, and they'll do it to the next Republican president. It's an obvious play right? Steve Bannon plays the role of Dick Chaney, the puppet master that allows you to believe that the president could be a fool. Then they start with the pissy pants blog posts about being ""anti-science."" Sorry dude not working this time. The daily show snark left is on the outs and everyone knows it. > ""inversely proportional"" Wow pedantic, boy if nothing is evidence of having won an argument it's when dudes start griping over definitions. Inversely proportional works just fine here. > ""won on income"" is just poor phraseology. Nah, it was fine. You got it. > Most of your sentences above had poor grammar and, at first, I suspected some advanced Russian bot. But this is atrocious. Try to express yourself in complete thoughts. Read what you wrote .. it's complete garbage. I almost didn't respond at all since it doesn't deserve a response. Aww now you are just trying to hurt my feelings. It's almost as if ad hominem attack is the last recourse of a defeated liberal. I believe it's acceptable to take whatever grammatical liberties necessarily when writing mocking prose. It is intended to be read as it is spoken."
