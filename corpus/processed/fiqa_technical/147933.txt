So I am trying to puzzle out this claim about tax cuts paying for themselves through growth. This means that for every $1 in revenue they forsake in cuts, they expect to get $1 back in revenue elsewhere (like other taxes). So with a high tax burden on something, say 25%, that $1 cut in revenue would need to generate $4 in additional value to pay for itself. I can't think of *anything* where the federal tax burden is actually 25% of the total value. This looks like a pretty clear case of diminishing returns, because the *lower* the tax burden the *higher* the growth needs to be in order to get the money back. If we look at something on the order of sales tax, say 5%, that $1 cut needs to generate $20 in growth. If we flip this around and look at it as an investment, these are the kinds of returns that are reserved for miraculous right-time right-place bets. They are not the kind of returns you can expect to get from groceries and mortgages. Can somebody sanity check me on this?
