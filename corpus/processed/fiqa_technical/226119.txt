> If you want to argue that businesses are more important than people I don't think businesses are more important than people, I just think that the public good is not their concern. Leftists seem to think that the public good is supposed to be everyone's concern, I do not. > There's plenty of businesses out there charging a fair markup for a quality product or service and paying a fair wage. There is no such thing as a fair wage. I mean that literally. It's a nonsense phrase. What is fair? Where is fair? What does fair mean? There is only an agreeable wage. Walmart is entitled to pay you as little as you will let them, regardless of how that impacts your wellbeing, because I don't think your wellbeing is their concern. The same relationship works in reverse, You get to try to get them to pay you as much as you want, even if it hurts their business, because their business is not your concern. Wherever you both agree is whatever you get paid. Fair is nonsense, it means nothing. I don't like social management as an idea. It is only ever a necessary evil. I don't believe social progress is a respectable value and I mistrust anyone who professes to want it, because what they really want is to control the world. I don't think you or anyone else gets to control the world, I think you get to control what's yours and nothing else. I don't want the public good to be something *anyone* is concerned with as a matter of course, only as an exception when really necessary.
