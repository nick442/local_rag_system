Yes, but that wasnt the real issue. Lehman brothers didnt bring the recession, they were just a symptom of it. The real issue was the commodization of private loans provided by banks which weren't properly vetted or secured and were sold as AAA investments. So when a run on those investments occured, their value plummeted leaving many investment institutions with a gaping hole in their accounts that quickly grew in scope.
