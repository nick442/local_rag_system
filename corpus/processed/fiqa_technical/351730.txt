"I feel like you could talk this one down diplomatically, but only if you find a way to not be dismissive of the female employee. This will be difficult since your tone makes it sound like you don't seem to believe women when they tell you it's not always fair to be female in the tech industry. For instance, most women would never want to be hired for a quota or because they are attractive . That belief also undercuts women when they do get hired because they are good at their jobs. The pay gap is complicated and in part do to care giver responsibilities but that doesn't make anyone feel less salty. Anyways I suspect that if you told this female employee, ""X had their opinion but we as a company hear your point of view in this."" And affirm her experience, the issue will be withdrawn. She is afraid she is in a chauvinist culture and lashing out. I do agree that calling a disagreement sexual harassment trivializes the issue, and this personally irritates me. But you're going to get a lot of salty women if the culture of your company is to tell them you don't believe their experiences. As for firing, don't even think about it. It only ends in shelling out a lot of money to her or lawyers."
