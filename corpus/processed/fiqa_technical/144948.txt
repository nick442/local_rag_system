"Awesome news! Securing one for this last year will really help your case. That way you can put the extracurricular stuff you've outlined above as well as the two internships. Network like crazy. The sad reality is with such limited work opps, it's really more of a ""who do you know"", so I highly suggest connecting with alumni from your school and get feed back on what else you can do to start off on the right food in your career track. LinkedIn is a huge amazing tool and I recommend shelling out some $ for the premium (think you get pretty good discount as a student). When I was looking for jobs recently, I'd literally send InMails to alumni that worked in the companies/fields I want to go into, and the responses were very positive. Shamelessly ask for referrals when it comes time to apply, or at least ask questions about culture so you can ace that part of the interview. We didn't mean to knock those down, it's just that the job market these days really wants to see legit experience and preferably for a steady amount of time (so 1 year carries more weight than 1 summer)"
