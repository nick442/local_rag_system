illegal? no. free speech issue? no. Free Speech is a contract between citizens and the government. Between citizens, if you say something stupid, like 'the earth is flat', or 'vaccines cause autism' or 'build a wall MEGA' I'm allowed to laugh at you and hold my own opinion that you're a dumb ass and you don't know what you're talking about. You don't have to agree with me and I don't have to go to the bar and buy you a beer, and the government can't arrest you. You can't however express your opinion then tell me what my opinion of it should be. It's just like your opinion man. And I'm allowed to make free choices as to how I interact with you as well. We are all playing by the same rules here.
