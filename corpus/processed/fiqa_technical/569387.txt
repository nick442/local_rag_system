What is the best way to learn SQL for use in finance, namely FP&A? I've watched videos on YouTube but most of them focus on syntax. I do know that SQL is used in some type of DBMS like IBM / Oracle / Microsoft Excel. So, when job applications list SQL experience (like for FP&A Analyst positions), what DBMS are they referring to? Oracle? Microsoft Excel? Does it matter? If I learn the syntax, is that enough? I have searched for resources but again, they seem to be focusing on the syntax. https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/wiki/index Can someone who works in FP&A please explain or recommend a MOOC or other sources that will show me how to use SQL just like you do on the job? Thanks.
