Ok. They take a lot of risk with a 29 years old CFO with little experience. Maybe the idea is to save tons on money by paying much less for a kiddo that work non-stop (while some older experienced finance people are watching every step he does)? Anyway, I work in the same company (electronics) for 20 years. Quite high in the corporate ladder (IT). The amount of damage done by clueless young Harvard garduates is astonishing. They are mostly just good with talking very convincingly. I also figured out how manipulate them with their ill-conceived IT projects: I let them fail without giving any warning for how bad are their ideas. Their life-span in my company is 2-3 years. Most got fired, and the company never learned the lesson.
