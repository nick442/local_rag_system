"tl;dr: Anyone who doesn't like what VISA and MasterCard did to wikileaks should not be in favour of this. This is a slippery slope (yes, really), where participating the the marketplace shall only be allowed by people the powers that be likes. What is ""intolerance""? Should James Damore never be allowed to use paypal for any purpose? How about VISA, MasterCard, should he never be allowed to have a credit card again? If the government doesn't ""like"" what you're doing then they have made (or can make) it illegal, and you are taken out of the marketplace of ideas and money, if the government thinks this is best. This is government-sized actions (denying people the possibility to deal with money) done extrajudicially by private entities. ""I have decided that your legal enterprise should not be allowed to make money"" is terrible! If you are in favour of this then you should be in favour of the phone company, the electricity company, and gas company to deny service to anyone who's ever been accused of being a paedophile."
