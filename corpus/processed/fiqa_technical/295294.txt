Those are some big aspirations while still in school and certainly are attainable :) Here's a good [article](http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/proprietary-trading-careers/) that will hopefully outline your expectations of prop trading. Hope this helps! I've been trading currency for going on 4 years and have also been looking into prop trading. I studied finance and econ in college and currently work as a financial advisor for a small firm. I have a series 6 and 63. Currently working on my series 3 to seep my way into the field via a legitimate broker/dealer. If I had plenty of capital, I certainly would rather just be an independent trader.
