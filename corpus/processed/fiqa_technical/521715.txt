"I'd agree with you except for that last part. Not sure we can really HAVE a large scale war again. Certainly nothing between the major powers (not that the human race would be likely to survive anyway). What would be more likely would be a dramatic collapse/end of the global economy via a large scale ""slamming of the gates"" between major nations (i.e. US/China) and subsequent nationalizations/confiscations of foreign assets -- leading to a BIG depression as a lot of paper assets end up becoming worthless and it takes a decade (or more) to sort out who actually (still) owns what, and what the heck it is worth. Meanwhile, of course, all kinds of civil unrest, riots & looting and the inevitable police-state crackdown.. but ultimately then demands for solutions and the election/elevation of some ""strong-man"" types with dictatorial powers who proceed to run a very low-prosperity command economy with rationing of essentials (for the masses anyway.. the elites, as they always do, would retain their privileges)."
