I'm speaking of the investment I'm making in my own skills and work ethic, which would still be extremely valuable even if I was a terrible person who didn't give a shit about anyone else. That said, where I've worked, no one is getting locked in the building at night or threatened (although one of my employers did try to pay me under the table one time). My experience with organized labor in my workplaces has been that the leaders whine about having to do stuff that is actually part of their job and don't actually provide much of a benefit to the workers. I'm not saying this is true for all employers - organized labor is obviously an important check on employers that abuse their employees. But in my experience, having an organized workforce is not a universal positive. Rather, its value depends on the leadership of the union and whether the working conditions are actually abusive to begin with.
