"Oh how I detest ""Good to Great"". Worst management book ever. Incredibly poor analysis method and useless results. They even asked the inverse of the question you actually would want to know. They asked ""Given companies that went from Good to Great, what strategies did they use in common."" That's worthless. It's like analyzing lottery winners and finding out they all used the strategy of buying lottery tickets, and they concluding that you should also buy lottery tickets. The question should be, ""How many companies using Strategy X went from Good to Great compared to using Strategy Y."" Even if GtG found some coherently useful strategies (they didn't), it might be that most Bad to Worse companies also used the same strategies. What you want are strategies that are statistically likely to improve your odds of success, not what the successful are statistically likely to have had."
