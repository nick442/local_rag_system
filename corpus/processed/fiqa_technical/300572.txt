"AI and robotics are going to destroy millions of jobs. That's not necessary a bad thing. The human species should not want to spend eternity in agonizing menial labor over something as make-believe as ""money"". If the cards are played right, eliminating menial jobs will be a good thing. It would mean easier and more luxurious lives for most people. Folks who are currently doing jobs which will be replaced such as commercial truck drivers, can learn new trades and/or be transitioned to different roles in their industry, preferably without starting over from nothing. but it's going to happen, and it would be irresponsible to give menial laborers the impression that their jobs will still exist somehow."
