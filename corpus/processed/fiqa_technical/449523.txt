"Wiki: consumer surplus - ""Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they do pay..The aggregate consumers' surplus is the sum of the consumer's surplus for all individual consumers."" Efficient production provides MORE product at LOWER prices, thus the difference between 'willing to pay' amount and 'actual price' is increased, plus as more product is produced, more people enjoy the benefit, so the aggregate consumer surplus is increased simply by increasing the number of consumers."
