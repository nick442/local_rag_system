"Something kind of like that, but geared more towards professional content providers. For example, if you were going to do everything with an automated plug-in - the plug-in would open up ""premium content"" on sites that support it (e.g. New Yorker, etc.) and would be used by a ring of professional content publishers. I mean, this is something that I haven't fully thought out yet - it's not even close to my industry - but it'd be nice from an end-user perspective to get access to all the premium sites on the internet, not by paying individual subscription fees, but by being 'metered' when I'm on those sites so my billing is an accurate indicator of my interest level in their content. I mean, this opens up all kinds of problems of course - like how it would be easier to just set up an API to rapidly download all the content into an offline browser/format - but we're just brainstorming right now."
