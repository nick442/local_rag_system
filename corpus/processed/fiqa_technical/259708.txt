> Not when 100 people apply for a receptionist job with 20 graduates in the mix. How is a tax credit that encourages business owners to hire the long term unemployeed going to do anything to fix this problem?

It's just going to shift employment opportunities from the employed and short-term unemployed to the long-term unemployed. Where is the value in this proposition?
