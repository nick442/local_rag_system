Teslas use standard maintenance items. The headlamps are standard on the models without LED (do remember that absolutely no vehicle LED lamps are standardized except for retrofit parts), brake parts are common cross-brand designs, the differential gearboxes use a common GM synthetic trans oil, battery coolant is a common ethylene glycol based automotive engine coolant, fuses and wipers are standard, and lots of the little electronic parts (door microswitches, hall effect sensors, plunger switches, solenoids, valving, and actuator motor) are very common and easy to obtain. Steering and suspension parts are available in the aftermarket from high quality vendors. All the coolant lines on the vehicle are standard or easy to reproduce, clamps are universal.
