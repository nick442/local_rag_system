I probably know more about both business and drugs than you'd assume. But there are a lot of jobs where it's not a big deal. I understand that most companies who drug test do so for liability, because their insurance requires it when workplace injuries are reported, and that they have to cover their asses so that the insurance wil pay out. And operating machinery, equipment, etc while high is the same as doing so while drunk or otherwise impaired. But we don't keep employees from drinking on weekends. And current drug test policies don't do much to keep employees from popping pills or doing meth on weekends either, so they're weeding out a lot of pot smokers while still hiring people who use harder drugs. I've worked at one job that was all about mid-week drug tests to screen out marijuana users, but where people were pretty open about abusing prescription pills and other drugs. I've worked in a law office where cocaine and adderall were openly abused, with higher-level associates offering to hook me up if I needed a source for either. And I've worked in sales positions where those same drugs were pretty openly used and talked about. And yes, plenty of corporate cokeheads and pill poppers would look down on pot smokers too, and try to tell you that their drug of choice made them more productive.
