Ha! The Walmart receipt checkers are a joke. Also, you don't have to submit your receipt to them. The theft was the main reason, but the machines broke down constantly and plenty of customers complained about them. Companies don't make decisions based on feelings. At one point, the grocery chain decided it was a better decision to get rid of them and let people take back over than continue with them.
