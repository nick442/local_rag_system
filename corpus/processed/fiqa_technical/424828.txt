That's Apples to Oranges. Amazon isn't the same business model as Sears and infact has been the recipient of the zero sum retail game in this country. Looking at similar companies: Best buy -53% Target -10% Walmart +2.4% Target -10% Costco +84% Sears +119% Amazon +1450% --- hardly directly comparable So we see compared to similar brick and mortar retailers Sears is actually doing quite well over the last 10 years. If they can recover from this envionment they might very well end up surviving.
