This is one of the most repeated claims on reddit, that companies are legally obligated to maximize shareholder profit. But articles like [this say otherwise.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/maximizing-shareholder-value-the-goal-that-changed-corporate-america/2013/08/26/26e9ca8e-ed74-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html) Of course, it does all come back to regulations. Companies may not be forced to maximize profit, but its obviously their goal. They certainly won't always make decisions for the good of society over their profit, and I can't blame them for that. It isn't the responsibility of a business to fix the worlds problems. But it is still their choice.
