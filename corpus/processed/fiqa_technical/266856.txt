Mecha's comment was intended to make readers discount Gate's view on the subject, with a sort of reverse-appeal-to-authority move. It's possible that Gates knows more about economics than many economists. Mecha is, without further information, in the same situation regarding Gate's credentials. Mecha is no trained expert on Gates, so we should discount *his* comment intended to make us discount Gate's comment.
