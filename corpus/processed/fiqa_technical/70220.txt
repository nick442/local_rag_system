This article was garbage. I don't disagree with the overall premise that kids from elite colleges may not be better candidates for a job, but the article's delivery and proof was shit. My argument would be that not all kids are equally mature in high school to the point where they can accumulate the resume necessary to get into a Harvard or Yale. But in general, if you hire from Harvard or Yale, you know your getting someone of likely high intelligence and good work ethic. The difficulty of getting into Harvard, excludes most deadbeats. The deadbeats who do get in, have connections that would be beneficial to your company. So, yeah, all else equal, I'm hiring the Harvard kid over the UMass kid. But I wouldn't exclude a UMass kid because they went to UMass.
