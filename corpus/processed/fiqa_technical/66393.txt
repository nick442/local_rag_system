Anarchy is an absence (or nonrecognition) of all governing authority .. I certainly don't (and didn't) confuse that with capitalism. But capitalism is control of trade and industry by private entities rather than by government - attempting to guide the economy at large to a specific outcome through government regulation is at odds with capitalism. However, we obviously have never had a purely capitalist system, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
