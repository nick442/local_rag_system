I think that is very consistent with how any hiring/purchasing decision gets made -- there are a lot absolute nos.. a fair number of absolute yeses.. and the rest is left more to chance than the winners would care to admit. Getting bumped for something seemingly arbitrary is not remotely uncommon, nor is winning b/c of something arbitrary.
