"I switched back to contracting because I felt that while companies were perfectly willing to accept the fruits of me working 50 hour weeks, there didn't seem to be anything but more demands on the other end. At least this way I get paid for every hour I work. except.. Boss recently told me I'd have to cut my hours to 40/week so they didn't run out of hours on the contract. That's cool - it means I work 7-3 and I still feel like I have a day ahead of me at home. After two days of this we're meeting at 2pm and he lays out a shitload of stuff he wants done then says ""we'll get back together about 5 to see how it's going."" I said ""This isn't getting done today"" and he seemed all shocked. Oh, I get it - you didn't want me to stop *working* 50 hours a week. You just want me to stop *billing* 50 hours a week. Let me think about that. No."
