"Such economical system is the corporatism (well, a fascist poorly designed version). It is basically a system between free-market and communism, but in practice it is usually located on the far right, beyond conservative capitalism. - In corporatism, the state is seen like ""an organic body"" and the different social classes of citizens and state organizations, as the organs of such body. It is an planned economy but not egalitarian nor distributional (unlike socialism and communism), also inspired by Marxism. - In theory this system should serve to create an equitable and just society, such as socialism and communism, but also libertarian. And yet it has never been used as originally intended. This variant that has been applied is called ""fascist corporatism"". In theory there are many more models that could work, and some aren't authoritarian, but none has been applied. - As a curiosity, the book ""beyond the brave new world"" shows an authoritarian corporatist system taken to the extreme."
