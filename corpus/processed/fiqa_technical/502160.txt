"Massaging statistical data is an art form. Probably the most common tactic to manipulate without manipulating is to not measure something that is not immediately connected to the stat, but is absolutely influencing it. Then there is scope manipulation (we see this with the wage gap stats) where data will be purposely aggregated at a level outside of the scope. My pet peeve with national stats is when people will compare data collected in the US where we regulate thoroughly to data collected in a country like China where they live by the mantra ""if you are not cheating then you are not trying"". Education stats for instance that always make us look bad when we absolutely know the Chinese are padding like crazy."
