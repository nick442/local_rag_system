I think your understanding is correct as far as you describe, but you don't mention a critical detail to me. You also imply some penalty details for early withdrawal / cancellation but you don't state those terms in detail. Where and when is the interest paid? Does it go into the same CD for compounding? Does it get paid to another account? The description does say that it is priced at par, so we at least know that the interest doesn't have to be stuck unpaid within the CD until maturity, but it also means you don't necessarily get compounding at the CD rate. Without knowing where the interest goes, and if it's available for compounding, be careful in how you compare it to other CDs / savings accounts. A compoundable structure might be a better option, even at a lower APY.
