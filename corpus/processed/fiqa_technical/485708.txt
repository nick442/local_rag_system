Amazon pays their entry-level workers $5.00 more an hour than minimum wage. We're comparing that to child-labor sweat shops? News flash, if unskilled entry level workers can afford the median home it means people who have been working for years are making the same as entry level workers. Does that sound like a world you want to live in? Everyone gets the same priced home, and you have no hope of ever getting anything better.
