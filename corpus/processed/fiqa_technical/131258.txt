Perhaps they shouldn't stray from their core competencies (as they've clearly done)? Plus, consider their competition--bad software interface isn't one of the problems their competition has. Microsoft really stands out as a loser as a direct result of these continual blunders. Seriously, if they'd put a touch-based Windows 7 option in their Surface products, I'd consider a purchase right now for the RT (or whatever has the Wacom sketching capacity built into it). That would work great for what I do, particularly when traveling.
