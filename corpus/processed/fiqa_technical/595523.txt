> That junky site constantly has completely outrageous headlines upvoted to the top over an over again, only to read the article and find out they have sensationalized and essentially re-written content from other sites. That's internet journalism for you. There are gobs of sites like this - alternet, theyoungturks, washingtonsblog, counterpunch, prison planet, the whole gawker network, and so so many more. But tossing them would be tossing based on crappy content, rather than spamming. Just downvote them & move on. Really a shame though, when great sites like theatlantic get banned for engaging in shady promotion.
