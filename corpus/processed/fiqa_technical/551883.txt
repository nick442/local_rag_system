> stop partying so much Seems to point at the root of the problem. Like drugs, it's a temporary high and hard to sustain. If you're self-medicating to cope with stress on the job or other parts of your life, work at fixing those root problems. If the things you did for pleasure (including working and downtime) didn't cost you money, then you'd be set. The hard part is how to structure your work and life situation to both minimize stress and make you look forward to it.
