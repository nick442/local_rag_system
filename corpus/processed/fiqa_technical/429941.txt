I don't understand what your contention with Katsuyama is exactly. Are you saying that Lewis' Flash Boys was a work of fiction? Electronic trading is more efficient, cheaper, democratic, etc than paper orders, for sure. But many HFT firms have built billion dollar enterprises by scalping ordinary investors, fractions of pennies at a time, without adding anything of value. The former truth does not invalidate the latter one.
