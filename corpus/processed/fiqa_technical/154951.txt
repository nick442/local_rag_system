I totally see your point about not seeing into the future, infrastructure has to take into account so many variables it's often very difficult to plan these things I can see why a major project might take months on end, if not years. I'm okay with (private or public) companies doing the bare minimum and saving a few dollars here and there. That being said obviously all companies should should fall under the same rules or laws, if companies can take huge short cuts that end up harming people there is something really wrong with the regulations and the company is clearly at fault. I think you have the right idea, I don't see why the government couldn't force private companies to abide by infrastructure plans similar to the ones public companies use or come up with ? do public companies take longer because there is more oversight?
