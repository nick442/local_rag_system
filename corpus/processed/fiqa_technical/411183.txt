Yes, almost everything was custom, and was mostly\* well built. It would almost\*\* work fine as a hydraulic press for industrial applications. \* There are things like the really impressive tapered roller baring on the wrong side. Probably because the engineering firm wanted to show them off. \*\* Things like not being able to unlock the door when the power is cut is **NOT OK**. As in, major injuries and massive laswuit not ok. We're talking, it doesn't matter if the company is bankrupt, this is bad enough to go after the designers personally not ok.
