> Personally, I've avoided those sellers on Amazon because I know I don't get the same level of service I expect from Amazon Previously you as a consumer had that choice. You could pick the vendor a better return policy, or you take a gamble on the vendor with a potentially cheaper price or better shipping. With the new policy your choices are reduced. As marketplace businesses most likely will have to increase prices to compensate for return losses, there will be less competitive price pressure on Amazon. It can only serve to incrementally increase prices across the board.
