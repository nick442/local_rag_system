i always found his advice to give to charity because it had a karma effect on your wealth to be hilarious. i was struck by the kiyosaki bug too when i saw his presentation on pbs. i discovered his board game where there were apparently people paying 300 dollars for it. pbs has some retarded shit. there was also another guy with a personal finance presentation. he acted like an infomercial all the way til the end where he revealed the secret was life insurance. personal finance on pbs is the equivalent of the history channel's aliens.
