Having been in the situation of commuting and working long hours at a low wage to just scrape by, I faced the following dilemma: I used all my income to pay bills and taxes and could not afford to go back to college to get another degree (or pay for distance learning). Even if I could afford to pay for classes, I couldn't figure out when I'd have the time to study because I was often only home 9 hours a day and needed to eat and sleep, shower and get ready for work. A wealthy friend of mine liked to read books about people who overcame great obstacles and she was sure I could figure out lot a way to improve my situation if I'd just try harder. One day I handed her a piece of paper showing my income after taxes and monthly bills and asked her to get back to me with a plan that would allow me to afford classes and give me say, an average of 6 hours of study time per week. She was happy to do it. Here was her longed for opportunity to show me it was possible to pull myself up by my bootstraps. After she studied my income, expenses and schedule, she decided she couldn't devise a plan that would work and she never again told me I wasn't trying hard enough.
