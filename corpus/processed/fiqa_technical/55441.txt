The average joe wouldn't.. we would bury our cash in a mayonaise jar before we would take a guaranteed loss.. (although the argument could be made that a positive return that doesnt outpace inflation IS a negative return).. big corporations with billions on hand dont have that luxury however.. some investments may also guarantee investors that a certain percentage be allocated to bonds.. and in times of deflation a negative return could still provide a net positive return..
