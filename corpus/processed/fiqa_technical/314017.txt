It's a scam because MLM schemes are the closest thing you find to a Ponzi scheme you will fine that is still legal. Selling the stuff is never the way to make money. You make the real money by getting others to join because you get a signing bonus and a percentage of their sales, and a percentage of the sales the people they sign up. So you only make money by getting as many people trying to sell the thing you are trying to sell which makes it impossible to sell because there are now lots of people trying to see the thing you are selling. So yes, there are risks to all business but MLM is like playing Russian roulette with 6 bullets in the gun and hoping it jams realising that a revolver almost never jams. But that is just my ill-informed opinion.
