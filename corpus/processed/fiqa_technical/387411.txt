Thanks /u/LupusSuperius . Great information. Do you have any terms or articles(perhaps on investopedia or similar)you can recommend I search for how much debt is ideal to take on for a start up? I'd like to learn more instead of getting you to do my homework if that makes sense. My simulation is similar to Capsim. We've made two strategic decisions: 1. We went capital intensive in the first year to build up factory capacity. Year 1 we have very little R&D, but year 2 we plan to increase R&D budget. Since it is a capital intensive year, should that capital expenditure be funded by debt entirely and I leave equity alone? I noticed this drives down my WACC, but I see a decrease in NPV because of increased interest payments. Also does it make sense to increase the debt to pay for R&D as well? The way I see it paying for the manufacturing plant on debt isn't bad because you get an asset out of it at the end, but paying for a R&D program seems foolish because in this simulation there's a chance your R&D program fails and does not provide results, so we would see no return on the debt in that case. Thanks again.
