"> Why aren't all government programs required to be self sufficient starting with military? How would the military be self-sufficient? They'd literally have to *invade and plunder other nations* on a regular basis. For some things, it just doesn't make sense to expect that. That's why we have ""government services"" in the first place, they are services that we need to be a successful society as a whole, but by their nature cannot be self-sufficient."
