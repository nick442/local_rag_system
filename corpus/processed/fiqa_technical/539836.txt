Single payer health care, aka socialized, has been shown to be superior. If you haven't noticed we already do the free market thing. That is why insurers have been booting people with pre existing conditions and hospitals and pharma companies hugely jacking up the rates. Epi pens are up over 700% from a few years ago. Martin Shrekli bought rights to a life saving drug and jacked the prices astronomically. The free market works great for consumer products and services, but when it comes to services that are meant to benefit society, the free market does a horrendous job. Health care in other counties' goal is to provide adequate health care for the lowest cost. Here it is trying to charge people as much as they can get away with and marginalizing those that can't afford. And funny enough you are paying more for health care in your taxes than in any other country in ADDITION to your private insurance for lower quality care so the pharma execs can increase their share prices.
