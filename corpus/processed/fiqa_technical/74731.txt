NAVIENT is ripping off borrowers by making it difficult to increase your monthly Autopay amount to be above the minimum that they set. NAVIENT gets more interest this way. We have had several student loans with our kids and the other lenders make it easy to increase the amount. SALLIE MAE was terrible and NAVIENT replaced them. They are the same - they will get away with whatever they can to get more money out of borrowers. Student loans were not supposed to be a huge money maker for institutions like them.
