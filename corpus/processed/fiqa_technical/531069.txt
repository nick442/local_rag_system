"> Favoring one position because it is more pleasant or resonates more emotionally despite the logical alternative is the very definition of naivety. And what position would that be? I have stated my position repeatedly: these companies are doomed, millions of people will lose their jobs, and it will suck for them. This is not a pleasant position; nor does it resonate with me; the one point I am making that seems to make you all so angry is that _I feel compassion for the people who are going to suffer._ So tell me where I'm wrong, why I'm ""naïve"". Should Sears continue to exist as a shitty company? I don't think you believe that. Are these people who lose their jobs going to get better jobs? Some of them, absolutely - but most of them have few marketable skills - I think you probably believe, like I do, that _most_ of them are obsolete workers and are going to have a lot of trouble even finding a job as good as the shitty one they are about to lose. Or am I just ""naïve"" because I feel sad for all these people who are going to go through a tough time? I call that ""compassion"" and I'm proud to be a compassionate individual, even if it makes me sad."
