Honestly, there's one studio that's releasing a blockbuster with any kind of cadence (Ubi) and they do it by feeding the gaping maw of production with the fresh bodies it craves. On top of that, because games take so much time to play consumers are much much less tolerant of stale ideas. The pressure to innovate is tremendous. Delivering, say, the video game equivalent of TMNT will not yield profits.
