I walked by the one their building in the Domain in Austin this weekend. I asked, “What the hell is an Amazon bookstore? We’ve really come full circle, haven’t we?” I assumed it was just a branding exercise. Love me some Amazon. But I still don’t understand why they would sell books in an upscale shopping mall and expect to make actual money doing so.
