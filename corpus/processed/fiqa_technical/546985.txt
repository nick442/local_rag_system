"Although Social Security & Medicare have been known to be some of the most efficient government-run programs, their future is dismal. With increase in life expectancy and rising unemployment (and extensions on unemployment insurance), something has to give. Because of the severe recession, Medicare is now paying out more than it receives. Some of the programs I think the federal government spends too much money on include: agricultural subsidies,""nudge""-style 'tax expenditures/selective tax breaks; and land-based Cold War military systems."
