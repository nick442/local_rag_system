What standards do you set for performance? My wife has three students with parents in jail, and one that started the year not speaking English. Due to budget cuts, less extreme special Ed. Students are joining regular classrooms. My wife has one student who can't add single digits in 2nd grade due to learning disabilities. Im not saying seniority based is right, because god knows there are bad apples everywhere, but you start to skirt teaching to the test. Again (NCLB).
