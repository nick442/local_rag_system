"I live in Canada and have a BMO mastercard. I called them and asked them and their answer was ""of course!"". I have put thousands of dollars on my mastercard from my bank account to pay for rare, large purchases. The money I put on appears differently on my online mastercard account though. EX: account balance: $6,000.00 CR available credit: $3,000.00 This confused me at first, but when I called and asked them, they said my available credit doesn't change (ie: how much BMO lends me), but when I add my available credit + what I've put on my card (my account balance, which is CR (meaning my balance has a surplus of money)), then my spending limit is $9,000.00 So, I don't increase my ""credit"" limit, but I do increase my spending limit. It just comes down to terminology. I assume it is like this for other credit cards, but I would recommend calling and asking, just to be on the safe side. Heath"
