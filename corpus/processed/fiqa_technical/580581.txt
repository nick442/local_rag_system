Thanks for the reply! I am considering all lines of work as the priority is the location, then the job. But if the work I can get is relevant and expands my network, that carries a lot of value. The plan is to stay where I am for the next 2-3 years to gain the required work experience to become a charterholder and developing my skills/project portfolio to become a better candidate. I would still be young enough to move to Australia/UK on a working vacation/youth mobility and I want to be set up to have a good chance by then.
