The only way I could see you fighting this is by saying that portion of the contract is unenforceable. Contracts are only allowed to cover reasonable things. You can't demand someones first born child (illegal) and can't demand they fly to the moon magically (improbability). So the gambit here would be saying that its impossible for people to control what their guests do after staying somewhere. Counter would be: you shold make your guests sign contracts. Another argument could be that since the hotel never mentioned any time limits, its overbearing to essentially say 'you can never say anything bad about us *for the rest of time*'.
