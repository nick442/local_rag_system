Crony capitalism isn't capitalism. It is basically a case where the government turns a blind eye to wealthy individuals breaking the law, or is even complicit in giving away taxpayer money in the form of no-bid contracts. This is much more prevalent in China's state-sponsored capitalism. Their system is textbook crony capitalism. We still have it but to a lesser degree. Don't blame capitalism for the government's failure. Crony capitalism absolutely requires a complicit strong central government in order to flourish. And there is a difference between the suburbs around Las Vegas and Chinese ghost cities. The Las Vegas suburbs were at least built with buyers in mind, even though this turned out to be a mistake. It was a mistake on the part of a few individuals. Absolutely a mis-allocation of capital, and I didn't mean to imply that capitalism is perfectly efficient in allocating capital. But the Chinese ghost cities are a centrally planned project made for the intention of moving rural Chinese people into them in future 5-year plans. Whether that turns out to be a good investment has yet to be seen, but it seems like it will involve moving lots of people against their will. But does it not make more sense to gradually build up a city according to what is currently needed, as capitalism tries to do, rather than spend lots of money building an entire city, much of which may never be needed? There are so many imbalances brewing under the surface in China, it seems like only a matter of time before they all come to a head.
