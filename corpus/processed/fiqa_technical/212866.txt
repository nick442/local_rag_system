From the IMF paper: > This ability to generate and live with zero steady state inﬂation is an important result, because it answers the somewhat confused claim of opponents of an exclusive government monopoly on money issuance, namely that such a monetary system would be highly inﬂationary. There is nothing in our theoretical framework to support this claim. And as discussed in Section II, there is very little in the monetary history of ancient societies and Western nations to support it either. I suppose the extensive literature on the relationship between central bank independence and inflation is to be ignored then?
