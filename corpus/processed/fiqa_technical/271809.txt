Right. When you have an influx of people willing to work for lower wages, it depresses wages. Scandinavia has the political will and the geographic location such that there is not a large influx of labor from poor countries coming in to work at higher wages than they are used to but lower wages than the locals are used to. Having an ethnically homogenous population makes it politically easy to have tight immigration and border controls. Being in Northern Europe makes it easy to not have a ton of migrant workers from third world countries right next door. This isn't rocket science.
