"Must I rehash the obvious reasons why a community organizer lacks the business sense to see us through the mess? ..and must I really detail why it is the corrupt career politicians in and out of congress that are to blame for this mess? Obama's persistent electioneering since 2008, and the pandering to special interests to the tune of trillions is a good place for starters ..or perhaps the 7 figure price tag per job that he owns.. I dunno, I lost count of Recovery Summers (is this IV or V? ) and ""shovel-ready"" *jobs* obviously meant something else to him.. Yet, I suppose the dozen or so private firms that Obama haphazardly threw millions of tax payer dollars into that only ended up failing could also play a role ..but proceed to blame bush, and stack up the excuses. I'm waiting. Sure, Romney may have been a shrewd business man, but at least someone made money and had something more tangible than ""hope."""
