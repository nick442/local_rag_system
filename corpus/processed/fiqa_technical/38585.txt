This is something better asking a licensed professional (EA/CPA licensed in the US) who's also familiar with your home country tax law and the tax treaty your home country has with the US. Assuming no tax treaty and adverse tax consequences at home, you can have this scenario: The last step is critical - unless there's a tax treaty, not every country allows foreign tax credit (tax treaties usually have a provision to avoid double taxation), and you may end up paying both the US tax and local tax on the same money. If there's a tax treaty - step #4 is most likely guaranteed. Step #4 may not work in some places that would not consider the penalty as tax. Again - check it with an accountant proficient with the local law. Step #3 depends on your country. Some countries ignore foreign deferred compensation rules and consider the 401k amounts income to you when it was deposited (the US treats foreign tax deferred accounts this way, I believe that is also the case in India). So you should check locally. In this case you have probably paid taxes (or were exempt) on this amount when you earned it and will not pay taxes again. But then you might also not be able to claim the 10% back as credit. Leaving it is an option, although with such an amount is hardly worth it. You'll have to check how your country deals with foreign accounts of its citizens (the US, for example, puts an enormous reporting and tax burden on these, some countries forbid them altogether). This also applies to step #1.
