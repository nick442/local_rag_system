"The economy refers to the macro view of economics and associated policy. Macro economic policy's target objective should be full employment. With regard to wages, full employment leads to an increase in the ""frictional"" subset of unemployment. This type of unemployment is essentially unemployment by choice because of the confidence that jobs are available. When employees become scarce, wages rise. Arbitrarily raising the minimum wage does nothing but increase inflation."
