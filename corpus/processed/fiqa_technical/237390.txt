"When C did their 10-1 reverse split in 2011 all the fractional shares were aggregated and then sold with the proceeded going back to the fractional shareholders. From their press release: ""No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, Citiâ€™s transfer agent will aggregate all fractional shares that otherwise would have been issued as a result of the reverse stock split and those shares will be sold into the market. Shareholders who would otherwise hold a fractional share of Citigroup common stock will receive a cash payment from the net proceeds of that sale in lieu of such fractional share. "" While there was selling, it didn't cause a ""sell off"" so to speak. I have also come across instances where the company buys the fractional shares and retires them."
