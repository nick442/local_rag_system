The biggest problem is that the rate of return for a completely immunized program is really low. Especially, now, given the low rate of return, the cost of such a program makes it nearly unfeasible, unless you assumed a ridiculously low rate of return (<1% return). As it is, they're assuming a 4.5% rate of return, which is about 2% above inflation, a very very conservative forecast. Plus, not every pension plan could immunize their plans. All that does is shift interest rate risk (btw, not the only type of risk that exists, there's credit risk as well. To get rid of both, you'd be getting marginally above 0% return, not something you can run a pension plan on). So, you'd have to have someone or some set of people that have a very large and very unnatural interest rate risk. If you had a large move in rates, it would demolish those people, which would completely invalidate those hedges. It's much better for the economy on whole that pension plans are able to take credit and interest rate risk.
