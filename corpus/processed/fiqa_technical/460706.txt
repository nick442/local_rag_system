Swimming clubs exist. Treat it as a start up business and it's easier to figure out. Once you know about what people are willing to pay to join you know about how much you can spend. Our family business invites tenants to use a private pool located at one of our properties. We maintain the facility and have appropriate signs posted and a balloon insurance policy specifically for the pool. In 1975 the pool cost 25,000 to install and we spend about $5000-$6000 to operate and heat it each season. The downside is that there is likely a lot less support for the idea than you think. You're going to have to limit access to it with a membership and that's going to be a pain to figure out because it will almost certainly require an employee or a very expensive electronic access control. You can't really open it up to the entire community without some sort of contract or no one has an incentive to pay. Every time a home sells in the community you either lose a customer or gain a headache if you don't have some sort of deed restriction or membership fee.
