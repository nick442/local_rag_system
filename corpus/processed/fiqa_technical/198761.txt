Are they run by Amazon directly or intermediaries? If it's an intermediary, they can be very cut throat because it's *their* profits on the line (which are super slim as per contract negotiations - they offered the lowest possible bid and actually won the contract). I know that's how manufacturer rebates are processed - by an intermediary. The processing company is different from the retailer offering the rebate. *That* contract has already been worked out and if the employees don't operate at near 100% efficiency, it cuts into their profit so they're very hard nosed.
