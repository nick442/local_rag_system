Most of the bankruptcy is due to taking [or building over a period of time] a loan that one cannot service, if the interest rates rise, then the amount of money to repay the loan increases, when one doesnt pay the revised amount and keeps paying less, the over all debt keeps shooting through the roof .. a lower interest rate means that one can continue to pay the same amount .. and few missed payments do not cause as much as damage as it does when the rates are high.
