Having lived in both places, I have to say you can find a higher income in the US for the same job and can live in a small town versus having to live in a big city in Canada to find decent salaries. For similar sized cities, the cost of housing is significantly lower in the US than Canada. That is your biggest factor in cost of living. If you are thinking of NYC or San Francisco, there are no comparable size cities in Canada and you would probably be better off in Canada. My tax preparer was amazed at how much I paid in Capital Gains taxes when I left Canada. Maybe it is different now but I doubt it. The biggest free lunch in the US is a generous capital gains exemption when you sell your primary residence without any lifetime cap or cap on the number of times you can do it. There are rules on how long you have to live in it before selling. For investment real estate, all expenses are deductible in addition to fictional depreciation so with a mortgage you can have positive cash flow and pay no income tax. You can keep doing tax deferred exchanges into bigger and bigger rentals. When you are close to retirement, you can exchange into your ultimate beach home, rent it out a few years, then convert to a primary residence.
