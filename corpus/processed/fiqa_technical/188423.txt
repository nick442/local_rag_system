As a customer I absolutely hate aggressive marketing . If a shop aggressively markets to me I avoid it - this is why I avoid [Shell](http://www.shell.com/) and [WHSmith](http://whsmith.com/) . It is also why I prefer to shop at [Morrisons](http://www.morrisons.co.uk/) rather than at [Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/) ( although I will use the machines there ) . And it is also why , as a corpoprate and as a personal buyer , after 15 years , I will no longer be buying Toshiba - their laptops now come infested with spyware and adware . I also pulled out of LinkedIn when they started spamming me repeatedly despite me saying no marketing emails . I also avoid getting my car serviced in the UK because of all the agressive marketing . I don't put my details on marketing lists - I keep very tight control of address details including email addresses and I use source based email addresses so I can easily cut out any offending party . Re, Ford - why does he \ they no longer sell just black cars ?! The companies that do their marketing well succeed very well . From what I have read [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) is one of these . We have a massive situation at the moment where many of the large corporations are having huge problems with getting sufficient sales - they are going the way of the dinosaurs . Part of this is that their customer base has been so impoverished that they can't afford to buy their products . But a large part of it is that they no longer supply the products , the price and the service that the customers are looking for . So customers look elsewhere and they get elsewhere - they find the products they want at a good price and with good service on the Internet and these are usually supplied by small and medium sized companies that are much more nimble . It's a case of bottom up progressive evolution winning over top down mass extinction events . There are a number of products that I have difficulty locating . One such range is men's clothes . The main stores don't stock what I am looking for . I can find what I am looking for in the odd small store in some parts of the world some of the time and I can find what I am looking for on the Internet - if the vendor's web site would work . Does this mean that I walk around dressed like a 15yr old ? No ! - it means that I hold off purchases - things that I would normally purchase every 2 years now get purchased every 6 years .
