"It isn't an edge janitor. As a whole, BART employees vastly better compensated than private industry. http://blog.vctr.me/bart/ It's noble that you desire a ""fair wage"" for every worker but that's not how this works. The role of the business is to earn profit and return money to the shareholder. There is no corporate doctrine advocating that compensation must be equal or somehow divided. The janitor doesn't need $100k/year -- he needs affordable housing. But efforts like that are stymied by public unions sucking up undue compensation that would have been better invested in a public-private trust for affordable housing construction. Even Zuckerberg, arguably the biggest liberal in town doesn't implement your ""fair wage"" system -- why? Because he runs a private corporation and has to answer to share holders. Watch a companies profits plunge and hard decisions be made -- if it's a bonus for your in-demand finance or engineers or a $100k salary for the janitor I think you know what will take precedence. Companies make these decisions every day. Back to the root issue. My argument is that public transportation by rail can be a real money loser, even in a dense urban setting like SF Bay. The only way to fix BART is to starve the beast but bay area voters see the system through rose-tinted glasses and fail to do. Counties should privatize the system, disband the public union and cut labor costs by 50% so that taxpayer subsides aren't required to maintain a system that takes in $6B over 10 a ten year timespan."
