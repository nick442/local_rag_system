Automated trains are all over the place. CBTC is the standard signalling system for any new installs and most metros are converting to it when their old equipment ages out. That's the main component required for unattended train operation. Some agencies keep a driver in the train anyway for failures and other problems (most interruptions in North America are customer medical issues) and pausing service on a busy metro line can cost millions per hour.
