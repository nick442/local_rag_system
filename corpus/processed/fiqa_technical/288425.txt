Nope, sorry. ChemChina-Syngenta are not US companies and they couldn't care less about US when it comes to long term strategy. Chem china is also in about to merge with sino chem. This will be by far the largest diversified company in the world. followed by BASF. Dow Dupont, will shrink, since they have the weakest global reach, compared to Asian and european counterpart. Bayer-Monsanso? They see the writing on the wall. Either they look for partners quickly or become irrelevant. There is no option. Either become bigger/more efficient or perish.
