"You have to remember that there is no such actual thing as ""deregulation"". Even if regulations are light, the government is still legislating one way or another. There are already regulations that cause wealth to flow from workers and consumers towards shareholders. It's just a question of which way legislation allows wealth to flow. There is no empirical data to indicate that if the healthcare industry were ""deregulated"" that costs would fall. Lack of regulation is what leads to $2,000 epipens that cost $25 to make. If it were deregulated, prices would rise because free market forces do not reign supreme: corporate greed does. If you can charge a higher price you will. But malpractice will definitely rise as well. Take Kansas for example. Massive deregulation, leading to huge job losses, failing sectors left and right, and great big gaping budget holes with no free market rushing to fill the void. On the other hand take the NHS. Much lower cost per person than the US, and each person pays a much lower percentage of their income than people in the US, in return for quality healthcare. There is always regulation. It's just a question of who the regulation benefits to the detriment of whom."
