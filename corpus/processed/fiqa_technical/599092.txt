Glad I could help! I really got a lot from the theory, although full disclosure I didn't read the whole book, we just studied it in class. I'm a supervisor at a paintball park while I'm at school, and the thing I always admired most was how they made everyone feel like they had self worth. You could be the seasonal employee, making minimum wage, and you still knew you were valued by everyone, as long as you did your job. Everyone played their own role, while some were more important, the whole thing falls apart if its missing a small piece. Your question about IT is just like this. Even though the IT guys might be technically small potatoes next to the big time salesman, he still needs functioning computers or else he can't do business.
