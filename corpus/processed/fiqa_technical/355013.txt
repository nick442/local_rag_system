Anything from being a plumber to being a nurse, or dental assistant to an electrician or most any other contractor. We own a couple dental offices and everyone we know has a difficult time finding dental assistants (job typically requires 6 months of training and 1 year of work) Hell I had a $6k-$10k job for an electrician (about 3 full days worth of work) couldnt get a single one to call me back because they were busier with bigger jobs. Luckily I can get a plumber to come in because he's already a client of mine but there are lots of plumbers here that won't go to new homes because they have enough existing clients.
