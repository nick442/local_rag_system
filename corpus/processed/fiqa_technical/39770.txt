1) Don't get an MBA yet. You should spend ~3-5 years in the industry first. 2) If you think you need Excel classes, you probably need Excel classes. Depending on what type of path you want to take, either learn financial modeling/forecasting or data analysis. Or both. There are a ton of free resources online to get yourself started. [Like this.](http://macabacus.com/) 3) If you need to, start in an ops/support role to build your network. These roles don't require a ton of industry experience, allow you to build your skill set, and (most importantly) allow you to network with people in the industry. I started off in a Market Risk support role at a major bank and now I'm working in front office finance. Just go above and beyond people's expectations, learn as much as possible, and keep an end game goal in mind.
