"The short answer is that the IRS knows this is an issue, so they are prepared to deal with the ""discrepancies."" The filer does not need to something special to call it to their attention. Keep good records and consistently report according to your accounting processes. Exactly how the IRS resolves / flags this, I don't know. Maybe someone else can answer, but you can imagine that if they track you for multiple years they should have some idea of how many dollars are rolling over and whether you might have ""forgotten"" to report something from a few years ago that happened at a year-end break."
