"Profit sharing adds complexity. I'd pitch it as a percentage of revenue to him. ""Profit"" is a term than can be abused. Sales are sales. Somewhat related, if you're giving him 30% of all profit on all deals, you're basically selling 30% of your business for $80K. No surprise he's interested. Think more about how you'll finance working capital. You need money to buy the pool supplies, pay for labor, etc. Ideally, you should float as little of this money as you can. An incentive structure that rewards the salespeople should also be taken into consideration. Build that in somewhere. You want his reps to want to pitch your pools. They need some kind of incentive. These are just thoughts off the top of my head. I don't completely understand the details, but maybe it'll help."
