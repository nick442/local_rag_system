"> Your anecdote is worthless; the data I provided tells the exact opposite story. You did not provide data. You provided a statistic. And that statistic doesn't tell me much about the distribution. All I can say, is that 50% of the people working in finance make less than 53K in their first five years, and making less than 100K after working more than 10 years. I don't know the quantiles, I don't know the min and max. It could be that fully half of the universe makes 30K, and the other half makes 53K. And this illustrates my point. Fully half of the universe is making mediocre money, and no one talks about them. All anyone ever speaks of is CEO's and fund managers printing fucking billz. > Rampant ignorance of a topic you don't undertand. Really? Do I not understand it? What do I not understand? > You still have not provided an alternative field of study, just ""finance = bad."" Literally anything else. Programming is better, statistics is better, engineering is better. Fuck - go learn a trade. Even ignoring the outsized pay they are receiving, you can typically work for yourself, and you actually create shit. AND you dont have to spend 100K (SEC numbers) on a fucking degree."
