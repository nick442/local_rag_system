">You don't want FDA to review generic applications? I don't want there to be ""applications,"" period. People and their doctors are the best judge of what substances should be consumed for health reasons. >How would you stop fly by night companies from selling low quality harmful drugs? I wouldn't. And yet, the best examples of ""harmful drugs"" out there, such as heroin, cocaine, etc have all gotten significantly more pure over time without government intervention. Consumers for some magic reason are demanding and receiving better quality drugs! How is that happening? Let me reverse the question for you - why do you want to artificially limit supply of drugs to people, driving up prices? What good does that serve?"
