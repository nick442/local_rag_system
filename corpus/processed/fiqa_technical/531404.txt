"Meh. I'm a government apologist. Bend but don't break. The U.S. handles its emergencies quickly and its problems slowly. A lot of ""problems"" could be solved with an authoritarian government. We dont have that. We let people decide. A lot of them. We seek out and are often subjected to input. It takes a while. But our emergencies, they're already taken care of. If the debt was an emergency, a truly real here and now problem, it'd be solved."
