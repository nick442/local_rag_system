"Yes, I did. I won't deny it. But, as I said in my original post - ""I don't know much about this subject [finances]"". Well, that's why I came here to ask a question. I don't know what ""trusted"" sources are in this field - it's not as if there are real scientific journals in this field as in biology (my profession). So.. is this a problem in your view?"
