>FTFY: Repeat after me: Monopolization can only occur when there is a corrupt government to limit the emergence of competitors. No government exists that is not corrupt, as power attracts corruption. The sooner you realize you can't obtain a non-corrupt government the better off you'll be. >How about we stop voting for the limited government idiots and start electing people who have the best interests of the American people at heart. I would suggest the people who wish to limit the government do, in fact, have the best interests of the American people at heart.
