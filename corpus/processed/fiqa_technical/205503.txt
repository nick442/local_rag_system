"So your goal is to sell out? If I'm understanding correctly. I say that without connotation. Since you want stock and the ability to be bought. Your partner sounds like he wants reinvest back into the company and make it grow. If you want ""profit"", I'd say find a different partner. Again you personally can be profitable while still maintaining the company with a nonprofit status. Gotta pay employees."
