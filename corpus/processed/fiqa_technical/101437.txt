Death of anyone can bring their close one’s in big distress and they found themselves unable to come up with this trauma of their life. When this death is of a spouse, the severity of trauma affects the life of the living one in such a huge extent that he/she begs for the death and keeps no desire of living. The inspirational books “BECAUSE THE SKY IS EVERYWHERE” and “BOTH SIDES NOW: A TRUE STORY OF LOVE, LOSS AND BOLD LIVING ” written by Nancy sharp can work as great motivation for such people whose have no desire of living now.
