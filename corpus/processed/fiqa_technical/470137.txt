> Whatever the supply of labor and demand for labor set. That's essentially a circular answer. The price of labour affects both the supply and demand. If the demand for a certain type of labour increases, the price will increase, and that causes the supply to rise, lowering the price back down. For any given job, the price of labour will tend towards the marginal value.
