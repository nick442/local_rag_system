"I know something about this issue, so maybe I can put it into context from my world. One problem is that dairy farmers - like any small/mid-sized business - can only afford to pay so much in wages (especially factoring in the fact that the cost per employee is higher b/c employment taxes, maybe insurance, etc.). As a commodity, milk and feed (to make the milk) prices are set and any fluctuation is passed to the farmer, so it isn't like the costs of paying a higher wage can be passed directly on to the consumer. Also, the kind of work involved is not what most Americans are willing to do. There are 4 trailer parks within 5-15 minutes of the dairy farm here - and very seldom - if ever - has an American come asking for a job - when they did, they got a chance - at $12/hour and housing if needed. They never last long: drug/alcohol use, warrants, bad attitudes, absenteeism, mistreatment of the animals. Local workers simply are not dependable to show up on time, for every scheduled shift, and do a good job. Hispanic workers are paid the same wages. It isn't like 10-15 years ago when some jerk farmer thought he could cut his labor cost by paying half-wages to ""illegals"". Hispanics here have social networks, and know the value of their work. If they're not happy, underpaid, whatever - they will leave - and will instigate all the other Hispanics into leaving as well. Dairy farming is a hard, dangerous, smelly job that puts you out in the heat of summer, cold of winter, pouring rain, day and night, 24/7. If you paid a wage that compensates for that, there would be no dairy industry and if there were, its products would not be affordable. So the Hispanic workers get an ok wage to do a job that no American is willing to touch. And robots? They don't work that great either: expensive, constantly needing service - and the rats eat the power cables!"
