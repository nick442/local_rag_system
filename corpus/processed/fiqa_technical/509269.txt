"Honestly it's hard to take anything you say seriously just based on the prejudice of it all. Experience is experience. You don't need to be a corporate suite to have valuable business experience and share that information. You also don't need to talk like you have a bored shoved up your ass to present a good argument. Sometimes entertainment value adds to the overall message. Honestly, I could careless what WSJ published. I know it's a ""respected business publication"". Times have changed thanks to the internet. More and more developers are going to realize that they are being used as a tool to make their employers rich."
