I think class is a little more than just how much money you make. You could make $1,000,000 a year but if you are still wretched, have a corrupt morality, and possess no sense of culture, then you are still lower class. Yet, you could be making $40,000 but if your mind is elevated, your self control strong, and possess a good degree of culture, I would consider you upper class. Its not just money bro!
