Ultrasound machines have enhanced extremely in terms of ultrasound imaging resolution, digital capabilities and ease of use. We can now clearly visualize small structures that we were unable to visualize ten years ago. The reason behind is that computers and ultrasound machines have followed a similar trend in terms of decreasing in size at the same time as increasing in power.
