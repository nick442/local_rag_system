I got my passport by mail. There was a procedure and well written rules to follow. It was completed in the time expected and the cost was known. I also have dead friend who died just before Obamacare because he found that the insurance he had paid for as a small business owner didn't actually cover cancer treatment. So he went without. I have two dead brothers who might very well be alive had they had their problems post-obamacare. My favorite professor had a kid who needed a transplant. The procedure was delayed for more than a year while the insurance company hoped he would die before they had to pay out for the transplant. In single payer countries, immunizations for children are as simple and cheap as having a quick eye exam or school picture. In our system every parent must make an appointment weeks in advance, take their kid out of school, drive to an office, wait an hour or so, get the shot and deliver the kid back to school. Repeat that by 25 to 30 for every single classroom across the country. Then the parent waits weeks and either the shot was covered or a bill arrives for as much as a couple hundred per shot. This is inefficient to the point or absurdity, but it keeps that profit margin high for stockholders. I'll take the government agency over a for-profit entity beholding to shareholders over me ANY day. We pay something like 3000 times more money that someone in France. We have no one at our back or standing with us. I want my government in the game and not looking on passively as though the health of the people mean nothing at all.
