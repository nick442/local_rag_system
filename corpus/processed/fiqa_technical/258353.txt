"Completely false. I recognize the impact that energy has on everyday life across the globe. Your reasoning is fundamentally flawed because you think oil or ""oil lust"" is the reason. The desire for cheaper energy is the driving factor, it just so happens that oil is the cheapest. If the roles were reversed and solar was more profitable, there would be the exact same counter movement in support of oil. You don't understand the rules of the game and that's why you're willing to throw billions of other people's dollars at the problem to change the rules to fit your desires. And you can prove me wrong right now for calling you an uniformed ideologue by just saying, ""it's about being as efficient as possible to produce the most energy for people to live their lives. No one person or industry should have an advantage over someone else; therefore all energy subsidies should be eliminated in the interest of progress."" But you won't."
