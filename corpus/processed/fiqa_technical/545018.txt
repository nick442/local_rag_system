With about 10 minutes in front of google you could probably answer everything you just asked. I'm not directly trying to defend her, in so much as making a point to say that most of the comments I've read here indicate a severe lack of awareness of what the fuck your talking about. and a desire to posture about it, and making an ass out of your selves in the process. Ignoring the QUALITY of writing, its a blog post, expressing an opinion on something. The value of anyone's opinion should be weighed in regards to what they've done as a person or professional up to that moment in time. Again, in 10 minutes, Google could tell you everything you need to know to give you a better opinion then you've written above. Take the time people, before you make your self look like idiots.
