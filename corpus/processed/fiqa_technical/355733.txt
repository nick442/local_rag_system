Prime preys on people's sunk costs fallacy. I would never buy it either. Either way, in the last 6 or 7 shipments I got from Amazon I've had problems with 4 of them. Problems like shoddy packaging and items arriving damaged, products not working as described, or breaking on first use or just items that are perpetually out of stock.
