">Quality control. The second generation is not consistent >Control on patent license to prevent theft. Kind of sidesteps the ""no one replants seeds in agriculture"", doesn't it? And isn't the fact that the second generation's quality is not consistent the farmer's problem? Why need to enforce it contractually? And what do you mean by patent theft? Is it theft if the farmer re-uses the seed to replant another harvest? >I take it that you get your information from activist blogs, because if you actually read that case you would know that Schmeiser was guilt of patent theft. The fact that you cite this case marks you as deeply uniformed about the ag industry No, mate, no activist blogs. Go re-read my comment. I do give it away that the farmer is not squeaky clean as he tried to use the the seeds to advance his own developments. Which is patent theft. But it doesn't take away the fact that he had a bunch of GMO canola that he didn't purposefully plant on his property. If he would have used those seeds to use in his developments unwittingly of them being Monsanto seeds, there should have been no claim of patent theft as he was just using what happened on his land. That's a big if, but the point stands. And you keep on claiming I am uninformed despite the fact that I've refuted your first chiding that no farmer replants seeds. Doesn't really make for a shining example that you actually know what you are talking about. >Like I said, if your knowledge of the TPP is a high quality as your knowledge of agriculture.. I've read what I've read, and from a few sources. As I said, so far it's hearsay, but if you're so enlightened, please do let me know your sources."
