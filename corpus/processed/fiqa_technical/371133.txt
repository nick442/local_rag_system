"The title is misleading (shocker, right?). The exact wording in the cited study is ""in order to afford a modest two-bedroom rental home at the Fair Market Rent without spending more than 30% income on rent"". HUD says: > The Fair Market Rent is HUDâ€™s best estimate of what a household seeking a modest rental home in a short amount of time can expect to pay for rent and utilities in the current market. So that's not the minimum available 2BR unit available. It's more like 50th percentile rent per zip code. Check rent.com for 2BR prices in Tennessee and Arkansas. They start in the lower $500s. Also worth noting that if you work 40hr/week all year at minimum wage and claim 1 dependent then you don't owe a dime of Federal income tax."
