"Wow! Look at that job description: > ■ Job: Sleeping > ■ Location: Akihabara (3 min walk from station) > ■ Qualifications: High school age to 30s > ■ Compensation: 3,500 yen/hour > ■ Hours: Weekdays 15:00-22:00, Weekend/holidays 12:00-22:00 At today's exchange rate, that's $44.48 / hour to sleep. Sounds like my dream job. Of course, you also have to be a pretty girl to qualify. I'll just have to wait until they open up a ""sleep with a fat old guy"" boutique shop. Then I'm moving to Japan."
