Ok, let's start your company and call it Parkoor. We hire drivers rejected by Uber because they will work for cheap. We skip background and drug checks to save money and because it's best to not ask questions you don't want answers to. A passenger hires our driver via the app, opts to pay by cash, and then tells the driver they're paying by credit, stiffing them. Who pays? Reverse situation, passenger pays by credit in the app, driver demands cash and threatens violence if they get stiffed again. Who pays? Passenger is killed because the driver was drunk. A background check would have revealed 6 DWI charges. Passengers family now wants to sue. Was Parkoor responsible? Passenger was killed because the brakes failed on our drivers 1985 Camry that hadn't been properly inspected in decades due to a loophole in state law. Is Parkoor responsible?
