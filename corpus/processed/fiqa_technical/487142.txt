There was a market in medieval life but there were so many restrictions on it plus there were a lot of elements that undermined the market. For one thing you were not free to pursue any line of work. The Surfs were tied to the land and bound to surrender their work to the lords. In the cities the guilds controlled who could work doing what. So there was no free market for labor. The Guilds also controlled prices so I wouldn't call it a free market in any sense.
