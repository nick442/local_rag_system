Better suited to /r/personalfinance, but your first step should be to find a new job. Don't wait to get canned in 60 days, do it now. Other than that, don't spend any money you don't need to. You're in a good spot because not everyone has the luxury of knowing 60 days in advance that their position will be eliminated.
