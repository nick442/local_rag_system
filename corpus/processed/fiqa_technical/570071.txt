"As advised you need to budget, but there are a few simple things you can do to make it easier. Work out how much your fixed bills are every month, for example, council tax, gas and electric, mortgage and rent etc. On pay-day, move an amount of cash equal to this into another bank account when you get paid. It's easier if this other account, let's call it a bills account, can pay the bills automatically via direct debits, you can then forget about it. Now your budget should tell you how much you spend on things that are more variable, food, fuel, travel etc. Again on pay-day, move an amount of cash aside to cover this (plus a small buffer amount) into another account. Whatever is now left in your main account is yours to spend or save as you see fit. You just need to make sure you are sticking to your budget and it's as easy as that. If you cannot pay direct debits from the other accounts you just need to move the money over to cover them when they need paying. Most banks will let you set up extra accounts so you can mvoe the money easily using internet banking or by a monthly standing order. If they won't let you have several ""current"" accounts you can use savings accounts but will need to manually move the money around as the bills are due. If you get all your direct debits to debit on pay-day, that makes it even easier. If you are struggling for money then prioritise paying off debt first and prioritise the debt with the highest interest rate."
