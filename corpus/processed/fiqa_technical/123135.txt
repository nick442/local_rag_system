Don't worry about it, it looks like many articles written by non-native speakers. Practice makes perfect and it looks like you are heading in the correct direction. Most of the mistakes are little things like missing articles. One thing I noticed is that you could work on is articles. For instance the first sentence should be The Russian Government. Good luck!
