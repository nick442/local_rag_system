Blame Bernanke, blame 98% of congress- but don't leave out the democrats as your article does, blame the president, blame the schools, blame others & blame yourself. All of this could be averted if people spent one day a year not watching TV but discussing topics with people. We should not be scared to place blame, but only if it is well thought out and rational.
