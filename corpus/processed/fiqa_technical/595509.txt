"Trust me, so am I. We really had *feared* the scenario you painted -- everyone in the HOA has been very pleased that it didn't happen that way. My point isn't that you are wrong (I think in some markets what you are talking about undoubtedly IS happening) -- rather that it isn't necessarily happening that way everywhere. Indeed, some of the people who have bought in our area were people who seem to have a more ""frugal"", solid, long-term mindset, and who had rented throughout the bubble years, often despairing of ever being able to afford a home (but being unwilling to pay the high prices/go deep into debt w/o any equity at all, so they simply endured it and saved {and saved}, hoping to someday.. and their patience has been rewarded, some have been able to use what they thought would merely be a modest ""down payment"" to nearly buy the houses outright, taking on minimal debt and then using that to refurbish the homes)."
