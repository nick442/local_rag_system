> you're also signaling the value of tangible things like storage, weather, and transportation costs as well as intangibles such as future macroeconomic events, global policy decisions, etc. To whom? I, as a buyer of the future, only get to know this from normal news, as can other people. Or is the assumption that I have a special source that not all people have access to, and hence when I buy the contract, other people think that I have some special information that they don't, and use this fact to then derive the prices of whatever? Apologies if what I say makes no sense. I am a noob to finance. Please also provide some links for Price Discovery if you feel my understanding is wrong.
