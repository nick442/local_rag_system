Or you know, going from 28k to 50k because I got my degree was 100% worth the 66k of debt I took out to fund myself. Spending 100k overall to get my wife and me through school bumped our pay by 40k a year. In honesty, even a lot of risk-averse people look at school and think it's a great plan because, by and large, in-demand degrees pay for themselves quickly when the economy isn't in a recession. edit: to further clarify, a lot of our debt was used for daycare and paying our mortgage and bills while we did school. The tuition itself was almost entirely paid for through grants and scholarships. It wasn't like playing the lottery, it was a methodical and logical approach to handling our finances that led us both to agree that quitting work for a couple years was worthwhile, and we had the credit and FICO score to pull it off.
