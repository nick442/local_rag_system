I'm not comparing the OWS with the tea party.. How were the protests at UC Davis violent and deserving of pepperspray? >The right to peacefully assemble does not mean you can encircle and block the police from doing their lawful job Correct. So you feel the proper response is to pepperspray people? Isn't there a better way to move people out of the way? My point was that in the past workers fighting for some workplace safety and better wages had pinkertons kill them because they protested. People fought very, very hard and some died to get where we are currently and with the police and the people okay with pepperspraying I am worried about the bloodbath that might occur when we have to fight again for workplace safety. >currently politicians are rolling back those protections >No, they're not. They are.. OSHA is being targeted for budget cuts. If there are no OSHA agents checking that workplaces are safe, then workplaces can and will offer less protections to their workers.. Let me ask you a question, what prevents a race to the bottom with wages and benefits if people don't collectively bargain?
