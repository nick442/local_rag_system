Hey Congrats! A word of wisdom, don't just go blowing that money anywhere. Use what you need for the essentials, and save the rest for the big college you transfer too. This will help you not need to take out loans and keep you fiscally responsible. Congrats again, you should be very proud of how hard you have worked.
