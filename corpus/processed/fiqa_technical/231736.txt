Questions: When you say feds inject money into the system, what do you mean? What system? the commercial banks? Or Government so they can pay govt salaries? And can commercial banks such as chase, bofa create money out of thin air regardless of FED(and i dont mean by frac reserve either)?? Meaning giving out credit cards, or lending money they don't have. Coz it seems banks don't need to have savings in the bank to lend/create debt money. M2 increase regardless to M1 or Mbase money proves that. there needs to be a federal govt nationalized franchise of utilty banks to compete with commercial banks. let com banks speculate, and average conservative savers go bank with the nationalized utility banks.
