I appreciate your help and thank you for your response but it was worded so poorly, I have no clue what your message was in the end. It got completely lost. I’m not trying to be rude or anything, I just have no idea what you were trying to say and am now utterly confused. It was just really hard to read when it lacks correct grammar and punctuation, sorry. It sucks though - I’m actually interested in what you have to say.
