They are not great points at all. What does this guy think happens to the money spent on stock buybacks? It just disappears? People reinvest that money- sometimes in the stocks of other companies that *do* have good R&D projects that they need to fund, sometimes in startups, sometimes in yachts, and sometimes in government bonds. It's stupid to just expect companies to force R&D spending if they cant find projects to actually work on. It's not better for the economy for a company to just go and waste a billion dollars on a ridiculous project that has no hope of actually being meaningful in the marketplace just so that this guy can feel good about R&D spending as % of GDP.
