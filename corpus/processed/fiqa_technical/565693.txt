">Show me a real case where as soon as the hive is destroyed and the bee dies immediately, or drop this silly example. It is hardly ""silly"". What IS silly is your contention of the opposite that somehow humans are ""bees"" needing a ""hive"". >We all die eventually and your comments about the elderly are alarming. Yes, but the life expectancy of someone who is already 95 is measured in days, weeks, and months, not years or decades. And the comment about the contribution to society is simply FACT, whether you like it or not; there is nothing ""alarming"" about it (unless you are some *socialistic/stateist* who believes that resources should be allocated by some central authority for the benefit of the larger population in the aggregate -- IOW, it's only alarming because of YOUR mindset, not mine). >Yeah, it's common to see a two year old in the wilderness, living off the land. So when did ""several years"" suddenly become ""a two year old"". Really, your pissant ""strawman"" arguments are getting tiring. Bye Bye."
