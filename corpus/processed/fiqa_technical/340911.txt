"Yes there is - not for all apps, I guess - apple's weather app settings are always or never. Most others seem to have ""while using"" or ""never"" as options (no ""always""). I'm glad I checked this.. Apple is a tricky little bastard: I have most apps set to ""never,"" including ""compass."" But in a separate ""system services"" folder, there is ""compass calibration"" (along with others, like motion calibration and distance) set to always (with a symbol that it's been used in the past 24 hrs). Worth double checking the settings in system services :)"
