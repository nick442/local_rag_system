No. It's not mandatory you buy from them. If they have money and are rich companies is because they provide a good service and deliver value to people then get rewarded by customers with they money. It's different than the monopoly that government is. You aren't able to get from anyone else. You are just a slave from the system. So government creates monopoly. Now if some company decide to be a better search engine or anything else that Google does better than them then that company will get rewarded over Google. So, it's not a monopoly.
