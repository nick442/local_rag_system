"Yeah I knew you would bring that up. But what about the guy who is getting called a racist but really does have black friends? What do you say to that guy? That's like the old saying, ""If you bust on gays you must be gay."" Super retarded logic, but expected. I am getting a full picture now, keep it coming. Look, muslims all follow this Koran book, it's their fucking bible, which has over a 100 verses about fucking up non-believers. I don't think anything more has to be said than that if you are a logical thinker. Now if none of the muslims were acting up, maybe you could say ""hey, it's just a book, they don't follow it to the T"" but tons of them are going around quoting the book, praising the peadophile who's the head of the whole thing, and stabbing, hacking and running over innocent people. Seriously man, what part of that don't you get?"
