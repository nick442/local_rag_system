I just filled out a survey for my cable company. I made it clear to them that their prices are a little higher, and their website sucks, but the fact that they have a call center based in the US and the call center is so well run is the only reason I stay with them. The wait time is never more than a minute, and the people answering the phone are always pleasant and helpful. I'm one of the lucky few Americans who has the luxury of more than one cable company in the area meaning the threat is not hollow.
