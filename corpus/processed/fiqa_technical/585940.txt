That's my point, a 20k bonus at big 4 for non partners is really common. You can easily get 40-50k if you're highly rated. Also, I'm not saying the max for partners is 600k, that's the average. This is much higher than the average Accenture partner-equivalent. The data is out there, just look at glassdoor. It's perfectly ok to not be big4, you can still make a good living at Accenture. But, realistically, the compensation and other benefits are lower. My theory is because public firms pay less than private firms, what's yours?
