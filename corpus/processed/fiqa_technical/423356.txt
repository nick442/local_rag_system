"I once had to train a guy who worked 2.5 hours away. They had me drive each way everyday, paying both mileage and my hourly rate for the drive. So everyday was 5 hours drive time, 3 hours of work, plus mileage. I asked for permission to get a hotel room, which would break even with my gas reimbursement and let me work with the guy 35 hours a week instead of 15. They said no, my boss had discretion on driving, but had to get hotels approved. I was also told I had to work 5x8hrs days, not 4x10hrs, which would have saved a day of mileage and meals and given 5 extra hours a week with him. There was also a minimum number of training hours that had to be done, so the lesser hours per week meant I did this for months instead of weeks if I had a hotel room. I even got yelled at one day by the location manager because I called out due to weather. ""It's against policy to let people call out due to weather unless the location closed due to it."" I had to explain that the ice and snow would drop my driving speed too much and I would spend half the day driving there, the other half driving back and spend no time working."
