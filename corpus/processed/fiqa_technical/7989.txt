(I'm a bot) ***** > His crucial, yet utterly simple, idea was that any competitive game has a notion of equilibrium: a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can win more by unilaterally switching to a different strategy. > How do players get to equilibrium in the first place? In contrast with, say, a ball rolling downhill and coming to rest in a valley, there is no obvious force guiding game players toward a Nash equilibrium. > The new result says that economists can&#039;t assume that game players will get to a Nash equilibrium, unless they can justify what is special about the particular game in question. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6oz36i/sounds_like_ouroboros_pos_is_right_on_the_money/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~173468 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **play**^#1 **equilibrium**^#2 **game**^#3 **Nash**^#4 **each**^#5"
