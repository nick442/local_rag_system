I second this. You should be able to keep them in place. As far as I know, you can leave the HSA funds with the existing administrator indefinitely, unlike a 401k. I'm not certain of that rule, but I think that is accurate. It is possible the current administrator may include a maintenance fee or something, so watch it. I left my employer 4 months ago and have kept my HSA with the same administrator. I don't recall hearing anything in the exit paperwork about a requirement to move, I haven't received anything in the mail telling me to move it, nor have any fees or other charges been implemented that would cause me to move.
