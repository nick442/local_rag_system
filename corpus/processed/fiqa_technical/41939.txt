Yeah, now I feel bad for my snarky response. I could have been more constructive and helpful. It's tough trying to figure all this out, especially if its all new. I appreciate your willingness to edit your post and your attitude. I'd say if you're looking for more personal and detailed responses, there are great Day-in-the-Life articles and interviews/forums that will be more helpful than this Finance reddit. Keep up the good work and good luck.
