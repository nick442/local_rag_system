I like this idea. The limiting factor of renewables and EV's is mainly in storage capabilities. It's easy to make a Tesla go 400 miles on a single charge but the weight requirement isn't. We need smaller size, longer life, and greater storage. And today's environment provides a profit incentive to pursue these goals.
