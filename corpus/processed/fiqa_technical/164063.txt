Actually when someone hates something that bad, it's only a matter of time before they're fired anyway. I have hated something this bad before. A good internship working in environmental crimes. I didn't last because of a couple things. People were too conservative (was not expecting that!), and it was god-awful boring, quiet, and lonely. I had to be switched into something that didn't make me wish for a brain annuerism(?) It's not entirely up to OP; if the people around him know how much he hates his job, then if this were a real job, he'd be fired anyway.
