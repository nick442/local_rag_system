Simply put, the government has no balls to fight corruption. Ideally, the government would have enough people to oversee and make sure corruption like this doesn't happen. But the politicians cut a lot of money out for this type of enforcement (primarily because they had money donated to them by these same businesses). This looks great for the politician as it looks like they're cutting government fat, let's say something like a hundred million dollars. These opportunists fleece these companies and when they go under, they plead and beg the government to bail them out or else they'll have to fire all these people and it'll kill the economy. So the government steps in and bails out these companies for a few billion - now they look like they are being proactive and 'saving' the economy. All at the expense of you of course. It's too bad politicians don't do what they believe is best but do what their donors believe is best for themselves.
