"Great, it's the old ""no true capitalist"" argument. It's hilarious how you keep seeing this, yet when you see the exact opposite version of the same argument, namely that all communist countries have been authoritarian nightmares and that this does not necessarily reflect the true ideology of communism, then suddenly you're a commie bastard. If we agree that there are no state bailouts in ""pure"" capitalism, then please never again in your life disregard this argument when you hear it from a socialist."
