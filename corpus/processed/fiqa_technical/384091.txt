"This is a brilliant move on Amazon's part in my opinion. They have the economy of scale to increase margins. In addition, it increases their urban ""brick & mortar"" footprint. They were already planning to enter the grocery landscape via Amazon Fresh and this gives them an immediate and scalable footprint with the opportunity to transform the way consumers buy groceries. It will be interesting to see if the likes of Walmart, Kroger, Sprouts, and other traditional, large format grocers are able to adapt and continue to compete. Also excited to see how Amazon will decide to improve upon the existing Whole Foods format. This is a huge disruption in the grocery landscape and the ripple effects will be significant."
