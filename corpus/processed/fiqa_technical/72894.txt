Oh of course you can fill it up in 5 seconds if that's what you mean by filling it up. I personally spend 0 seconds filling my gas car up because the gas station is on my way home from work, and I live in a state where someone else pumps my gas. So I just drive in, play on my phone, and leave. So yep, definitely less than 5 seconds.
