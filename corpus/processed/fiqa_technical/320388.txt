McDonalds burgers may be sub-standard, but you get what you pay for. They are extremely cheap, and you also pay for the service of speed. You order a burger and it will be out in less than 2 minutes. If McDonalds burgers were really that shit in terms of quality+service compared to price, then how to they sell so much? Say what you want about it's quality and service but in the end I think the demand speaks for itself.
