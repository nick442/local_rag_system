Sorry yes it's a state school. It's not online only. They offer online courses for their business degrees. I agree about a finance degree and honestly I'm more interested in that field, but the job prospects in my area aren't very good. On indeed jobs requiring finance degrees anywhere near me are a few dozen. Jobs with accounting degrees are in the hundreds. I'm 31. Married. Have a 1 year old and my wife is extremely close with her family and probably wouldn't want to move. I'm looking for financial security in a job I don't hate. My dilemma is that all of my experience is sales with a financial background. I'm concerned I'll never be able to get out of that field without a bachelor's, but I'm not sure I can justify the expense. Thank you for all your help by the way.
