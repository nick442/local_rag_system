"The bank is asking for a P & L because as a contractor you are in essence running your own business. Its kind of a technicality, all you need to do is look at any expenses that you paid out of pocket while working there that were job or ""business"" related. Write a list of those expenses such as ""Gas"", ""Materials"", ""Legal Expenses"", etc. and then show your total income from that job or ""contract"" subtract the expenses and show your total profit or loss hence Profit / Loss Statement. I realize that you may not have any real expenses tied to that job although I don't know and if you don't, then simply write in your income, say no expenses and show your ""profit/pay"" at the bottom of your P & L! Viola! Your Done! Good luck with the closing!"
