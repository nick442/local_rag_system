No, it's always accelerating. Each cycle of technological revolution occurs faster than the last. The internet revolution was the fastest yet, it happened in just a few years, *and things are way better*. The time when the revolutions happen so fast that people can't keep up is called the Singularity, but I still don't think it'll be a problem.
