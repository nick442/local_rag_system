I will never tip an Uber driver unless it's something seriously extraordinary. I've used it for a while and still do and the prices are the same. I've talked to many, many drivers and they all talk about the money they make and the hours they work. No thanks, there's no way I'm going to start doing that all the sudden and I'm not going to feel guilty for not either. This was a big part of why I liked Uber in the first place.
