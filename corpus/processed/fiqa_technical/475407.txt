Add to this that every argument is incredibly generalized with almost no proof or support. I could think of 10 companies that this article could apply to off the top of my head, one being Apple. That said there are as many companies that fall under these same traits that have remained successful. Maybe it's just really hip to trash talk Microsoft and Forbes is looking to cash in.
