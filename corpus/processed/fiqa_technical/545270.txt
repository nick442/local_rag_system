To me it sounds more ridiculous that the same process can't be applied to other suppliers. The system we have can be used for all inbound invoices regardless the supplier or the inbound channel (email, EDI, paper invoice). Not all our suppliers can send electric invoices messages but even the paper invoices that go through OCR can be automated, as PO-number and invoice header info can be automatically read to our system.
