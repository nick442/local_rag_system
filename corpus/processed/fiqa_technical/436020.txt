"TD e-series index funds are great for regular contributions every paycheck since there is no trading commission. The personal finance blog ""Canadian Couch Potato"" has great examples of what they call ""model portfolios"" and one consists of entirely TD e-series index funds. Check it out: http://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios-2/ The e-series portfolio that is described in the Model Portfolios (linked above) made returns of just over 10%. This is very similar to the ETF Model Portolio. One thing to remember is that these funds have a 30 day no sell time frame, otherwise a 2% fee is applied to the funds you withdraw."
