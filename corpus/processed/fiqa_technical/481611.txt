You don't specify where you live, so I'll explain the case if you lived in Canada. Other countries may have similar laws against criminal usury. In Canada, this would be a criminal offence. Canada Criminal Code 347 (1) means you are guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to a fine of up to $25,000 or to imprisonment for a term of up to six months, or both. Note that you don't have to actually collect on such a contract. The contract itself specifies an interest rate well in excess of 60%, so the contract itself would mean you have committed a criminal act.
