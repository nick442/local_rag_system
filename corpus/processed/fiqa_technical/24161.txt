SeaWorld had plans to expand the whale habitats. Huge frickin habitats for the whales. However, they no longer can afford to do it due to declining income. As far as other animals, Busch Gardens Tampa has 65 acres of animal habitat in the Serengeti plain alone. The apes have huge enclosures modeled after their natural habitats as well. The parks can't exactly replicate their native environments but they do their best in ways that are safe for the animals, handlers and visitors to the park.
