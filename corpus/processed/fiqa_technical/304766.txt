It had to have been a con from day one - did anyone really think AC needed another casino? Every state up and down the seaboard has or is allowing and building casinos. Gamblers are a finite resource and simply building a new casino does not generate new gamblers. For decades the eastern states envied the gambling tax revenue AC generated for the state and wanted in on the deal. Now, shocking I know, now that gambling can be done just about everywhere, everyone is seeing their revenue drop.
