I worked for a company who managed money for Braeburn. They are managed more like a foundation than a hedge fund. They invested in a fixed income separate account. Yes, they definitely try to avoid taxes as the entity was domiciled in a Ireland and their offices were in Reno. The goal of Braeburn is to maintain that huge amount of cash on the balance. avoiding taxes is an efficient way to do that.
