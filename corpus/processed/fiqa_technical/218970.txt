So Netflix loses either way under your great plan. You can't watch Netflix with Comcast's shit quality so you cancel, you can now watch it but Netflix is paying for access and you say they should cancel out of principle. Comcast doesn't care. They compete against Netflix and are losing to them in subscribers. Comcast also has virtual monopoly powers in many market areas. I'm not seeing how complaining to Comcast solves anything.
