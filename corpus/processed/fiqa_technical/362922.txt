>eventually, the US will lose money until the point where production in the US is cheap enough to bring it back. Not if they raise taxes. I recently saw a mention of a research job in psychology that came to a conclusion more or less like this: given the choice of getting $100,000 while their neighbor got $250,000 and the alternative of each getting $50,000, most Americans chose the second option. They'd rather get less for themselves rather than let their neighbor get more than they did. That's why so many Americans favor higher taxes on the corporations. It doesn't matter if the corporations become unable to invest in more jobs, the important thing is not to let the corporations make money easily.
