"While a lot of buzzwords are abused, many of them are also very useful. ""Synergy"" is one that buzzword haters love to pile onto, but it's a powerful concept - that if a car manufacturer and a tire manufacturer decided to work together, the efforts of each would reinforce the other's. I'm sought for my writing, and my style is virtually never criticized. I use these words, though sparingly and in the proper context. The idea of ""buzzword bingo"" is funny to indict the speaker as someone who uses so many empty buzzwords that you could use them to play bingo, but it doesn't invalidate the words themselves."
