It's possible, but I doubt it. You have to consider federal income tax, state income tax, state sales tax, local sales tax, property tax, FICA, utility taxes, telecom taxes, and all the little government fees as well to figure the total tax burden. It's really hard to calculate, but I doubt the total is below the peak for the middle class.
