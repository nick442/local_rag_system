>marginal 2% extra in taxes This is gibberish. You aren't even using the term 'marginal' in the correct context. That aside, 2% extra tax solves what exactly? 2% extra of which tax? Be honest, you pulled that number from absolutely nowhere. Am I wrong? Let's see that source that shows '2% extra' of some unknown tax is going to solve an unstated problem. All without toooooootally screwing over the teachers pensions, mom and pops and the rest of the lenders that expect you to pay back the money they lent to you. You are doing nothing more than trying to justify theft of someone's money because you don't want to pay them back. Your debt is someone else's problem, right?
