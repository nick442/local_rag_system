I should have said 'insane inflation related to rising costs versus wages'. It used to be that wage inflation outpaced product inflation. It's been in reverse for some time, which only exacerbates the problem as it continues. I'm aware in the manner our economy works some matching or reversal should be expected, but we've been in a downward spiral for the better part of 30 years.
