is that the touch one with the qwerty pad? I have a thing for blackberries..I recently bought a motorola that broke instantly after a bike ride and motorola refuses to abide by the warranty, they actually went so far to void it completely for my model. So, back in the market for another bb..i just wish they'd get their act together and throw together something sleek and with tons of support.
