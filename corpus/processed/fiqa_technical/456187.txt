"What Ben fails to see is that when people say ""healthcare is a right"" what we mean is that ""healthcare should be an affordable right"". Those who want it would gladly pay for it if it was reasonable, affordable and easily accessible. Sadly, it is not because pharmacies, doctors and medical institutions gladly drive up prices for profit. Healthcare is not affordable. The system is broken. Healthcare should be an affordable right for anyone as it is the basic premise in which we can work, contribute to society and drive the economy. Without our health we are useless. Ben is smart and I enjoy hearing his talks from time to time, but the guy lacks serious empathy and bed side manner in certain topics. This clearly being one of them."
