"In the United States, yes it will generally cover suicide. However there is usually a ""suicide clause"": Usually, this clause states that no death benefit will be paid if the insured commits suicide within two years of taking out a policy. Whenever an insured person replaces an existing life insurance policy with a new one, the time clock for the suicide clause is set back to zero and starts over again. It also depends on the policy, state, etc."
