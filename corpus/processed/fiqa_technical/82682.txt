"Actually the labeling still leaves a lot of room for imagination. I know this due to researching food labeling concerning allergies. There's a huge number of things that can go under natural seasonings, for example. At the end of the day you don't actually know what it is. EU is a lot more particular about their labeling and they avoid wording that is deceptive to the consumers. Let's not pretend that ""made with 100% chicken"" wasn't created to dupe people. We shouldn't have to stand there and debate semantics when buying food."
