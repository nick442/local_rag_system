"Vegetarian here.. That's my camp exactly. I despise the taste of meat. I don't buy ""veggie burgers"" or anything similar for that reason. This product does not interest me at all. I'm glad it exists though. Lots of people truly love meat but also care about sustainability. This is a win for them."
