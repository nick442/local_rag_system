"mcnultysbluecavalier, I just made this account and broke my lurking reddit virginity to give you these upvotes. I'm also an undergrad and in a similar position as Wegener. I graduated this April and have been trying hard to break the industry. However, I've been slowly slipping into given up these past month, but not admitting it: Procrastination, Frustration, and loosing confidence. After reading your comments, it really woke me up. Seriously. ""find that fucking dog"" for some reason hit a chord and I now I cant wait to wake up tomorrow and give it all I got. So just want to say thanks bro and here's an upvote. PS.
