Coca-Cola execs just trying to do something. What they need to do is nothing. There are coke machines within 2 minutes from everyone, almost every store sells one. It's a world-wide smash hit. All they have to do is, make it and it sells itself. But they gotta change something.. asshats. Same with New Coke, and all the other failed ventures. Just hide the recipe and sell sell sell.
