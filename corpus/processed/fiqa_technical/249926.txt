> Shitty? No doubt I doubt it - in fact, I think it's quite reasonable. Exceptions and loopholes aren't in the tax code *by accident*, they were put there deliberately so certain people wouldn't have to pay their taxes. 'Dodging' taxes legally is following the rules. Period. Have you ever given part of your paycheck back to your employer because you feel like you didn't work hard enough to earn it, or that you'd rather contribute to the company succeeding? **Fuck no**. We're buying israel weapons to bomb hospitals and daycares, flooding the military with weapons and tanks they don't need, *then* giving those to our cops so they can run us over and shoot us with them. Then there's the PA Turnpike Commission here (don't even get me started). We're paying the NSA to listen to and watch everything we do, and pumping all that info back to israel and others. And I'm supposed to somehow *voluntarily* pay more for these things? Pfff. The only thing *shitty* here is the tax code to begin with - the winners are the slimy politicians, the ultra rich and conglomerate corps; the losers are small businesses and the middle class - both of whom don't have the cash base to pay for legal services to reap such tax benefits. Ya know, the same people all the politicians circlejerk about protecting and helping to thrive - hanging them out to dry. Taxes too high is a minor problem - not enough people paying them is a bigger one, but wasting them is worse than either of the two combined.
