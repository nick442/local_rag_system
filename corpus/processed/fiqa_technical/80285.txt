Profits go to the owners of the corporation for providing capitol. CAT is paying around 2% .. a little under $2/year/share in dividends. (note that dividends come out of profits, not before.) A 2% return on investment isn't a terrible thing. It's not great, but in current economic conditions, it's respectable. Looking at their financial statements, they don't have tons of cash on the books relative to what they spend in a quarter. They do have a fair chunk of their assets tied up in inventory. On the books, that goes down as a profit - kinda. It's mostly neutral accounting wise - money went out, inventory came in. You now have an asset worth exactly what you spent on it. The biggest growth in assets over the last couple of years has been in inventory. The amount in inventory is greater than assets minus liabilities. Then again, so is cash on hand, but the cash flow rate is also pretty high because the margins are low. So.. yeah.. they're making more money, but they're also investing most of that back into the capital costs of growing the business. New machinery, inventory that they can sell, business development in new markets, etc. Remember that capital costs are considered neutral - you receive an asset in return. This is distinct from operating costs which come straight to the bottom line.
