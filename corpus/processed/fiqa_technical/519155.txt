"Do so. It's a bit insulting that you need to pay the very entity that fucked you to **start** protecting you, but that's a reality of life. And to add insult to injury, the very info stolen is the *same* info needed to reset your freeze PIN.. *But*, at least they'll send you physical mail letting you know ""you"" changed your PIN. Do it. If not for the fact that these worthless bastards are allowed to charge us in the *first* place, a credit freeze should be the **default** situation. It won't hurt your credit, and *might* prevent someone from opening an account in your name without you knowing about it. / And if I didn't make it obvious, invest in ""torches and pitchforks""."
