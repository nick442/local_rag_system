Winning an election and then going head to head with the most entrenched state legislator in American history without building support for your 'turnaround agenda' is stupid. Declaring in an open forum in 2013 that the ideal political strategy would be to put pressure on the most vulnerable populations in Illinois in order to drive a political wedge between your opposition and their constituents is cruel AND stupid. Stating publicly that the most recent budget proposal contains 90% of what you want and then proceeding to veto it because of the final 10% is stupid and counter to the goals of our political system. He trots around the capitol wearing his Carhartt jacket and talkin' in a folksy way and it's a joke. He is personally responsible for Rahm Emmanuel's personal fortune, and both of them should go far far away.
