How so? Just because you can't test for something means it should be thrown out of consideration? Now I don't think that cheating the Antibiotic-free classification is rampant but I would consider the possibility in my purchases. I'm more likely to buy from a vendor that is known to work closely with its suppliers to maintain quality than ones who have not. If I see something with an organic label selling below market cost from a questionable vendor, I won't have blind faith that the product is what it alleges to be.
