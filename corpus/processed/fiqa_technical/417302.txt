"The testimonies against Armstrong explicitly outline how he was able to get away with what he did. To say that because his blood tests came up clean, and therefore he is innocent is just plain stupid. Let's say I have a weapon gun which after firing once disappears into thin air. I use this weapon to commit a murder and nobody sees me do it. I am apprehended immediately after the murder occurs but the police find no weapon on me so I am free to go. Now let's say 26 people report to the police of what I had done. One of those people is the person who manufactured the gun. Wouldn't it be stupid for me to defend myself by saying ""You found no gun on me after the murder therefore I am innocent""?"
