"Right. There are laws about this stuff though. It's been hard for advertisers to ensure that their paid placements are properly identified. I can tell you as a marketer that has worked with influencers, I want them to do it the right/legal way. ""Subtlety"" might sound nice, but if it means fines from the FTC, I'd prefer a clear label. I also love that it gives me visibility to the stats for the post without relying on the influencer to report (who could inflate their numbers to me to get future business)"
