They mention the struggling economy but not McD's caving to the franchisees and getting rid of the dollar menu at precisely the wrong time. Also, McD's long-time strength -*consistency* is now a given in any franchise operation. It isn't novel anymore and is perceived as *bland sameness*. The posts about Five Guys, Whataburger, In-N-Out, etc. show that regional favorites still have an impact and a place in our hearts and there's the smaller nationals as well, like White Castle, Carls Jr./Hardee's, and A&W. Whenever I visit Washington or Oregon Burgerville USA is de rigeur, or Arctic Circle or SteakBurger. Also, the article talks about burgers vs. 'Other' like OS market share. Does that make Fast Casual the iOS of dining (flame bait)? Does that make the burger joints equivalent to Android version fragmentation? Edit: fixed typos from mobile posting.
