"Excellent observation! The short answer is that you don't own the firm, you own the right to your share of the profits (or losses) for the period that you worked there. Technically you also have the right to vote to sell or disband the company (known as demutualization). The workers at Equal Exchange voted in a clause to our bylaws to prevent this--basically a ""poison pill."" It says that if we ever sold the company we have to pay off any debts, return any investments (at the price paid), and give away any remaining assets to another company dedicated to Fair Trade. The effect is that there is no incentive for us to sell the company, so we don't worry about all the kinds of things you would if you were focused on an ""exit strategy."" But in this sense, ""ownership"" is even more compromised, right? Back to your question, I think the answer is ""It depends on what you mean by ownership."" It is certainly not ownership in the conventional sense. I think of it more like a trusteeship. We are stewards of the enterprise while we have the benefits given to active workers, but we have a responsibility not just to maximize our own well-being, but that of the other stakeholders (our suppliers, consumers, investors, our communities, the environment, etc), including the people who worked there before (and left part of the profits in the company as retained earnings) and those that will come after us."
