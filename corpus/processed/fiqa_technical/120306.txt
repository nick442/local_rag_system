">Correct me if I'm wrong, You're wrong. >but weren't taxes much higher from the 50's through the 70's? Only on the high end of the scale (the TOP tax rate was higher). But for lower and middle income people, taxes were tremendously LOWER in those decades, and became significantly higher, to wit: * [FICA increased from the original 1% in circa 1937-49, to over 15% in 1990](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/taxRates.html) -- and that is taken right out your GROSS paycheck, no deductions, etc. * Things like State Sales Taxes (which are known to be heavily regressive) were either non-existent or minimal (at say 1% and often more of a ""luxury"" tax) prior to the 1960's; and they have been steadily increasing since then. * Many other taxes (property, excise, tobacco & other ""sin"" taxes, etc) have increased (some many-fold) -- and virtually ALL of them are regressive in nature (being made more regressive with every increase). But probably the most egregious thing.. is that the public has been successfully indoctrinated into believing the EXACT opposite of what really happened (and *both* political parties are to blame)."
