"That sounds like a marketing process that might work although it would be much easier and will most likely have a better impact if you made a cool video showing it glowing in the dark at a rave/party/nightclub and had a women's voice over it saying little jabs of info and branding it as ""the party drink"" or some other brand that you want to turn it into. Then take that video and put it on FB and do some paid marketing with FB's AI system so it can find your target market and then once you do find who buys it, market the shit out of it. After you prove that people want it, maybe find a distributor since you will then have provable sales and let the distributor sell it to every gas station and quicky mart known to man and just keep up with the marketing and branding and then boom you are a millionaire! Well, maybe. haha"
