LOL, so you think smoking pot never affects anyone else in the country? And you think all drugs should be legal and with zero restrictions? At least alcohol has restrictions. > Adults in a free country shouldn't have to have their rights constrained because some person on the Internet thinks they know things. Unless it affects others, which it does.
