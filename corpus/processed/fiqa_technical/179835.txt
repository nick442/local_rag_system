This is a logistics problem for a small percentage of employers. The economy as a whole doesn't need workers. These are companies that decided to keep their factories out in the middle of nowhere in order to keep property values down and then complain that they can't get workers. Youngstown, Ohio has a total population of 64K people. They could move a half hour commute closer to Pittsburgh or Akron and be up to their eyeballs in workers.
