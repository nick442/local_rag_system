Yeah, but you're not going to be playing games on a laptop. That kills the experience. Plus, I've had my friend who goes to the college I want to advertise at say it would be amazing because many college students love to play video games, and I personally feel no console is going to give you the best experience with games, excluding Nintendo consoles which have a library of nearly completely exclusive titles, engineered specifically with the console's specs. I completely understand what you mean, though.
