"Uber has consistently lost money because it spends massively to fuel its growth (think about those $20 when you sign up promos) so people expected it to lose money at a level consistent with its past, but they actually lost a little less money while still improving sales. Whether or not Uber is in a ""good"" position could be substantially debated, however these two metrics (sales/net loss) we know of show signs of healthy growth."
