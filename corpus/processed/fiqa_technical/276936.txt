I agree but there is some benefit to compression, especially if you are watching tv in more of a casual environment with a high background noise level. You crank the volume to hear quiet dialogue and then a loud scene happens and scares the shit out of you. Ideally the compression would be user controlled but that's too complicated for your average schmoe unfortunately. I think compression is added to some big screen movies too (on say TBS) as well for the same reasons.
