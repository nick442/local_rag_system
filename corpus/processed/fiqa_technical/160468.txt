>Because we are the people who have come together to form a more perfect union. You realize that isn't an actual argument for anything, right? >Also, if we have poor & elderly suffering in the USA, the people with the high line condos and sports cars are not being taxed enough. So the poor and elderly have zero responsibility for their own suffering, and the wealthy have all the responsibility to alleviate any suffering via higher taxes? How does that make sense?
