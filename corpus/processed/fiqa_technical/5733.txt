Are you just turning in applications? Are you cold calling/emailing and trying to get a hold of managers and finding out about positions? Have you sent any cover letters to people? Also, does your resume look aesthetically pleasing and is well organized? Are your skills highlighted well? I feel like it can be pretty tough to get a job if you didn't get one right out of school.
