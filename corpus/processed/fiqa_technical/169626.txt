"As you pointed out in reference to cost-cutting, fiduciary lawsuits come out when things go wrong. When directors successfully increase stock value, everyone including shareholders is happy. I'm not sure exactly where the best place is to look for such cases, but here's what my google-fu yielded: * [Example 1](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/25/business/the-media-business-excerpts-from-ruling-in-paramount-case.html): Paramount is sold to Viacom at a lower price than QVC's offer, shareholders sue. Paramount claims they were looking out for long-term but shareholders sued them for screwing them out of maximal share value. * [Example 2](http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2012/05/case-law-on-the-fiduciary-duty-of-directors-to-maximize-the-wealth-of-corporate-shareholders.html): Dodge v. Ford Motor Co, Ford had a majority share in his company and wanted to stop paying dividends to shareholders so he could expand his business. At trial Ford ""testified to his belief that the company made too much money and had an obligation to benefit the public and the firmâ€™s workers and customers."" The court disagreed, as his motor company was set up for profit, not charity. Ford was ordered to resume paying dividends. Interestingly I found many more lawsuits where corporations sacrificed long-term for short-term. It seems once incorporated this is where the internal incentives and pressures lead many managers, lawsuits are merely one of these pressures."
