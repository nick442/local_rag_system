"I think we're just at a point in society where everyone feels anonymous in public, and therefore many act like they're not affecting others with their behavior. Many would call it an entitlement society. I worked at Panera for a year in HS and made a vegetarian sandwich for someone. It had a sliver of roast beef the size of perhaps 1/4 of a dime, and yet, she freaked out and yelled at me. I removed the piece of lettuce it was stuck to and she demanded a new one. One of many ""dealing with the public"" stories I'm sure so many of us have now. Also the power afforded to everyone via lawyers gives more fuel to this fire. Always threaten to sue if they don't get what they want."
