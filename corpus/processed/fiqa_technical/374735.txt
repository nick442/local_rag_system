> Ask the guy who guessed Sarah Palin's email password how that theory worked out. Breaking into someones private email is hardly comparable. *Target* made the rule that coupons could not be used this way, and then *Target* allowed it. It is like telling a man not to fish on Thursday, but when he asks again on Friday you allow it, is that man a crook? Printing the coupons and using more than one is difficult to defend, though that in itself does not prove injury. A customer could hypothetically gather a large group of people, having each of them use the coupon, achieving the same end without breaking the TOS. Would that also be fraud. Where then is the injury if every consequence to target is the same, yet no one person cheated? Now, if the situation was a cashier and customer working together to abuse the system, I would say it is absolutely criminal activity. Target had knowledge of the thread in some form, they sent a notice to the website asking for a logo to be removed from the same thread in question. Maybe it was just a copyright hound, and maybe the information was not passed on. That is unclear as you stated. In the end I would say target is certainly aware now, and if any legal action is taken against these people we can find out for sure if what they did was criminal. The courts can decide the outcome and I will accept it either way. EDIT: Grammar, formatting.
