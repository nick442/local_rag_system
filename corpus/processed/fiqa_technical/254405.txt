"That oil is traded in USD makes for extra demand and thus a stronger dollar with more purchasing power. It's not really economics that are the issue though - many might argue a weakened dollar might help the US economy (cheaper exports). The real issue is power. These gold backed securities make it so that certain countries can get around US sanctions. Not to mention that controlling the currency that oil is traded in means the US can devalue their currency to gain an advantage in the event of a shortage. Also, because petroleum is traded in dollars, this means treasury bonds are a natural place to store wealth for oil producers. High demand for these bonds makes it cheap for the US government to borrow and easier to make interest payments thus making T-Bonds a ""safe"" asset."
