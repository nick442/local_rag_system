The president doesn't have a magic wand that automatically makes his will the law of the land. The president is the chief executive over a complicated bureaucratic system we call the US government. With many branches and departments, some of which are legally separated by the US Constitution and not directly under the president's control. No things aren't going to get better because the issues this country faces are beyond the office of the president. Maybe if Congress would get serious about America we would see a little traction on the recovery, as we would have 2/3 branches of the government moving in in the same direction. Currently the US government is a centipede with 2/3rds of its legs busted. **EDIT:** I don't mean to give the impression that the Judicial Branch is dysfunctional so much as I wanted to illustrate that it tends to follow the Legislative and Executive branches, not lead them. The Legislative branch creates the laws that the Executive branch (Office of the President) enforces. The Judicial branch oversees these two branches to make sure they create laws that abide by and operate within the Constitution.
