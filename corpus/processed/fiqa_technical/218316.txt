Not arguing about ethics, but why is this a problem? They didn't make anything worse/more difficult/more dangerous. In fact, all this does is help anyone who has the discontinued 60. They didn't pay for a 75, so it's not like they didn't get what they paid for. Would it make you happier if the 60 came with a smaller battery and you had to buy a different one to upgrade? Of course, then they have no way of assisting consumers trying to evacuate, but that's a fair price to pay for a less convenient way to upgrade your vehicle, right?
