People buy less shit. Therefore less work needs to be done to produce shit. Therefore people spend less time working. Of course this means less income, but that's OK because you're spending less money buying shit. The trick is figuring out how to spread the income decrease to the entire population, instead of companies laying off some people while everyone else's income and hours worked remains unchanged.
