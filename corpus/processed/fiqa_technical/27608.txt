"It's not ""the market"" deciding anything if you're forcing a business to pay someone an arbitrary amount that you declare to be a ""living wage"". Why do you believe that you get to interfere in a mutual agreement between two people? One guy goes to another and says ""hey wanna do this job for me for X dollars"" and the other guy says ""ok cool sounds good"" and here you are jumping in and saying ""nope, can't allow that, I have to stop you"""
