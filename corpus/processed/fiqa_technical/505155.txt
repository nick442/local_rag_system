>You seem to want our government to fail as well. No, I want people to recognize that the *concept of government* is a failure that simply gives a lovely cover-story to oppression and mass-murder. I want us to *intentionally dismantle* our government so that we can implement *a better system* that isn't designed to kill people and impose the will of the few on the majority. >Do you know what to call it when people structure their interactions in order to cooperate? The word is Government. Except that's a mighty beautiful line of bullshit, because in reality, government is what happens when the powerful create a justification for maintaining their power and imposing their will on the masses.
