I dumped every stock I own at market open today. I didn't really lose anything and I'm just going to sit things out for awhile. I'll wait and watch and when I see good opportunities to buy solid companies at below market rates but for the moment I'm sitting out. There is too much shit going on from North Korea to Harvey to who knows what else. I like cash so I took my profits and am holding them in that for the moment.
