"Firstly, ""the government"" is the people. So should the Government be involved in Fire and Police departments, military services, roads/highways, water/sewer, the electrical grid, air transportation, trains, the National Parks, schools, libraries, state colleges, zoning and municipal bylaws? The government exists to serve the people's interests and not those of profiteering business lobbyists."
