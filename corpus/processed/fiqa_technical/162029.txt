It is. I stopped using Uber. I use Lyft exclusively now, even tho they cost a little more. Obviously one customer is not going to have a huge impact on a billion dollar company, but a real businessman knows every dollar you lose is hurting your business. That is, a businessman interested in success, rather than mediocrity, knows that.
