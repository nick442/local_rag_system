I've never read such a bullshit article in my life. The alternative to garment manufacturing jobs in places like Bangladesh is subsistence agriculture, completely outside of the cash economy. If Communist/SJW of the West want to do something for the global poor, they need to look at population control and family planning. An overpopulated country will mean high pressures on the cost of living, and increased supply of labour will mean lower wages. This is exactly what China has done - control population, and let the free market dictate wages and conditions. Look at the result - the biggest uplift of a population from poverty in history, with wages still growing yearly. By contrast, look at Africa. The entire continent is supported by foreign aid, and its a basketcase, with the population of the continent forecast to grow to 4b by the end of the century.
