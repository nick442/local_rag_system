I know there are a lot of papers on bubbles already, but I was always interested in how many were retail/individually driven vs institutionally driven bubbles - at least who plays a larger role. The American pension crisis is also another interesting topic that may be fun to write about. With everyone calling doomsday on them, maybe you can shed some light on some (if any) of the bs or touch on what options they may actually have to survive. Topics on investor behaviour is always a safe bet - potential returns lost due to home bias, investment behaviour of millennials, bla bla bla. The dangers of the rise of passive investments (ETFs) if any & if it actually generates more room to capture alpha since there may be greater inefficiencies. Also the impact of a stock's return relative to the amount of ETFs it is a constituent of So many things - pls advise what you end up deciding to choose and post the paper when the time comes!
