"You, yourself, cannot spend the money from life insurance because, well, you are dead. So the question becomes ""what is best for those you leave behind?"". Thus is a question that can only be answered by examining the individual(s) you would leave behind. Near as I can tell, you currently have no one else who may be significantly hurt by your passing. So you cannot answer this question until there is (are) that (those) other(s). In the meantime, 'self-insure' by saving (true investing) up the money that you would otherwise be spending on premiums."
