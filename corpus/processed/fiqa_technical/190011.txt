">so I would like to ask you which, at this project, poor management skill of Oracle staffs or plan of Oregon are worse to be accused. **I believe there is an increased burden on the employer (Oregon) to effectively manage the scope of the work required for the project that the contractor (Oracle) is working on**. Otherwise, the contractor has plausible deniability for being able to provide deliver a quality working solution. >Or do you think that plan was made mainly by Oracle? I think the plan was **mostly made by Oracle with the requirements given by Oregon**, and that's where things seem messy. My gut tells me though that when an employer hires a contractor for the creation of a fully integrated enterprise system, that the employer essentially signs their financial life away to the project in a way that absolves the contractor of indirect or direct ""damages"" that come from the result of unforeseen implementation requirements or issues. Oracle has been around long enough to know how to legally cover their asses. If there is anything that Oregon may have traction on, it would be a few of their fraud claims, given that Oracle has made [two settlements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_corporation#Justice_Department_lawsuit) with federal agencies of ~$100 & ~$200 million since 2011 which were from allegations of fraud or false claims. Such claims by Oregon may be supported by the fact that they allegedly have a former Oracle employee who can substantiate the poor quality of the product they were giving to Oregon, but that blame might go back to Oregon's specifications which I have no insight into. As someone who has witnessed a couple of employer and contractor relationships between public & private entities, my hope out of all of this is that: * Sales people for contractors think twice before over-promising technology solutions that their company can't fully deliver on given resource constraints or lack of employer specifications. * Employers ""hiring"" such entities manage them, expectations, plus the overall project effectively while accepting personal accountability & responsibility. I think the only people who have a clear picture of what was going on were anyone from either party who were on the front lines of managing the project, developing the systems, or running them."
