Nope, not a Moto G, it's a new budget model with the name Moto E. I'll see if I can link to it on a sec. *edit [Here's the link]( http://www.motorola.com/us/consumers/shop-all-mobile-phones/Moto-E/moto-e.html) I just bought the plain black one, but it's kind of neat that they make interchangeable colorful backs if that's something you're into I guess.
