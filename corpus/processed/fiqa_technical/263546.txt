According to Dave Ramsey you should pay off the house. What I've found is that I'm willing to work a lot harder at saving money to put toward the house when I have that specific goal in mind. If I were to put the money in the market instead then I would be less likely to make as many sacrifices and would inevitability end up putting less money away.
