So I am in this position with my grandmother and she is in her late 90s and wants to give us some of her things. There are some items I would want, but there are a lot of other things that I don't want. So when she wants to give me things now, I have to be delicate about it. I don't want to be inundated with everything and the things I would want now she is still using so I will happily wait.
