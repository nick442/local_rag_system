The majority of honest sellers who are serious about their business and committed to the Amazon platform just authorize all returns/refunds as quick as they can because they don't want to risk having a bad rating/review punctuate their profile. This policy does not change much for any of those sellers, just a few less clicks they need to make every day. Agreed that many smaller shops or those who are just in it for the short term don't have the room to absorb the costs of meeting the same level of service Amazon provides directly -- but shouldn't we all aspire to it anyway?
