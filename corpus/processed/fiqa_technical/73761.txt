Yup, and fortunately there are vocal (and voter) people on both sides of most issues, making the center unnecessary for voting. If the system gets too crazy, the middle will act. So I'm not too worried. The vocal kids you worry about are like the 60's peace, love, and freedom hippies that grew up and became the respectable capitalists in the 1980's. Youthful idealism gets replaced with respect for reality.
