I have no argument for or against it, hence the grey area. My heart wants to provide the service to everyone, while my brain tells me to do a cost-benefit analysis. People in the US opposed to UK or Canada style medicine cite access to medical help as the reason but I don't have any experience with either nor has it been a big deal for me so far.
