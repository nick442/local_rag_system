Anecdotal evidence, but my company is trying to fill four electronic assembly positions in North East Ohio. We are literally in the backyard of Delphi and GM. We are paying 18-25 dollars an hour with only minimal experience required, full benefits, full time with overtime available. We cannot fill them, plenty of interviews, plenty of people we make contingent offers to, but they all no show or fail the pee test. Its insanity.
