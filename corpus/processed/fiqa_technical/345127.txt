Thanks for the details. I didn't know that Sony had relaxed their warranties with their current generations of consoles. Cartridges weren't SSDs like we know today. They used ROMs for storage and battery backed SRAM for saves. There was most likely also no controller in the cartridge itself, but the host CPU accessed the ROM directly. A lot of storage is called SSDs today when this term is actually only used for SSDs you can buy for PCs and which interface through SATA or PCIe. The storage in most mobile phones and tablets are called SSD for marketing impact, but they are inferior.
