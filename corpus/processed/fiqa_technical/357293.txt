"> Two Ex-Googlers Want To Make Bodegas And Mom-And-Pop Corner Stores Obsolete .. Weird and unachievable but okay .. > he is launching a new concept called Bodega with his cofounder So he's replacing bodegas with.. Bodega? Uhuh. This is getting weirder. > Bodega sets up five-foot-wide pantry boxes filled with non-perishable items you might pick up at a convenience store Oh. Nope. He's just making high tech vending machines. Okay. Nothing to see here. I hate how everything has to be the new Uber. ""We're gonna disrupt the whole industry! We're gonna make <super universal thing> obsolete! We're gonna change the world!"" > McDonald says. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you.” Shut up McDonald. You're making a high tech vending machine. Will it be profitable? Probably. Is it going to completely revolution the world and eliminate brick and mortar stores across the nation? No. Shut up."
