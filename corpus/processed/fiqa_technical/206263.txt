My feeling on this is that anything to do with a child and raising a family has to be a joint effort. It is very rare that both of you will have exactly the same income, or the same time to spend into caring for your family, so work out what you can do. For us, I work 70+ hour weeks, my wife works 18 hour weeks. Far more of my money goes on clothes, kids, food etc than her money, because that is where the bulk of our income is from. It's just part of sharing - she doesn't feel dependent, and when she was on maternity leave (3 times) the agreement was that we would just rely on my income. I have the same attitude as you - it is a shared pool that you each contribute to in your own way, and once the essentials are paid for (this includes post-pregnancy clothing) then you can worry about other bits and pieces. Having said that, while most of our finances are shared, we do each keep a separate account for buying gifts, things for ourselves etc - which gives some flexibility.
