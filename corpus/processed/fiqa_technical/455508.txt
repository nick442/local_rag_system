Seen from Jerusalem, the EU appears to be siding with the Palestinians; it is the Palestinian authority&#039;s largest donor, and some member states, including France, were early champions of Palestinian statehood. > With Israel&#039;s domestic politics having shifted dramatically to the right over the past decade or so, a loss of power for Netanyahu&#039;s Likud party or the prime minister&#039;s removal over an ongoing corruption investigation would change little with regards to attitudes towards the Palestinians, and hence relations with the EU. At the same time, the regional setting, with wars ongoing in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq; low-intensity conflict in Libya; and increasing competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran, shows little sign of improving. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6ywdm7/ceps_the_eu_and_israel_partnership_and_the_weight/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~206605 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **Israel**^#1 **Palestinian**^#2 **EU**^#3 **Israeli**^#4 **war**^#5"
