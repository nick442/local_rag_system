There's a company in my town that is notorious for refusing to hire people over 35. They prefer to hire 20-somethings, work them them to exhaustion, and then dump them by the side of the road, career-wise, with the 20-something clutching a good reference letter in their hand if they're lucky. I would love to work 3 days a week. In truth, as a Veteran with chronic pain I sleep so lousy, and I'm so poorly integrated socially, that work is the primary place where I interact with people, so I keep on with it because the alternative is me sitting at home listening to my neighbour's dog howling the song of the damned for hours, or hearing their blaring telly as they drink themselves into a stupor and then leave the damned thing on all night after they eventually pass out. I really thought retirement age would be better, but I closed on this place and I'm stuck here for a while.
