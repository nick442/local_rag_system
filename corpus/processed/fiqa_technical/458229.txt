"Reddit has what is informally called the ""1 in 10"" rule. That is, it's generally considered OK to submit your own material or material you are promoting as 1 in every 10 submissions. Accounts that only submit for commercial reasons are likely to get labeled spam and possibly deleted. More definitions of what is considered spam on Reddit can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam)."
