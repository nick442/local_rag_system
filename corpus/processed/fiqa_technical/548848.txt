Sounds great, but what happens in practice is that the town loses money out the wazoo by 1) failing to levy taxes on the primary attraction, 2) capture peripheral expenditures by visitors, 3) having to support increased traffic, or worse, throw bonds at infrastructure that never gets used, 4) flat-out corruption, 5) foolish promotions. Nobody wants to hire losers from depressed communities, particularly black ones, anyway; the good jobs go to imported or commuter talent, if any jobs materialize at all. Offer value to the world, and the world will return value. Instead, these communities whore their cheapness. Well guess what, you don't see too many cheap whores getting rich, do you.
