Taxes are insanely cheaper than West Coast and Northeast. I believe they are requiring a city with at least 1 million pop and existing public transit (I read that as train/subway). That eliminates a lot of cities. You are correct that it is rapidly catching up to some of the big names on prop cost, etc.
