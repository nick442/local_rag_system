I'm no fan of Go Daddy and less of a fan of SOPA, but why the hell is Go Daddy getting singled out? Microsoft and Apple are two huge supporters, but you don't hear anything about them. Keeping it on topic to this subreddit, I don't think a boycott of godaddy will have any effect. They are a behemoth, and the people they attract don't give two shits about SOPA or internet activism.
