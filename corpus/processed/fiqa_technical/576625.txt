I think people are glossing over the type of experience you get working at a startup. Having worked at a huge multi-national corp, and now working in a basement, I would say this: Multinational corp - everything is a process. They have a documented process for damn near everything, including taking a shit. If you don't know how to do something, you have internal support or somebody around you that knows how to do it. You don't learn anything in this type of environment. You get hired for one specific job on the assembly line, and you consistently perform a set of pretty specific job functions every day. The upside is full benefits, job security, and stability. Startup - Absolute chaos. Your responsible for sales, design, implementation, production support, and late-night troubleshooting. You could be out of a job tomorrow if a single customer pulls out. But the upside is the wealth of experience you get on all aspects of business and you have to see a design from spec to production. As a young professional, I much prefer the latter. If I lose my job - so what? I'll find another one. The experience i've gotten from the startup in just under a year far exceeds the experience I got in three years at the corporation.
