I second the above post. I am a CFA charterholder, and have an MBA. The CFA Charter is the gold standard for asset management and investment research. Plus, it is a self-study program. You can sit for the Level I exam as a Senior in undergraduate, and this is a huge positive signal to prospective employers.
