I was saved when I prevented myself from being brainwashed from a pack of people who seem to think conditional ideals, based on mans logic, are truly of of God. The only person who can save would be God himself for if we take it upon ourselves to declare that we are safe and demean others who we pass judgement on, then consider them dammed, we will become our own false god. Express lane to hell on that.
