I am not a Republican conservative. I would begin cutting the budget at the Pentagon, the NSA, and the CIA. I would eliminate Homeland Security and give the salvageable parts to the FBI. You could easily cut 500 billion right there without touching social spending. Then I would shutter the Depts of Interior, Education, Commerce and Agriculture. There you have another 100 Billion At that point you demand 15% cuts of the remaing departments, another 75 billion and then you attack the 3 big problems, which are medicare, medicaid and SS. Medicare and Social Security should have the minimum age raised now to 67. Medicaid must be much more difficult to qualify for. Problem solved. Budget balanced. Foreign adventurism terminated.
