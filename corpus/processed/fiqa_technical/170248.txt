"If you were making that large of a payment (via a cashiers check or other withdrawal means from a cash account) to a credit card, would the payment generate a Cash Transaction Report? Probably, yes. If it does require the bank to make a CTR, then is there any harm in that or anything to be concerned about (like that transaction appearing suspicious, personal reporting implications, etc.)? Are there any other reasons why one might want to make sure payments to a credit card are broken up made* in amounts smaller than $10K? You should be concerned if you cannot explain the source of the money (legally..). If you withdrew cash from your own account and paid your credit card with it, in case of questions asked you can show the account statement with the matching withdrawal, and you're done. The point in this report is to point at people who move around large amounts of cash. Usually, people pay credit cards with checks or ACH transactions, but if you want cash - it's your right, as long as the cash was obtained legally. But if you're paying your credit cards off with the cash you got as a bribe or by selling cocaine on the streets, then you should be worried. By the way, breaking into smaller payments may not save you from being reported to the money laundering detection agencies. The report is per transaction, not per payment, so if the credit card statement is $11K and you pay $5K and $6K - the transaction is still $11K. Also, the bank can file a report even if it is not required (it was clarified in the other answer to the same question you're referring to), if the clerk thinks the transaction is suspicious. This leaves the decision on filing a report solely on the banks ""common sense"" and internal policies which you don't know. So even paying $10 in cash may trigger a report if the bank suspects wrongdoing."
