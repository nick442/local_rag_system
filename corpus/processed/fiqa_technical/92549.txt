It is absolutely worth it. My wife and I have two of these accounts (different banks). We are required to use our cards 20 times for one bank, and 15 for the other. We have yet to miss the required transactions in a month (over 15 months of use now), and are actually considering getting a third account. Between the two of us, we simply have to use our card on average once a day. Getting gas? Use your debit card. Getting stamps? Use your debit card? Self checkout? Use your debit card twice. Eating out? Use your debit card. If married, split the bill. As soon as we reach the minimum, we stop using the debit cards and switch to credit cards to further boost the rewards. Maybe it's easier for us since we don't have kids and are out a lot, but 12 transactions is really simple to obtain. We receive ~$100 a month from our two accounts, all for doing something we already do.
