"That's an interesting statement to make. A pretty even number of people complain about not being helped and being ""bombarded"" with ""pushy"" employees. Hourly employees won't be as aggressive about selling whatever the fuck they can, and commission employees are going to make sure they help you even if you don't ask. Best buy also tries to promise ""impartial advice"" which I think can only be achieved through hourly employees. My comment history might give away that I was (I still am but I used to too) a best buy employee, first in mobile, then Geek Squad. I can't speak for more than my store, but 9/10 of the people I work with regularly go above and beyond to do the right thing, and make good recommendations, for the customer first. I went from the new guy to the top associate in mobile in less than a year, just by presenting my customers with all of their options and suggesting a solution based on the information they give me. Best buys problem, in my opinion, are young managers and old employees. Older employees in my experience, know less about the products, are less honest, and more aggressive salespeople. With management, best buy loves to push young managers who increase sales around to affect as many stores as possible, meaning a younger go-hard pushes to undo the customer service progress that a store may make. I never looked best buy until I started working there. Call it Stockholm syndrome if you can't resist, but there's a reason they're still around. Mobile and Geek squad aren't going anywhere for sure, and there are other very profitable segments of the store as well. I don't think they're going anywhere soon. Sorry for the rant"
