> Productivity can increase, but it doesn't have to. Productivity can remain the same but if you've got two people competing for one job they bid wages lower since even a lower wage is better (up to a point in welfare state) to no wage at all. But, regardless of decreases in wages, productivity should still increase since there are more people working. On a fundamental level, labor and capital combine to create products. If you add more potential labor, and keep capital constant, you'll only have the same number of products being produced if increase in potential labor isn't used. Since unemployment hasn't increased to compensate for women entering the work force there should be more goods produced.
