It's very simple: The whole purpose of a credit card for the credit card company is that you borrow money and then pay them extortionate interest for the rest of your life. The way you describe yourself, you are the perfect victim. So the obvious thing for you to do is to not touch credit cards with a barge pole. IF you decide to use a credit card, then what you should really, really do is to pay back the maximum amount possible all the time. Best is to pay off the credit card in full if at all possible. Consider this: If you owe them money, the interest rate is so high that with the minimum payment, your debt will be growing all the time. Spend $1,000, pay $10 a month, and next year you owe $1,100 without having used the credit card at all. If you pay $32 a month as you mentioned, your $1,000 purchase is actually a multi-year loan. If you need a multi-year loan for a $1,000 purchase, an ordinary loan from your bank will be much, much cheaper.
