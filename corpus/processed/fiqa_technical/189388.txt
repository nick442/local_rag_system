"How do financial derivatives like futures help in price discovery? From what I understand, the prices of futures are decided after the parties ""discover"" the price they think is appropriate for the underlying asset after some time. Wouldn't taking a future's price and then valuating an asset like a cart in front of a horse or the tail wagging the dog? Please link all that you want to and correct me everywhere."
