"Thanks for the link. It was great to hear Curtis speak about things. He had an interesting take on Occupy Wall Street. He said if he'd been in charge of it he's have sacked the leaders but he didn't make note of how OWS was slowly neutered by the MSM. After the intial coverage, the MSM began focusing their reporting on the physically more disagreeable aspects of that many people ensconcing themselves into an area and they started framing it as a public heath hazard and a nuisance. Once the public had absorbed the message and interest waned, the police were sent in to disperse them all. Edit. After listening to the whole thing, Curtis' final monologue on ""change"" and who expects what type of change and what it would cost them was brilliant and stunningly prescient. It made me redefine the ""change"" I envision."
