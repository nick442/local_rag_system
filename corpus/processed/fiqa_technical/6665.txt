"You need to contact the institution that is holding your current account, have them sell your fund investment, and then close your account and send you a check for the balance. Then you can open an account directly with Vanguard (or call 800-319-4254). You don't need an account with an online broker unless you want to be able to invest in funds outside the Vanguard family. Fees will depend on the institution that you are currently using and the fund. With some funds you have to pay a ""load"" (percentage of your assets, in the neighborhood of a couple of percent) when you redeem shares. Your institution may charge you a fee for redeeming the fund (anywhere from $0/free to maybe $40 or higher). Some institutions will charge a fee for closing the account. (I've seen anything from $0/free to $40, but I haven't looked around in a while.) As MrChrister points out in a comment below, this is not the best method for an IRA. In that case, you'd want to make a transfer, and I'd recommend calling both your current institution and Vanguard (or wherever you end up transferring funds to) for forms and instructions on how best to do it."
