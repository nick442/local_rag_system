Saftey is and always will be an issue in heavy industry i know this because i work in the industry. But to suggest that mj is more of a risk than booze and prescription drugs is just flat out wrong. The effects of thc last far shorter than any other of those substances and have no residual effects like alcohol does yet its treated far more serious than those substances. This is a monumental issue our nation is dealing with right now because of numerous years of damaging marijuana polices and blantat misinformation.
