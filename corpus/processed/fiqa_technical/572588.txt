You seem to have not ever received a cease and desist letter and not sure if you know what you are talking about regarding the nature of this one. - legal trouble is extremely disruptive to business (and this is a tiny side project) really not worth the hassle once they had proved the point. Being 90% certain you are in the right is not that reassuring if the downside is measured in 6 or 7 figures - issue was use of McGregors name and likeness which are protectable. You can't just slap a famous persons name and image on your product (or anyone's for that matter) without their permission. Trademarks don't appear to come into it - they could have continued without use of his name and probably would be fine - but by that point they have achiev d what they set out to, the profit is relatively small compared to the main business and they probably have some insight to how crucial the name was to the success (e.g. What if 90% of web searches that lead to a sale included his name? If CTR is much lower for non mcgregor ads?) etc.
