I am currently interning in wealth management. Do you guys have tips to projects I can do? So far, on my own initiative, I have created a dynamic investment model comparing different product structures in Excel and currently working on automating some processes in Outlook and Excel. Not sure what else I can do to pass time. I try to do other things than just talking to clients.
