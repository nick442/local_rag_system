"They may have planned on spending more money, but they haven't actually done so (just as I may plan to buy a new TV, but up until I've bought it I can change my mind). The ever increasing spending, and related debt, is just a symptom of our ""leaders"" failing to make choices and lead. If A is more important than B, then spend the money on A and forego B--don't buy both. And, if both are essential then raise the taxes to pay for them. All we've seen for the last 40 years is congress buying A, and B, and then throwing in C for good measure but never figuring out how to pay for them. They simply pass the debts on to future generations and that's what has to stop. If we need something now, we should pay for it now. We should not be signing away our children's futures expecting them to pay for things because we want them now."
