You clearly have no understanding of the issue. As an example, lets say Apple sells an iphone in France. Apple has to pay income tax and tarrifs and whatever else on that money they receive for the iphone they sold. That makes sense, they use France's infrastructure and citizens to sell the phones. Then when the money comes back to the US (the money is not coming back at this time), Apple is taxed on the same money from the iPhone they just paid taxes on in France. That makes selling iPhones outside of the US difficult due to tax law and regulations that other companies don't have to deal with. This makes it easier for other phone manufacturers to sell phones at a profit and not Apple. This hurts Apple at the end of the day and keeps the money in foreign countries when it could be re-invested in the US.. What is the point of selling internationally if you are going to have to pay two sets of taxes and likely lose money?
