I don't understand why it would be going (I mean I do, money) up. I would imagine that a large majority of the people who signed up, who did not previously have health insurance, were mostly healthy and not use the healthcare system that often. Shouldn't the new wave of healthy people help leverage the sick people in the system some? Shouldn't the extra inflow of money into the health care system, by people that aren't going to be using the health care system frequently, lower the costs for everyone. I thought that was the whole argument on why this was going to work in the first place..
