"Well, that's about 3% higher than the national average, so.. I'm not sure if we should be relieved or disturbed. Personally, I find it deplorable that insurance companies are *allowed* to randomly exclude pesky unprofitable things they don't want to cover. Floods? No thanks. Dental/Vision? Why *ever* would you consider those ""medical"" issues? Uninsured drivers? Yeah, you live in a state that requires 100% of drivers have insurance, but **suck it anyway**, since you have no choice, mwa-hahaha! And people seriously wonder why I utterly loathe insurance companies. Insurance ""fraud"" should be viewed not as a crime, but as the moral frickin' high ground; it's *insurance itself* that is little short of fraud-hidden-in-a-6pt-font."
