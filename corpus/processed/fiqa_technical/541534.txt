You can't be serious? You're seriously coming in here to discuss how a third world country is generally less well off than a member of the EU and a first world country and you're going to quote the HDI. In other news the sky is blue, water is wet, the snosberries taste like snosberries and you're wasting my time and yours. I'm going to disengage now. In fact.. I think you're just flame baiting by jacking the top comment on this thread so i'm going to delete this very shortly.
