Not all his restaurants are geographically close to each other. He tends to run higher-end places that emphasize fresh ingredients, so sourcing from packaged goods suppliers like Sysco that emphasize convenience for a price and trade off of some quality could adversely impact his top and bottom lines. His buyers might head up localized buying co-ops with other restaurants to buy in committed quantities from local suppliers in exchange for substantial discounts. An unenviable challenge.
