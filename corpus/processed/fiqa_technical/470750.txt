Yeah but now imagine you're a third worlder and earn the average national salary. Suddenly such private clinics are not as easily available anymore. It's a decent option for westerners to go to let's say Eastern Europe to get lasik surgery. There it's pocket money compared to what the'd charge in Germany. But the people in Eastern Europe don't have that option. ninja edit: Not saying Eastern Europe is third world. It's a separate example.
