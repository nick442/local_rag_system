In the current climate, most good deals are for people looking for a 75% LTV or less. There are mortgages available with ok APRs for up to 90% LTV though. At the moment you would struggle to find a mortgage with greater than a 90% LTV. You can use an online comparison site like Money Supermarket to find a deal. Plugging in the numbers you gave in your question (house price 100K, income 21K) with a few other assumptions (10K deposit for 90% LTV, 300/month other outgoings) gives a number of results at around 6% APR, which isn't great, but the payments would be around Â£600/month which you may be able to afford.
