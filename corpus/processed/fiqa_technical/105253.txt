The VP came into the restaurant I work at and I served him and a client. At the end he tipped me $10 on a $30 bill and left his card saying to call him if I'm interested in being his assistant. I don't think I did anything different than I would a normal table, but I guess he was impressed with my work ethic. the idea of working for someone who can appreciate my serving and see more potential is exactly the kind of person I'd like to work for.
