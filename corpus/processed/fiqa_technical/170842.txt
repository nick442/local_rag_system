> You may be willing to pay much more, but not everyone is willing. Taxi services in Europe are more expensive than Uber, but they are still in business. Yet, Uber wins on all other fronts (no cash exchange, quick pick up, reliable and friendly drivers, etc..). Although, there has been some protectionism in some countries, obliging uber drivers to be taxi certified (uber Black). I'm just surprised that a taxi company has not developed a similar app, there are a lot of quick car rental services these days (3 of which I know of).
