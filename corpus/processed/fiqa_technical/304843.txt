Exactly. I mean, angel investors can be great, but you shouldn't be doing that unless you already have a proven model and revenue stream. I think an angel investor that would give someone money for an idea at the stage of having made $0 isn't really aware of what they're doing, and they're probably a friend or family that you may most likely end up letting down.
