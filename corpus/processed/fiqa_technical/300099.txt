"> Well they've ""created"" what $5trillion in the last few years I agree with you technically, but they control both the quantity and the quantity times velocity of money so they are also responsible for the lack of cashflow. The big thing I think you're referring to is that they did this weird maneuver where they temporarily injected money into the banks, basically so they could say they were solvent without actually being solvent. Because the injections were temporary, the money never moved and was simply deposited at the fed. If, like Adam Smith, you don't consider money to really exist unless it moves, they did not create effective money, as you point out. Critically, they did not create cashflow, which is the appropriate macro definition of money. The corresponding macro variable for this is NGDP. But actually the fed also controls NGDP, as Ben Bernanke says every time the FOMC makes its report. They just choose not to increase it, because they think that ""monetary policy is sufficiently accommodative."" I would agree with you that the present level of cashflow is inadequate, but if the Fed fixes it at the present level, nothing will increase it. This is called the Sumner critique (Sumner was raising the issue to argue, contra Keynes, that the multiplier on fiscal policy is 0), if you google it you can probably find someone to defend it better than me. In any event, this means it's not very surprising that private spending and investment doesn't lift NGDP: nothing but the fed can lift NGDP. Because it cannot create new cashflow on its own (which it could under free banking, this would be the advantage of free banking), the market must now move to a new equilibrium NGDP level while it is saddled with a large number of contracts from before 2008 that were negotiated with respect to a higher expected NGDP level. This deleveraging process is responsible for the present slump and the disinvestment you describe."
