Most financial guru's recommend between three and six months of savings, modified by how likely you think it is you'll lose your job. Note that the months here are months of expenses not income. Dave Ramsey on the other hands recommends saving only $1000 until you've paid all debts (except your home). This strategy only makes sense if you're paying off debt very aggressively. Since you have many relatively small debts, you would benefit greatly from the debt snowball (recent research shows it's more effective in practice than paying off high interest first). As you quickly pay off the smaller loans you reduce the amount you must pay each month, reducing your risk (your emergency fund now goes that much farther), and enabling you to put more on the next debt. In your particular case the debt snowball would be: etc. Again, this is good because it quickly reduces your monthly required debt payments.
