">Every word is true. No, really, none of it. >Taxpayers get tax credits for buying them. If taxpayers didn't get those tax credits then TSLA would have to lower the price of the car and they would be a loss. In what world is $7,500 26.9% of $100k (their ASP, something close to 100k)? Please, show me the math on that. >See above. See *what* above? You picked that number out of your ass. >I said competition is ""coming"", not that it's here. Yeah, and name one that's coming. Go ahead. Nothing? Thought so. Not to mention, of course, that Tesla's company mission statement is to get other cars to compete with it. That's literally the entire purpose for the company's existence. And they recently told everyone else they can use their patents if they want to. >TSLA has worse battery tech than the cutting edge battery companies whose batteries are coming in the new competition Oh, the competition which is coming, which you seem to know everything about and yet can't name? Of *course* the current battery technology is worse than the technology of the future, no shit. That's because battery tech improves at 8-10% per year. It's been doing this for decades."
