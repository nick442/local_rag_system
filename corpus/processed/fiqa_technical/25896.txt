"From the page you referenced, first click the link ""EI premium rate and maximum"". There you'll find the calculation itself, but not the percentage rate. Then from that page, near the bottom, click the link ""EI premium rates and maximums"". It's almost the same title as the prior page, so a little confusing, but that pluralized version has the data you were looking for. Partial quote: The same rates are applied across Canada, except in the province of Quebec. That province has a different set of rates because they administer their own Parental Insurance Plan. In particular, self-employed workers in Quebec can opt into QPIP (even if they wouldn't qualify to participate in EI) and potentially collect parental benefits. Typical non-self-employed workers in Quebec pay into both EI (at the reduced rates for Quebec) as well as QPIP."
