When I worked for a few years in Ontario, there was Paternity Leave. I didn't pay much attention to how it worked, but I think the parents could split the leave up among themselves as they saw fit. So when my manager Phil had a kid, his wife took off for the first few months, and when she was ready to go back to work, he took off for the remaining few months. Which is really how it should be in America. What if the woman is the one with the higher salary? It might make more sense for the couple to have the man take the majority of the leave, minus some time for physical recovery and the early bonding.
