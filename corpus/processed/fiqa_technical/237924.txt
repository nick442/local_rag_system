"This is why I hate any article talking about luck and success. It gives people an excuse as to why they aren't successful in life (I'm not lucky) and a way to shit on anyone that is successful (something Reddit loves). ""See if you throw enough mud at a wall, eventually some of it will stick. And if 20,000 people start a business, then most will fail, but some will succeed, and some will go through the roof."" This doesn't really work. If you keep doing the same stupid things over and over, you most likely will not succeed. However, if you fail, learn from the failure, and try again over and over, you most likely will succeed at some point. This isn't because of luck. I've worked with a lot of people in business and the reason most fail is because they give up or are just not experienced enough to know the correct path. I suppose I should be glad that the majority of people are lazy.it just means less competition for me. ""The business acumen of the directors is sometimes capable of making a business MORE successful than it otherwise would be, but mostly, it's down to luck."" If it really was luck, anyone could sit there, do nothing, and success would come upon them. This never happens. Every decision in life that you make involves some sort of chance (or luck), but it's not nearly as much as what you would like us to believe."
