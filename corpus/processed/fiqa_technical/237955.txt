Don't worry, Israel handles threats to its existance very well. To remind you: the nuclear reactor in Iraq, destroyed by Israel in the 1970s. The nucelar reactor in Syria, destroyed few years ago. Last week, the factory for chemical weapons which was not supposed to exist, does not exist anymore. Many Iranian scientists died unexpectedly and if needed, there will be a cleanup job in Iran, with the help of all the Arab/Muslim neighboring countries, all of them hate Iran more than Israel does..
