You have to be kidding. The derivatives market alone is in the hundreds of trillions and that's just a low ball guess. The Zero Interest Money Machine has been running full throttle for 8 years now. You know it's bad when they list the Billionaires and there are all these guys from South America who haven't figured out how to hide their money or care more about the status while all the North American and European Billionaires are disappearing or appear to be losing money (they just figured out how to hide more of it).
