"What you're saying here sounds awfully close to ""I believe in free speech, but only for things I agree with"", which means literally the exact opposite of free speech. To go this ""ends justify the means"" is making a mockery of the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law), even if it's not a legal matter. To take it to the extreme: If rape were legal it would still not be moral just because the only people who are raped are done so as punishment for things you think are horrible."
