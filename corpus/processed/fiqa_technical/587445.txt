What good does that do a city, though? More so than housing any large company? I'd be mildly surprised if HQ2 surpassed what Amazon has in Seattle now. That's a very long buildup and there's a lot of established business structure here, and I don't get the impression that it's going to slow down. My hunch is that they've simply given up on trying to keep up with the pace of growth with only one major campus. This gives them a lot more options. I want to see how they plan to foster the growth of HQ2. There are a couple of easy ways to get me to consider moving, but at the same time, there are serious advantages to staying in Seattle: all of the interesting projects and teams are here, and all of it's within walking distance. It would be a pity to lose that.
