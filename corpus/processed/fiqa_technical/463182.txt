1) Why wouldn't I be able to contribute to an IRA if it is taxable? Since I am spending the stipend on living expenses, shouldn't it count as income and thus make it eligibile for an IRA? Not any income is eligible for an IRA. Only earned income (compensation) is eligible. From the link - see the second bullet item: For 2015 and 2016, your total contributions to all of your traditional and Roth IRAs cannot be more than: In your case this is not an earned income, since you haven't performed any work. You promised to perform work in the future, but you'll get paid for that work separately. This income is taxable, but doesn't qualify for the IRA. If you have any other earned income, you can use the stipend funds to make the actual deposits, and use that other earned income for calculating the limits.
