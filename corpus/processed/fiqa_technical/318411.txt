It depends what you mean by 'gain'. Over long period of times the market increases so using a blind monkey with a dart or index fund should be sufficient to get an average returns. The key difference is that changes in currency are close to zero sum game while money in equity or bonds is actually used for something (building a company etc.). If you mean 'get above average returns' then you will likely get answers depending on person. If you think that markets are efficient then you won't beat the market consistently - over long periods the returns are likely to be no better then average - because of large number of 'smart people' trying to beat each other (and even them are likely to have below-average returns). If you don't think so then it is possible to get above average consistently - as long as you know how to beat those 'smart people'.
