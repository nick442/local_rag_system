"The fed does charge interest. Like you said, they do give profits to the treasury each year, but not all of their profits are sent back. They also pay dividends to the banks that hold stock in the Fed (I think it is like 7%). But yeah, since the fed does pay the rest back to the Treasury any interest it pays is basically moot. >If you don't already know, this is the modern version of ""printing money"". This is the larger concern. If they are just buying bonds to implement monetary policy that is one thing. However, if they are financing the government debt because foreign investors are strapped for cash or don't want it, that is a bigger problem. I haven't been following closely enough to know if that is an issue here, but it seems treasury bills are in high demand at the moment so I don't think the fed is actually ""financing"" our budget, just keeping rates low (which does create problems but that's a different conversation)."
