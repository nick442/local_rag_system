I write cyber liability sometimes. Most I've ever covered is 1million for a business with a few hundred employees. It cost around $8k a year for that policy. My educated guess is that obtaining anywhere near sufficient cyber liability insurance for a credit bureau would be both cost prohibitive and difficult to find the capacity. Basically they are likely paying this out of pocket.
