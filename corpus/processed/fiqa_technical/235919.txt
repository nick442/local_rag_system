I love graphs, but graphs don't tell stories. Graphs just represent data. The author of this article is looking at graphs that represent significatly different data sets and saying that the poor jobs data is significatly releated to excessive ceo pay. The author also fails to prove a correlation between the two (Showing graphs with different axis and different scales doesn't count). I wish correlation equaled causation, but it doesn't.
