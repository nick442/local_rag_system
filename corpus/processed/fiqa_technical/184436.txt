The fundamental question remains - why was the change so necessary? Google Maps' platform is very open and easy for developers to build upon. I don't see why adding guided turn-by-turn required a complete rehash and rebuild of a maps program. (Not to mention, it doesn't even work on the iPhone 4.) It is that bad, because what was provided before was that good.
