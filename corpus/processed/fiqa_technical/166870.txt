"US currency, today, can be used for useful things like selling a car, but there's nothing stopping you for trading it for something else. On edit; I've been thinking about this, and I think that the problem is that currency exists as a. edium to pay taxes. The usefulness of it for non-governmental transactions is a secondary benefit. However, without them full faith and credit ofma government somewhere the currency would be worthless. For example, see Zimbbwean currency or any non-convertible currency. *extra edit--altogether too many ""m's."""
