"Do you think that publishers haven't thought this through pretty carefully already? You can't *easily* make a thousand copies of a dead-tree book and give it to all your friends, or make it available to millions on the internet. (Possible? Sure. But not without a ton of work and hassle.) Publishers rely on customers buying paper books for their personal consumption, and figure that they might loan the book out once or twice - big deal. They still get paid. Without DRM, publishers would basically be inviting the public at large to steal their e-book product. Marginal costs to copying a ""book file"" are nothing, unlike in the paper comparison, so everyone would do it if they could. Sure, the DRM is easy to hack, but the vast majority of the public isn't going to do that or know how. Just like for video games - the publishers know some folks will do it, but enough don't that it makes the product profitable. DRM is what creates the whole business model for e-books in the first place. By the way, Amazon's DRM doesn't lock you into using the Kindle. The official Kindle app for the iPad works just fine, and I read many books with it."
