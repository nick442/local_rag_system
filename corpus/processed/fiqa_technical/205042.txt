Ownership has everything to do with it. If I created a block-wide lawn mowing service and forced you to pay for it but I mowed your lawn, your objection to buying my service wouldn't make you the bad guy. You'd say that you don't want my lawn mowing service, and even if you did enjoy the lawn after I took your money and mowed it, you could still object to it and want a different method of taking care of your lawn. The same could be said for any other good/service out there.
