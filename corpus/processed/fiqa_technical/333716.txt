IMO we could start with getting rid of protectionism, which would help decrease the prices of goods and services, and thereby increase real wages. You could also lower taxes on the poor and middle class, hopefully giving them more money to pay their bills and afford things like children. Plus, IMO many artistic endeavors are best left as a side-project until there is a glimpse of sustainable income earning from it. But that's just me and I realize many would disagree.
