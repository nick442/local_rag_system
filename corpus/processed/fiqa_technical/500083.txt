This depends on when exactly you want the month back. If you need the money back at the end of 6 months, then option 1 is advisable. It is easy to set-up an Recurring Deposit. If you don't need the money immediately, generally the FD rates are better than RD rates. So creating FD's every month will result in more money. However you would have to ensure that you create this every month, so there is more effort.
