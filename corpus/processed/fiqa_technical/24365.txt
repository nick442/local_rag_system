"Ex-Apple Store employee here. I didn't read the article, but then again I didn't need to. Apple is a great company, blah blah blah. Here's the bottom line: If I sell $15,000 of computers in 6 hours (something that's not so terribly hard to do), I still get paid the same $11.5/hr. Why the fuck should I work harder to sell? Pressure from above. Also they print a list of how much everyone has sold by day, week, month, quarter and YTD. You want to be in the top 5 of that list. Now, I worked there from 2008-2010, so things could be a lot different there now. But I suspect they're not. There's a huge amount of churn, as someone said, and I'd argue that it is entirely to keep happy smiling dumb faces there all the time. The ""Lifers"" are huge tools who suck big ones. I still love Apple. Just glad I don't work for them."
