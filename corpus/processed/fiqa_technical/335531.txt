"there is a problem with grouping them all as ""dismantling"" as many are overgrown and are wasteful. The EPA itself can not get out of it's own way. I worked on one project recently (2 years ago) where we were designing a counterflow cooling tower (huge AC for power plant) for Goose Creek SC where we were going to add another tower so that they could eventually switch to a close loop system (keeps all water in system, no dumping in river). the city of Goose Creek went to court because the EPA made a rule that by a certain date a company could no longer use an open system on a cooling tower if it dumped into a waterway. the city got their wish and they won and the EPA backed off and the town of Goose Creek gets to keep the dirty warm water that was (is) being dumped into the river so that the fishermen would have better catches (no shit, this is how it was and they wanted to keep it) they didn't want to chance losing the warm waters that drew more fish. Well, jokes on the town as we are now building a crossflow tower in that location that will have an open system to dump into the river. here's the catch, before it was to be a counterflow tower where the water must be better quality as the media in the tower could foul and impact the thermal rating of the tower, now they are going with a crossflow type tower and the media on those can accept the worst fucking water you can think of and still perform properly. so now the fishermen will get some nasty water that will be just below the allowable amount set by the EPA so that some lazy people can catch fish easier. that is what I consider a wasteful government program. but that is just my opinion, based on an interaction I had with a project where the EPA stuck there big head where they didnt even know what they were doing."
