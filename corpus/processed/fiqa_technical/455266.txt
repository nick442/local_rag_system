There's an explanation of what that means a few lines farther down that page: It looks like they keep a record of ~600 days of their previous implied volatility calculations, but some symbols might not have that much valid data. So when they report the current IV as a percentile of all those previous IVs, they want you to know exactly how reliable that measurement is. If they only have 30 days of past IV calculations, then the percentile doesn't mean all that much. On the other hand, if they have 600 days of past IV calculations, then the current percentile is pretty significant.
