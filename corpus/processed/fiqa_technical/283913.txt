Id rather have the govt print the money, as stated by the constitution, than private interests in other countries dictate our money system. u know, DEBT FREE govt issued Notes. if u fear govt politicians messing up by creating inflation to get votes, then that's the least of your problem and can be creatively solved. Why not have a life term politician, coming from a successful private business background, be in charge? a politician that can be voted off the position if he's not doing a good job. hmm sounds a lot like a chariman of the fed, yet is elected by the congress. Look at China's central bank, you think the CPC gonna let some private western banker dictate their monetary policy? last i check the Yuan is undervalued. there are many creative ways to go around this problem. I'm not ignorant, you're just lazy.
