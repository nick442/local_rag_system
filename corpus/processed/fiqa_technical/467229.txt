It's an experiment with limitations because they chose 2000 unemployed people. At no point was there any real discussion about giving basic income to also some employed people. It's not really a study on universal income if it's just a simplified and hassle free unemployment benefit. I have hopes that the results would at the minimum encourage the state to redesign the current systems for unemployment benefits, longer term sick leaves, fixed term pensions and minimum social security, but true universal basic income still seems rather impossible in this country.
