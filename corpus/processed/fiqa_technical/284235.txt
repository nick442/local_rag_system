"EVERYONE buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price (no matter who you are). There are a few important things you need to understand. Example: EVE bid: 16.00 EVE ask: 16.25 So if your selling EVE at ""market price"" you are entering an ask equal to the highest bid ($16.00). If you buy EVE at ""market price"" you are entering a bid equal to the lowest ask price ($16.25). Its key to understand this rule: ""An order executes ONLY when both bid and ask meet. (bid = ask)."" So a market maker puts in a bid when he wants to buy but the trade only executes when an ASK price meets his BID price. When you see a quote for a stock it is the price of the last trade. So it is possible to have a quote higher or lower then both the bid and the ask."
