Narratively from the POV of the landlord, the hip retailer ABC offered me a 10 year lease at $1000/month for an empty store front on an empty block. I agreed. ABC attracted a large youth market, so other stores filled in the rest of the block in the intervening decade, which I leased for 1200, 1500, 2000, and finally 4000 per month since the foot traffic and demographic is so strong. It's now year 9. Next year, the lease will likely jump up to the comparable 4000 per square foot. Their margin in this location probably looks great today. But the purpose of the quote is to warn you to check the future.
