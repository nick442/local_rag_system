Aside from everyone else's explanation about bundling them with other mortgages, a buddy of mine who worked at a boutique lending group basically said that they KNOW these people can't pay the loans back and thus the bank will be able to take over ownership of the home. Since **housing prices are guaranteed to go up**, they'll be able to make money once they re-sell the property.
