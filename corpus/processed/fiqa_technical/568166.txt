You could hold a long position in some company XXXX and then short your own shares (assuming your broker will let you do that). The dividend that would have gone to you would then go to whoever is holding the shares you short sold. You just don't get a dividend. If you're going to short in a smart way.. do it on a stock you otherwise believe in, but use it to minimize the pull-backs on the way up.
