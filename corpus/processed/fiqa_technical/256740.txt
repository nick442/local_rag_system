"Does the writer of this have Target stock or something? I'm always amazed when people come to the defense of large corporations. Target would NOT HESITATE to do ANYTHING possible to squeeze every dime, dollar, etc, out of each and every one of their customers. When the customers do it, though, suddenly it's ""looting"", ""stealing"", etc? Fuck that. EDIT: Surprised to see many on Reddit agree."
