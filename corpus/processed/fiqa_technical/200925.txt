The projects are expensive because they are technically challenging. The point is that BART (an existing public transit system) has no money for infrastructure investments because it's spent on employee benefits (gross salary, overtime, and pension benefits). Paying a janitor $100k in any locality is ridiculous and that includes the bay area. A private corporation, such as Facebook doesn't pay their janitors $100k. They contract the labor out to a company who pays $20/hr and they hire another employee instead of paying 1.5x or 2.0x overtime.
