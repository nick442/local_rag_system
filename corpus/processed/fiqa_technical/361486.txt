"I must be part of the lower class then, for I will never have enough resources to incur such taxes. I receive so little (despite making two to three times my salary for my employer) that I qualify for many low-income services. From here, even your ""upper middle class"" are moneyed elite. Any fault in how I sound can be attributed to my lack of skill in expression. After being soundly beaten by the *tetsubo* of a malformed labor market (wielded by an invisible hand, no less) I know intimately its every spike and rivet."
