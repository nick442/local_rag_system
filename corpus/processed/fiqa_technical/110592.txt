I work for myself, thus there is no HR department which will agree to hand over my money to a debt collector. And if you work for yourself you don't have a tax return because you don't give the IRS any more than they are allowed to take. Even if you work for someone else it is easy to adjust your withholdings so that you don't have a tax return to intercept.
