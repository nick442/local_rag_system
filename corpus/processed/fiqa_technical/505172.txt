The answer is mathematics. Let's say you have $100 capital to invest with. With a mortgage: With a unit trust (assuming you don't put in borrowed money): 5% growth on the property is $25, but a $25 profit on a unit trust requires 25% growth. Well, that's assuming zero interest and zero fees. Let's say interest is 3% but so are trust fees. A property now requires 8% growth for $25 profit in a year, where a unit trust now requires 29% growth for $25 profit. Which one is more likely? The above calculations don't take in to consideration all associated costs and is obviously exaggerated but it shows the answer is not black and white but is instead just mathematics on a bunch of variables. Debt isn't a bad thing so don't be afraid of using debt. With debt you can borrow more to invest. Having a fully paid off house is not a good investment if some of that equity could be earning you more else where (if the math makes sense).
