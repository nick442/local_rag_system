Well I found out the hard way one way Best Buy might not be getting enough business: they don't open until 1000. Other stores in my area open either 0800 or 0900. Granted Best Buy may have other problems, but now I don't even think of them when I need an item that morning for a job (electronic installations) because of those hours.
