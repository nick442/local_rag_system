Yeah there's a lot to talk about with basic income. Like how currently there is an incentive to not work harder or move up the socio-economic ladder because as you earn more your welfare benefits go away. So people think it's not worth getting a better job because they will pay more in taxes and lose benefits but now they are working harder and not getting more for it. A basic income wouldn't go away with that sweet new job promotion. Therefore there is an incentive to work more. I like the basic income idea. But I wonder about how to handle immigration and global relations. You will have it in some countries where others are like literally falling apart. Basically we have a long way to go until we are comfortably collecting our BI checks. At least in the US.
