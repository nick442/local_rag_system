As part of the cost benefit analysis, I would consider that the collections agency has often paid pennies on the dollar, so you can negotiate a lower amount if the bill is legitimate. That may make paying the debt more attractive than fighting. If the bill is illegitimate then you would mainly consider what legal means they have to attempt to collect. If they can put a lien on your property then you may want to settle it and avoid the hassle. If all they can do legally is keep calling you and asking for the money, they may give up if you tell them that you have no intention of paying because you don't believe you owe anything and you look forward to telling them the same thing tomorrow, next week, and next year (followed by a change of subject--ask some personal questions and go into a discussion of the weather, etc.). Whether they give up will depend on how strong they think their legal position is.
