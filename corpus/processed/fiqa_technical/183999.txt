"Be wary of pump and dump schemes. This scheme works like this: When you observe that ""From time to time the action explodes with 100 or 200% gains and volumes exceeding one million and it then back down to $ 0.02"", it appears that this scheme was performed repeatedly on this stock. When you see a company with a very, very low stock price which claims to have a very bright future, you should ask yourself why the stock is so low. There are professional stock brokers who have access to the same information you have, and much more. So why don't they buy that stock? Likely because they realize that the claims about the company are greatly exaggerated or even completely made up."
