> The stock market measures individual companies' ups and downs, right? Not precisely, no. If anything it measures.. 1. Information 2. Risk and Riskiness 3.

It'd also be subject to caps and floors, unlike the market which is only floored (at 0). > I don't know if anyone could come up with a kind of standardised measurement we could use to do this. It'd be impossible. Happiness is subjective *and* relative. Getting a million bucks might make me happy, but Bill Gates bored. Having a child can be conflicting intensely. The death of a loved one could be both sad and a relief.
