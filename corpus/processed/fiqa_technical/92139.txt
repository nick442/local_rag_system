I don't think this is always true, it really depends on the quantities you're looking for and the markets you're in. Sounds like this guy is dabbling in many markets trying to find out the good niches, therefore he's not going all in on anything. In the article he addresses the fact that some of these shops will sometimes have more orders/connections and therefore more leverage than you might if going directly to the manufacturer. I also wouldn't be surprised at all if many manufacturers, especially the uber-cheap ones, don't feel comfortable talking directly to westerners.. their expertise is making stuff cheap, not in communications.
