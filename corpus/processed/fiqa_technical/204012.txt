"Sure, and I made it clear in my post that I'm willing to accept that I may be wrong. But the author does a poor job of arguing his point, his argument in the article is based on an unsubstantiated claim that a certain activity is bad. He says it ""impairs price performance"" but offers no proof that this occurs. Now granted, I haven't had a chance to look at the data either, but as myself and other posters have mentioned, this claim is quite debatable. I need a bit more material to be convinced."
