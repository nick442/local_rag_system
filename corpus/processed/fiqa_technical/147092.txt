All the comments seem to accept the slap on the wrist and move along. The law obviously exists for a reason. If we are allowing it, then why the law? What makes them exempt? First few times, get fined. Anything after, LARGE fines (6+ figures). If you do it again, obviously you don't know how to follow the rules. Lose your license. Honestly, why condone this and other behavior?
