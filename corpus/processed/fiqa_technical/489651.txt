Watch this film, as well as going through what they did it is simply a rather excellent documentary and one of those ones worth watching even if you have no interest in the subject. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron:_The_Smartest_Guys_in_the_Room The metaphor also forget to mention that you manage to stage a milk shortage, to put up prices despite making almost twice as much milk as there is demand for by illegal market manipulation on a massive scale. Enron and what they did is a good example of just why privatisation/deregulation of vital infrastructure has to be done very very carefully and isnt a magic panacea and can be the opposite.
