"This is trash. No way Willy and Markus did that to bitcoin. It's called trading. Of course they were actively trading during a giant volatile bubble in which bitcoin jumped 1000s% just as 10000s of other people were. Mt. Gox is credited with popping the 2013 bubble not inflating it. Even though Mt. Gox got hacked and ddos'd all the time there is no way bitcoins price was manipulated that much by ""Willy"" and ""Markus"" as a result."
