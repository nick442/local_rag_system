"I grew up when eBay started long before Amazon. For the past 20 years, eBay has been a total ""no-option"" service. The amount of fraud has been out of control for two decades. If you can't afford something, just don't buy that item. Buy something lesser. Going on eBay for something cheap will burn you every time. This has been common sense for twenty years. It's garbage and it profits off bad transactions. Just drop it altogether as a service and align your wants to your means."
