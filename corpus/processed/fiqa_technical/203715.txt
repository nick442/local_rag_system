Unfortunately that's the most recent full report on things I know of, it was published in December. The current stats can be found elsewhere online. Currently Instagram is surging and has been since March, it's now bigger than Twitter. Also I believe those stats in the report are based off people who use the network at least once a day. This would include Messenger. I'm a social media marketer and consultant. The irony is like you I primarily use Facebook as a way to talk to people, I do participate in some groups but other than that I actually have my news feed blocked. Twitter is a massive time suck to market on, and not my favorite so I just automated that. Instagram is currently my favorite social media site and I think many Millennials would agree with that. People are highly visual, so it makes sense Instagram is surging. That and there's a lot less drama and bullshit on Instagram in my experience.
