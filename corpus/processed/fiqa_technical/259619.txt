I know folks who have had two personal (chap. 7 both times) bankruptcies in the U.S., including one after the bankruptcy reforms of a few years ago. I did have the 10-year thing wrong, though. It's once every eight years for a chap. 7 liquidation, and once every six years for Chap. 13 restructuring.
