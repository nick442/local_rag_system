Well first, this is a very small proportion of teslas that can do this, it was only one model that is discontinued and was a cheaper alternative to the 75. Any person who bought that car knows that they can upgrade to the 75 at any time by paying the difference. They did this so more people have access to a Tesla and just didn't design a whole new battery to reach some people. This is not bad at all, you get what you pay for and it's the same thing as just buying a smaller battery. If it was only 60 kWh you couldn't unlock it for emergencies, so it's an added bonus, not a bad thing.
