"90% of what you need to know about diversity and racism was taught to my son in 2nd grade. > My college education included a class on diversity laws in the us and the state i live. So tell, me: what did that class teach you that you did not know? I am asking, because maybe I can learn something that you know, but my son or me may not know. > I evaluated how businesses predominantly focused on a market can effectively adjust their businesses plans to new markets. This is taught in marketing and business classes. Even before the 1960s everyone was taught or knew that you can make money off minorities and niche groups because of their needs. > I could go on but i think you get my point. No, I did not get your point. Please tell me about something you learned purely about ""diversity"". **Not about how to take advantage of diversity for economic and POLITICAL gains!** Do you understand what I mean with the last thing I said? Think about it first."
