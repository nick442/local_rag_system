> They still lead the industry in the move to driverless taxis, which is what their entire model is based on. The first company to really nail driverless is who will own that space. They aren't leading there in the tech, they just have a large customer network ready to plug a solution into. If a big company who can afford to spend $$$ to build their customer network gets to fully functional levels of driverless first, they are in trouble.
