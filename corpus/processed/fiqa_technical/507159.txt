You are a fucking moron. Do you really think India is stupid enough to let some franchisees openly steal McDonalds brand and run restaurants without the HQ engagement? McDs usually are in major metros with high incomes and high levels of visibility. Indian government can't afford to let a foreign brand be stolen in broad day light and there has never been an instance such a brand store is stolen EVER. Advice from someone who lived in US for 20 and in India for 22 years - go visit India. For the most part, there is some levels of law and order - especially to foreign companies.
