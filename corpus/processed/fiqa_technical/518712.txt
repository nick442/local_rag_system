I too live in Europe. being that you live in Europe you must also be aware of the vastly more generous labor laws than in the US. yet you would have the audacity insinuate that such laws are causing such social and economic upheaval. You should ALWAYS care about the well being of your employees. when you need them to perform the job well, they will certainly remember that time you fucked them over when their kid broke their leg. or their mental health declined as you refused to give time off for bereavement. all of those things impact how said role is performed. if you cannot manage the fact that other people have personal lives you have no business as a manager. and i know this might come as a shock. but bear with me. when people are paid more..they can afford to by more things. that drives...the economy (unless your sole target demographic are the wealthy.). how anyone could be so short sighted to do otherwise is simply beyond reason. ^ see a few examples of risks listed above. overworked employees fuck up more. thats a risk. disgruntled employees are a risk. underpaid workers are a risk. strong labor laws ensure employers don't become unruly, greedy slapdicks.
