I'm generally very fiscally cautious. Social safety net run by the government often turn into financial messes. I'm all in favor of a UBI as a complete replacement of all non-medical welfare. In order to start voting for people that support it though, I'd have to be convinced we're not looking at Social Security 2.0 and that we're not going to be trying to add additional programs 10 years from now.
