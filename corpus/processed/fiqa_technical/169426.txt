"Something about artificially limiting the supply of taxicabs via the medallion system always rubbed me the wrong way, and so this makes me smile a little. I figure, set the standards for taxicabs and then let anyone who wants to be a cabbie purchase a license from the city for a reasonable fee, and then let the market sort everything else out. In this case, Uber and Lyft seem to be ""the market"", finally sorting things out."
