The hard work of working class men and women is what has made modern industry and business possible. Unions are legal so forming one isn't going against the rule of law, and if they weren't we would of never have gotten the things we enjoy today as workers like the 8 hour day and the ban on child labor. People are not willing to be relegated to the status of serfs and will retaliate, within the legal system if they can but if they can't desperate people have been known to resort to incredible measures.
