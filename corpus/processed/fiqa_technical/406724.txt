I miss the old true libertarian Reddit. I could always rely on Reddit being the first place to find news that wasn't being reported anywhere else. When the various parties started trying to generate fake accounts to sway the conversation, Reddit lost it's authenticity. And I would never expect news to break here any more. Some mod would bury it.
