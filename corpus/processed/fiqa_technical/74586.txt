"Compare the first part of the statement, ""constant growth can only make most of us poorer"" with what is supposed to be evidence of that (ridiculous) claim. Just because people are worse off (which isn't actually true if you aren't measuring things only in money) doesn't mean it *has to* work that way. This is such a short run analysis and it is just so ridiculous my head is seriously about to explode. Why not say, ""Since 1914 we have had consistent growth and everyone is better off for it"". I hope that people this stupid never get any sort of political power because they are truly the destroyer of things."
