It's stupid things like this, which unions often do, really piss me off. They have this wonderful opportunity to fight for worker's rights and help keep them earning a livable wage.. but what do they do? Fuck it up by doing things like this. I think unions are great in idea. But when they do this, I can't help but to get quite peeved.
