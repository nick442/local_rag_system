As a developer in a former life, I would not even get out of bed for $50 an hour. My normal charge out rate for ANY computer work at all is $100/hour + 15% tax. Don't want to pay that much? Find someone else. I never ever had anyone ever try to negotiate a deal, and I only ever worked on an hourly basis. And only when it suited me. I struggle to understand how anyone could ever accept any kind of coding job for $15 an hour - *even if they lived in India*.
