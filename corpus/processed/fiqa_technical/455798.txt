"Really? Because at Tier 5 for electricity I'm paying 35 cents a killowatt hour. And at $1 per watt for a panel, and 5 hours of sunlight per day in California, that's 142 days for pay back (grid tie). It seems like Solar panels are cheaper for the ""peak load"" issues. i.e. when the sun is hottest and people are running their AC's the highest, then the solar panels are kicking in (Grid tie). But using a battery to operate off grid doesn't seem feasible currently. And using solar panels to generate non-peak electricity doesn't seem efficient either."
