> Upfront investment cost to create a contemporary business is challenging today, and this is before a firm anticipation of the cost of labour declining in developed nations. Yes, today. But I think part of this future is where these costs come down due to advanced technology. Look at 3D printing as an example. It's new and expensive now, but when these things are $99 at staples and capable of printing high quality plastic parts, you essentially give every single person the ability to buy a cheap factory for his home. This helps greatly distribute and decentralize the means of production, and possibly even get around copyright and I.P. with open-source repositories like Thingiverse. This is how I see the future in the world described in the video. Cheap, advanced technology that replaces human labor. When the cost of a labor robot is in the price range of 90% of the public, you won't have to work. Every human will have robots working on their behalf. I think the video warns of a future where these robots exist, but they're only owned by the rich. I think that's the wrong prediction. That isn't how technology works. They even go over that in the video. How computers every year get cheaper and more powerful. Same goes with 3D printing; they get more powerful and cheaper by the day. Same will go for labor robots. So it's not that every person is going to have to operate their own small business (though it will probably increase entrepreneurship, which is a great thing), it just means that each individual will have the means to produce without actually laboring.
