"The shortage is of capable people willing to work for peanuts. I am in the tech industry, but my schooling is in electrical engineering. It was always, and remains my belief, that IT degrees are bullshit. You can teach someone to recite the manual, rattle off specifications, memorize protocols, and even to calculate design equations in telecom inside his head, but you can't teach someone to actually implement those things. You can teach information, but that won't give someone who doesn't naturally have the right thought processes and mental organization, to do the actual work. I started an IT business during high school, which I am sure isn't too uncommon in the Reddit community. I've had people think they were ""hooking me up"" or doing me a favor by offering me some $50000-60000 per year job working full time as staff IT for a company. I don't generally tell people how insulting the offer is, or how I made almost that during my last year of high school. There is no way I would consider taking a job that paid less than $125000 per year. Even that would be contingent on there being enough time left for me to continue running my other businesses even if I had to hire employees to do more of the work than I have them doing now. There are also a lot of complete idiots who somehow tend to easily get jobs in the field, which seriously lowers prospective employers' opinions of what they will probably get when they hire someone. It's a huge headache with these bozos constantly giving my industry a black eye."
