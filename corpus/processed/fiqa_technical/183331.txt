"Economics is not hard science. Economics is really just a study of what people do and why. The best book to read to understand why people protect their wealth when the government threatens it is ""[Human Action](http://mises.org/document/3250)"" by Ludwig von Mises. Check it out. It will answer all of your questions with a lot more logic than research. Economic research on macro subjects can prove any preconceived theorem, therefore it is worse than logic because it purports to ""prove"" what are, in the end, only opinions."
