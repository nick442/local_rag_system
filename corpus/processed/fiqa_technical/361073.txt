"The whole story of ""Pamela Shea"" is so light on facts that it makes it hard for me to see what happened to her as example of a problem, let alone a tragedy. What kind of weird house purchase involves the forfeiture of the down payment in the event you can't get financing? Yes, there is money you commit when you make an offer on a house that is non-refundable, but it's less than 1% of the value - it's not the ""down payment"". And if the life savings of a woman with a ""six-figure income"" are less than 1% of the cost of the home she's buying, then I'd say she's not ready to buy a home, or she needs to look at less expensive property."
