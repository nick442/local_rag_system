What a load of bullshit. To make the assertion that government, in its natural role as a the defacto non-private advocate for its citizens, should not provide a public health solution is mind-bogglingly myopic. The idea is that society (and therefore the economy we use to measure it) as a whole improves with the healthcare of the individuals that make it up. Why is that so difficult for the conservative mind to grasp?
