So my idea is to open small hummus place with open island kitchen. You can eat inside or take away. I also now places were i could deliver my product like a cafe/pubs. Really simple idea but i am little bit scared of telling details. you can eat different types of hummus with fresh bread and vegetables. Also in the morning i am planing to making tortillas with hummus, fresh salad and meat inside for take away. But my problem is a money for start.
