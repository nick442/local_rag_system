>Thank you very much for your reply. > >I'll look more into the CFA but I have a question - does it require an undergrad degree in finance/accounting to become licensed if you pass? Obviously that's an area that I need to do more research but a great place to start based on your suggestions. No, you do not need anything but to be in your fourth year or graduate from any undergraduate program. It's a three test process (Level 1/2/3) and it will take you years to become a chartholder. People recommend 4-6 months of study for level one, it is quite difficult. More information on r/CFA, or CFAI's website. >If I take it in December I'll be 5 months from my masters. In that case it makes more sense to complete the masters because quitting that close to the end really throws a lot away. I know counseling isn't specific to the field, but people skills seem to be the cornerstone of every career. I don't know enough about counselling to really advise you, nor do I really know about the hiring process or decision criteria. You can ask on wallstreetoasis (WSO) > I'm more interested in a career that is not as emotionally taxing Uhhh, I don't know about that, but I really don't know anything about counselling. Can you tell me what a day in the life of a counsellor is like and how you see the career and challenges faced in the industry or by people in your current/future positions?
