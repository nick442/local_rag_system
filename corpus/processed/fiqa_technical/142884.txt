You're not wrong, and I was somewhat disappointed by how the case played out. But what I was getting at was that maybe it's posted here because of the case's context. I heard on the news he was charged with 8 things but only convicted of 3. I can't say I know what the other 5 were. (I'd look them up but can't right now because of circumstances) I might be on a wild goose chase there but I want to find out later.
