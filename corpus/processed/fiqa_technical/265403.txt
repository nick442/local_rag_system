You can get the number you want pretty easily by plugging some numbers in to a mortgage calculator like this one. Set the PMI and property tax to 0 and set your term to the duration you need. Then plug in numbers until your payment amount equals your monthly budget. Think of yourself as the bank in this process. I started at 1mil over 25 years and that was over my budget so went down to 800k which was under just a bit, and found that you need about 850k based on your numbers.
