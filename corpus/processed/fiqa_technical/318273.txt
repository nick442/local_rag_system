(I've not read through all comments so please hold the criticism if this is covered already.) The problem here is that I know nothing about your market and neither do you. The most common issue with small businesses and managing advertising budgets is that specific thing. Recommendations here in the comments tend to focus on xyz that every other business under the sun does. Problem here is they cost money and you know nothing about your target market. So long story short think of stuff that costs little but will grabs a lot of attention. First thing print the following onto your truck' I got that b**ch a plunger. B**ches love bringing up old shit'. PM me if you want more.
