Depends on what you mean by communism. Also whether or not a basic income is viable is another question. I'm not trying to say I know all the answers, but I've thought a lot about the future. Some worry that a basic income would basically make the masses slaves in a way because it wouldn't solve income inequality, it would make people dependent on a government hand out. Another option is to disperse labor. Instead of working 40 hours a week, they work 30, 20, or less. But this solution might only be temporary until humans are simply not cost effective. The question will be, why are we working and why create machines? To alleviate human labor and serve human life? Or to extract as much as possible from Earth regardless of human life, to horde a big pile of resources regardless of whether or not humans exist to use them.
