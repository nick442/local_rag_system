"Not so much the money. The *productivity* has been spread around. Productivity used to be the sole province of the ""first world"" nations. Then things like CAD/CAM made is possible to produce almost anything anywhere. 250 million middle class Chinese people didn't just happen because a trillion dollars were airlifted into Beijing. It happened because whole industries collapsed in the first world and moved to China. On aggregate people are better off, on aggregate. But if you're in, say, textiles in the US then it looks like a really shitty deal. So ""money"" didn't go away. Commerce didn't evaporate. Production (and resulting productivity) moved and spread out with some areas getting hurt and others gaining."
