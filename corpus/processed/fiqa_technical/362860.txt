Sure, they can still vacation in the US. However working in the US requires a seperate visa than a vacation visa which requires that they pay taxes on income earned within the US etc. I'm fairly certain using complicated intelectual property tax tricks to avoid paying any taxes in the US might be a violation of that visa. Actually, why can't I owe myself a large amount of money in another country that I'm paying myself back slowly thus zeroing my taxable income?
