">Are you being paid by the word? I'm not religious. I think the bible is full of fairy tales. So no! I just don't like being stolen from and having it whitewashed as ""the ends justify the means"". Which is crap. Theft is theft no matter who does it for you. A badge or costume does not change that fact. Your rights end where someone else's rights begin. If your ""solution"" requires theft and violence to pay for it, it isn't much of a ""solution"" then."
