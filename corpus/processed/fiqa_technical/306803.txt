"Value is entirely subjective to individuals. Nothing has ""intrinsic value"". So if humans put a lot of work into polishing a turd, it's still worthless. But if you put half that much work into preparing a meal or building a car, your labor is actually ""productive"" because it is meeting a consumer's demand. This is how ""productive work"" is defined in economics (at least the Austrian branch) - people are willing to voluntarily trade for the product of your labor."
