Hey there..You asked me earlier to take a look at this.I will send you later, when I get home a small plan that helped me a lot when I opened my bar, with a lot of nice things that you should be careful..And tbh I don't think a degree is that important.They will teach you how to manage a business in general, you will only use just a small percent from that knowledge..You can learn a lot of things strictly for managing a bar/restaurant by yourself, from books and internet..For me experience was very important (I was a bartender for 4 years, my brother was a waiter)..In 4 years we learned almost everything that we needed.The taxes should be made by an accountant (Here in Europe every company needs an accountant, this is the law.) Where do you live and what age are you ?
