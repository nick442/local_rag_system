No it's not expensive sets - they are rare and there are tons of cheaper ones. I think technically it's cheaper than historically. No it's not mine craft - that has been around for years already and they obvs actually make money off it. I personally think it's saturation - 5 years of double digit growth and it's a durable product - people have already bought a ton of lego and expanding distribution will eventually run out of steam
