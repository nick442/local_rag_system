"I work in IT. India has been allowed to increasingly INVADE us IT policy (adopting VULNERABLE policies) over the recent decades (slowly) due to PREJUDICE about their superiority/affability (even though their native society is predatory and the word ""thug"" originates from THEM!). This is how you LOSE your control. The part ""they"" don't understand is coming SOON. I see them daily. I know them. I want to thwart this criminal activity. I never liked war before. Now I understand where it comes from (idealogically). It comes from covert foreign attack. Let's nuke India! Twice! Look at how ugly looking they are! They look dirty. They should stay in their own disgusting native cesspool, or pay the price! They are NOT as mass media portrays them! We will send all of their supporters to India with them! YAY!"
