"A withdrawal from an IRA has a 60 day period during which time you may roll it over to another IRA, effectively ""borrowing"" and returning the money. Once that time has passed, the transaction is complete. Your question asks in one place about deposit, then withdrawal. You might edit to clarify the timing of your situation and your intentions."
