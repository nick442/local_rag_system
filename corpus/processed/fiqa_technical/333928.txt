"Apparently with all your advanced knowledge you have no idea what ""former"" means, but thanks, I have no desire to return to my 2010-2012 habits. Once again, your dickbag, condescending remark is so off the mark, and it's incredibly ironic you are telling others ""not to be a dick"" when you are the biggest cockhead in this fucking thread. I mean BY GOLLY just simply don't take pain pills and don't get addicted, WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T ANYONE THINK OF THAT?? You fucking moron. If only you knew how many people in YOUR life are addicted to prescription opiods that you have no idea about. By the way, fuckface, I got addicted after having eye and lung surgerty and having an IV dilaudid drip. Glad you wisdom teeth percs didn't get you addicted though! Fuck yourself, you judgemental prick"
