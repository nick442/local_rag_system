>IOW, everyone is perfectly free to instantaneously decide that a dollar is worth only 1/1,000,000,000th of an orange, and oranges would instantly cost a billion dollars. Oranges cost less than that not because the government sets the price of oranges, but purely because that's what the market agrees to. This shows a profound misunderstanding of how fiat currencies work. The demand for fiat currencies comes from the fact they are necessary to pay taxes and debts. Other currencies/commodities will not be recognized as settlement of debts in court disputes, so they would first need to be sold onto the market in exchange for the fiat currency. Individuals can't simply *decide* what the relative value of certain goods and services are. The market does that, collectively via voluntary trade. >I'm explaining internal combustion for a 5-year-old, and you're calling it inaccurate and misleading because it doesn't address the sociological implications of American car-culture. Hahah, you're confusing the oil for the gasoline!
