Different goals, so different press release styles. People don't really associate Microsoft with hardware, so they need to establish themselves as a player in this market, where Apple was already set to get right into what their latest device does. I wish them both success.. The market is easily big enough for both, and competition benefits us as consumers. Surface looks cool, and is something I've wanted in the past (minus Windows 8), but if I got one, I'd still keep my iPad.
