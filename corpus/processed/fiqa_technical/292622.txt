In my experience, there are two types of redditors. Reddit is mostly those who just vote & move on - they vote up the sensational headlines, the memes, the images, etc. Then reddit has those who comment in non-default subs - they're the ones in the comment sections of those posts complaining about what a crappy post it is. The first group seems to have a big = bad business mentality, the other group seems more nuanced.
