They make a killing. In Queensland, a state of Australia, they only have one Distributor, Energex, so there is no competition. All power comes from them. As such, the prices are ridiculously high since retailers can't afford to sell it any cheaper than what they bought it for. This company Energex has employees that casually take 3 hour lunch breaks and still earn over 100k a year and they are not even execs. Meanwhile the consumers in that state are going broke from the energy prices.
