"So my understanding is that Google is prioritizing it's own comparison shopping services at the expense of others since it is acting essentially as the ""gateway to the internet"" in the EU. Some people say this is like Coke being forced to put Pepsi in its machines but I don't see it that way. I see it as Google unfairly giving its own services priority in Google Search Listings when the algorithm they use should be non-biased. Overall, a very interesting decision which could have great ramifications in the US"
