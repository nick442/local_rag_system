This is why I've come into the view that most companies should be worker co-ops. There are a few key sectors of the economy like health care and banking that probably shouldn't have a profit motive to them. Turn everything else into worker co-ops. That way you, as the workers, do earn that money through your own blood sweat and tears with the added benefits of not having a CEO that makes over 300x as much as you while doing away with wage slavery. Its strange that we say we value democracy in our society, except in our companies which look more like serfdom.
