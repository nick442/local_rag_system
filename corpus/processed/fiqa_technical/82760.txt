Not to mention, people only shop at Walmart because they have to. Whether it's small budgets or quite literally no other choices in town, most people don't like Walmart but shop there anyway. It has a bad reputation for many things. They often have lower quality versions of the same products available elsewhere because they bully suppliers into lowering prices. They also steal products to be marketed under their Great Value brand. They bleed local economies by underpaying employees and offering no benefits. And, they are seen as the low class option compared to other stores like Target. If there was another option, people would take it. As soon as Amazon perfects the shipping system, Walmart will be a thing of the past. Sam's Club might still have a shot, though Costco seems to be edging them out too.
