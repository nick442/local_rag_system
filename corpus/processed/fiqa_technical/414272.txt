Interesting, that makes some sense. With Planet Fitness, my understanding is that their cost structure is slanted towards fixed costs. Whether their members come to the gym or not doesn't matter; they still have to pay rent, labor, utilities, buy equipment, etc. Those costs don't change much if people subscribe and don't show up vs. subscribe and do show up. Moviepass seems to be almost entirely variable; their costs are buying movie tickets when people order. They would love it if people signed up and never used it, but unlike PF if people DID use it they'd be completely screwed. It's a risky plan, but it just might work as long as people don't figure out a way to game the system (or, you know, turn out to be movie buffs).
