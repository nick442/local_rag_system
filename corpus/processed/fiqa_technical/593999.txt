Today’s up and coming tech companies are taking value from the existing companies so I believe there can be a net loss. Also, efficiency gains are going to a smaller portion of the population, and if they don’t increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the spending of those who are falling behind, then that might cause a decrease in economic activity. Of course, there are a lot more up and coming people in the word too, so they could very well outnumber those in the US/Western Europe regions.
