so you have any LEGAL experience to back that up? Yeah I do get there are exceptions to the rule, like minister, however the christian plumber. i think you are full of it. There is no need, or relgious basis you can use on why you had to hire only religious plumbers. WIth a priest it is obvious. OF COURSE You can discriminate when the person you are hiring cant do the job. An atheist minister couldnt do the job. An athiest plumber can. A Guy with no arms cant toss pizza dough. You can not hire him and say it is due to his handicap. I need someone to throw pizza dough. You have to prove they cant do the job you need them for in order to LEGALLY discriminate.
