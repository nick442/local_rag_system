"Yes, you can certainly keep it in a savings account until you spend it. You'll get much less interest than you will be paying on the loan, but it will be better than nothing. However, you may want to ask if you can use the loan flexibly instead - i.e. only ""draw down"" the money you need when you need it, and not start paying interest until that happens. That would save you a lot more money. Note that the ISA limit is currently Â£5,760 and the limit is on total deposits so you won't be able to reuse the amount later in the tax year. Since that ends on April 5th that probably won't be an issue for you."
