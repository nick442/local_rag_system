"> but the invasion of Iraq was, by definition, a military venture intended to overthrow their leader and change the regime. No, it was a government venture using the military as a tool. But even if it were a military venture, you would be right - the invasion was, not the occupation and attempt to stabilize/rebuild. That was a joint venture. >The US military acts for the US government, as do other departments and to muddle the question by listing departments is to miss the point – which is privatization of government functions, be they military or just involved in military ventures. Painting the construction of a school, built by Iraqi contractors, directed by the State Department, and funded through USAID as a ""military venture"" is absurd. >If the contractors weren’t really required but were hired anyway….I don’t know how that’s defended. Of course that occurred. The government is incredibly wasteful. An example that actually involved security contractors is the one I already gave. 10 Ugandans to stand around a checkpoint (1 or 2 of them lazily checking the drivers credentials or slowly walking around the vehicle pretending they know what they are looking for), another 2 to standby for whatever, and the last 6-7 to literally do nothing. The same job can be done by 2 U.S. personnel. So you have +8 bodies, +192 manhours per day, but you have a net cost decrease. That's why it was done, and that's why the total personnel count in and of itself does not tell much of a story."
