"as someone that works in finance, i will say it is really hard to get out of the sales web, regardless of where you are. i don't want to discourage you, but you will need to get advanced degrees/certification to get into analysis or fund management. there are plenty of broker/service roles available at large broker-dealers, but you will take a pay cut and likely only advance to your current pay in those roles. and you will still have some ""soft"" sales responsibilities. all that being said, if you want to go this route, go for it - and the sooner the better. if you are smart and hardworking, you can wrap up your bachelors in 2 years and then go for the CFA over the next 3. you'll need some luck to do the CFA in that amount of time (as there are 3 levels that take a minimum of 1 year each to complete), but you could potentially have some traction in 5-6 years. so it would be difficult, but achievable. the CFA will qualify you for some corporate finance roles as well. i have some friends that were hired to these positions after only passing the first or second levels of CFA, but i believe they had accounting/finance background already. i think that, regardless of your intermediate term plan, getting a bachelors is a great next move. it's a minimum in a growing number of financial roles. you can also look at getting the CFP, which is less demanding and quicker, but it will remove you less from the sales process. (you need a bachelors to qualify for the CFP, too)"
