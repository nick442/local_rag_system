Thanks for the detailed reply. One thing that makes me furious is that whenever something screws up in other sectors (such as contaminated drugs, or a residential tower catching on fire), we always take necessary steps to prevent it from happening again. But for the financial sector, when they screw up there's this careless hand waving: Sorry, nothing could've prevented this.. nothing can be done.. perfect storm.. market forces.. those subprime mortgagors should've paid up.. Like, seriously? We're just supposed to sit back and let it happen again and again? I never borrowed a cent from any bank in my life, yet I still got royally screwed by the recession in terms of where I am in my professional career. This goes for millions of other people too. Something needs to be done. Of course every regulation has its drawback, but as long as the benefit outweighs the detriment, I'm absolutely for it.
