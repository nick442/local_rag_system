Does anyone actually read his stuff. I never bothered with his Valeant presentation, which is supposedly wrong, but his recent stuff is absolute garbage. If anyone actually followed those stocks his writing is laughable. I'm not sure if he purposely misconstrues financials to illustrate a narrative or is actually stupid. Probably the former, but that doesn't make him hero.
