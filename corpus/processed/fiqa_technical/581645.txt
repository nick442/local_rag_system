No. It's not. It's lots of changed interface items that require lots of learning for the users (who are often sketchy, at best, with their familiarity in setting up and using computers), which is frustrating when said users are faced with deadlines that must be met. The original release of Windows 8 was buggy as hell, proving unreliable and untrustworthy for those who actually had to get things done. Many of these users couldn't figure out how to upgrade to 8.1, and I've dealt with several such users whose update actually failed when attempted. I'm not saying this cannot be salvaged. I'm saying it's not remotely worth the pain--as a user--of switching/upgrading from Windows 7.
