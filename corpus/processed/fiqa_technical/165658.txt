You are confusing two things. One is the business side and the other is the social safety net. I believe very strongly in a social safety net. I do not believe in a business safety net. If you don't want progress then have central planning. Let the central planners work out how much to make of everything and direct employers on how many people to employ. There won't be any overt creative destruction. There will however be a significant decrease in prosperity. It is like getting a lower rate of interest - doesn't seem to be so bad in the short term, but really bites in the long term.
