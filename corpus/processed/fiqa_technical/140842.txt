> While I'm talking to an Estonian, how's Estonia doing these days? The current party in power is having a financing scandal. Allegedly one of their current ministers organised money laundering schemes while being the secretary of the party years ago, but it goes a lot deeper than that, he's refusing to step down, and an investigation into this by the state prosecutor was shut down due to lack of evidence. The guy is the minister of justice, so the state prosecutor actually answers to him directly. At times it feels like we're living in god damn India or something.
