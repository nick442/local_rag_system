Yeah it's not that uncommon to work at least in large part for stock options for start ups. They literally have people who invest large sums of money in them just for stocks (very frequently they use venture capitalists or angel investors for capital), same line of reasoning can apply to writing some code. The OP dude reacted (and acted) really poorly and the programmer acted pretty reasonably though.
