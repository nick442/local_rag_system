From a business point of view, I agree. From the customer's point of view, I don't because 1) some smaller businesses do care about BBB status even if it means nothing on a legal front and 2) it creates a digital paper trail if it comes up in small claims. On point 2, it shows that you attempted to solve the problem before taking it up to the courts and it documents your complaint better since it was closer to the time of the conflict between you and the business.
