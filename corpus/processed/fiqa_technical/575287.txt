Recycled toner cartridges spill excess toner all over the insides of printers, causing higher maintenance costs and shorter life spans for other consumable components, such as the fuser. The reason this occurs is that the drum assembly has a conductive coating on it that wears out after the cartridge's service life. Once that coating is weakened or removed, it can no longer keep excess toner from spilling out. I'd say a good 95% of recycled toners are just drill and fill, so the old drum remains unchanged. Even changing the drum doesn't work all the time. HP uses a special coating on their drums, which isn't replicated when an aftermarket drum is used.
