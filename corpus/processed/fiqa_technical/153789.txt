"The way they are tricking you is that they will ask you to send some of the proceeds of the check back to them, after you deposit it in your bank account. So, lets say they send you a $2000 check. You deposit it, send them $500 over western union. And then the bank pulls all $2000 out of your account (the value of the check), leaves you with a negative $500 balances and freezes your account because it took them 3 days to figure out the check was bad. You'll also be in trouble with several authorities. (Whether you send the actual fraudsters money or not) The people that ""enlightened you"" made some money. They get away with it because you don't know their name or anything, the check was written in your name, which is the main paper trail. There is no temp agency."
