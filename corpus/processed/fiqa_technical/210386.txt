Are you very certain that your regular investments will produce >10% above and beyond what can be created from your 401(k) plan? Unless you have a monumentally terrible selection of funds with massive fees you would need to be a truly exceptional investment genius to consistently beat the 10% penalty hurdle. Also, losing the tax-deferred growth for your money is a large additional hurdle meaning that your investment skill would have to be near Warren Buffet levels to just break even. That 10% + tax-deferral is easy free money just like the 50% match. Wait for a few years until you switch jobs and roll the money into an IRA and you will have full control and a lot more money. Taking the penalty is a bad idea.
