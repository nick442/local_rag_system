>During WWII the US government socialized many factories to support the war effort. They took statistics nerds and gave them factories to run. After the war the nerds were offered jobs in the census. Some of them went to other countries to help rebuild instead. There are statues to some of them because they helped Japan become a leading economy in relatively short order. China is full of nerds. Their maths olympiad's teams are now all but totally dominant and they are kicking the asses of developed countries in PISA tests. My father was a physics professor - whenever he speaks to colleagues in the states they all tell him their best new talent is from the PRC. >China doesn't have that focus. They succeed out of sheer numbers. Not by refining process. That would require investing in their workforce too much and cheep disposable labor is the way they compete. I guess that's why they send so many of their best and brightest overseas to study, or why spending such a huge amount of money on education domestically?
