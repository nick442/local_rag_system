Competing against other groups and against computers. In this course we have some point in the future where we face a crisis. I would think I need to keep my debt levels low incase I need to get a long-term loan to cover my expenses over the 3rd year. In that case I might just hold off until before that date to maximize the debt load. I also don't know what effect on our stock price our balance sheet has. I feel like when I analyze companies and see their balance sheets have a lot of debt I shy away depending on their share price.
