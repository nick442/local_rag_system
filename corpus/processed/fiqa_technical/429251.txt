When youre young, youre basically a sponge. You dont really know much (sorry) so you just kinda set out to learn all these new things. When you get old, you brain solidifies and you get stuck in your ways. New information bounces right off. There's a reason all these tech startups are from teenagers and 20 somethings, and not say people in their 50's-60's. It becomes a lot harder to learn at that age and a lot harder to envision change.
