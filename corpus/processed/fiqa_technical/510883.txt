Schwab suggests investors do the following in the face of tighter monetary policy in the near term: > * Consider limiting the average duration in their portfolios to the short to intermediate term to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates as the program begins. > * Consider using bond ladders to spread out maturities of bonds in a portfolio, as a way to manage through a rising-interest-rate environment. > * Focus on high-credit-quality bonds, as volatility may pick up as the Fed reduces liquidity.
