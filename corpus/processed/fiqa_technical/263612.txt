"The 1% thing is a platitude and socialism always creates a distopia. What ""socialist"" government has come closest to creating the dream society you describe? They all turn into something worse than an organized crime syndicate combined with a fundamentalist religion. Russia, Cuba, Bulgaria, north Korea, Romania, Albania, Somalia, Ethiopia, East Germany, soviet occupied Czechoslovakia, Poland, China, ,Cambodia, Venezuela and on and on. If your dream of unlimited time to play video games and free cheetos worked wouldn't it have worked a little in one of them?"
