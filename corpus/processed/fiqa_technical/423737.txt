Look I am not debating you, I think something should change. I was point out that the current mood is that protect the consumer. The MS thing was a competitor complaining about them, spun as the consumer canâ€™t use other options as means to get them a better product. Like by not using Firefox and being stuck with IE the consumer is harmed. Back before when everyone went trust busting, it was about keeping a healthy competition in the market. That view is gone, its all about protecting the consumer. a short sited view as once competition is gone we can then screw the customer and then what happens? Protect competition and encourage, not the current view.
