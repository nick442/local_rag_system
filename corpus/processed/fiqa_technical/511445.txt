What would an entry level job entail? I know a fair amount of scientific computing (numerical methods, finite element methods), but computer science knowledge/skills are like intro to comp sci I and maybe II. You don't need a lot of comp sci stuff to implement scientific algorithms in matlab (e.g. not even, like, object-based programming, classes, or even recursion, although I've touched on these things in intro comp sci classes), so Idk if you're thinking I have more skills than I do.
