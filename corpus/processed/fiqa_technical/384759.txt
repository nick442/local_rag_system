I think it might come down to the contract itself. In many states in the US an employer cannot block you from practicing your trade to make a living. In many jurisdictions contract clauses that are designed to prevent you from working in your trade area are generally void and unenforceable however in cases like this only a trip in front of a judge will fix it. What I find interesting about this, is that depending on the details, Sony might have a hard time finding another spokesman in the future. I would imagine most actors would steer clear of that spot in the future if this is how Sony is going to react when they try to get new work.
