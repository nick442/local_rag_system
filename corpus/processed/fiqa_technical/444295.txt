Is Zellers was such a quality company, it would not have been bought out. So the company, stock and locations were valuable. The staff might hae been part of the problem. In addition most of the jobs do not require any type of skills. This is called entry level work. This is what you start doing when you have no skills, get more experience, go to a college or trade school to get more knowledge to become more valuable.
