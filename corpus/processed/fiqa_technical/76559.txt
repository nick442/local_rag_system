Nope! Taylor has always been super original, I mean she dated another guy named Taylor, hence why t squared. What other pop star did that? None. That's right. How can you say she's not original, she's the best. Popstar? No. She's country. Get your facts straight then maybe I'll listen. Taylor+Taylor forever.
