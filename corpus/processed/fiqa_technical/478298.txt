Came to post this article hoping to elicit this response. They really put out some turds sometimes. I appreciate the offbeat Econ news.. But this is buzzfeed quality. I mean so bad that I would take the time to try and post it, then come here and write this whole comment.

It's not about the modernization of mexico's rural farming ranching economy. Could say so much more but it reached that point where it's not worth it
