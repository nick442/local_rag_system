>you're fooling yourself if you think they don't have advantages over retail investors. Well clearly they have resources connections, more clout when speaking to their investees, etc. but what I meant is it's not as big of an advantage as most people believe it is. Also with derivatives you're right its a whole different ball game. I'm a finance student and I invest my own money to learn, and to grow my wealth slowly and intelligently. The thing is I never touch derivatives(probably because I haven't studied them much yet). Also I come from a very Benjamin Graham value investing background so that is why I think that an average investor with a retail brokerage account can beat the institutions. This energy thing is not something that I think can be capitalized upon, however.
