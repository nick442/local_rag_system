If you like financial planning the CFP not the CFA will be your cup of tea. Screw books though. If you are really that interested just walk into an office like Schwab or Edward Jones or fidelity and start asking questions. They are usually happy to talk to new comers. Also if you are female you already have a leg up in the industry. Sad but true.
