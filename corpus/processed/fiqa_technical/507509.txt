Mazda is, hands down, the best manufacturer of affordable fun cars. While I mostly drive Audis, I've had the opportunity to put a substantial number of miles on a couple Mazdas lately (the Miata and the 3), both on the street and on the track, and they are both fantastic cars. It makes me wonder why anybody would ever buy a Toyota or Honda.
