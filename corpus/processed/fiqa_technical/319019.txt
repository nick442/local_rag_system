"Saudi Arabia finally has started doing this. They built a new city in the south near the sea that is completely reliant on new refineries being their industry. As for why more don't do it, meh, it's a fair amount of work and takes a lot of investment. Selling oil is just digging a hole and hooking up a pipeline, its 1920's era technology really. Meanwhile, refineries are very complex facilities staffed by PhD's and prone to explosions and gas leaks if not maintained and regulated. I guess its comparable to your parents saying ""Okay, you will get $10 a day if you set your bed. And that number will go up to $12 if you set your bed, mow the lawn, clean the dishes, cook dinner, and mop the floors"" Most of us just shrug and take the $10 for the easy work. Let someone else break their back doing all the hard work to earn the extra $2"
