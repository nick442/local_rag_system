It sounds sensible to me.. If we are hiring Rolls Royce to build an engine we might as well get them to design it, to capitalise on their expertise. If Wings Incorporated is making the wings then surely they are well placed to design them, as long as they follow the 'compatibility guidelines' for the project. Building Boeing's own blueprints would be like Microsoft giving Nvidia a circuit diagram for the graphics card to go in their tablet - Nvidia are the pest people to do this, Microsoft don't have the same level of organisational knowledge. Of course it matters how you manage this process..
