Given that the Apple janitor is a contract worker, shouldn't the focus be on the company that actually pays her and not Apple? My first job back in the late 80s was as a contractor, making just above the minimum wage as a data entry/office clerk. I spent two years with them and they had training classes for their employees and vacations. I would have liked for the New York Times to focus on their story as well; also, I think the comparison shouldn't be between Apple and Kodak but the difference economic environment they faced. Kodak and they do everything model (even janitorial work) and Apple's decision to outsource everything else.
