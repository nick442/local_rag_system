Also to add to my other point you don't give more money to someone who can't use the money they already have wisely. For example a friend borrows your money to pay his rent and he blows it all on alcohol and cigarettes and when he asks you for more you don't give more to him you direct him to a place where he can solve his problems. The same needs to happen with the US, the money they recieve now is more then enough to run the country.
