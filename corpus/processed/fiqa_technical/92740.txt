"> these casual chains blame Millennials. Generation X here. I mentioned it in another comment, but I last went to BWW a few years ago and had a lunch ""special."" It wasn't so special. I don't remember exactly what it was, but the meal was something like 90% bread. Like a hamburger with a bun that was too big and a bunch of breadsticks. All of it sucked. Then it was like $15 with tax and tip. Just a horrendously bad deal. The buffets in town are around $10-$11 and you can actually get a bunch of protein and a salad. Mom and pop restaurants have $6-$8 lunch specials that are pretty good and end up $5 less than BWW. It's not a generational thing. When you serve a shit product that costs $5 more than *better* products, you're going to lose customers. Is it really so difficult to see that?"
