As an individual, I am not aware of any insurance you can buy that will cover legal costs for any event that may occur (whether criminal or civil).. I imagine this is because the risk is too difficult to measure and the moral hazard too great. I do notice you mention rental property/small business needs. If your concern is truly for costs relating to some legal issue that arises out of your professional operations, then Professional liability insurance may be what you are looking for (oftentimes referred to as errors and omissions, or E&O for short). This insurance is specific to whatever business you engage in, however will typically protect you against legal claims (including defense costs) as a result of your business operations. Note however that what is actually covered will be specific to your policy. As duffbeer703 mentioned, the purpose of insurance is for covering specific losses, i.e., protecting you from legal claims that may arise during the course of business. If you are looking for a solution that will, e.g., provide you a standard set of legal documents (maybe a lease agreement) then you are not in fact looking for insurance, but instead legal services at a fixed rate. Why would an insurance company pay for services both you and it already know you need?
