You either believe that the dollars matter or they don't. I fly really a lot and while I have once or twice flown first class just to see it or because I got a free upgrade, I don't see that it's good value for the dollar. But also, your questions presuppose that if there isn't a supervening reason, the default should be to give them a benefit ordinary people don't enjoy. I don't buy that. None of your long questions tell me why the value-per-dollar of a biz/1st ticket is something the public should be paying for when it is routine to tell poor kids they can't have food subsidies or early education etc. because there is not enough money. It matters up and down the hierarchy to remember that money matters, but some government employees are scrutinized about being a few minutes late or using a small office item for personal use, while others are not scrutinized for thinking getting enough leg room is worth hundreds of dollars. This matters in terms of setting a tone.
