Except the state isnt actually paying anything, they are just not charging. Its not the same thing. The state doesnt lose any money by giving breaks to the factory, it's not a subsidy, and in the long run it provides more tax revenue, and all those jobs immediately provide more tax revenue. It's a no brainer for the state.
