">Privatization and outsourcing of knowledge is much cheaper than in-house economies of scale.. wait, what? It's a short-term gain .. problem with short term things is that when you do them repeatedly year-after-year, you pile-up a long-term loss (which eventually comes home to roost). >When this grand experiment is proven to not be the panacea of the business world's quest for cost reduction, we'll all look back and laugh at how silly these guys were. You mean like the housing bubble, when *everyone* was getting rich ""flipping"" their homes back and forth between each other. >It's like saying it's cheaper for a family of four to eat out three times a day, seven times a week (at restaurant that serves food with quality comparable to home cooking) than it is to cook at home. We all know home cooked meals are more cost effective unless you're eating the bottom of the barrel fast food, even then, externalities of health and well being make the savings questionable. Well said."
