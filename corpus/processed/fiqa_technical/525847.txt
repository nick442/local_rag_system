>I remember the articles years ago about working conditions at Amazon, but ive not seen anything to prove those accusations, and ive seen plenty to convince me they either are no longer valid, or they never were in the first place I guess all those articles must have just be false then. I'm surprised Amazon does sue for libel because they were not very favorable toward Amazon.
