The thing about the US and oil is that, we both produce and consume a lot of it. Yes the oil producing parts of the US economy benefit from a higher oil price and are hurt by a lower oil price, but the oil consuming sectors of the US economy benefit from a low oil price. So, it's hard to say definitively whether lower oil prices hurt or help the US as a whole. Although, I personally suspect that low oil prices benefit the USA economy more than they hurt it.
