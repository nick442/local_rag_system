This is so over sold. Just another pie in the sky Kickstarter fake video. There is no way that you can get the precision from a router, as they are showing here, from following a screen using just your hands and arms. It would still be very sloppy. I doubt you could stay within 1/8 inch tolerance. No way you can make puzzle pieces fit like that. As a user of many routers, this is total bullshit.
