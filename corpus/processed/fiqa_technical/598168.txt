The only mistake she made was attaching a timeframe to her call. the muni market is structurally flawed and is in severe danger. However the dominos haven't fallen quite like she expected and thus was very wrong on her date. I still think she'll be proven correct, it may just come off more as a slow motion collapse as opposed to the sudden spike she called for.
