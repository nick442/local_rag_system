"Those are actually causing demonstrable harm, in the forms of child abuse and murder. Saying ""X group is terrible and should all go die"" is hateful and ignorant, but not actually harmful. Saying ""I will kill this person for money"" is an express intent to murder somebody. Saying ""look at these children I sexually abused"" is admitting to sexual abuse of a child. Even if you're just running the sites and not involved in the activity, you are still facilitating and encouraging it. Any more spurious comparisons you'd like shot down?"
