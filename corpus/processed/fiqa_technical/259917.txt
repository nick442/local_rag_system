Yeah, those sound like good interns. But I'd look at it more like a person like that would get more out of the internship than somebody will fewer qualification. I see where you're coming from. I haven't supervised an intern in a while, I moved into an organization this year that doesn't have anybody below VP level and doesn't take interns. I teach a class to interns and new grad hires though, and I always enjoy it.
