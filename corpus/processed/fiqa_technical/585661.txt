"Yes, merchants may charge a fee for using a credit card. For a credit card transaction, interchange fees flow from the merchant to the card issuer. This is why Australians are seeing a boom in ""Debit"" MasterCard/VISA cards - the issuing banks make income when you select ""Credit"". These costs can be passed from the merchant to the customer as a ""Credit Card Fee"". For an EFTPOS transaction, the interchange flows the other way, from the card issuer to the acquiring bank (The merchant's bank). As an aside, the setup of these fees is why some large supermarket chains in Australia restrict you from selecting ""Credit"" with a scheme debit card (MasterCard and VISA are 'schemes'). They are 'acquirers' in the payments networks and they make interchange fees when you hit ""Savings"" and pay if you hit ""Credit"" - therefore where you can hit either ""Credit"" or ""Savings"" they prefer (and may force) you to press ""Savings""."
