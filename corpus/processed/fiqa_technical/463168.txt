Really, I can only endorse the ones that I go to. Also, I could insert Wendy's, Harvey's or every other fast food joint near me for being better than McDonalds in my experience. BK only stands out for me because of how well they're run in my area. I only commented because the article doesn't surprise me based on my experiences. I'd like to think that consumers make choices based on experience and eventually poor quality leads to loss of market share.
