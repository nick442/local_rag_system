His TTIP energy deal [is really scary](http://action.sierraclub.org/site/DocServer/Analysis_of_EU_Energy_Proposal_TTIP.pdf). because the US could have to pay literally billions of dollars in compensation if we decide for almost any reason to stop fracking. Just like with the insurance companies and healthcare insurance. Which is just as crazy because fracking wells only last a short time. its projected to raise the price of energy in the US, a lot. The rest of what I think is too speculative but it involves a big scam, like the bank scam in 2008. Targeting US taxpayers. I see it coming. Thats how they operate now.
