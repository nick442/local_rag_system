There's quite a lot of investment in battery tech right now. Batteries with 2 to 4 times the energy density of Li-ion are now in production, though not for sale yet. People are working on fast charging and long life battery tech too. And there are a number of flow battery technologies, where the electrolytes are like fuel, and the power extraction unit is like an engine. These may never be suitable for vehicles, but they can store huge amounts of energy for months. Also there are some very high energy density batteries that are non-rechargeable but where the solid electrolytes are replaceable and recyclable. These have energy density close to that of gasoline.
