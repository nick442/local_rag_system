Walmart, for example posted a profit of over $100B last year but their employees are draining over $6B from taxpayer funded programs (food stamps, healthcare subsidy, housing credits, etc). They're stealing from everyone to boost their profit margin and it can't keep happening. You need to get your head out of the clouds or your ass, not sure which.
