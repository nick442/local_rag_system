She was Google's first product manager. Because there was nobody else standing around. She's not brilliant, she won a lottery. I've met her. She's basically a professional cheerleader. Not a visionary. If I had the reigns of Yahoo, I would have focused on what people still go to Yahoo for - their financials. I would have built that into a major destination for investors and parlayed that into a key news hub. Instead she fucked around with blogs, acquisitions (Fiorina style), and stupid micromanaged policies. Zero respect. She should retire, enjoy her good fortune, and never bother the tech world again.
