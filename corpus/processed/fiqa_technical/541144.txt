If you paid by debit/credit card, there is an expiration period to the authorization the seller is given by the merchant processor, although that timeframe is dictated by the credit card company/bank, merchant processor, and sometimes by state law. That being said, the other posters are correct that technically, once you authorize charge, the seller has the right to expect fulfillment of the agreement, that you would pay them X dollars for Y product.
