Not sure you are going to find anything like this in Excel - with the automatic lookup in specific. Microsoft has a template available; but it looks to be a pretty busy page. Why not look at other software? If you have a PC, Quicken and Microsoft Money are of course the big guns. You don't mention why you switched away from MS Money.. There are many other packages as well. The one that I use (but have no other financial interest in) is Moneydance as it was the best on Mac at the time I was looking. It also runs on Windows and Linux.
