">DCF only works with stable cash flows A DCF works with whatever cash flows you are willing to forecast. If you have extreme skepticism about those forecasts then you can either adjust them, run sensitivity analyses, or use a significantly higher discount rate (or all three). All of those approaches will help you establish upper and lower bounds for a valuation. >Facebook could argue, the core rationale for the acquisition was to stay current with their users keeping their core product attractive to their customers (advertisers). So what you're saying is that Facebook can forecast that by acquiring Snapchat they're able to ""keep X users for Y period of time"" but they then can't make the next logical leap to figure out how to apply a profit/revenue factor to those user numbers in order to create a suitable DCF?"
