"It's interesting that after reading this article you would make an assumption about where the stock market is headed. This article specifically says that the only way to know that is to know where interest rates are going, and for that we can guarantee no one knows. The takeaway is this: ""The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors."" Intelligent investors should have no concern about what ""the market"" is doing. Analyze businesses, not the stock market."
