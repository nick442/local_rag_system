"I empathize, honestly, but we can't address claims like >that when the cards are so stacked against you and when all jobs available to you are not paying a living wage at a generalized societal level. Everyone is an individual that makes individual choices that affect the outcomes in their life. I would assume there were some missteps along the way if *every* available job does not ""pay a livable wage"" (whatever that may be..not trying to be a dick, but honestly, what does that phrase even mean?) Those missteps in life, such as not graduating high school, or having a kid without a partner and before being financially self sufficient, or getting into trouble with the law, etc, etc..are going to make life more difficult for one than the person that didn't make those mistakes. I think that *IS* fair. Some people have great parents. Some people have shitty parents. The former will have the opportunity (assuming they don't fuck it up) for an easier life than the latter. That's just life man. If you have shitty parents hopefully that will motivate you to make better life choices than your parents did so that your kid doesn't have shitty parents. The kid that stayed home to study for his exams and missed all the parties *SHOULD* be rewarded for that behavior, and often times they are, via better paying jobs and financial security in the future. Is the system perfect? Of course not, nothing is. But in the history of mankind, we've never had a better system that has pulled more people out of poverty, produced more advancement in the standard of living, or given people more freedom over their own lives."
