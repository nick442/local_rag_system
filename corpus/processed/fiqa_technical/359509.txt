"Hanging up is easy, whether it be charities or telemarketers: ""Sorry. I'm giving to other charities and am not interested in donating at this time. Bye. No, seriously, I know there are starving puppies, bye."" *hang up* You're probably trying to be polite and inoffensive by not interrupting and listening to the pitch, but you're not doing them a favor by listening for longer if you're not interested in paying up. Assuaging your guilt is another matter I can't address here."
