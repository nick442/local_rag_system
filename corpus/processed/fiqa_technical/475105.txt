Coming from a libertarian, someone who believes in an ideology is demonstrably false with even a cursory understanding of economics or the political process? Please, there has never been a libertarian government and there never will be and long after your dead the U.S. federal government will be involved in providing social welfare like roads, schools and bridges. The reason you are beneath contempt when it comes to political discourse is that you are a true believer and nothing anyone says will ever change that. You know what that makes you? An idiot, in the classical Greek sense of the word.
