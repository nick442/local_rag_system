"I think something telling about this article is how infatuated people seem to be with the 1%. The 1% are exactly that..ONE..FUCKING.PERCENT. Shouldn't we be happy that the top 1% are earning significantly more than $100,000. The argument of whether or not $100,000 is a ""good"" salary is a far different argument. As many have brought up already, location is a large factor in how far your money will go as well as other factors, but that's not my point. ""But as income inequality in the US continues to worsen, a $100,000 salary creeps ever-closer to being an upper-middle-class income, not a sure sign of wealth."" The article seems to subtly suggest one should be unsatisfied that they are not part of or close to being included in the 1% or seen as wealthy."
