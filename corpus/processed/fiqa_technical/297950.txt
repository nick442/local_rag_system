"Someone posted a very insightful article on reddit a while back that basically explained the whole cable pricing model and why ""a la carte"" wouldn't work (or would be so prohibitively expensive that nobody would go for it). IIRC, the breakdown was that basically a few super popular channels and live sports in the standard $100/mo package helped ""subsidize"" the rest of the less popular channels. Most of the niche channels probably couldn't exist in an ""a la carte"" environment unless they were ridiculously cheap.. and if they were ridiculously cheap, they wouldn't be able to generate enough revenue to stay afloat. Also - how would the pricing work? Could I ""subscribe"" to AMC for 1 hour a week to watch Mad Men? Or would I be locked into subscribing for a minimum of a day / week / month? IMHO, what makes more sense is to allow people to subscribe to individual shows like RSS feeds."
