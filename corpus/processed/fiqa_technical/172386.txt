It really confuses me how businesses and politicians fail to see how much of a problem this is, even beyond issues is social inequality. An economy in which the middle class is earning less is an economy with less growth potential. When a company is squeezing employee wages, on par with other businesses, the end result is a smaller pie for them to carve out. The look at their immediate bottom line in which the weight if wages has gone down, but fail to see that they have weakened the market (for broad-based, community serving markets, at least), and so are shrinking demand. Even if you assume that only 80% of those $93 Billion are for low and middle class wages, that is still $74 billion less demand. For decades we've heard that the middle class is what fuels the economy, yet the fact that the wages if the middle class are waning are seen as trivial and nothing to worry about..
