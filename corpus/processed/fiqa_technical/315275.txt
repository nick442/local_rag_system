"A lot of your options depends on the type of debt you have. If you're single, young, and have lots of credit card debt then don't discount bankruptcy. It's definitely not an ""appealing"" thought I'm sure, but it's an option. One thing I did was completely cut myself off from most forms of credit (credit cards and personal credit loans). I know my weaknesses. I will never, ever, ever, get another credit card. I'm probably older than you are and have lived with debt for a long time. I'm pretty much debt free; at least from debts that are not covered 100% by assets. It took a long time. Keep your spirits up. Maybe try contacting a credit councilor; one of the real ones that aren't paid for by credit card companies. I've known people that took that route."
