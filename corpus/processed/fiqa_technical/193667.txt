"C'mon, Bill - you're better than this. Aside from the fact that he accumulated his personal wealth through ruthless profiteering and tax shelters, it's just a flat out bad idea. It was an even worse idea when some neckbeard actor and commie guitarist started pushing it. All this tax will do is hamper the ability to do business (i.e., market liquidity), and end up being shouldered by small banks and in the end, the consumer. Big banks will find their ways around this, no problem, but the boutique capital firms will surely struggle. This isn't just a ""oh, we'll institute this micro-tax and everyone is happy!"" - they want to tax the underlying value of assets on each trade. This creates a direct impact to free-market trading which I don't believe they've accounted for (which is shocking, really). It's a tax on the top and bottomline, and a general tax on the actual execution point of an entire industry. It's a half-baked idea that shouldn't have gotten as far as it did."
