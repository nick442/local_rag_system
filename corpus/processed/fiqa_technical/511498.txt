"One of the things I love to do is to find big patterns in things. When an effect is the result of human decisions, then since people are involved in lots of stuff you should generally be able to find large commonalities of behavior. In this case, it's really ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" Over and over we see industries that fear change and fight the change with lawsuits and dirty tricks. This can be traced down to the idea that a large number of managers and executives aren't that *creative* but know how to politic their way into jobs. (It's not what you know..) While I doubt they would recognize this, the threat of market upheavals scares them because they don't know how to deal with it - it introduces fear, uncertainty, and doubt. So they use the tools they know - lawyers. In the meantime, the Sergey/Pages, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, and Reed Hastings of the world see the ""brilliant!"" path and essentially duck through the giant's legs (not all the time, mind you. Ask Preston Tucker)"
