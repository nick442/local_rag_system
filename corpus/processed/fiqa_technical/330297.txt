I agree. Amazon hires more retail employees and factory workers than the others so the Glassdoor comparison isn't as valid. But if I'm looking for work and I get an offer at Amazon and at Facebook, all other things being equal, all the evidence points to Facebook being a better choice. Amazon will need to pay more to attract employees.
