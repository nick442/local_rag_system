You are going off on some tangents here. Yes, I agree, doctors and economists have different jobs and those skills won't transfer over necessarily. What I do disagree with is your claim economists simply can not grasp why American healthcare is so much more expensive. You gave a reason that has already been well studied and accounted for by economists. Having a patient die on a table I'm sure is very emotional. I don't believe it is necessary for someone to experience to properly research why American healthcare is so expensive.
