No, not a consultant. I'm a systems administrator and part of my job is doing due dilligence on purchases. The reliability of a company is always a factor in large purchases and CEO behavior is a factor in that. When it comes to minor or temporary purchases (bottled water) the CEO and company behavior is irrelevant.
