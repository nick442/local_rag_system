I disagree with the comment that radio is dying, you may not use it often but many people still commute to work and use the radio. Satellite radio attempted to take over the radio business but it really hasn't done so successfully. There's a surge of people playing music from their iPods into the car stereo but I don't think it's been large enough or reached enough people to say that the radio is dead.
