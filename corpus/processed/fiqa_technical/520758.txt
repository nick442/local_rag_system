According to https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0181-unordered-merchandise, If you didn't order the merchandise, then you don't have to pay for it. I would talk to your doctor about this order and clear it up. I would only suggest paying for the product if you feel it will hurt your relationship with your doctor if you don't pay for it.
