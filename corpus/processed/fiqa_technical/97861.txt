My first job was an Applebee's. Yes, Chef Mike was in the kitchen. He cooked sides. Rice pilaf? Mike. Steamed vegetables? Mike. Customer wanted their steak super well done? Grill the shit out of it and give it to Chef Mike. Warm dessert? Of course it was microwaved. You think we bake a chocolate cake every time you order a slice? The vast majority of the food? Cooked just like any other restaurant. Grilled, fried, blah blah blah. And yes, we roasted the potatoes in an oven.
