"I would say ""yes"" to your question. CD's purchased from a bank on your behalf by your broker will be FDIC insured and safe. However, be aware that no one is examining the broker except you to ensure that each CD is actually purchased from an FDIC insured bank. Don't trust them blindly. See risks mentioned by the FDIC on the subject Remember, the broker should not originate the CD, so the broker's lack of FDIC protection is irrelevant. The job of a broker is to buy things on your behalf. If your broker does that appropriately and sticks with FDIC insured CD's, you will be insured. Given the risks and gotchas mentioned in the link, buying directly from a bank instead of through your broker still sounds like good advice to me but you can make your own decision based on your level of trust and aversion to inconvenience."
