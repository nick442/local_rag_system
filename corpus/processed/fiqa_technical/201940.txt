I'd like to point you to article ten of the bill of rights: >The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. It seems to me that the Constitution gives the states the right to do whatever they want so long as the Constitution doesn't specifically forbid it. Either concede the point or show me where the Constitution forbids the states from levying a sales tax.
