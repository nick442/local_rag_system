I usually use this process: determine fair market value. This will be an estimate from KBB or similar minus any known repairs or maintenance needed. (Est)-(repairs)=FMV IF FMV < $0 walk away and sell it for whatever it will bring. You would be better off even just buying a similar model than buying the repair. If FMV > $0 ask yourself this question: If I had the fair market value in cash, would I purchase this car? Essentially, this is what you are doing if you choose to keep it. This is where your needs and opinions come into play. If you wouldn't, sell it and buy something else. Unless you have certain specific numbers on the future maintenance and repairs needed, you are just speculating on future events. In general, the probability of repair for the age and condition will be reflected in the estimate of value, so that is captured in the analysis already. There is also no guarantee that another car would not have some other large repair, even if it was newer. From just the numbers, I can't think of many reasons not to drive a car until it dies (FMV < $0) or until you find an excellent deal to replace it.
