I don't see how you could have this conversation without also including mention of the labor participation rate. If the unemployment rate is low but there is still a huge pool of workers trying to get back into the workforce then you still have high competition for positions which would depress the wage rate. This has been my experience looking for work in the last 12 months. Linkedin tracks applications and it is routine to see 100-300 applicants for entry level business analyst positions that are only a week or two old. Does that seem like low unemployment/low competition for work? Hell no. I bet most employers are still flooded with applications and can be as picky as they want and can lowball applicant wages.
