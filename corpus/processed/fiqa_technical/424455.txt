I'm not an expert on HFT. But order cancellation is not an indicator of front running.. Let's say you are willing to post 1000 shares at 25.00. Someone jumps in and takes 500. From past trading analysis you know that this is indicative of a larger order - say because of the speed of the execution you expect another 10000 shares to follow. This will push up the price because the demand curve has changed. If you leave your remaining 500 shares listed at 25, they will be lifted and the price will move up to, say, 25.25. This is not shady order cancellation- this is rational response to new information about demand for the stock, and not wanting to get screwed for selling at a lower price than equilibrium. Or (I think this is a valid example but again not an expert here) say you are willing to sell 100 shares. You don't know where the buys will be routed so you post your 100 on multiple platforms. When one gets lifted you cancel the others. Frankly the best argument against HFT is the billions of dollars being poured into infrastructure of questionable economic utility, or at the very least diminishing marginal utility. But all this front running nonsense is just that.
