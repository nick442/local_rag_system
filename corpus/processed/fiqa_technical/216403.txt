In 2011 Walmart total executive pay [was just shy of $60million](http://insiders.morningstar.com/trading/executive-compensation.action?t=WMT&region=USA&culture=en_US). Let's make them earn zero. That would work out as a raise of $2/month per employee. While I agree with your sentiments about executive pay, such laws never work. For example the executives could just move to Canada.
