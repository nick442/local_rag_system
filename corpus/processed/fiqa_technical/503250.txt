"Title touted in the press: ""LCD makers will pay a $538 million penalty."" Actual terms of settlement: ""LCD makers will pay a $37 million penalty, and set aside $501 million to partially reimburse those consumers who hear about the settlement, can find their receipts, and bother to fill out and send in a form."" I bet if every single consumer affected filled out the form it would cost the companies $501 million. Seeing as only a fraction of affected consumers will actually do so, the companies will end up paying a far smaller penalty.
