Smart cars are highway legal and pass crash test safety standards. Making them much more expensive than they need to be. And yeah, they suck to drive because they're under powered for their weight. There are much better alternatives. [For example all of these cars are illegal, or regulated out of usefulness, in the US.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_car) And they're the prime size of vehicle for commuter electric cars right now. However, they would never pass a crash test at highway speeds. There's a similar class of cars in India and Europe, I just happen to like the Kei trucks myself.
