> “Any time you split a portfolio up — whether it be a credit portfolio or a trading book portfolio — you lose the benefits of diversification that allow you to reduce the capital you hold against it,” said Mr Austen. > Just to amplify this a little. Banks like diversification but you can only diversify within a reporting entity. At the moment, most banks have a single EU wide reporting entity so thay are free to combine trade and credit exposures. With a mandated split, they will be forced to split the pot between the UK and the EU entities as each must look healthy.
