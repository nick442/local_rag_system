The best way to use your new credit card to establish credit history is to use it for small-medium purchases and pay it off in full each month. There is no reward for using it more than once a month. If you are getting some sort of rewards for using the credit card to pay your health insurance (air miles, points, etc.), then you could go ahead and use it. Your credit score will take a temporary hit for high utilization. You can actually avoid this by making a partial payment before the end of the billing cycle so that your utilization is never reported as near 100%.
