I agree, sales will always win. I just saw another study that showed social media engagement for companies and 99% were getting almost no engagement from organic social posts. The 1% that were getting organic engagement were killing it though. My point is that most companies still have no real grasp as to what the hell they are supposed to be doing in this space.
