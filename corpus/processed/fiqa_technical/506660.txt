"Gave it a shot? Lol! You went back and forth for half a day yesterday about how ""gubment bad"", and not once offering any substantive alternative. And when you finally do, it's Medieval Iceland! Dude, the only difference between your sub and r/hentai, is at least tentacles actually exist.. You have more in common with those people who sit in the stands and whine about LeBron James, except that they may actually go out and play basketball with their buddies over the weekend every once in a while.. Ya, you gave it **a** shot, and now I know why you and your buddies are much more comfortable sniping from the comfort of your couch, because to actually live what you preach would be so ridiculous that you place unclimbable obstacles in your way to prevent you from ever even trying. Good luck with all that, and I will quite happily continue to pay my taxes and push for more. At leastI will do it while being honest with myself. Send me a post card from that no tax, no government Shangri La!"
