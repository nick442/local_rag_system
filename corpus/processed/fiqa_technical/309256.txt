"In short: management wants something because somebody said some vague idea. Management does not really know why the idea should be done! ROI? Good idea? Is there a need for the idea? Let's not forget that to begin with, management does not know how to execute, implement or design the idea. Never! The idea is sent to IT to think and do all the above. IT will never fight Management and do serious work on the first part: Should the idea be done? ROI? Need for the idea? Business Analysts in IT are notoriously knows to be clueless except to write down ""requirements"" that some Business people said. So, IT concentrates on the 2nd part: implement and design a solution for the idea. And between the 12 people in IT working on the design and implementation, non of them have background in Business, Marketing or Accounting, the results are predictable. How it should be done? You have an idea? You and only you work with all the stakeholder on all aspects of evaluating and implementing the idea: from research about the validity and feasibility of the idea, to checking and working closely with the design and development team as YOU try to implement the idea."
