"* Don't underestimate the power of facial recognition wizardry. * No, you don't have to show ID to activate the cards. But keep in mind that they know which cards were activated. There is a paper trail. I'm sure Amex, Visa, MC would happily deactivate the cards for them. Target just has to report that the cards were activated using fraud/theft. * If you took advantage of this ""deal"" your best bet is to get the prepaid credit cards and spend the money asap at another store (walmart) before they are deactivated. * If indeed this legally is considered fraud, and they go after you for it, you could end up in a giant heap of trouble as many laws have been broken. And, if you use any of the ""fraudulent"" CC's to make online purchases from a company in another state you could face even more federal charges."
