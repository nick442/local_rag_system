"Its the economics subreddit. People post here to talk about economics. I assume people here have attention spans long enough to read a few paragraphs. I can understand your issue with principal. I understand people who will willingly take a worse system that costs more just to fuck over a drug addict. I'm not one of them. Personally, I would pay zero dollars extra to fuck over drug addicts and I have no desire to have worse quality care so drug addicts can be denied care. I want the system that is a good balance between cost and quality. Sure, the trade off of paying ""less for better"" is when everyone else is covered, there will be people who I don't like, and who made poor choices that will also get that coverage. I suppose one could make a single payer system that also doesn't cover drug addicts. Maybe that would be ideal for you. However, studies also find that paying for these drug addicts/lazy assholes also saves money in the long run. I assume you don't want to explore the theories as to why statistically this is the case because you know...TL DR. I'm sorry you don't like the ideas. Don't worry about ideas. Worry about facts and reality. Base what you ""agree with"" on reality. I'm going to go out on a limb, I think if you thought about it, saving yourself and your family money for better treatment will rank higher than the principal of denying treatment to those who you don't like. Once you establish what you value, abandon ideology. See what works best with what you value and go from there. I would make a guess that one of the reasons Americans are absolutely ripped off when it comes to medical costs is because people don't agree with ""ideas""."
