This! I went in to try on different sized Apple Watches (don’t hate) and the guy pushed the 3mm because it’s the women’s one. I mean, I don’t mean to say you must have a tiny dick, but if the size of the watch is determined by gender for you, mr salesman, and not by my preference, then I don’t know where else you got that dumb an expression. Not to mention, I already told him I wanted to try both to see how they *feel.*
