"Luck is the wrong word then, since you believe it to be fake. How about ""chance of birth"", ""chance of opportunity""? ""Being in the right place at the right time"". It's all the same thing. > If you're from Darfur, sure you might be at a competitive disadvantage. One must be from Darfur to have the same disadvantage? Someone who grows up in abject poverty in the Appalachians you feel should be as successful as you? Or growing up with a single mother on welfare in an urban environment? Sure, you rose from meager circumstances to achieve. But guess what, so did I. I grew up on welfare, moved frequently, switched schools, but I made it eventually and am quite comfortable. But unlike you, I still feel ""lucky"" for where I am today. I am grateful, very grateful for what I have and where I am. That is what we, as a society, lack currently. Gratitude. Feeling pride in your self reliance is a good thing, but don't forget to be grateful, and don't feel the need to belittle others for their lack of success, because you don't know their situation, you don't know what they had to overcome."
