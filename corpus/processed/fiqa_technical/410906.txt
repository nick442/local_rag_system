Completely wrong. People are traveling less and Sears has chosen suburban malls requiring lots of space. Urban shopping malls (think Kohls, old navy, home depot, local grocery stores) are doing better, there is a uptick in buy local campaigns. Also I think the economy is doing so well in terms of employment and wages have grown so little, that the desire and capability of many people to buy expensive and nice fridges and washer machines, watches and housewares because they a) have no time to enjoy them and b) would ratber spend the money on time saving/enjoyment. The retail companies that realize you need to entertain your customers and their families will win.
