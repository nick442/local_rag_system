This is why you don't get to excited and accept the first offer. Did they tell you that it was just sales and your main job would be cold calling people? If they lied to you, chances are she is lying to you about helping you to land a real job. Honestly, unpaid internships sounds like a scam. Maybe its the trend now, with the shitty economy, but I never did any kind of internship that was unpaid, and the only ones who offered unpaid were some shady places.
