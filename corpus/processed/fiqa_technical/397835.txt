Yea there is an easy fix. RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. Look into how it has changed over the years. Cost of living has gone up but wage has not. Its almost impossible to live on a minimum wage. Compared to a good 40 years ago and adjusted for inflation it was something like 15-17 dollars an hour. If people where paid a real wage then they could afford to purchase other items than just the bare necessities to survive. They need to really learn more about trickle up economics and stop believe that trickle down works.
