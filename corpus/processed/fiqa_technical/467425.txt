My college gym would do something similar. The school took out a massive loan to build a gym then charged students automatically $100 for the gym on their tuition, then they charged $10 to use it for the semester. Most kids don't look at what is included in tuition so they think they are getting a good deal by just paying $10 per semester when in reality, its $110.
