"To me, I get what people are saying and don't hold semantic differences against intelligent people who may not have insight into my perspective as an employer. If someone says ""professional development"" instead of ""training,"" sure, it sounds much more slick. Are the two terms materially different? No, and unless there are other indicators of subpar communication for the training dude, it's silly to devote an ounce of energy to giving a shit when the question itself is inherently valid."
