I'm a plaintiffs attorney in Texas. I've read both sides of the issue and my conclusion is shaded by: when one side speaks, who benefits and what's their motive? Insurance companies lie and deceive and delay and deny. All day. After September 1 comes and goes, you'll hear nothing more from the insurance side because they've officially beat the clock.
