"In all honesty, the path she described is just preference and relative to what ""get money"" means. She made the comment she was a state school grad. So lets look at her ""Fuck prestige, get money."" mentality. * The big money in asset management and research is at the top hedgefunds (Two Sigma, Medallion/Renny, Fortress, Blackrock, Paulson, Soros Quantum, etc). * These firms hire will only hire from tier 1 school grads or from those grads who have networked and proven experience background from a major player. * Working for an unknown (relative to firms on the street) asset management or mutual fund firm will go completely ignored when they take applicants into consideration. They hire based on background experience that is in proximity to the street and market making. Bottom line is that to make the big money (aka analyst/asset mgr/trader @ top hedge fund) for non-tier 1 grads.. it requires putting in your time making less starting out to prove your performance at a household name on the street."
