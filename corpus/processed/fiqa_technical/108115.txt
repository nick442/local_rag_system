"Their definition of a brand ""disappearing"" is extremely weak. It just has to meet one of these criteria: * a rapid fall-off in sales and steep losses; * disclosures by the parent of the brand that it might go out of business; * rapidly rising costs that are extremely unlikely to be recouped through higher prices; * companies that are sold; * companies that go into bankruptcy; * companies that have lost the great majority of their customers; or * operations with rapidly withering market share. By that definition a brand like MySpace has ""disappeared"" in each of the last four years. In fact, they just put Myspace on their list last year and marked it as one of the companies they correctly predicted because it was sold."
