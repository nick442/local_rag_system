">A lot of the greatest innovators in America started out with little or no capital. Thomas Edison once sold newspapers and fruit on a train. Jack Welch was the son of a train conductor who worked his way up the ranks of GE. Steve Jobs was put up for adoption as an infant and was at one point homeless. Those are all *true* but *trivial* and *irrelevant* points. Steve Jobs did not start and grow Apple computer without capital -- it was just *other people's capital* (a series of partners and investors). Jack Welch may have ""worked his way up"" in GE, but he did not found the damned thing -- he merely ran it -- GE was not created or grown without capital. And likewise with Thomas Edison -- yeah he ""once sold newspapers and fruit on a train"" (which is about as relevant to anything as that he once took a crap on a train as well); but he didn't save his money from those sales and use it as capital to found his lab -- he also had ""investors"". >The idea that the 1% create all of the growth in the economy is a lie. Yes, it *is* a lie. But that does not make the opposite true (that somehow innovation can occur *without* capital investment). >Do we, the citizens of the richest nation in the world, want to watch our fellow countrymen go hungry, homeless or die because they don't have living salaries or access to proper healthcare? Ah, the ""emotional appeal"" -- spoken like a true ignoramus, socialist, or politician (but really those are all pretty much the same thing, so I am being redundant)."
