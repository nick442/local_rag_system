Go away. > Ironic, coming from the person who didn't answer my long comment about credit card processing once I mentioned I work in the industry and put a lot of information. Ironic that I tell you that you are out of your element in one area, just because you work in something completely unrelated? Yes, I've heard of this definition of ironic. It's very ironic. Something else that is ironic is that I don't sit on reddit all day and have time to answer every long thoughtful comment without taking time to read it. Actually yes, that is ironic. You answered my comment without reading the words or understanding the topic at all, and are now criticising me for not yet fully reading your longer (presumably not idiotic like the ones above in this tree) message, but instead **want** me to do like you do: Not read, just reply like an idiot.
