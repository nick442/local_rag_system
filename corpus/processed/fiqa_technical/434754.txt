>If society is evil (as you believe) I don't believe society is evil. I believe that some people make irrational decisions, some people make evil intentionally discriminatory decisions, that some people are indifferent to the suffering of others, and that all of those things combining are why the libertarian fantasy doesn't work. >Legislation doesn't help It absolutely does. When interracial marriage was illegal, society didn't want it to be made legal. It was against society's wishes according to the majority. It was made legal anyway, and (in sane parts of the country) we all moved on. You can pretend legislation isn't necessary, but it is, and libertarianism is naive at best.
