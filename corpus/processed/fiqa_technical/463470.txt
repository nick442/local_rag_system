Understood. And the article goes into that pretty indepth. My friend also mentioned that if the tappers hear a private conversation, they are legally bound to turn off recording for x seconds or minutes or whatever it is. So it def seems like there should be ways around the wire tapping, if recordees are prepared for it. One think to keep in mind though is that at least there HAVE been convictions. So apparently they seem to be walking that legal tightrope effectively.
