"Its a good question. Off the top of my head I would suggest to revoke their licenses to do business, and involuntary dissolution of the corporate entity. Mandatory sale of all assets including customer lists and other intangibles to the highest bidder. The entity would essentially be absorbed by other businesses in their industry so the industry and economy as a whole probably wouldn't be affected too much by the ""execution."" The shareholders would lose a lot obviously because the proceeds from the fire sale would probably be way lower than FMV. But fuck the shareholders, investing carries risk and their business failed. The relatively innocent employees could go work in the other businesses that bought up OldCo's assets. Higher level corporate executives should have to take personal responsibility legally. This is similar to how SOX requires the CEO and CFO to take personal responsibility for the financial statements they prepare and publish, with penalties up to and including millions of dollars of fines and jail time. But of course, as long as I'm dreaming, I'd like a pony too as the saying goes."
