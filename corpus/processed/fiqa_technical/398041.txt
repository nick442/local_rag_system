"> Identifying and supporting products good for the business If a gray person comes with a great idea or innovation, any idiot can ""identify"" and ""support"" that product. And you want to bet how many great ideas and products Steve and CEOs said ""No!"" and it turned out to be huge mistakes? Do you know the story of Bill Gates/Microsoft Internet Explorer versus Steve Jobs/Macintosh? Hint: eventually, Steve had to cave in and ask Bill Gates to make a version of Internet Explorer for the Macintosh. In this respect, Bill Gates was much much better than Steve Jobs in identifying and supporting new products and ideas."
