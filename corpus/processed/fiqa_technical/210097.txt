You're taking one instance of a spurious correlation and using it as an example of why a theory which everyone knows it false, is false? Congrats to you sir. You have done nothing interesting. The correlation is spurious, correlation is not causation, and EMH is already demonstrably false. You sound like an uneducated prick who knows a couple big words.
