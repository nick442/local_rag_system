"If a quantum computer could solve any cryptological problem instantly it would be very disruptive technology with no societal payoff. It seems pretty obvious to me that the only reason that is getting a lot of research money is very much like the race for nuclear war superiority – if ""they"" get it first it could be disastrous. In any event, the article was pretty boring – quantum computers may work differently, if at all, from existing ones. I think I already knew that."
