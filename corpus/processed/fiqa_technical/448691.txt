I'm a native English speaker and managed a team of Hungarian developers. Ranged from 15 people to 22 at our biggest, I think. I was not quite fluent in Hungarian at the time, and I found it was actually much easier than you would expect to manage the team. The majority of them had at least a little bit of familiarity with English, but only one or two were fluent. So, for the most part, the team liked to help me find the right words/phrasing for what I was trying to say. It became a collaborative effort, rather than me telling them what to do. Plus, the unintended hilarity of saying entirely the wrong thing always broke the tension. Being not fully fluent also required us all to keep our communications and thoughts rather basic. So we couldn't get mired in jargon, or go off into the weeds on some bit of esoteric nonsense. We kept it simple. And if something complex needed to be expressed, then I could talk in detail with one or two of the guys that spoke English well, and they could translate for the rest of the team.
