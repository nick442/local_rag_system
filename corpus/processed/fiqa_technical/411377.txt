Yeah, they'd be worth more than EA. There's no way Zynga is worth that much. My take is that people can only play a game for so long (unless its like the classics like Chess, checkers and what not), Zynga would have to compete for a user's time with everything else. It's only a matter of time until people get bored and move to something else. Zynga would have to continually make games that will suck people in. Not saying Zynga is a bad company, but I don't think its worth 7 billion dollars. Youtube was bought for like 2 billion I believe, and I would much rather pay for Youtube than Zynga.
