I've got a small position at Lending Club and it's doing really well. It's been easy to use, good (not excellent) interface, easy to track the loans you've made & does a good job with notifications. Not much there for doing anything advanced with the portfolio math--I've used a separate spreadsheet to track things *as well as* use their reporting. The one catch with them I find is that when you put an order in you have to wait longer than you might expect for the process to complete--that is, even after the loan is *funded*, it still has to be *reviewed*, so the lead time before your money begins earning interest might be 2 weeks + 1 week of review time.
