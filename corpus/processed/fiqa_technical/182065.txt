Sorry for your loss. If the insurance money is now in an account under your names, you can might be able to withdraw the money. You should put a country tag and state tag on your question. EDIT: my initial response might incorrect -- see comments below. This is going to be state speficic and the amounts may be relevant. Best to seek professional advice!
