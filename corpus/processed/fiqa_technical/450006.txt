You're totally correct, but missed my point. The socialists in our society pushed for socialized healthcare, the free-marketers resisted. Punishing poor/unskilled workers was the end-result compromise. Personally I think the only reason this compromise exists is because the socialists elements of our society have a fundamentally naive view of how an economy works. It isn't because they are evil, it's just that their total focus on 'social-justice' blinds them from seeing the inevitable consequence of their actions. It's a similar problem to fundamental religionists needing to disregard science to remain true to their faith. Knowledge of science turns people towards atheism, knowledge of economics turns people towards free-markets. It's critical for one to find a mechanism to remain ignorant in order to hold on to such a world-view which is why few people 'jump ship' from athiesm to religion, or from free-marketer to socialist. It's a one way trip. Religion and socialism are psychologically and emotionally comforting and to a limited degree work well, especially in smaller communities in helping to coordinate a society to bring about positive results. So I'm not anti-socialist, nor anti-religionists, especially at the small scale. The problem is that because both of these movements rely on a certain kind of willful ignorance, their adherents are easily 'tricked' into working against their core motivations (love for humanity, justice for all). I said all that to say that you are correct in assuming I blame the socialist disproportionately, but I think this blame is justified. If they didn't have such an irrational/ignorate fear of the free market we wouldn't have such complex, unfair set of rules that tend to hurt the most disadvantaged in our society most.
