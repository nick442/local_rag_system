You won't get reported to a credit bureau for an overdraft, that's a service offered internal to the bank. The only way it would affect your credit score is if you had an overdraft fee that you didn't pay, which would get reported. There's is a system that gets a notice when you overdraft though. The bank MIGHT report you to ChexSystems, which is an agency that tracks the mishandling of accounts. Generally, a fee based overdraft is an agreement with you and the bank that they will charge you a fee, this is desirable to the bank, so they don't report to ChexSystems unless there's some sort of abuse. Banks view overdraft like a product for revenue generation and they encourage you to continue. Examples of abuse are: intentional overdrawing where the bank updates the account balances by batch jobs, so that you can overdraft 5x$1000 on an account that only has $1000+fees in it. Banks check ChexSystems to see if you have mishandled accounts to determine if you can open up another account, though they're mostly checking to see if you are leaving accounts in bad or negative status.
