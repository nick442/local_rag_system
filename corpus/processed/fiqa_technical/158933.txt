"> So basically, you think they are all bullshiters and don't understand anything. A significant number (or perhaps more correctly, the vast majority) of them are. And this is not just something that has only happened with recent ""digital"" technology or computers. >So really, the idea of any of them understanding technology would be practically impossible. No, it is certainly *possible* for them to understand technology.. it's just that for most people, well.. they just don't *want* to put in the mental effort; they don't want to comprehend the how/why something works (i.e. the underlying fundamentals) they generally want to get away with whatever minimal a level of ""training"" that allows them to achieve their immediate goals. When it comes to a lot of the C suite level people for the most part they are only concerned with *appearances* and motivating controlling others -- that usually means familiarity with and faking competence via jargon & buzzwords --their ""people"" are supposed to deal with the pesky little details of reality. And then (especially) when you get to businesses that are almost entirely about ""marketing"" -- well, appearance & perception are 90% (if not 99%) of the product."
