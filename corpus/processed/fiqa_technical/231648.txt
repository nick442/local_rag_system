Are you a senior? Do you have any internship experience? Move past alum. It doesn't have to be just them. You don't necessarily need a connection like that to them. Find a name and try to find a deal their group worked on. Or find a deal then figure out who worked on it. Shoot them an email saying you're working on a project and would like to know more about X and deal Y. After a few back and forths then you can ask. Keep it pushing my man. You'll get something. And it doesn't have to be some top firm. Fuck that mentality.
