Your numbers sound super off. Where exactly are you working? The starting salary for most CS jobs in SF/Bay Area is at LEAST 80k. Most of my friends in CS or anything marginally related in the Bay Area make closer to 150 at this point and at least half of them started with 90k+ starting salaries right out of school..I feel like you must be talking about a different part of the country. Although to be fair this study is pretty stupid because it doesn't take into account cost of living. 150k in SF is pretty much 75k in Chicago/Cleveland/Etc.
