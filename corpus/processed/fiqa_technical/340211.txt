I've just finished reading *The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies* by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. I thought this would be a book about technology but actually it was written by economists. Anyway, this book explains how inequality is caused by changes in technology. This 2013 book must have been very influential and inspired a million puff pieces, because I've heard all of its arguments before, but never explained so well.
