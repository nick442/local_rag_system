I didn't say I expect it, but it's not a waste. A degree has morphed from a competitive edge to a mere qualifier. A college undergrad degree is the new High School diploma. Few would hire a Taxi driver or Greeter without a diploma, and it's getting to the point where a degree is required for those jobs as well.
