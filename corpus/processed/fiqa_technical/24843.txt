I have no idea what you're talking about or why you think it relates to my point that good people cost money. You need good people in government. Letting managers make case-by-case decisions only makes sense if you have good managers. And I hate to break it to you - but lots of good people only do what they do for the money. This is true of doctors, lawyers, pilots, mechanics and janitors. To think otherwise is being childishly naive.
