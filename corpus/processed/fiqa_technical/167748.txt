"How will making energy cheaper help? The issue is that average earnings have barely moved since the 70's, inflation has sky-rocketed for necessities and for assets. My dad was making the same as I am now when he bought their first home for $40,000. My smaller place cost me $300,000+. That isn't fucking sustainable. Natural gas, gasoline, electricity, those are all tiny slices of pie in comparison to food and shelter. Then the American government makes all these shitty chess-play moves that they think will stimulate the economy but they don't take into account that civilians aren't entities that behave like ideal statistical models. They don't fucking understand that people are concerned about the viability of their futures. The whole thing is nose-diving into the ground. Read the the book ""The Death of Money"" by James Rickards, America is fucked and the politicians don't care because they will be financially OK and will pass the buck on to the next generation to deal with."
