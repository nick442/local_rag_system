Gross has proven he's no great money manager. Under-performance and consistent poor timing on his calls the past few years. I really wonder, does anyone listen to him anymore? He was bearish on equities, and they rallied big. He was bearish on US Treasuries in early 2011, and they rallied big. The guy is quickly becoming irrelevant within his own firm, if you ask me. PIMCO has many other top tier investment managers that provide more accurate advice, as far as recent history and practicality go.
