Your experience may be unique to you but the Chipotle I go to has a multi-racial group with people of varying ages. In some ways I like that younger people are working those places because that's what you do when you're young. In fact I prefer the staff to be younger because that's a group that needs money the most. I don't get the same level of hopeful cheeriness with a staff that's much older. Fast food jobs belong to the youth.
