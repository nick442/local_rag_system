I'm not hating on anyone, just agreeing that it's pretty much all older people or all younger people and not many in between. Not any one person's fault, just where human nature got us. Although I think that they (the vocal majority of my generation) think that once the boomers retire, when the government finally gets filled with people from our generation, and once we take over the large corporations, that things will get better for us. Which is the reason for lashing out. I just think we have a s**t load of problems that need to be fixed, and it seems like all we ever do is patch them up because the long term fixes are too costly in the short term, and that this cycle won't ever change. But look on the bright side, every generation will have a group they can blame and a group to be afraid of, so nothing will be anyone's fault. At least until it finally is and someone ends up paying the piper. Hell, it's not like I've experienced the good times, this is what I grew up in, so I don't really know any better. My generation doesn't expect to stay with the same company for their entire lives because we don't think it's possible. We've learned to adapt, we've had to. The smarter of us know to learn from your generations' mistakes (like saving for retirement).
