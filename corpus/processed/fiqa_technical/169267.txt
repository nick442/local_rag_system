"> * How did you get started? I realized there's little to no overhead for a service-based business, so I thought up a name and concept and spent a few hundred on licensing with the state. > * What kind of services do you offer? All the simple shit an average person can't do. OS upgrade, RAM upgrades, home entertainment installation and troubleshooting, purchase consulting, HIPAA compliance, and whatever else works for both me and my customer. > * Do you follow an ""Hourly Rate"" or ""Flat Rate"" payment system? Depends on the job, but usually hourly. My standard rate is $30 an hour, if you were wondering. I could charge more, but my rate is already flexible, so I don't really care to push away potential client experiences with a high price tag. > * What services make you the most income? The easy stuff. Upgrading a businesses machines. I get paid $30 an hour to reddit and click buttons, not because the business can't, but because they don't want to. > * What physical things would you recommend I acquire prior to getting started? Go on ifixit.com. Buy every unique tool they have. I wish I was kidding. > * How long until you were able to ""make a living"" from your business? I still don't because I'm in school. In theory, if I just doubled my hours per week, I'd be able to make more than enough to support myself for about four or less work days a week. > * What would you do differently if you were to start again from scratch? Not name the business after myself.. > * Any other tips / words of wisdom on how to make this work? Consultants only thrive on word of mouth. It's better to lose money supporting a client than losing their trust. Their recommendations mean EVERYTHING. Widespread dvertising is a good way to get a ton of one-time customers who don't respect your services or your rate."
