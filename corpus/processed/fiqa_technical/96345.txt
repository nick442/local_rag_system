I tend to agree that the need for liquidity is overplayed in this day and age. We live in a world of electronic transfers that take only a couple days at most. With my brokerage account I can go from stock to gas in my tank via debit card in about 3 days. We're a long way away from the days when it took weeks, phone calls, and physical checks in the mail to go from stock to cash in your hand. We've also moved a long way away from limited credit/debit card acceptance. It was not long ago that my mechanic didn't accept credit cards. Locksmiths didn't carry a square reader on their iPhone 10 years ago. However, don't expect debt to always be available. Many many many people with strong income and stellar credit histories had their credit/HELOC limits slashed from 2008-2010 while banks pared back risk. A cash position of a size that makes sense gives you a high level of short term control; you aren't reliant on someone else's money. Liquidity isn't the main issue with emergency funds. The main issue is psychological. Build a foundation rather than overly optimistically chasing yield.
