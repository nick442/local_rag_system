"Its so funny how people complain about the price of food - the price of food in the US (for the quality) is so far and away better than the food you get in other countries. Outside of large areas in developing countries you can't get fresh food at all - or if you do its off the back of a truck and the food is full of bugs and looks emaciated. The problem with Amazon entering the food market is that food is a penny-margin business. Walmart makes but a few cents on food sales - this is because the market for food is so large and is nearly perfectly competitive. If a tomato seller says ""im raising the price of my tomatoes 1c"", then Walmart will simply find another competitor to sell at -1c lower. The only way Amazon will be able to break into the market is by doing the two things they are doing now: 1. Buy a company that brings to market the same shit as everyone else but with a product differentiation (organic). This way they can front load the already expensive per ticket sales to hide step 2. 2. Make shopping more convenient. With the margins being so low - the cost of buying food at Amazon (at first) will be insanely expensive. Think wholefoods with a surcharge."
