My corner of the plant looks like a run down slum of cube spaces. Our stairs aren't even remotely close to up to code. We call the bathroom the shit hole. It honestly looks like someone abandoned this part of the building and high school kids have been trashing it for years. We keep getting assured that we're on the schedule to have things renovated in 2014. Or was it 2015.. The management areas (they don't entertain customers any more than we do) have pristine and new and very nice.
