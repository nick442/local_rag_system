Honestly it was because I wanted to start a meaningful discussion about it. I posted the article because it seems like to me from the article that it ONLY favors the big tech companies. The rules and regulations seem to stifle small businesses with reporting and restrictions. Considering this is a business subrreddit, I thought it was a meaningful discussion to start.
