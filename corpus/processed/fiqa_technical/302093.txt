Another thing to consider is how much longer you wish to stay in this home & what you will do with it when you move. I had planned on doing exactly this, but we are more likely to keep our home when we move out and use it as rental property. If we went down this route, we would have a lot of equity (perhaps even paid off) in our home, but would have little left to save towards the next home down payment.
