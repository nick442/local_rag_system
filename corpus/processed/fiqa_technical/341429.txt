I just cancelled Fresh because of the monthly fee and the fact that they were always out of things we wanted to order. We switched to a local grocery chain that offers delivery and online order pickup. They have more delivery times available, better stock and no monthly fee. I'll definitely check out Fresh again once they get some good integration with the WFM stores.
