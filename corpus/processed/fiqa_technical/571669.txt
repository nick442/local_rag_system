"I like to turn it into a bit of a joke. Like ""yeah right, like I'd spill the beans! What's your next question? How much we pay our engineers!!"" Then laugh and smile, if you have a really good ""guys"" type relationship you can do a bit of a sholder punch. Play it off like a spy vs spy type thing. Like how bond can share a drink with the enemy."
