If you don't mind a question: you're bullish until [fill this slot] will happen? Personally i'm not bearish but i'm out of this market and i'm waiting, aware that i'm losing some money but risk come fast and i prefer not hedging my gains of last years. Still having a small position on some ETFs USD/JPY cross.
