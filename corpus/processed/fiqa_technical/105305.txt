There's this widespread assumption that Apple intends to release a smartwatch yet no clues whatsoever have come out of Apple suggesting that's what Apple's wearable is going to be. Nobody in the tech press is considering that it might not be a watch, and I don't think it will be. I'll bet Apple is tickled to see LG, Samsung, and Motorola all scrambling to get their latest wrist devices to market ahead of Apple's phantom phonewatch.
