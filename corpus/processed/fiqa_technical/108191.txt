"I appreciate your perspective, but I think it's fairly obvious that the ""made with 100% chicken"" thing is intended to hornswaggle, in some small way, consumers who aren't carefully evaluating food labels. There ain't no such thing as a crazy 50% chicken/turkey hybrid bird that could have contributed its meat to your chicken nuggets. If a thing is made with any chicken at all, then at some level it is ""made with 100% chicken."" Clearly we know the food manufacturer would prefer to say ""made with 100% chicken"" rather than ""made with chicken"" because while both are legal and both completely technically accurate, the former is the one that is used. The fact that they want to use it means that they are probably hoping people misinterpret the 100% to mean something it doesn't, because the 100% actually stands for nothing. The alternative to 100% is a logical impossibility."
