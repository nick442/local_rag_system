Correct. What exactly is Uber spending its money on? Their platform service has no inherent capital costs. They're not renting a fleet. Amazon is creating distribution centers and cutting prices in order to undercut existing distributors. Tesla is creating gigafactories and supercharging stations, as well as reinvesting in innovation for solar panel tiles and electric 18 wheelers. Uber beat taxis a long time ago. Their prices were good since at least 2014. What are they spending money on? Software dev?
