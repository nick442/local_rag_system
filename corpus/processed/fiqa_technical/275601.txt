I don't understand how this gets propped up on reddit all the time. Before a candidate works at a job, he and his employer reach an agreement on what the pay will be. If the candidate doesn't agree, he doesn't work there. If the minimum wage was $0, and an employer advertised a wage of a penny an hour, no one would take that job which forces the employer to go without an employee, or the employer increases the compensation to entice candidates to apply. If a candidate agrees to work for whatever pay is mutually agreed upon, where is the harm?
