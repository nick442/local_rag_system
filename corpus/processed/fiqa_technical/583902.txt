"The TSA has to stop terrorists 100% of the time (current record: 0%). Terrorists just have to get through once (current record: 100% through TSA, stopped by passengers). I don't trust that the TSA would be able to secure the trusted traveler program any more than they secure people right now. The ""my metal detector wasn't plugged in"" thing just reinforces my idea of them. But behavioral detection can work, Israel has shown that. Of course their agents are truly trained on it and do direct interviews as opposed to just scanning a crowd. This would make that even less effective that it is now."
