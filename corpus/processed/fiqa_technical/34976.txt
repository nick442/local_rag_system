Someone needs to tell the LinkedIn developers that the recommendation for a low-salt diet does not extend to their code. Salting hashes is a pretty basic security measure. I have to wonder what other basic security practices are missing there. Clearly there is at least one other issue, since the hackers were able to access the hashes to begin with. BTW, changing your password now is a good idea, but I'd also change it again after LinkedIn has confirmed they have both started salting and have corrected whatever security flaw revealed the hashes. Until then there is no reason to believe your new password is any safer or more secret than the old one.
