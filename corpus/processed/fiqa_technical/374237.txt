"There's little to make short flights suck less, but that 90 minute flight from Buffalo/Rochester to JFK (common for some civil servants here) won't totally wreck a person. That said, in a lot of those cases, the perks are comped because courting regular government business is good business for the airline. Longer flights with layovers, that nice lounge to spend the layover in, a nicer meal than a stale sandwich and bag of peanuts, and possibly even enough room to catch a little more shuteye, those are perks. So is being able to offer more time at home with family, etc. Also, if you're in travel status, you're getting paid per diems plus in some cases additional wages outright for the time you spend outside your normal working hours traveling. It's not as much of a cost savings as all that when compared to other factors. People see ""ooooh look at that extravagant public servant, ripping off the taxpayer by taking more than they need"" and don't consider the whole picture. Which is why most people should never be executives or even middle managers."
