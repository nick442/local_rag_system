With trillion dollar plus deficits, it's not like we're running an austerity program here. When you say sacrifice, compared to what? Two trillion dollar deficits? Your observation of constant predictions of imminent doom is valid. The timeline has been extended by a series of bubbles- market, housing, fiscal deficits.. The shortcoming of doom prognosticators is that they underestimate the willingness of those in power to do whatever it takes to prolong the status quo, regardless of the long term consequences. The game is perpetuated by ever increasing debt, and government became the borrower of last resort once the rest of the economy was tapped out. The govt's ability to continue along this course in the open market is questionable as the Fed appears to be monetizing a large portion of newly issued debt. The end game is a currency crisis. It's nice to have a timeline accompanying a prediction, and critical for investing, but it is often very difficult to do, and in this case, it has been extremely difficult because the policy decisions have been rational from the perspective of elites maintaining their status, but not optimal from the standpoint of solving the problem. That doesn't mean the predictions are useless though. You could live in a flood zone and not be able to predict with accuracy when the next flood will occur, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't prepare. Given the uncertainty with timing this, it seems to me the best course of action is not to try to time it, especially with respect to investing based on market timing, but to prepare the best you can for what will inevitably eventually occur.
