The simple answer should be easy to find: Call your local place, inquire about the price, and then divide that cost by the cost of shaving supplies per year (don't forget to account for your time!) to get the number of years it would have to last to reach the break-even point. Some have indicated that laser hair removal does not last forever; if it does not last at least as long as the break-even point, then it is not more economical. If it does, then it is. This is only one data point in the decision, but it should be fairly straightforward to calculate. Like all grooming services, I expect there is a range of prices, so you may want to call more than one location.
