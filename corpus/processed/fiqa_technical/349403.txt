"This is an unrelated subreddit, so I want to avoid starting unwanted discussion out of common courtesy. I am merely trying to reach out. But a joke among firearms enthusiasts goes thusly: > *Guy: ""Look, not only are you losing the arguments on home defense and hunting, but even if you weren't, the Second Amendment isn't about those things, it's about the ability to rebel against tyranny.""* > *Narrator: ""That's paranoid and insane. A government will never become tyrannical!""* > *Guy: ""What do you think of Donald Trump.""* > *Narrator: ""He's literally Hitler. He wants to put Muslims and Women in FEMA camps.""* Also just a friendly tip, publicly advocating for violent overthrow is a prohibiting offense. You can never purchase a firearm from the closest thing we have to ""militia"" stock. Please consider what you have just posted to social media. *(Also consider these have been continually expanded to include ""feel good"" restrictions. [Such as calling someone the wrong gender pronoun.

I just wanted to point out certain groups have thrown away the ability to ""#Resist"", in the morbid hypothetical you point out."
