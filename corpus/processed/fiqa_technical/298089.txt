I started a group last year called The Creative Coalition of Southern Illinois, our aim is to help artists network and collaborate with other artists. We also provide classes and set up local events. Something like that would be of interest to me as my group is still quite unorganized and would love to learn how to organize things better. I'm also interested in setting up systems/networks to help artists find jobs. I'm open to many different types of art start ups, I love art and would enjoy being involved in most projects. What do you know of?
