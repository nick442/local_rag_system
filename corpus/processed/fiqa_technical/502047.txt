The worst thing I've been seeing is interviewing for a position, requiring a ton of experience with specialized technologies, waiting almost a month of back and forth interviews and screenings and finding out that the position is below entry level pay. Oh, this job requires 7+ years experience and pays $50k-$55k? GTFO. That might be an OK salary in Frogballs, AR, but in my area, that's entry level helpdesk pay. So you have a foozeball table and offer free snacks, that doesn't pay the bills.
