"Oh! Well, on that mark, we are in agreement! But we need to get to the source of the issue so we can correct it properly, rather than blanketing it as ""the government"". Sources of issues: 1) Lobbyists for special interests can actually push through garbage bills due to lack of knowledge by, and financial influences over, congress. 2) Regulation groups are also infested with Lobbyists and special interest groups whose goals are counter to the regulating. Regulators are being financially influenced as well. 3) Voting is manipulated by Gerrymandering and inadequate voting systems. First Past the Post removes choice from the voters in favor of the preferences of a ""faux"" two part system. 4) Bills that already disrupt the healthy economic working of the nation are already in place and causing damage. Things like the Post Office need revamped to foster competition rather than stifle it. What else am I missing in this list?"
