Well, that's a loaded question. You're assuming the goals that QE is attempting to accomplish are desirable. I advocate the abolition of central banking. I believe it causes more problems that it solves. Booms and busts have actually happened more frequently after the creation of the Fed (in the US). The QE scheme is designed to keep the central banking model afloat at the expense of the 99%. I don't believe there needs to be an alternative, because I don't believe this type of manipulation should ever be done. It invites obvious corruption, pushes legitimate problems down the road and creates an even bigger problem for future generations to deal with.
