> I follow bitcoin more than you think. I suspect I understand it better than you do. My apologies, I didn't mean to be rude. Although hey now, I'm pretty knowledgeable! :P > This would stand in stark contrast to the repeated denials by the hodlers that bitcoin can't be regulated Oh bitcoin can absolutely be regulated and banned and the governments are already working on these tracking tools already. Yet to ban bitcoin in 2014 would almost be equivalent to banning the internet in 1999. It hasn't yet reached mass adoption but to ban it after so much development has gone into it, and after so many people have shown the opportunity with it, that to ban it would signal error/mistrust towards the government. *Let's ignore that though* Even if it's palatable for governments to ban bitcoin *(as did Equador just recently actually)* all it does is cause the currency to go to the underground markets. It won't be banned globally and people won't have access to their accounts severed: the governments will just make it difficult to use and create bitcoin businesses within the country officially. Thus with this in mind, would a government want to create a regulated and highly-watched industry or push everything into the dark where they have no control? If they do it doesn't make bitcoin go away it just pushes it towards other countries and causes certain citizens to increase their distaste towards governments. It's interesting to see the different incentives play against each other.
