Let me add a counterpoint. I don't know about you, but for some psychological reason, when I know I have an abundance of something I tend to be less frugal about the way I consume it. For example: When there is a six pack of cokes in the fridge I feel like I am more prone to not drink them up so quickly so I have some for later on. However, if I knew I had 3 more cases in the pantry, I seem to go through a lot more of them.
