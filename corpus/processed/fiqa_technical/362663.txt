This is the second article I read this week where these casual chains blame Millennials. Neither mention that, perhaps, people just don't really value going to a restaurant and being served microwaved and fried pre-cooked junk. Glamorized TV dinners. The vast majority of the time when a restaurant fails, it's because the food isn't good. It's not demographics or whatever else they want to blame it on. The. Food. Sucks.
