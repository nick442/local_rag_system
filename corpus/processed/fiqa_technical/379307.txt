"Finally some good examples! So clearly this is an issue, and many large companies do similar shenanigans. But the divisions being cut are massively unprofitable anyhow, even with these crappy tricks. I agree that a company like GE should be looking long term, but I'm not sure what % they do in technology R&D so I'm not prepared to be too harsh on that front. I absolutely agree that having non software engineers write software is a long term failure. Even smart engineers who can pump out software often do so without having learned the lessons that software companies learn. Resulting in short term results followed by long term pain. Anyhow. Thanks for a real response. I wonder if the divisions being cut need to be cut or sold off regardless. But I think every large org should look at examples like this and not try to play the ""this quarter is good"" game."
