2012 is the year when more and more people will be proud to wear their logo. Embroidery Workshop, based in Lancing has been embroidering and printing products including workwear, schoolwear, sportswear, helping you personalize your outfits and much more. Wearing your logo is a great way to promote your business, club, community, organization and give more awareness to what you do and where you come from, your website and how people can get hold of you. This all helps to give that personal professional image and pride in your organization. One of the great things about including your logo on staff uniform is that they look more professional, are more motivated and convey the business image. Julian Hendy, Managing Director of the Embroidery Workshop said, “The logo represents your branding and communicates a uniform message without words or language. Your business core values are conveyed by your logo. You have it on your stationary, business cards, promotional materials, so why not also on your clothing? This is a different way to make an impression when meeting people, especially in networking situations.” Another benefit of wearing your logo is more online visibility, better positions in search engine rankings, more awareness about your business and more traffic to your website Included in all the pricing is one FREE embroided logo or texts per clothing and special requests are very welcome.
