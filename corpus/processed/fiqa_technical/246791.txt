Thank you for responding. This all happened Friday night and I've been doing the job alone this weekend to offset the cost. I do very itemized invoices and planned on showing the difference there but, honestly, wasn't wanting to verbalize it to the client out of embarrassment. I knew it would have been an unprofessional move not to say anything and, admittedly, hoped I could find a way around it. But, you're right and I'll go ahead and do both. Note: 10 years I've been doing this and I feel like my 12 year old self putting my terrible report card on the dining table for my mom to see and sign as I head out the door for school:(
