">economists like to just ignore it for the benefits that it offers.. that's what i tend to think- my dad has a phd in economics, he's given me quite a few lectures over the years, and that's the feeling i get from him- he of course refuses to acknowledge it most of the time. i think the most i've gotten him to concede is, ""yes, it's a game, but if you don't play it, you'll be pushed around by people who do."""
