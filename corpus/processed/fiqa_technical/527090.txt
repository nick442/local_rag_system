"When one says that ""corporations are people"", in a legal sense, they are saying that they have the ability to enter into binding legal agreements in a manner similar to people. This allows corporations to do things like own a building or a car, or enter into a contract. This is so that an individual does not have to do so. This keeps individuals from being liable for the activities of the corporation (it also keeps the individual from running off the the corporation's car or selling the corporation's building). If they are using it in any sense other than the legal sense, it's either hyperbole, ignorance, or pandering. Now, if you set yourself up as LettersFromTheSky, Inc, then you would very well be able to get all the same tax deductions and benefits as a corporation. But you would also be liable for everything that a corporation is liable for (namely, a higher standard of reporting and different accounting methods)."
