"Okay I am not apart of Silicon Valley and do not know the culture but I don't want to jump to conclusions right away. How many female entrepreneurs are actually trying in Silicon Valley? There's a lot of talk about the amount of money but that means shit if 95% of entrepreneurs seeking funding are men. If you told me, no, women are seeking funding just as much as men but receive nowhere near as much money as them then I'd instantly argue there's a problem. But these numbers sound a lot like the ""women make 70% of what men make!!"" number when we all can agree that that data is misleading as fuck and have filled a bunch of young girls heads with the idea that they will make less then what their male counterparts make. I just want to make sure we have our facts straight. Regardless the anecdotes in the article are pretty bad."
