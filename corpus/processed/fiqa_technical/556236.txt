"That's actually a really cool feature, **but**.. TFA doesn't say a single word about loans. I *believe* you, it's just not mentioned. I don't get all the hate I'm seeing over not divining the ""obvious"" value of investing in something that (when used as intended) I can't have until I die. **Thank you** for giving me one possible explanation of how to make this work, but everyone else needs to chill. ""If a 45-year-old, non-smoking man were to contribute $2.5 million to an IDF for four years, the investment would be worth $113 million within 40 years"" .. ""Beneficiaries get their money when the insured person dies. For products structured correctly, there arenâ€™t any levies on death benefits."" Is it *really* so absurd that I failed to see how that applies to literally 99.*99*% of the population?"
