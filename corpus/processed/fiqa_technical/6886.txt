I'd recommend LinkedIn instead for this purpose. I'm an admin for a business page on both platforms and in the US, Facebook is highly competitive paying little attention to group affiliates, more focused on consumers or prospects. You are lucky to even get a like from a vendor. LinkedIn however has groups directly associating B2B.
