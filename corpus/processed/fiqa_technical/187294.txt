"The firms listed as protesting - Google, Facebook, Amazon, Reddit, AirBnB, Twitter and Snapchat - almost to a ""T"" (sans Amazon) rely on the free delivery of content model to survive. Of all of these, Google benefits most due to the advertising revenues. I pay for the New York Times because I find that it's quality journalism. I don't pay for the Huffington Post because it's shit journalism. If it was no longer free to deliver that sort of content, the NYT would survive; the Huffer's Post wouldn't. And is that what we're fighting for here? The right for the Huffington Post to scrape content off the web, provide it for free, then earn money off of advertising for grabbing our eyeballs? Think about who you're carrying water for here."
