> which is why i find it wrong that interest for money collected in a given financial year is announced after the end of the next financial year. Oh, I may have misunderstood. Generally it would be reported at the end of the *same* year. I'm a little intrigued as to why it's waiting a year to be reported.. are contributions reported elsewhere?
