Honestly, why not? If my goal is to end up in finance, then I need to understand, from people in that field, whether a certain subject is relevant for me to achieve that goal. If I were to ask that question to those majoring/working in physics, then I am going to get a completely different outlook that's not beneficial for me. What you don't realize is that when you are asking your peers in school, many of them give you half answers or even bogus ones. It makes perfect sense to ask the question in a forum. As a matter of fact, the answers that I am getting here are completely different from what I was originally told by my peers.
