"What you're pretty systematically failing to appreciate is the **pain** felt by people during structural unemployment. Yes, they should get an education, but guess what, they're probably too old for it to be worth or so far behind on the education ladder that it'd be a real struggle. Maybe they should move to a city where there are jobs, but moving is expensive and so is living in a city. The libertarian arguments here have the same problem as the (more extreme) arguments about civil rights. Yes, the ""equilibrium"" will converge to a society without discrimination, where people get educated because low-skilled jobs don't pay much anymore, etc. But those arguments completely neglect the pain of getting from here to there. Maybe you think the government always screws things up (despite pretty glaring arguments to the contrary), and maybe you think the free market always ends up with the most efficient solution (despite some pretty glaring examples to the contrary), but that still doesn't mean that inefficient government programs that cost the future (GDP, whatever that means) can't be an appropriate means of reducing the overall suffering of the populace in both the short and long term."
