This is great news. Proving that Comcast is effectively (albeit indirectly) throttling specific traffic would be difficult in court, to a judge or jury. But regulators have significant expertise. They will understand Netflix's arguments. Also, since Netflix has signed a deal, they will not look like outsiders just wishing to join the party. They are complaining about their own business partners! I now expect the Comcast/TimeWarner merger to be stopped. Lobbying won't help them at this point, so I wouldn't be surprised if Comcast starts running ads to buttress their weak case.
