Having 20% of your portfolio in P2P lending sounds really aggressive to me. When we have another recession, a lot of those loans are going to be bad and having a big chunk of 20% of your portfolio vanish could sting pretty good. I wouldn't go into it with more than the sum you are willing to lose and not be too upset.
