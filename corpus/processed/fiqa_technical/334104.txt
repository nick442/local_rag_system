That is a false equivalence. That worked because Microsoft is in a dominant position, owns the channel and could afford to lose money on its platform for a long time. I don't remember how long MSFT lost money on the XBox. It might still be doing it and making money some other way, Would XBox have even worked if all Microsoft did was to charge a monthly fee for using the XBox, while the rest of the platform was owned by Sony(or Nintendo) and they had a strong incentive to not let MS succeed?
