In Phoenix you can get a two bedroom for $600/mo in an okay neighborhood if you know where/when to look, and a bit cheaper if you're willing to go a bit skeezier. Since we are talking minimum wage, you should be hopefully be able to find a job within biking distance (or, if you live in Tempe, take the free bus.) Have one person work mornings and the other work evenings/nights and you don't need daycare. (Other options: have them stay with a nearby family member, trade off watching the kids with other working families, or go for a three bedroom, grab a family member, and have someone work a 20-hr week instead.) Electricity averages to something like $100/mo over the course of the year (my high was about $150, low was around $40 in a two-bedroom.) So ~$700/mo for shelter, maybe $30/mo for a bus pass. That's $730/mo. I'm not saying it would be comfortable, but it can be done.
