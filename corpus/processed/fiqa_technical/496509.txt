I don't understand what the conclusion you came to is, as well as how that differs from the economy. Positions on Immigration policy, NHS, Public Service, and etc. are normally derived from an opinion of how those factors effect the economy and the individuals bottom line. Minimum wage, unemployment, health care, infrastructure, and etc., all have fiscal correlation. On top of that, I don't really see any conclusion and how that correlates to David Cameron. Maybe I'm showing an inability, but I don't feel like I gathered any information from the article.
