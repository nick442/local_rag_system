I hate that this thread is all binary, either it's the fault of the individual or the fault of the society. Isn't it obviously both? Some of it is lifestyle inflation (which is understandable considering our parents generation was one of the wealthiest in human history). Some of it is the automation throwing a wrench into unskilled/lowskilled labor. The article says it's a function of stagnating wages while housing and other traditional expenses keep climbing. If that's true (which I think it is based [on this and other studies](http://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/)) then why aren't we having conversations about WHY this is happening.
