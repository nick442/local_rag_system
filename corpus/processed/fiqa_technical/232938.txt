> They specifically say that is not true, there is no genetic explanation You really can't read, huh.. They specifically say that they haven't found the specific genetic explanation yet (because the genome is still too complex to link specific haploids to specific parts of nervous system development), that doesn't mean there isn't one. Differences in gene inheritance absolutely affect intelligence, the brain is part of biology. Just like how black people are genetically more prone to obesity after controlling for diet/metabolism, despite the fact that we don't understand the precise genetic mechanism yet. Even grade-school psych/bio101 nature vs. nurture, nobody argues for pure nurture. The IQ metric holds up fine, as it correlates with nearly every broad measure of socioeconomic success and many other lifestyle measures as shown above. It's your shitty reading comprehension and misconceptions about the scientific research process that is preventing you from understanding and accepting the basic concept that people of very different ancestry have a correspondingly different cognitive makeup.
