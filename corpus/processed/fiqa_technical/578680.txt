Nope. I live in an Arizona city that doesn't have *anything* like Seattle's growth. Arizona raised the minimum wage in November. Many companies have closed their doors. Come here and see for yourself. Others, mostly restaurants, raised their prices. Traffic dropped off. You know why? Because food prices at the supermarket stayed about the same. Restaurants got more expensive. The option is to buy food and cook at home. Which - *fucking obviously* - people are doing. I'm doing this. People I talk to are doing this. You do not need a Ph.D. in economics to figure this one out. And you can take your left-wing propaganda and shove it up your ass. If you think you're so correct, then open a business and show everyone how you can do well selling an overpriced product. Go ahead. Show us.
