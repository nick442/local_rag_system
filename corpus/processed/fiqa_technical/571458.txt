I took it after I'd only taken one finance class and was in the process of taking another. I did below average on the subjects I hadn't taken classes in (corp, investment banking) and above average in the classes I had taken/was currently taking (financial statement analysis, economics, math, verbal, others). It's pretty straight forward, if you've taken classes on the subjects that are covered then you should do above average on them all unless you just didn't pay attention and got C's. I don't remember my final score because it was over a year ago but I do remember it was above average, but not by much, which was disappointing to myself, but expected because of my lack of practical finance knowledge at the time.
