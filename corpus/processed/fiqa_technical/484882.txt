We have had to let at least 4 people go from entry level assembly and warehouse picking positions when we try to transition them from temps to full time. Of course we have warned all of them multiple time that there will be a drug test when they move to full time. I know the last one was due to cocaine, which really doesn't make sense to me but it's a barrier that the company is not getting rid of because if you are not able to get clean even just long enough to get hired there is a good chance of other issues as an employee. Especially when most of these positions involve driving forklifts and delivery vehicles.
