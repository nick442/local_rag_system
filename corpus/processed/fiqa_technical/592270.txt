Similar story with the last big corporate company I worked for. One of the major hotel chains dicked around our CEO and next thing you know, there's a ban on certain hotels - as in, all 50,000 employees are forbidden to stay at those hotels when on company business. And that company spent *millions* each year on hotels.
