The maintenance of roads is largely funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. Since the amount of fuel you consume roughly correlates with the wear you cause the roads these very closely resemble a user fee. It's the same with tolls. Those who use the resource pay for it (and they pay it typically to a state toll authority not a private company). Now some larger transportation capital improvement projects, like reworking a major intersection or a new bridge, will rely on grants and direct taxes but mostly its fuel taxes funding everything.
