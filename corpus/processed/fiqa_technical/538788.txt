">Exactly right. ""Tax incentives"" do not mean that the state is giving Apple a trunk full of cash. This is NOT strictly true. If the area has (and I am fairly certain it does) [""tax incremental financing""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_increment_financing) then a lot of the underlying costs of bringing facilities to an area -- costs associated with road construction, utility changes, etc -- are funded via municipal bonds and other taxpayer-based financing (which of course the companies that are part of these ""deals"" are given a multi-year pass on paying)."
