> Using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment. Do you believe this kind of belief perpetuates the problem? If you look at the data, roughly 20% of college graduates will do *really well* for themselves, which is difficult to ignore. But when you look at the remaining 80% of graduates, the income distributions start to look a lot like those who have less education. You being a financial advisor, I'm sure you are aware that the early years are the utmost important ones for saving. The prevailing idea has been that a degree will earn you more than the other opportunity costs over the remainder of your career, but that is based on the aforementioned top 20% who really serve to skew the data to the casual calculator. With that, the typical highly education person ends up getting hit with no only massive debt, but loses a ton of early earning potential, and often cannot convert that education into a higher income than anyone else. It comes as no surprise to me that this group has the biggest debt problems.
