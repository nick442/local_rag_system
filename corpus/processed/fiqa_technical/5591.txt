You have to take into account the correlations of the securities across the three different markets. It's definitely not as simple as dividing by three. The reason why I don't think this is correct is because you can imagine an exchange in which there is only one other security, and the asset in question is perfectly correlated and therefore has a beta of 1. You could then have a different exchange with thousands of securities where the asset has a beta of 0.3. The simple average method would produce a beta of .65, when it's probably true that the correct answer is closer to 0.3. The solution is not generalizable so I don't think it can be right. It neglects the relative sizes of the exchanges and the correlation of the underlying assets with each other. Which leads me to consider, perhaps the right thing to do is to calculate the returns across all three exchanges and the returns of the asset on all three exchanges, do a weighted average and use that variance/covariance to calculate the beta across all three exchanges. I'm not sure what purpose, practically, such a beta would serve. I think the correct answer is to take the beta of the asset with respect to the largest (most diversified) exchange. Ultimately, using a basket of securities like the S&P 500 is just a proxy for ""the market"", whatever that means. It doesn't truly represent the realm of possibilities for the diversified investor, but it's close enough tl,dr: I say pick one exchange and go with it"
