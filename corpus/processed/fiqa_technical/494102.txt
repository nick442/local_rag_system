Don't underestimate the degree to which it seemed like Microsoft essentially *was the entire computer industry* in 2000. Apple's comeback was only understood by a few of us, the smart phone market didn't exist, and Microsoft Office and networking solutions were dominating almost everything they competed in. Hell, Internet Explorer was even considered the final word in browsers at the time (Firefox was two years off). Betting on Microsoft in 2000 was like betting on computers - assuming computers were a growth market (and even after the .com bubble, no one really expected computers in general to do anything but grow) then Microsoft was going to grow. Point is, Microsoft in 2000 was the king of the technology world to a degree that is hard to appreciate in 2014. They were beyond dominant - they were God.
