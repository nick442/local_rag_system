I know you don't want to hear this, but your life is anecdotal. What you have lived applies to you and no one else. It's easy to make decisions based on emotions and your story is an emotional one. But if you read my words and look at my links we are not that far apart. A single grandmother with a disabled daughter raising her grandson is the definition of moving the process along. You would be hard pressed to find someone in a very poor country that would object to helping that scenario and certainly not in the Western World. The real question is how did she end up in that situation. Much like the $22 Trillion spent on poverty, the aid she received before you came along did not help her or her daughters. The system in place did not work. The fact that you somehow clawed out of there while people around you were doomed to a much different fate shows that you are the exception to the system helping, not the rule. Now let's move on to FUCKING SOLUTIONS, no slogans (as you aptly put it). 1.Baltimore has been going down hill for 50 years. What needs to change? 2.Detroit same. What needs to change? We can agree that trickle down is not the answer (although pure free market would be Fantastic)..
