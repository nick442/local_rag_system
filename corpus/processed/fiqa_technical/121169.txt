Taxation of the rich is slightly different than laws about a lot of the things you mention. I'm not gay and have nothing against gay getting married (and getting the same rights as other married couples) I don't use drugs, but have nothing against legalizing drugs (it has worked wonders in Portugal the last 10-15 years) What I DO find strange is, that rich people are NOT expected to pay the same _percentage_ of their income as poor people . regardless of the amount they end up paying.
