"Thank you for the great explanation, but there is an aspect of this that has eluded me the 10 times I've attempted to understand it over the years. When you give the 12-Loddar IOU to the shoemaker, I have two problems of understanding: (a) In October, I am going to owe 12 apple-bushels to ""the economy"", so isn't the 12-Loddar IOU cancelled out? Really, the 12-Loddar IOU is a pre-order. (b) If we take your metaphor to the modern age, handwritten IOUs won't work anymore; they have to be central-bank-printed notes; so the central bank does have to expand the money supply, doesn't it?"
