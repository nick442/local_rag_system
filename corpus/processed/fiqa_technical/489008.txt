I don't know. Who's to say the internet won't take over here as well. Who needs satellite radio when you have pandora and unlimited data plans on your phone which connects to your car. Sure right now it is cumbersome but in a few years.. radio may find itself in dire straights as well. Although i agree for the time being it is better protected than TV.
