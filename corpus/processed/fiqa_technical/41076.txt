> That is likely to require some extra work Surely there are jobs that can get done on-time in 40 hours/week. It's one thing when you *sometimes*, in an *exceptional* situation, need more than that, but if a job *consistently* requires overtime, doesn't that just indicate incredibly bad planning on the employer's part? > At the same time there is no reason to believe that significant professional challenges will necessarily fit neatly into standardized work time arrangements. Then what about the people whose jobs can get done in *less* than 40 hours/week?
