"Once a person has learned to read, write, and do basic mathematics, it is then up to each individual to make something of their own life. I am sitting here typing away on a box with access to all the world's libraries and I can learn anything I want. I don't need the royal ""we"" to do a god damn thing, its already been done, I need to get off my fat ass and take control and responsibility of my own life. So many educated people out there paying for that education they could have had for free working in industries they didn't need that degree to work in. What ""we"" need to do is stop encouraging that bullshit and protect the facilitators of cheap/free information."
