Thank you so much for this valuable info. Really love reddit for these personal answers, I wish I could talk to you all on the phone :D I'll spell out my situation a little more clearly, maybe you'll be able to direct me the right way. Graduated with an average GPA, business admin. I want to continue this path towards finance and I've been told by a few people the best thing to do is get an i banking job, then figure out what I really want to do in life (this way I have a solid resume). Been trying to leverage my puny network and I've been unsuccessful in getting a job, though I've paid for many lunches :\ Basically, I want to show I am smart and capable because the last thing employers have to go on is my gpa. Could there be a better solution?
