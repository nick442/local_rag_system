No, they aren't. So the fact they are willing to essentially take bribes is worse than Comcast. Comcast has 1 goal: to make money. They are doing that very well, can't blame them there. The government has one goal: run the country as effectively as possible. They are sacrificing that goal for money. That's worse.
