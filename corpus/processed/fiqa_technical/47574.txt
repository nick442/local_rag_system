"Between the top two manufacturers (not including Nintendo, because they're in their own bracket) I easily see Sony being the only traditional home console manufacturer in the next 10 or so years. I think there will still be the ""Xbox"" but it's going to be a much different system than what's currently offered. Either with a more PC-like interface or eventual Xbox service integration on all Windows computers."
