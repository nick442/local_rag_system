It's much cheaper, far better for the environment (in both extraction and greenhouse gases), easier to extract, more energy dense, easier to control the production of energy in response to demand with.. its only loss to coal is ease of storage. It doesn't matter if we have a lot of it if using alternative options is a superior option. Just because we have it doesn't mean it's worth extracting or using."
