You’re using logic, reason, optimism, and wishful thinking. I’m using cynicism. In New Orleans, we were not allowed to sue the clearly-at-fault, criminal, negligent, lying, guilty-A-F, corps of engineers nor even their fraudulent or incompetent sub contractors that built shoddy levees because “immunity.” “Grouping together” is greatly discouraged by the status quo. I hope I’m wrong. I do.
