Successful people run into bad situations all the time. Instead of giving up, they work around it and find a way to succeed anyway. You don't see how many failures a successful person actually had before succeeding, which is why you are attributing it to luck. As an example, the South park guys were rejected 10 times before finally getting accepted.
