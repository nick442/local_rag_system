I used to work at a Wendy's. I recently told a Co-Worker and they were asking for all the horror stories. Honestly, nothing foul happened there at all. Food is prepped fresh, very few things are microwaved. They were surprised the chili was made on premises and not dumped from huge can or something. It was clean. I still eat at Wendys too. Good shit.
