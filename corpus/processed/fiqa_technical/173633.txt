Same for me! Chatting with friends after school and then sneaking to stay on for longer after my mom went to bed. This was hard to do because the family computer was in my mom's bedroom! So, I would carefully position a blanket over the monitor and then drape that down my back to cover up the light emanating from it. I still don't know if she knew I did that.. I thought I was so clever but she probably knew. :)
