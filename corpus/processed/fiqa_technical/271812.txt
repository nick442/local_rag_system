Look for an internship, probably in San Fran there are a lot of opportunities. I'd suggest going through Glassdoor, LinkedIn and other job sites. Perhaps during the year you can flip burgers as its a more student flexible job, and supplement the extra by working as a software engineer during the summers. If you need resume tips feel free to PM. Goodluck!
