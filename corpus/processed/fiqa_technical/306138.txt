The problem is that at full employment demand in the market is supposed to increase as people spend money. More money in the market means more inflation, but because wages have not risen even at full unemployment inflation is not rising. If it is not rising the problem is that it might really be deflating, deflation is the enemy of the rich as the price for goods, services and assets decline.
