"I know many people who would recommend joining a credit union. They're typically local and are not-for-profit entities (not non-profit like a charity). The ""customers"" are actually members who cooperatively provide financial services to the other members. Oftentimes if there's a surplus of profits at the end of the year, they divvy them up to the members based on how many accounts they have, what their balances are, loans, etc."
