While you are correct, engine tuning isn't as nefarious. A common issue is someone who has no business buying a sports car will go out and buy a sports car. And, if they are not tuned to drive like a sedan, they will get brought back the next day. You will have people that spin out when the light turns green, just because their car has 500+hp and they don't know how to drive it. So, paying for tuning, sounds more like custom software, than an on/off switch of the batteries.
