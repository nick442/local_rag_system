As a business analyst, you'll work within an organization, to manage change and plan for the future in line with company goals. This could be for one specific project, or as a permanent of the Business Analysis organization. You'll need to understand a current organizational situation, identify future needs and create solutions to help those needs, usually (but not always) in relation to info and software systems.
