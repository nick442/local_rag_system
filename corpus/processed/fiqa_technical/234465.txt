In practice momentum and trend following are two different ideas, albeit similar and often ocurr simultaneously. I don’t know if the book makes a clear disctinction between the two but keep this in mind: 1) Momentum trading is a trade where prices are increasing/decreasing and an increasing rate usually confirmed by heavy volume. Like you said, this can often be at the top of a bubble or nearing a bottom of a crash but not necessarily. It may also occur when trend trading is violated (switching directions or a new trend emerging) 2) Trend following is a trade where one could draw a disctinct linear line in a chart (up or down at some angle). Being able to draw a line into the future would be your projected ‘trend’ target. You could buy now and say “the trend is up, in 365 days the S&P 500 will trade at 2,based on the trend we’ve seen in the past year
