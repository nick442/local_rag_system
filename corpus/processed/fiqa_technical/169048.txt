> 1 funny how you picked the highest estimate for the US and the lowest estimate for the UK Mea culpa. It appears average cost for the US is [$30K](https://www.medigo.com/blog/medigo-guides/coronary-angioplasty-cost-guide/) (my personal family experience with it is $50K though). This means the US costs would have to come down by only 80% to be affordable by US families. I still strongly disagree that this could be accomplished by deregulation of any kind. And that's not even considering the loss in quality that would likely accompany such a move. >2 if anyone expresses wishful thinking it's you Sources man. Sources. There is no argument without facts. >I live in a country with UH. Well then we're both operating from a position of ignorance. I don't know what it's like with UH and you don't know what it's like without it. In that case - all I can do is look at the money the US spends vs everyone else - and then look at our national health outcomes vs. everyone else (e.g. heart health, maternity health, life span, etc.). America sucks at both. >You'll still have the same problems, except that you get a hefty tax increase on top and end up shoving 50-60% of your income down the state's throat in addition. There are a handful of countries that charge that much income tax. But the bottom line is that those countries, on the whole, *still spend less on healthcare than the US*. So while that 10 or 15% of your check that goes towards UH sucks - remember that if you were in the US you'd be paying 20 to 30% to an outside company for insurance. Plus you'd have to deal with pre-existing conditions and finding doctors in network and jumping all the bullshit hurdles Americans do on a daily basis without any of the convenience of having *one single system* to coordinate those resources. So you're either paying down the government's throat - or your paying twice that down a private company's throat. It sucks either way - but UH mitigates how bad it sucks. And one interesting note - I thought you were full of shit about paying 60% in taxes - but some places actually do charge [that much](http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-highest-taxes-in-the-world.html). So you could be right. But two interesting correlations about those countries is that they all have UH - and they all dominate the top spots in the UN's [happiest places in the world](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/20/norway-ousts-denmark-as-worlds-happiest-country-un-report). Don't underestimate the stress of living as a regular citizen without the benefit of a strong social safety net.
