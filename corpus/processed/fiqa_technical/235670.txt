"Then why is it that no one needs to do such audits in private corporations? It's as if they assume that every public employee is corrupt, and from my experience it wouldn't be too far from the truth. In a private organization there's a sense of responsibility that's entirely unknown in the public sector. There's no need to count office chairs because if one of them would go missing someone would report it immediately. In the public sector everyone would say ""it's not my job to count chairs""."
