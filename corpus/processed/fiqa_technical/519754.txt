Is the growth sustainable at the company you're currently at? Did you have a hand in driving a success metric at your company (either by bringing in more clients, or bigger clients than the other guy)? If so, point it out and ask for a raise before you leave. If you leave would you be able to mimic the success you've had direct contribution to at your current position to success at the other one? If so, leverage that and the raise you asked for into higher pay at the next stop.
