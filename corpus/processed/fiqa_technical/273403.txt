As opposed to sitting on reddit all day spamming articles no one responds to because they're stupid and clickbaity? If you posted something from a respected journal or academic source, I'd be more inclined to engage in discourse or take your posts seriously, but instead, you post stupid bullshit instead. Where'd you get your degree? DeVry? The School of Hard Knocks? Get over yourself.
