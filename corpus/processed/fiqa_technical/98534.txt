It's interesting these days, I see a lot of daily deals startups taking investor money and inevitably failing.. It's a long con the other way, too - a steady paycheck for a few years with the knowledge that no amount of effort will save the company because the entire concept is wrong. Pivoting ten or twelve times just to suck more cash out of the gullible..
