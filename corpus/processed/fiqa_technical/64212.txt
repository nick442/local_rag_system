what kind of grades did he have after graduating? because a decent (3.0ish definitely 3.5ish) gpa and middle of the road school gave a lot of people I know their pick of the litter when it came to consulting or analyst roles. That on top of the fact that accountants are always in demand and if all else fails a feeder role for a bigger company as a call center tech also allows a potential career path. That being all said, direct MBA is certainly an option, although it is more expensive up front and may or may not pay off after all is said and done. I still plan on getting one due to a non finance schooling background, but I will probably wait 8 or so more years to figure out exactly what mba would help me the most
