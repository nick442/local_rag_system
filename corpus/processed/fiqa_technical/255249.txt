>Why not talk about services? Why should I pay more for services. It's not like more income means I use the roads and bridges more. More income doesn't mean more kids that need public education. More income doesn't mean I use fire services more. actually it does, your ability to make more kinda depends on the ability of others to provide their skill, or their ability to purchase more or if you own a business you need the fire service to protect your business operating during/after a crisis as well as your home. this is kinda how the economy works. >If you ask me, I'd rather people just pay for the services they use. Have kids? Then you pay for their school. Drive 60 minutes to work, then you pay more than someone that drives 10 minutes. except its much cheaper for everyone if it is all bound up together, and provided by the government. seriously the arguments you are making are retarded like sitting in the back of the classroom eating glue retarded there is a reason that no country emphasis on NO COUNTRY does it the way you are saying, and that is because it was done this way a couple of hundred years ago and we moved on from that because it doesn't work as well. I understand the anti big government argument, its just that it is taken to such an extreme now that its just stupid.
