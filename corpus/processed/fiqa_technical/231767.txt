#####&#009; ######&#009; ####&#009; [**Benford's law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's%20law): [](#sfw) --- > >__Benford's Law__, also called the __First-Digit Law__, refers to the frequency distribution of digits in many (but not all) real-life sources of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data). In this distribution, the number 1 occurs as the leading digit about 30% of the time, while larger numbers occur in that position less frequently: 9 as the first digit less than 5% of the time. Benford's Law also concerns the expected distribution for digits beyond the first, which approach a uniform distribution. >This result has been found to apply to a wide variety of data sets, including electricity bills, street addresses, stock prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant) and [mathematical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant), and processes described by [power laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law) (which are very common in nature). It tends to be most accurate when values are distributed across multiple [orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude). >The graph here shows Benford's Law for [base 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix). There is a generalization of the law to numbers expressed in other bases (for example, [base 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)), and also a generalization from leading 1 digit to leading n digits. >==== >[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/Gx6oYsa.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rozklad_benforda.svg) - *The distribution of first digits, according to Benford's law.
