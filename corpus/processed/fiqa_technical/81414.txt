The value to you of a tax free fund is going to depend largely on your current marginal tax bracket. For example if you had a regular MM that was paying 1% and it was taxable, then your net off that one percent would be If the tax free MM fund pays .75% then you would be a tiny bit ahead using it, if you are in the 28% bracket, but you would be behind if you are in anything lower than 25% The primary market (IMHO) for Tax Free money market funds is for high wealth individuals who are in the 33 OR 35 percent brackets
