"I don't think someone who walks in to a Red Lobster or Olive Garden is there for a dollar savings. They know what they want going in, and they have a general idea as to the price range of items. People go there as an experience package, meaning the food is consistent, the atmosphere is expected and the menu is with a certain range of culinary expectation that fits a genre. When little Jimmy and Molly ask their parents to go to out for dinner, and mom and dad think it'll be great to ""take the gang for some food,"" a dollar per item is not going to register. The parents, once they've decided to go out, have already registered in their minds that this will be an expensive night, but it's a treat and that's how they're going to spend Friday evening. Now, if there's a gradual, consistent increase within a couple years, yeah, it'll register, but a $1 now is going to be a blip. This will not lead to a mass exodus of customers."
