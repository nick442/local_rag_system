I work at the Lowes in huntersville NC, 10 minutes from the headquarters. The store is known as the corporate store, where they try all the dumb shit first. Can say that they do some dumb shit, but this is straight autistic.. and they do pay employees better than any other large retailers, so that's cool I guess
