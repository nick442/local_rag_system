"BINGO. Only thing wrong in your statement is that GenX is NOT (not even remotely) gaining control of anything.. not yet. **The Boomers are still in FULL CONTROL -- and IMO will be hanging onto that control by tooth and nail.** They will let go as a generation only when we can pry their ""cold, dead hands"" away. The only things that (generally speaking) GenX'ers are in control of is the entities that they themselves have created (i.e. various internet companies, etc). I don't think GenX will gain any REAL power positions or control until probably well past 2020 -- and then more likely than not, it will end up being ""shared"" control with GenY (who simply outnumber GenX by a wide margin). GenX is like the ""middle kid"" in a family -- squeezed from both sides -- mistreated & abused by older siblings, and having to be responsible for and mentoring their younger siblings (but given little or no credit for much of anything). That's just the way the cookie crumbled. (Something similar happened to the [""Silent Generation""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Generation) {who, born in circa 1925-1945, were stuck betwixt & between the so called ""Greatest Generation"" and the Baby Boomers}. Said ""Silent Generation"" did a LOT of work and made a LOT of innovations (everything from being the ""grunts"" of WWII, to the Beatles, to the moon astronauts were Silents), but invariably the ""credit"" {and the ""power"" -- no ""Silent"" was EVER President of the US for example, despite several attempts} went to either the prior or the latter generations) -- so it's not like there isn't a precedent."
