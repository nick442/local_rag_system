"This is really the best thing you can do for any salary job in the interview process. It makes negotiating salaries SO much easier and you have a baseline to tell if they're trying to short you or what they thought of your interview. Granted you should be adjusting for experience on a case-by-case basis but I've pointed to this in interviews when salary came up and (politely) said ""<here's> the average, I have a lot of experience in the field so I think <this> is an appropriately adjusted amount."" None of my counter offers have been lower than the average."
