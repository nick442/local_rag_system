First thing they should do is STOP CALLING AND MAILING THOSE OF US WHO HAVE DONATED. I get a call every night (which I do not answer) and a piece of mail every week. I know the labor for the calls is mostly volunteer BUT YOU'RE PISSING US OFF (I have friends saying the same thing). Once we give, thank us and get back to us maybe a month or more later, or at crucial times. NOT EVERY FUCKING NIGHT, k?
