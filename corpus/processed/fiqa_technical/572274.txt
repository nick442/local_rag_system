1) cryptos becoming almost, kind of legitimate or at least somewhat seriously discussed as an investment class (lol) 2) low vol, tight trading ranges, people worried that people aren't worried enough 3) unwinding of feds balance sheet and monetary tightening 4) rip retailers, long live FANG (ugh) 5) every start up that uses the internet is claiming to be a tech company is able to achieve absurd valuations (e.g. Blue Apron) Idk. These might not be very great but maybe that's the story in itself. Markets are fairly calm in spite of all the turmoil as of late.
