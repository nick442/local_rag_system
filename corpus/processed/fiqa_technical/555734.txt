This is basically the same as any other loan out there that defers payments. The bank doesn't care because your balance with them keeps going up along with their future profits when you pay that balance back. The only point where this becomes a problem for them is when you get to a point where your monthly income no longer supports the minimum payment required. (BTW, this is basically a study of what the US Treasury is doing with the national debt and the annual budget deficit, but I will go over to politics.stackexchange.com before commenting on the wisdom of this.)
