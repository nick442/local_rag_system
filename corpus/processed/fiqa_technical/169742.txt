"If you swap the word ""shareholder"" for ""investor"" I think it helps clarify things. If you owned 51% of the company you'd get to say what to do with the cash, would you not? Managers are smart and successful, but ultimately just employees. Companies are beholden to their shareholders. In a more practical sense, I would think the board (representing shareholders) and the upper management would have to come up with a plan. But shareholders have the ultimate say."
