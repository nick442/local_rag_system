Same here. I think the fact that it was such a challenge to find unlabeled clothing as a teen created an obsession within me to be completely label-free. I bought a Kate Spade and Michael Khors bag to wear with my business attire because I know how bitches can be when judging workplace success, but all my other labels are on snowgear and that's it.
