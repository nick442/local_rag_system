"Ok, so I know we have to agree up to at least point 4, as those are indisputable facts. Point 5 requires no agreement, government always recommends more government as a solution. So I must conclude you disagree with loosening FDA rules as a consequence. But at the same time, you decry ""loophole shit"" by big pharma? Teva WANTS to come to market with a cheap alternative, and they were PREVENTED by government for stupid reasons. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Why would you, a pharmacist of all people, support a government entity that imposes financial hardship on your customers for no reason? Epinephrine can be bought for $2 per vial and there's nothing special about an autoinjector. Eliminate the regulations and everybody can afford Epipens."
