"The simple answer for the so-called 'Rule of X' would be found by: In your case: Update: If you want an approximation closer to the nominal ""Rule of 72"" value, use this equation that incorporates a better approximation for the natural log. The ""Rule of 72"" fits this for an interest rate of 7.79% for a growth multiple of 2: The rule of 72 comes from by approximating the natural logarithms as such: The 2 is the multiple of growth. The rate r here is not in percent, so to change to percent (say, R) you have to multiply by 100: The number 72 is often used because it is easier to divide evenly than 69.3 and is a better fit approximation for the natural log and common interest rates.
