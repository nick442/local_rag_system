Immigration increases the supply side of the labor market, which drives down wages, thus driving down costs for the companies that hire them. That's how the employers pay less. One of the major reasons why Silicon Valley firms are so outrageously profitable today is because they've utilized the H-1B Visas to reduce wages. Some people, libertarians especially, would argue that, even if wages within certain markets are decreased, the economy as a whole is still better off since lower costs for businesses results in lower prices for consumers--which can expand markets (more people willing to buy stuff when it's cheaper) and the money saved can now be allocated elsewhere (creating more jobs, advancing technology, etc.). But, that is a separate and much more complex discussion that involves a lot more variables in order to understand the true cost of the increased immigration (including public services, social cohesion, crime, etc.) versus economic benefits.
