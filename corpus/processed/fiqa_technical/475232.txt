Interestingly, California dumped a lot of money into a program to try to do just this. Hundreds signed up for @ ~$18.00/hr fruit picker jobs but only a small handful stayed on after working a day. They preferred an easy min wage job. Maybe the wage is the issue, but at what point can farmers be competitive with imports from other countries? They are already heavily subsidized.
