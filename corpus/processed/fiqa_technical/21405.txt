If only SOMEONE would make a decent android with a blackberry-style keyboard, RIM could die a more honorable and fast death. I'm still using an old BB and the only reason I'm holding off on buying the Blackberry Bold 9930 (the one with the half-height touchscreen) is because I'm afraid the company is about to go out of business. The Blackberry Bold 9930 is what they should have released years ago instead of their parade of dumbassery that was the Storm, the Torch, the Playbook, and now a new BBOS 10 phone WITH NO FUCKING KEYBOARD! Are they insane!?
