Texas didn't create jobs, it moved jobs. Corporations moved workers to Texas due to the lure of poverty wages for workers who don't qualify to pay much if any income tax and cost Texas money to feed and shelter because the companies aren't paying them enough, on top of low or no business taxes Texas gets from the grifters it lures, resulting in the [third-highest debt in the country](http://watchdog.org/124193/tell-em-aint-got-texas-debt-hits-341-billion/). Cutting taxes doesn't raise revenue.
