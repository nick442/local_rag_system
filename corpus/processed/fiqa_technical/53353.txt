There are many financial reasons why a bank would not want to allow this. While making a note of them does not answer your question, I think it's important to note why traditional CD products do not allow such contributions. Below are two reasons. If a bank wanted to offer such a product they could hypothetically create mechanisms to account for the above And guess what these types of accounts exist .. they are called savings accounts. They allow regular deposits, but often have variable interest rates, charge fees if you don't make regular deposits, or offer interest rates below a typical CD. Note you say you understand what a CD ladder is, but you haven't explained why you don't want to do it. It sounds like what you want is the convenience of a savings account but with the higher interest rate of a CD. Unfortunately, you have to give up a bit of interest if you want this convenience.
