Do you feel that if you had a gotten an undergraduates degree in economics or finance you may have had an easier time on the CFA initially? You mentioned that you had a degree in computer science and math, so do you think learning most of the concepts for the way economics works on top all of the CFA materials put you at a disadvantage? I only ask because a friend of mine who took (and failed) level 1 mentioned that he did surprisingly worse on basic micro/macro economics than he would have thought, even with his undergrad in finance. Mainly because (he said) it had been so long since he was in an economics class, which is typically a class business students take freshman year. I apologize for the multiple questions on the subject, it's just rare I am able to take time to think and formulate questions I would want to ask a charter holder.
