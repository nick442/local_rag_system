I'm not in a MLM or anything but I'm a business owner and I'm wondering why people keep saying it's a scam because people lose money? Any opportunity has risk and the ratio of success to fail is pretty similar for normal businesses. These seem like sales jobs with commission only/exotic compensation plans. It's normal that people fail at this. Are they not compensating people that meet their targets? At any rate, I feel like the business itself isn't a scam, but a lot of the salespeople are scummy by not really explaining the odds. I also don't like the cult-like vibe I get from some people in those groups.
