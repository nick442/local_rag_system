> 1) Did President Trump say he thought Medicare Part-D should use its market share to negotiate drug prices, enter a room with executives from the pharmaceutical industry, and then come out saying he now opposed Medicare doing so? Yes or no? Yes. So he said that. Did he ACT to make it so? Maybe, as usual, he's playing business chess with executives and eventually, when changes are made to Medicare part-D, it will be something that he originally said? > 2) Has President Trump created, championed, or even backed any policy that would require the United States to take active steps to prepare for the upcoming problems caused by global warming? Yes or no? Absolutely not! Absolutely not! President Trump is not against any method or measure to reduce pollution or emission. **Now, that I answered your questions, I want to remind you what I already said to you: I voted Trump and I very much support Trump now, but, no, I am not happy with everything he said or do before and after the elections. For example: I am pro-choice, and he is not.**
