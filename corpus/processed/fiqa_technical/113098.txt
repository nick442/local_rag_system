My wife works for one of them, and I don't get the hatred. Ethics, at least in the company my wife works for, are non-negotiable. People get fired for the smallest offense. Are there some bad apples that don't follow the rules? Maybe. But in general, the rules are followed to the letter. As for researchers and average workers getting shafted, that's also hyperbole. Granted, like all businesses, the higher-ups want more done with less. But shafted? Hardly. Field workers, at least at the station my wife works at, are paid pretty darn well for having little to no education. Starting wages for field workers are better than Costco's. Researches are paid well, too. Far from hating the big company, people are proud of the work they do and the company they work for, and it makes them angry to see people so misinformed about the work they do. The researchers at these companies go into the field they do to help humanity, similar to the same motivations that drive doctors. They want to feed the world, but instead of getting praised as saviors of humanity, they are insulted and mocked.
