"Agreed, but often it seems that gray area is exactly what these ""innovations"" are looking for. Repeatedly pushing down onto the struggling individual the past responsibilities of the wealthy corporation. Say this thing picks up steam and is revitalizing Walmart. John is walking out the door and ""critical"" deliveries need to be made. John was a bit short last month and couldn't wait for the 2 week insurance reimbursement process. So despite the team lead's prodding, didn't upgrade his insurance coverage this month. He didn't want to be ""that guy"" so didn't confirm/deny getting modifying coverage to the lead. The team lead asks John to take the packages, but doesn't really follow through on the insurance check. John wrecks his car and his back. John's insurance company rejects the claim. The team lead and John are fired because not checking/having the insurance was against written policy, but winked and nodded away all the way back up to the #1 online retailer spot. So often, obstacles are easily surmounted. I get the ""personal responsibility"" angle for all involved, but social/financial pressure can be brutal. The problem is that situations are left as is and the moneyed parties are ""enrichingly ignorant"". My guess is few compile stats on SOL Uber/Lyft drivers in similar situations."
