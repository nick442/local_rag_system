One way you can accomplish this is on a cruise ship. Most cruise ships have casinos, and most will allow you to sign out chips at the casino cage. You can then exchange the chips for cash. The chips that were signed for are resolved as room charges. Those room charges can be charged to a CC. Those signed for chips are rolled into the total room charges and are thus not treated as a cash advance. The cost of the cruise not with standing, you could earn money in that form. Step off the boat, deposit cash in the bank, and send a check to the CC company. All that being said, it is an cheap and safe way to get cash while you are traveling in that method.
