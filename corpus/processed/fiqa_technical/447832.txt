We definitely do not have a free market - never have. That's why it's all messed up and don't have an Amazon for healthcare and your insurance is through your employer (tax breaks). FDA, Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance/hospital regulations have been around for years. The reason why all of these prices are spiking and and quality is dropping is because the Government continues to involve it self (like all other areas with high prices: education, housing, etc.). Freedom is moral and efficient. Stealing is not.
