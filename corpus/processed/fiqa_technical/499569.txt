It's the Uber drivers who will suffer the most from this ban. To work as a driver at Uber, drivers buy cars and they get invested. Most of the drivers finance their cars and this ban prevents them from working and getting cashflows to keep up with their car payments/bills. Uber Technologies itself can survive this ban because it functions in many parts of the world with massive cash reserves it has which are backed by strong Venture funds such as Benchmark. I feel bad for the drivers, not the Uber company
