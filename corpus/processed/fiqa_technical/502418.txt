I have an iPhone and live in a 3rd world country.. you know what people are doing? They're buying iPhone 1s and iPhone 3gs.. so they can still have the apple experience.. I had a galaxy tab and had two android phones.. I traded all of that away since android wasn't for me.. Will I go to android again at a lower price? Unlikely..
