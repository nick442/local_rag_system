40k/yr for college is really a waste unless you're going for certain specific majors. Most people will be fine with local 10k/yr colleges while living at home. But yea, I think a lot of the 900k number comes from the opportunity cost of the money not being invested at a certain assumed % growth so overall, still a generally bs number.
