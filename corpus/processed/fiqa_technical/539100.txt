It won't happen, oil companies control the US Gov. as much as any of the other Oligarchic factions. Every GOP politician is in their pockets and the Corporate Dems are as well. The US is controlled by Big Oil, Big Pharma, the Banking Cartel, and the Military Industrial Complex (with a few other major players like the Media Cartel etc.), anything one of those leading factions opposes will not happen regardless of what the people want.
