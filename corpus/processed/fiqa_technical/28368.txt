"I am currently an accounting analyst at a small company and am looking for a career change. I have a BS in Econ from a B1G school and 2+ years of work experience. The three options I've narrowed down to are: pursue MFin and move into corporate finance, take CFA L1 and start job search, or start studying for actuarial exams and go down that path. I'm good at math and have high aspirations for my career. Currently I feel under appreciated and underemployed. Does anyone have any insight/advice on these paths and which is ""best"" in terms of salary, growth, and work/life? Thanks!"
