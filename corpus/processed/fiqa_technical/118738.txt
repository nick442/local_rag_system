So many people are blaming the US gov't for the reasons people are taking drugs and can't get hired. Such a ridiculous response to a COMPANY's decision to drug test. I personally don't want to work around stoner's/meth heads/pill poppers when the job requires you to work around 30,000 pounds of steel. That's just common sense. Nobody is forcing you to take drugs. Stop blaming everyone else bc you got yourself addicted.
