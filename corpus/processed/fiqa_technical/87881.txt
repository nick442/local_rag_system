Perfect, really needed an ELI5 scenario. So correct me if I'm wrong, what this means is having an NPV of zero of an investment shows that you will be definitely breaking even - and that's better than just having your money lying around doing nothing. Now let's take a PE example. Why is it that they prefer having an IRR of 20% or more. Why not less? Is it because 20% takes care of the cost of capital and more? I.e. if your IRR is greater than your cost of capital, it means that all the outflows from the cost of capital still result in an NPV of zero. But if your IRR is less than your cost of capital, that means you'll make a loss. Correct? Thanks for your time on this.
