"This might not map well, because personal finance is not the global economy; but let's start by talking about this in terms of the cost of a loan vs the gain of an investment. If you can buy a house with a mortgage at 3%, but make 7% on average in the stock market.. You should take as *looong* as possible to pay that off, and invest every penny you can spare in the markets. Heck, if you can take on even *more* debt at 3%, you should still do the same. Now imagine you have the power to literally print money, *but*, doing so is effectively a form of ""loan"" to yourself. We call the ""interest"" on that loan ""inflation"", and it comes out to roughly 2%, basically the same rate that US treasuries pay (they aren't strictly locked, but they rarely drift far apart). So, if you can print money at 1%, you should rationally print as much money as you possibly can to buy US treasuries at 2+%. But someone has to *take* that money off your hands - Pallets of money siting in a warehouse aren't worth any more than the paper they're made of. There we get into trade imbalances.. Whether printing money costs you 0.1% or 10% or 1000% per year depends on whether your country is, on average, making or losing money on international trade (I'm glossing over a hell of a lot there, as full disclosure), and by how much. If you're printing money as fast as you can just to buy food to stay alive with zero exports, you're screwed; if your country exports $10 to the US (or equivalents) for every $1 you import, the rest of that is essentially ""invested"" in USD, in that you didn't need to print it yourself just to feed your people."
