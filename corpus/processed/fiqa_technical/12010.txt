"It's not a ""withholding tax"" it's a ""withholding tax amount"". That is, they are not taxing you but they are holding back some of your withdrawal and sending it to the government to cover any taxes you will need to pay on the withdrawal. Same as your employer withholds some of your salary and sends it to the government for you. You won't claim it as a deduction, but it will go at the end along with tax withheld from your salary or anything else. So if you owe $10,000 of tax but various entities have already sent the government $11,000 on your behalf, you will get a $1,000 refund."
