Growing up poor leaves so many holes in your education. Not knowing how to manage money compounds the problems. What middle and upper class parents teach their children, I had to read a dozen books to learn. For example, negotiating starting pay. I didn't even know this was possible since minimum wage jobs pay- minimum wage. No negotiations. I knew about dickering for a price when buying a car, but had no clue you could do this for other purchases. Clipping coupons was of course one of my skills, but had never bought in bulk to save money. My dad taught me how to change a tire and the oil in my first beater, but I had never taken clothes to be dry cleaned or shoes to be resoled. Basically, I had never owned shoes worth repairing or clothes that couldn't be thrown in a washing machine with my jeans and tee shirts. How do you choose where to invest your 401k? Had no clue. That required another six months of intense study and the help of a librarian. You get thrown all these curve balls in your first real job that everyone else seemed to know all about it. Etiquette in a meeting. Proper handshake. Can I eat one of the muffins? Can I save one to go with my lunch? You feel silly, almost childish.
