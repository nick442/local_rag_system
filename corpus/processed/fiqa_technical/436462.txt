"I don't have any sympathy for Wall Street insiders, and am greatly in favor of giving law breakers real sentences. But look, any facebook buyer that feels ""cheated"" here needs to take a good long look in the mirror. It's not illegal to sell something at a preposterous, outrageously high price. You can claim that you were ""mislead"" by the seller, but by doing that, you abdicate your personal responsibility to think through your own decisions carefully, and come to your own understanding of what they're worth. If the primary basis for buying facebook stock was that *Mark Zuckerberg* said $38 was a good buy, and you couldn't take a few minutes out to decide if that made sense for yourself, for your own sake you should really get out of the stock market."
