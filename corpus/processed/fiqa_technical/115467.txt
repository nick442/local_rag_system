"Before we all argue about his pricing, blah blah - let me explain to you how he absolutely fleeced consumers under the guise of helping them. JCPenney had a handful of sales strategies: * 40% off * 50% off * Buy one, get one for $0.01 * Buy one, get one for $0.99 * 60% off * Green tag clearance (where things were up to 90% off discounted prices; items as low as $0.97) What he did was basically eliminate all of the different kind of sales and just discount a straight 40%. Meaning that before, when you were ""screwed"", the worst you would do is their ""everyday low pricing"" today. If you went in and bought at their worst 40% sale, you got exactly what he offers you right now. If you were lucky and went in at a better time, you actually saved more, generally around 50% with BOGO-type of stuff. Not only that, he killed coupons. This is where you could really rake. You would: * Save money with your JCP card * $10 off orders of $25 * $10 off orders of $30 * $10 off orders of $50 / $15 off $75 / $25 off $100 Again, these all varied, but you could stack coupons on top of savings. Shoppers (like me) stopped going there because the savings ceased to exist. We're not stupid, but he played us like we were and he counted on people's outrage of sales to dupe them. As you can see by the scheme I've shown, you not only saved more before, but way more. And the argument that it's better now is patently false because their prices are identical to their worst sale without any coupons. Why do you think the red stickers go over the price? Because they want to hide it. The same items at Kohls have the sticker from Union Bay or whoever on it. It's all the same MSRP. It's just that he tried to fool the shoppers he didn't have with false outrage, but alienated the rest of the shoppers who look at their receipt."
