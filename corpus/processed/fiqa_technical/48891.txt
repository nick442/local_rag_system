This whole conversation is absolutely stupid. Presidents have next to nothing to do with random swings in the stock market. The idiot in chief wants to take credit where no credit is due. His minion idiots want to bolster the nonsense, and otherwise clear thinking idiots, myself included, want to somehow set the record straight. But, in the end we are just pissing in the wind too. God I wish the idiots would shut up. So, that's exactly what I'll do.
