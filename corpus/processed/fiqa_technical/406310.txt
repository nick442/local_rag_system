A Muslim perspective.. >Shaikh Saadi says: >Translation: If rizq (sustenance) was dependant on intelligence, the stupid would die of hunger. But observations are this, that sometimes, nay moreso, the ignorant attain so much wealth that it astounds the intelligent. The pious are contented with this distribution. They say: >Translation: “We are contented with this distribution of the Jabbar (omnipotent), that for us there is knowledge and for the ignorant wealth. Wealth will soon diminish and knowledge remains and never vanishes. – Huquq wa Faraaidh, Page 749. It is all by Divine Providence, there is no luck in it. From the Qur'an, this: >*Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees [of rank] that they may make use of one another for service. But the mercy of your Lord is better than whatever they accumulate.* —Qur'an 43:32
