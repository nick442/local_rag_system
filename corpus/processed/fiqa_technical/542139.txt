First of all $1k is not enough money to start a web business. You're probably going to lose all your money, your business and your friendship. Second of all you need to retain a lawyer. I really can't emphasize this enough. If a lawyer is too expensive for you, then THIS BUSINESS IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR YOU. If you don't have the money, then you don't have the time. When you say it's his idea - did he come to you with a fully written business plan? Even if he did, that's not really worth 20% of the equity. I would insist on 50/50 if the capital is 50/50, and salary to whoever is working on it. You're not going to have profits in the first year. Let me repeat that. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE PROFITS IN THE FIRST YEAR. Things never, ever, EVER work that way. Or ok they do but it's like 1%. It's not going to happen to you.
