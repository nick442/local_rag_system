Sears has a reputable home improvement arm, refacing kitchens and that kind of stuff. Supposedly they subcontract that work out, but only with people who have been doing the work for a long time, and with Sears for a long time, and pass background checks etc. I've only had Sears fix a few minor things in my house, but its been OK.
