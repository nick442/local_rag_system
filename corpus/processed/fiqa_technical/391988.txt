"I just edited an employment agreement last week that had a fairly standard noncompete for the industry (""You won't go to work for my clients"") , but the last sentence was ""You will not work as a contractor or consultant within 150 miles for 18 months."" WTF. Granting the employer the benefit of the doubt, it was intended to mean ""for any of my clients"" but that's not what it said, and as written it basically meant if I leave this job I can't work for 18 months."
