Unless Obama becomes dictator, he can't. I am not a big Obama fan but the guy is not the man who had a congress that stamped everything for his approval (which Bush had, he pretty much declared war, passed bills with a republican congress). Obama can't really even cut spending on defense or even give tax cuts with the current congress and senate. He tried shutting down Gitmo but congress wouldn't fund the shutdown. Alot of the agencies are missing appointments because senate will filibuster anything they can.
