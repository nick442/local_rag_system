"It's not like there are no explanations for the delay. It's one thing if you make predictions that don't materialize, and you just scratch your head and say, ""isn't that curious."". That's what's being implied here, and it's a straw man. If you look closer, you see the mechanisms by which the day of reckoning has been postponed (housing bubble and now a fiscal deficit bubble). Given you can explain the delay, I don't see how it invalidates the core tenet of the initial assertion, which is that the current system is unsustainable. It's a matter of distinguishing between the need to abandon the entire theory or needing to modify it."
