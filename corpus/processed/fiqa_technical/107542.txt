You just sound like a whiny little child screaming 'why do you like what I don't like!?' I like physical books. One of the reasons for that is because I like putting them on a bookshelf and having a psychical collection. If you don't like that, I really don't give a flying fuck. You sit over there and play with your kindle and I'll sit over here and enjoy my shelves upon shelves of physical books. Neither of us is better than the other, we just *prefer different things* You call me a pretentious douche but you're the person that comes off as one. Well done.
