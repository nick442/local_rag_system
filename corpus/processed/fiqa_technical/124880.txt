When you look at principles, whether you're a 'true' socialist, a watered-down SocialistLite or somwhere in between, the ideas are still anti-human. We can agree that he state of affairs between the US, in the throes of it's Socialist makeover and the Soviet Union, in the Communist heyday are wildly different in terms of results. To draw a comparison of the results would be a lot like comparing apples and deer, and not achieve very much. Let's look at the principles involved instead. Whether you call it Socialism, Communism, Post-Marxism or any other name, the core principle is the same: Man must look after his neighbour, but cannot be trusted to do so automatically. The state's role is to enforce this duty by using the gun and ensuring wealth is distributed according to doctrine, dogma and/or whim. No matter what that system calls itself or to what extent it actually materialises, the core principle is one of destruction, not creation. The state has no interest or agenda beyond using their gun to take from you in order to give to another. On the contrary, let's look at the principles that a true laissez-faire system would operate on. (I say 'would' because a truly free, laissez-faire system has never existed. The US came excruciatingly close, but ran before it was fully realised.) You have the right to your own life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. These form your individual rights. The role of the state is to use the gun, to ensure your individual rights are upheld. That's it. Notice how redistribution of wealth or any obligation to your brother is not mentioned. If you and your brothers wish to adopt those principles for yourself, please feel free. But the state will not use the gun to enforce your agenda against those who do not voluntarily agree with it.
