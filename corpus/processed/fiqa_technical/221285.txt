No. I have partaken of but not lately. It's only become non-taboo here in the last 10 years and I was raised to think it was bad and people who do it are slackers or lazy and the like. I've thankfully grown out of that old way of thinking and now know how profitable it is and feel this is a good venture to begin building a nice portfolio. I'd also like to get into real estate and solar and wind as well
