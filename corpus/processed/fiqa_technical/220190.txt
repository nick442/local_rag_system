> ..you must take responsibility for your actions and not expect someone who didn't get addicted to bail you out - that only encourages addiction. It seems I do not convince. Perhaps your experience is that force of will is all that is required to avoid failure. Maybe you don't believe society can set you up to be a failure or your own destructive impulses can steamroller your willpower. If success is only a matter of determination then your position makes perfect sense. If that is your belief, I disagree but I envy you. I think this is the bottom of our discussion unless you want to show me how my justification for taxes is flawed. Thanks for the thoughtful dialog and letting me explore your opinions on how society should work. I hope we cross paths again.
