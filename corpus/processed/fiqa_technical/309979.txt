"The first red flag of your ""facts"": One of the article's sources is an Atlantic article with the title, ""Entrepreneurship: The Ultimate White Privilege?"". The article rants on and on about politically correct SJW nonsense. Red flag 2: The Andrew J. Oswald ""What Makes an Entrepreneur?"" study that is cited to prove access to capital is a helping factor (Your daddy money argument) is from 1998. A hell of a lot has changed since then. Forbes reported a 32% jump (up to 70%) of self-made millionaires from 1982 to 2012. Red flag 3: The article was trash, mainly used as a tool to attack ""white privileged males"". The article only said, ""Hey, look a study!"" and didn't mention any data. The only actual mention of data in the article is ""more than 80% of funding for new businesses comes from personal savings and friends and family."" Well, yeah. That's where most businesses look for their first small investment. Actual facts: [60% of billionaires are self-made](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269593) [70%+ percent of millionaires are self-made](http://www.thomasjstanley.com/2014/05/america-where-millionaires-are-self-made/) Btw, thanks for the laugh. Didn't know anyone took Qz serious!"
