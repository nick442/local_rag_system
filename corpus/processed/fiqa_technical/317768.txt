Yes you are right. The cannibalisation comment was for opening up every pricing point. The article is quite specific to app pricing published by an individual. It doesn't apply to say a food product or a durable being brought to the market. A thing on the last comment. Wondows may sell three versions but the distinction is there and clear. A light version, a regular version and an enterprise version. They are labelled pretty much the same as Home, Professional and Enterprise. Good marketing or names to distinguish between the products. Different needs for different products. An app is priced much less and uses can be trivial (yet invovled).
