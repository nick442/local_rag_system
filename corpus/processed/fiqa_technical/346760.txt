"Read again what I said in my original post. ""Enterprise Value is the sort of ""bare bones"" total firm value. It doesn't include any cash because you'd basically be paying cash for cash. Also, this makes analysis of transaction multiples more streamlined, as some firms may have a ton of excess cash on their balance sheet, skewing multiples."" I said that that is WHY we use enterprise value. Because if you didn't it would skew multiples."
