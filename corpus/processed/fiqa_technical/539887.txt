"That ship has basically sailed. A significant number of businesses are going to have to replace their terminals *again* if the banks change their minds, which I doubt they would be too happy about. For example, a lot of small businesses use Square, which will not ask for PIN at all even for foreign cards and has no hardware that would permit it. Not to mention the restaurants that didn't bother with wireless terminals the first time (which is most of them). Hell, even ignoring all that, a lot of major retailers don't even bother asking for the PIN with chip and PIN credit cards unless it's over $25-50. (Meanwhile, they always ask for the PIN for debit cards.) It's almost as though security *isn't* the main reason for wanting PIN to be required. Source: I have a couple of the (very few) cards issued by American banks that ""require"" PIN."
