Don't believe wikipedia? Here is proof that Fox News is broadcast in Canada: www.myaccess.ca/Home/Communities/AC3/AtHome/TV/ChannelLineup/Networks/tabid/2486.. This is from just ONE of the many cable providers in Canada, I don't have time to look at all of them. If you still insist on spreading lies, it's a good thing you aren't in Canada because you would be censored. ...so it seems you're being lied to by people you go to for information. So wise up."
