Thank you. I try to lead my firm in a way where everyone feels important; I like to surround myself with intelligent and hardworking people. I appreciate the empathy (and sympathy) regarding my age - some people are jealous, others don't understand. That's there problem, not mine. I actually managed an ice cream shop when I was in high school too. (; Good luck!
