> Where are their multiple multi-million dollar sexual harassment lawsuits? What makes FOX bad is not how they treat women, deplorable as those isolated cases are (it is not the American way to blame groups of people for the crimes of individuals). What makes FOX bad is how they participate in the larger narrative, which has effectively destroyed journalism and the culture of this country. And in that way, FOX and MSNBC are opposing sides of the exact same coin. Their victim is you, and people like you.
