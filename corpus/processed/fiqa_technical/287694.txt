>Sometimes that requires more time other times less. Oh bullshit. Once when I had little work I started doing few hours. After a couple weeks of this I was explicitly reprimanded and told to give 8 hours per day of butt-in-seat. I asked if my actual team leader had complained I wasn't working efficiently enough. Turns out he thought I was doing *just fine* for the workload he was giving me. Only as a salaried contractor working remotely did I end up being able to turn my ability to *get my shit done* into more free time.
