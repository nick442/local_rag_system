(I'm a bot) ***** > Minneapolis Federal Reserve Chairman Neel Kashkari voiced opposition to the central bank&#039;s decision to raise interest rates this week due to the latest weaker data on inflation. > &quot;If we base our inflation prospects on this real data, we should not raise interest rates this week&quot;, said Neel Kashkari, who has voted this year at the Federal Open Market Committee. > &quot;In the 1970s, this belief led the Fed to keep interest rates too low, resulting in very high inflation. Today, this same belief can cause the Commission to repeatedly predict accelerating inflation, which is why we raise interest rates too fast and we continue to fail to reach our inflation target&quot;, added he. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6i0ks3/neel_kashkari_opposed_feds_decision_on_raising/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~147307 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **inflation**^#1 **interest**^#2 **rates**^#3 **Chairman**^#4 **raise**^#5"
