You're defending amazon against monopoly charges right here man.. They don't need to brainwash people or even advertise, they can enter any market they want and just destroy nearly all competition instantly. They have so much money that they can take losses for years and years on any sector until they price everyone else out of business. I do agree with you that Trump shouldn't be using threats against amazon as a political weapon.
