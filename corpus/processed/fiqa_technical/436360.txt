Some banks are bankrupt, or so close to it that they can only pretend to give real dividends in a desperate attempt to keep investors from fleeing and driving their stock price (and thus credit rating) down into a pit of despair. Other banks (like jpmc) are not in bad shape, have cash, and are quite happy to disburse it.
