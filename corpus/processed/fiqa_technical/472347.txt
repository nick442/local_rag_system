I can't speak for other companies, but we certainly hired people without experience in those products (I was one of them). And I certainly didn't get any experience in any finance/accounting class in undergrad. There's probably a whole spectrum of things you could do from just youtubing intro videos to get taking a weekend classes and getting certified. Sounds like from your coding experience you'll have a good leg up. But sorry I can't be more helpful
