Do you have any idea what you want to do? Companies never want to hire someone who is looking to 'stay in an area'. They want someone that knows what they want to do. As soon as you head down the CFA route you will end up in more of an analyst positions. These positions (as a fellow applicant as well but with experience) are hard to get because of the large amount of people applying. Accounting firms ARE hiring if your into that sort of thing. Otherwise, volunteer at some local events like financial counseling. I've hard two advisers be approached by firms for CFO positions in the few years I've worked. It sounds like your doing the right things..just keep at it..I've been looking since February..
