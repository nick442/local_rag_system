Bacon Cheesburger $7.59 Double quarter pounder with cheese $4.79. Five Guys is not even in the same ballpark as McD. It's a better burger, but it's also a lot more expensive burger. And they charge a lot for fries. That said, I was surprised just how much burgers cost at BK and Wendy's. They're a lot closer to Five Guys in prices. And that's why McD is going no where and BK and Wendy's need to step up their game if they want to keep charging $6 for bigger burgers.
