Meanwhile, **Granvil, who no longer drives** because of poor health and **uses a broker to hire a driver**, said he is facing threats from the lender, Melrose Credit Union, to foreclose on not just his medallion, but also his house. This really bothers me. It shows how medallions have prevented even other cabbies from competing. I doubt if Granvil see how he really isn't any different from Uber and Lyft now. He's a middle man. But unlike Uber and Lyft that provide infrastructure for finding clients, Granvil provides nothing other than his government sanction medallion.
