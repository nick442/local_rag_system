"I think a lot of people would respond with something like ""you use bank machines and online banking, don't you?"" That is the same reason I hear people supporting voting machines and even online voting, but the problem is that there are significant differences. Take a service like mint.com compared with your bank for example. The bank is a regulated company with insurance to back up your money should they make a mistake. Even if someone steals your debit card and drains your account, you will usually get all your money back. Banks have deep pockets and even the government has a vested interest in making sure the banks stay afloat. When they do make a mistake (and they will) you are usually quite safe. On the other hand, mint.com is a third party that you are just going to hand over your bank passwords to. I think it is reasonable to ask: I am not saying not to use mint.com, but it is certainly reasonable to ask these questions."
