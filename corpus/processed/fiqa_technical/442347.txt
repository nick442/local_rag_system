"This article makes a fairly biased point about how morally wretched suits MIGHT have caused one girl to commit suicide at one hospital in Australia . Then wildly extrapolated that point to make it sound like business people can't run businesses. Finally, the article states that business people are needed to run a business because businesses are businesses And doctors are doctors. I get that this plays on reddits ""does anyone else le STEM :D"" argument that mostly turns into hatred for ""lesser"" majors. Business included, as always. So I can see why this article can lead to entertaining discussion. But I want the time I took to read this article back."
