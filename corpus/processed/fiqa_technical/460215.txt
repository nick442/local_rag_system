This is for my final project in my international business major. I'm looking at country of origin effects on whiskey and whiskey regions. If you have the time, please take the survey. You don't need to know anything about whiskey. In fact I need more people with less knowledge of whiskey as I've got a lot of responses from /r/whiskey already. I know this might not exactly fit this subreddit as it's not news, but it is business related. And I'm happy to provide the results of the survey for those interested! (Though only this survey, I can't release my final report due to confidentiality agreements with some distillers I've interviewed.)
