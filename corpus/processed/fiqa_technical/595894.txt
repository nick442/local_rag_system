There are lots of reasons why a crook would want you to do this: counterfeit check scam, laundering money, trying to get your account information, getting you used to doing questionable things and then escalating, seeing whether you're the kind of person to go along with bad ideas, etc. There are not, however, much in the way of good reasons for it. I gather you can withdraw money from your bank without an ATM fee. This I am assuming from the fact that it is being proposed that you withdraw money from your account, and the fact that this is how pretty much all non-predatory banking works. If this person's bank won't let them withdraw money without a fee, something is seriously wrong, and they should get an account at your bank. Do they get charged for using a live teller as well? If not, how is getting money from you easier than getting it from a teller? How much is the fee? If the fee is $2, and you're making $10/hour, that's 12 minutes of wages. Does it take less than 12 minutes to complete this transaction (including the time this other person is spending)? This cartoon comes to mind: https://xkcd.com/951/
