Regarding doing this with your HOA: the cost could be very high. In my community the annual dues is less than $100 a year. When people don't pay they are aggressive. There is a late fee after 30 days, then a higher penalty at 60 days. That 2nd notice comes from a lawyer. The community charges the homeowner the lawer's fee. After another 30 days they file a lien. With those costs a small bill has ballooned to over $1,000. Property tax has two other issues. The government can sell your house. The lender can foreclose. Neither is good.
