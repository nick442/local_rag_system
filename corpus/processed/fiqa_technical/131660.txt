Take all of the overachieving wannabe investment bankers that you went to college with and stick them in an echo chamber, and you have WSO. I wouldn't overthink it. As you identified, it's all over the top, and not at all reflective of reality. That said, there is some really insightful content on there from time to time from individuals who really know their stuff (Thebrofessor, blackhat, etc). Some of the users are legitimately taking the piss though (Dick Fuld..)
