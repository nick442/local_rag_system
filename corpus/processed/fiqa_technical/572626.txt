Well - not true at all. The border between Finland and Russia had until recently and probably still has one of the greatest differences in living standards of any border in the world, up there with USA/Mexico and Australia/Indonesia and Spain/Morocco. There are a lot of Estonians migrant workers working in Finland. Sweden takes per capita the most immigrants in the western world. It's not about the availability of work force. I guess you have not heard about the influx of people from Africa, Near East and Afganistan to the EU. It has been one of the big stories if the decade. EU takes more immigrants both relatively and in absolute terms than the US. I did not single out Scandinavia. I singled out the US. It's the only western country where the illegal unregulated largely immigrant service class does the dirty work for the whole economy. There are small pockets of that in EU as well - the seasonal workers of Spain for instance, but the US is really unique as a developed country.
