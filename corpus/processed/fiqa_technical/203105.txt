First off, I'd highly recommend looking at this nytimes rent vs buy calculator. This calculator gives you some great flexibility (for example, estimating what will happen with a 7% return in the stock market, and comparing renting vs buying). Secondly, I have personally gotten a lot out of this wall street journal book. Check it out at the library or buy it and read it cover to cover. My personal opinion is that buying a house or condo is mostly a lifestyle choice. Some specific caveats with your situation: A sidenote: One of my friends who bought a condo in chicago is considering moving to a different city and is very much regretting buying a condo, even though he got the $8k housing credit, because renting isn't as easy as it looks (you can do it and do it profitably but you darn well better consider that BEFORE buying a condo)
