Admittedly I was starting to form a similar opinion as lazerpants. It seems like the sales team spends most of their time going drinking and golfing with customers or potential customers. I am sure there must be more to it than that, but their conversations would also suggest that their job performance is largely about who they know and less about real talent. It could be just what I hear, though. Maybe they don't like to showcase their talents. I have no complaints about my job, company environment, management, salary, etc.
