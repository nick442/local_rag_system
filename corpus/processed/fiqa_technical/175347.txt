I just found out today, there is a full windows 8.1 tablet on intel baytrail for $170 that looks really good if not for games. The one thing I can't decide is if I'd prefer an android or even linux version (needs maturity, but one reason to go android is that its easier to escape when mature) with the same chip. While the baytrail specs are awesome for me, and there are pc apps that I would use, and from the few benchmarks I could find, windows performance is better than android for this chip (though you can consider them even), its still not obvious to choose win8 over android even when the price is the same. I guess I would lean towards win8 (I need a super calculator with J), but the media performance of other chips is going to push others towards android solutions. The point is that windows 8 is now super interesting at the same price point as android, and it should grow as a result. Its still not obvious though, if it can dominate it.
