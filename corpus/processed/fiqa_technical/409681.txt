Congratulations on doing all the right things in your financial life. To me, the answer to your question is a no-brainer: pay off the loans immediately. However, I am sure that some people will post answers arguing exactly the opposite. I would also recommend using the extra cash that you will have each month (since the payments on the loans will disappear) to increase your 401k contributions even though they will not attract additional company match, and once again, you will certainly get answers telling you why doing so is a very bad idea.
