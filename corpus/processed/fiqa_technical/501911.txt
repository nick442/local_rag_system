Let's see here..how much does the Sears board make? http://www1.salary.com/SEARS-HOLDINGS-CORP-Executive-Salaries.html He makes a dollar, but there's that 3.4 million dollars in, what I'm sure is, prime class A stock that gets paid FIRST if the whole place collapses. With 11 million dollars spread across just a few people, and the company in dire straits, I can see why they'd be worried.
