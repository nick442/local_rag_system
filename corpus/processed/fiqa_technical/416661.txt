Another, perhaps simpler approach to the same result as @BenMiller. Firstly, if you can pay off the debt today, for 1695.70 cash, then that is the amount of your debt to the hospital. There is no such thing as a discount for cash; just extra money to pay if don't pay immediately. This extra money is called interest, and the hospital is indeed charging you interest. Use any mortgage program to find the interest rate if you pay off a debt of 1695.70 with 60 monthly payments of 37.68. The program should tell you that you are paying 12.64% effective annual interest. If you can earn more than that, after taxes, with your money somewhere else, then invest the cash there and pay off the hospital over time. If you can't, then pay off the debt immediately, and avoid writing 60 cheques. EDIT: Incorrect calculation revised as per @Ben Miller
