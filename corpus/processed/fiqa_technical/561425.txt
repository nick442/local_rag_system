"Some things you should consider from your observations. 1. Those ""few units available to rent"" at the mall: they're available for a reason, namely nobody else thinks they have a business idea that can work out at that location. Malls are suffering all over the country, and the more empty units there are at a mall, the less people want to go there. 2. You are right to be concerned about copyright/trademark from amateur Etsy creators. But there's another serious problem: what do you do with the leftover inventory when Harry Potter is less cool? Or the particular Etsy product doesn't sell as much as you expect? Are you are taking all the risk? The GameStop in my area is already selling Pop Vinyls, Barnes and Noble does too, lots of places. If an Etsy creator is able to provide their product in volume, they are going to want to deal with an established distributor/retailer. Why would they go with some unknown startup single-location retailer? Now, don't get me wrong, you see these kind of idiosyncratic kinds of retailers all over the place: selling Pokemon cards and comic books and other random knick-knacks. But it isn't a sure thing, and I suspect even the successful ones are not making their owners much of a profit. But if it is fun and keeps you busy, and gives you enough money to live and save a bit for the future, that's good enough."
