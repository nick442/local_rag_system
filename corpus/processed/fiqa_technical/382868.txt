As of now the two scenarios are very similar if not the exact same concept. At this point, DB is not legally required to fulfill that request. Maybe eventually they will be but right now no they are not. That only leaves the other element of ethical obligations which is what I agree with..except that's exactly the same conflict Apple had when they refused to give the US government access to a terrorist's phone (which of course had been suspected to possibly contain information relevant to other plans) Edit: the main point is both these companies stand to gain from refusing to follow a reasonable government request. I'm not saying DB or even Apple made the right choice overall but both companies of course had good business-minded reasoning for refusing to help the government reaching out to them in each case
