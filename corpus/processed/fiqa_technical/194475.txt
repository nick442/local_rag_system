Honestly, you aren't applying for a financial job. You're not expected to really have any financial knowledge at all. You're being hired to be extremely well-organized, well put together, intelligent and confident. Make sure in the interview you do everything to live up to their expectations. Well structured resume and professional resume, pressed suit, stand up straight and talk with confidence. You can do this! :)
