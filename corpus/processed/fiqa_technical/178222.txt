If they consider the midwest, I'd hope for Detroit or Ann Arbor. Both are right next to Detroit Metro & I believe Amazon already has a presence here. You could pick up a good chunk of land for not much money in the Detroit city limits, and Ann Arbor has the UofM talent pool. There's also a bit of a minor tech boom going on down in Detroit.
