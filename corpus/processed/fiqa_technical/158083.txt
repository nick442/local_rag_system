">""We expect to have a small U.S. income tax liability for 2010,"" GE chief spokesman Gary Sheffer told us. How big is small? GE declined to say. The number is unlikely to ever be disclosed unless GE goes public with it, or is forced to do so. Again, not a billion dollars. Unfortunately I am not skilled enough in accounting to be able to decipher that spreadsheet but I do appreciate your providing so many links, I didn't notice them earlier. Still, I find no evidence that GE is any more likely to have paid a billion dollars in taxes than a nickel."
