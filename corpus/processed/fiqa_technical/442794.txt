I am not joking one bit. If their job performance is suffering due to their own personal lack of self-respect then I would fire their ass and hire someone willing to do a good job. I've worked as a manager at a massive chain retail store. We had all different kinds of employees. Some were good and some were bad. The good and bad had no correlation to their pay (they all got paid like shit) or how long they had been working there.
