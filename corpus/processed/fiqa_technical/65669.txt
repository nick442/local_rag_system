Zimbabwe was a fine place to live when it was Rhodesia. Zambia, which is welcoming back a number of Whites, is doing better now as well, where the same cannot be as well said for Zimbabwe. Material resources are not the source of most country's wealth anyway, or we would not see countries like Hong Kong, Singapore, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, or Switzerland develop. And yet, we do. The common thread between them is simple: freedom and intelligence - things Africa lacks and cannot hope to create unless what most would call a tragedy were to occur. I wouldn't kid yourself, really. Many countries have had exceptionally long histories with many a chance to develop and yet they have not done so well as those with brighter populations. Many have had very short histories, with little chance to develop and yet they have done exceptionally. As stated above, there are common threads and that's what Faber is clearly referencing, not some mixed-blessing of resources or somesuch. Don't be foolish. There are no other sufficient explanations after properly interrogating the issue.
