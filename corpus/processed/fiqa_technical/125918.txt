So Bain buys the company in 2010 which at the time has no debt. 7 years later the company files for bankruptcy and blames outdated systems and online retail. Sounds like complete bullshit to me. I wonder how much Bain sucked out of the company before letting it wither out and die? I'm guessing the purchase of the company was financed against Gymboree and then add some hefty management fees and cut back on capital expenses and all of sudden the company is no longer profitable.
