Some do internships, but most don't. I would also try to get really involved with your school's entrepreneurship center if it has one. People on reddit often stress that it's wrong to participate in unpaid internships, however in this sector I strongly disagree. If you are able to secure an unpaid internship in VC, I highly suggest pursuing it.
