Have you ever been so poor as to be destitute? Not just someone with a hard scrabble life but someone with no options? I come from a third world country and was so poor that sometimes, I went hungry for days and on others, had nothing more than a banana to eat. My parents pawned all their meager savings to ensure I got a good education and was supporting my parents straight out of college. I am one of the lucky ones who got away but I had plenty of hard-working, honest and talented friends who are stuck. You need to walk in the shoes of these people. It is not always so simple. There are quite a few youth who while away their time on Reddit, games, hanging out on the corners of streets and so on but for every such person, there is a Dad or a Mom with a medical condition, a child whose parents are uneducated and too poor to teach their children at home, people who are too ill physically or mentally to work and having large medical bills and families that are barely surviving. Yet, they have chosen the hard, honest life over one of crime and petty theft. These people deserve our respect, even when we disagree with them. I am an extreme libertarian who thinks all government programs should be abolished but I respect the liberal viewpoint. Churches and charity are not always the answer. Many times, it is also one of chance and station in life. Edit - Pardon the lack of structure. This thread touched a raw nerve, even as I leave my old life behind and move towards a brighter future. Edit - Need to add for posterity that I came to the US as a skilled worker and legal immigrant, having been invited due to my skills in a particular field.
