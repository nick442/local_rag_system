"OK boss, I'll play along. First of all, which original comment did I edit? Here's a tip, you can see which comments have been editted because they have little *'s beside them. I'd think you'd know that given that you're a mod here. Secondly, once you're done looking for it and can't find it, cause I didn't edit any of them, explain to me how in my original comment, pointing out a difference between ""making money"" and ""turning a profit"" displays my ignorance of the distinction between revenue and profit."
