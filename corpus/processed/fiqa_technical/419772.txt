Generally speaking, an emergency fund's primary purpose for being is to be available in an emergency. Income generation is a distant second. As long as you have immediate access to it via checks or an atm card, you're doing ok. If you live in a high-tax state or a place like New York City with federal, state and local income tax, I'd probably err on the side of the municipal fund for your state.
