America is becoming poorer as a result of Fed monetary policy. Inflation is barreling on (a hidden tax) and wages can't possibly keep up. Manufacturing has been getting outsourced for 50+ years and we absolutely rely on cheap imports. If we ever want to be wealthy again, we have to roll back regulations, start manufacturing at home, lower taxes and reign in the Federal Reserve, increase interest rates and tighten monetary policy.
