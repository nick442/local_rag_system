I agree! For an interview suit - I would go to men's warehouse and get a suit that fits. If you're not wearing it all the time, you don't need a BB suit. I wear suits all the time for work and I love BB, but most people won't notice the difference, and even if they do, they don't expect a job applicant to be wearing a $1000 suit. I'm going to trial tomorrow in a men's warehouse suit - wore BB today - no one will know or care. Shoes though.. get good shoes. I like AE and Johnston & Murphy. Two pair has lasted me 4 years and they look great. I'd wear out $75 shoes in a few month. This isn't necessary for a job interview though, but when you're looking for work shoes down the road..
