There ain't no such thing as a free lunch! It has always been the case that the only way to talk to a human is to pay (because the human needs a salary), but the only difference is that in the past the cost was obscured to you because it was bundled in with the cost of the primary product or service. Now they're unbundling it so you see it as a separate cost. This is actually a good idea in my opinion.
