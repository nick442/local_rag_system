"> Yes, you lied for 3 years Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. Except in this case ""stupidity"" can be replaced with ""a really difficult problem"". That problem is counting. I work on a web service that counts 30 day active users in the 100s of millions. At this scale counting unique users becomes VERY difficult. Mistakes happen.. constantly. We have discovered 3 times in my 3 years in this team that users were being miscounted.. by a LOT. It happens, the systems underlying all of our users across multiple platforms are a product of ageing software, unfit for their current task. There isn't enough commitment from management to allocate sufficient resources to actually fix the problem. Defining an active user sometimes isn't even obvious. Accounting for users across multiple platforms and multiple accounts while simultaneously adhering to certain legal and privacy agreements all quickly lead to a difficult task from something that seems simple to someone who has never tried to count at this scale. Now I'm adding this context with a big asterisk: \* If it's the primary number that you announce at each earnings call.. then you'd better get the fucking count right."
