>then what's to stop people from building a twitter clone? technically software patents but I doubt there's one that applies to something the likes of twitter. There are alternatives already but they just haven't gained momentum yet because the need isnt there. However, I can only hope that if twitter does start filtering, censoring, 'disappearing posts', blocking trends from showing up, ect - it will only be a matter of time before it becomes the next google wave or my space.
