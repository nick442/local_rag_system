Okay, I'll amend my complaint: Because we decided to have a fucking stupidly complicated system of social safety nets. Seriously, though. Those employees are better off with shit pay, but still eligible for government benefits than being paid a bit better and not getting any benefits. As soon as people start to get somewhat better pay, they lose benefits of hundreds of dollars/month, and generally lose access to health insurance. I'm not saying support Wal-Mart, I'm saying we've got a lot of work to do to fix our government programs and regulatory frameworks and tax code in pretty fundamental ways.
