Well kind of hard to give an answer without seeing the underlying syllabus, but judging by the title of the majors here's what the career paths *might* be. Personal Financial Planning generally leads to a career in financial planning wherein clients come to you and explain to you their future goals and you have to devise an investment plan which adheres to their assets and liabilities structure. I'm getting a sense that the major is a precursor to the CFP certification; so check out the CFP Board's website. Finance Major is *probably* the major which leads to a career in investment banking or investment management (wherein you'll probably deal with institutional clients rather than individuals). It's worth noting that the two majors probably share courses.
