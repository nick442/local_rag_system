"> Once again remember, it's ZH. There's a Reuters cite almost immediately at the top of the story. Do you have an updated list of the OK-to-post media sources? > The US has had ATM limits since, well I can't even remember, with the max being at most $200 a day. If by ""the US"" you mean ""some people at some banks in the US, depending on the rules of that bank"" then yeah - but if what you were attempting to imply is some USA-wide ATM limit ala the one being discussed, then that's simply wrong."
