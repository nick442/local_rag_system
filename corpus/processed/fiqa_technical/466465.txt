"Well, you're a rarity, then. Every manager I've spoken to (and my personal experience on the hiring side) would indicate that it's a negative. The most common one being ""Does this candidate really have nothing else relevant that they could have put on their resume?"" It's totally trivial to make a couple months ""vanish"" on a resume. Yeah, it could come up in an interview, but at that point the resume has largely already done its job. Outside of entry level positions, having a fast food job on your resume is not going to do you favors."
