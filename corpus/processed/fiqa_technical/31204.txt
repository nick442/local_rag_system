">I think you are confusing ""understands technology"" with ""is technology guru"" or ""technology visionary"". Nope. I don't think Sculley really fits in ANY of those categories. He's a marketer & speaker -- he learns just enough of the **buzzwords & jargon** to make it SOUND as if he knows what is going on.. but -- like many other similar people -- he really doesn't have a frigging clue. >Your timeline is flawed, as Sony's early work goes back well in to the 50's. Sony was working on ""color TV's"" yes.. but not anything related to what became the ""Trinitron"" -- that history is well documented (both in the patents that they licensed, and the people/teams & subsequent patents that they filed, as well as in various narrative histories from the people involved). > I don't look at his work with the CRT as a demonstration of any particular brilliance Of course you do.. that's the entire reason you regurgitated that little ""myth"" -- to support this illusion/delusion you have that he HAS some ""technological brilliance"" -- all of your previous comments in this thread are in that vein. >You should read Jobs' own accounts of meeting and recruiting Sculley. They had very extensive conversations about technology and while Jobs no doubt didn't see him as a visionary, the computer industry was new to Sculley so he had a lot to learn (particularly the first year), and Sculley clearly didn't get Jobs' design esthetic, but Jobs very much felt he could share his vision and Sculley would understand it and its implications. Similar comments from Markkula and others who worked with the guy then. Jobs was **bullshitter** -- a very charismatic one no doubt -- but a bullshitter nonetheless. > Sculley definitely sees himself not as a technical visionary or even a technologist, but as a master marketer. ROTFLMAO.. Riiiight.. that's why he promotes himself as a ""technology visionary"" speaker: >>In the Age of Smartphones, Smart Pads and Smart TVs, John Sculley is the Quintessential Smart Entrepreneur - A Compelling Public Speaker on Innovation in Global Business and Technology"
