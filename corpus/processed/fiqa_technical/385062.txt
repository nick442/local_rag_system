It's not true that jobs have been shipped overseas. Most of the loss of labor intensive jobs has been due to improved automation. The growth of jobs outside the US has been to better support developing economies that have a demand for those goods. (And it's not efficient to build them here when the demand is in Asia or South America.) Production is generally up in US factories. It's just using less labor to do it.
