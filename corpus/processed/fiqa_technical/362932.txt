Wow. Few initial thoughts: 1) Amazon is not going to keep WFM's pricing structure in place. I expect we'll see some serious pricing pressure on the whole space. The food companies have already been feeling the squeeze (remember all those headlines about Wal-Mart pressuring their CPG vendors to trim prices 15%?) and this is only going to make it harder for them. 2) Amazon has been building out its distribution network through fulfillment centers. This gives them a huge footprint for both click-and-collect and direct-to-consumer online grocery delivery. Also probably helps consumer perceptions about the quality of buying food online. 3) I think if you're a company like TGT you need to step back and look at your strategy in food. Might be a good time to admit defeat or at least scale back. 4) Amazon could very well go the private label route here. Especially with pressure from Aldi and Lidl, there might be a real opportunity for it at WFM. Perhaps a name like THS could get a boost. 5) I'd sure love to be at Jana right now
