Of course it isn't solely responsible, but the way that sugar is sold and advertised makes sugar an insidious way to eat way too many calories. This is especially true for people who do not have education about diet, and of course children (who are heavily advertised to by the food industry). That's not at all the point of the documentary either, they talk about many interesting aspects of the sugar industry. Your comment illustrates part of that; the industry pays a lot of money to put doubt in people's minds. They are extremely powerful and it's a good chance whatever you read is sugar industry funded propaganda. Sugar is absolutely responsible for a huge number of health issues, where the fat comes from is not relevant because it's the extra carbs (mostly from sugar) that are responsible for the huge obesity rate in the US. I really encourage you to watch this movie. The association with health problems is well established but for a number of reasons it's extremely difficult to run experiments that show sugar caused specific diseases. The industry is using the same tactics the tobacco industry used to put doubt in people's minds over the studies. It's actually quite disturbing to see what they are doing to keep the food industry the way it is, especially when you take into account the extent of the health crisis of preventable diseases.
