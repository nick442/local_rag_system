Not at all. Some products were good value compared to previous historic prices. I bought an echo for £79.99 (usually £149.99) and an echo dot as a gift for someone £34.99 (usually £50). Then there were other products like coffee machines, microwaves, drills and some of those products had more than 50% discount. If you were after a particular product and it happened to be on sale then you could have made a huge saving; far more than a competitor was offering.
