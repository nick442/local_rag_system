Real loans are forgone consumption, like a savings account. In real terms, you can loan only when you put aside something from consuming it. Any kind of monetary tricks and expansion cant create real savings out of thin air, only an illusion of savings like in economic bubbles: the idea - banking system getting money first creates illusion of more credit being available than what savers are actually putting aside so the seeds for an unsustainable bubble are sewn.
