They won't survive. If it looks like they will, the right wing will pass more laws that only aim to bankrupt the postal service. They'll keep hammering until it's dead, hand it over to some ridiculously inefficient monopoly, and then hold it up as an example of how awful government run servhices are. And in a decade or so it'll cost a dollar to send a letter, you'll have to go to the past office to pick up your mail because there's no money in service to your door, and service will take weeks. Another decade, probably less, and the postal service will be a distant memory, and your only option for physical goods will be FedEx or .. well, nothing, because by then FedEx will have a monopoly. And it'll cost two dollars to send a letter, you'll have to pick it up wherever they decide to send it, and if you don't like it, too bad! Because there will be laws in place making it impossible to start up a competitor. They'll make billions, delivering worse service for higher prices, and all we'll ever hear about is how awful it was when the government ran the show and incompetently bankrupted the agency.
