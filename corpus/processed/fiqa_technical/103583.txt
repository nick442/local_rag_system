This should get interesting. BEA is a chronic under-performer, poorly managed and shareholders are suffering and Paul Singer is looking out for his shareholders. David Li has incredible political and social influence in HK and China. Elliott does not stand a chance. Paul Singer wants David to bow out with two times BEAâ€™s current book value, and everyone would win but David's ego is not calculated into this equation.
