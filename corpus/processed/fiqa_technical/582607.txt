"They stated *ebooks* are only 1% of their revenue. Amazon is responsible for 65% of *all* online new book sales, print included. Amazon and Hachette's disagreement on ebook pricing *shouldn't* affect the sales of Hachette's *print* books available on the site, but Amazon is increasing ship times, removing the ability to pre-order books, raised the prices of existing books, and lowering the chances that Hachette's book show up in their ""you might also like"" section. ([source](http://theverge.com/2014/8/9/5985901/amazon-hachette-contract-dispute-storystream)) I guess those changes might not add up to *half* of Hachette's revenue (I was mistakenly remembering [when Amazon removed the ""buy"" button from Macmillon's books in 2010](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/30/technology/30amazon.html) because of a similar dispute over ebook pricing), but you can bet their attempts to decrease Hachette's print book's availability, accessibility, and visibility on their site is having a very significant effect on their income. Again, Amazon is decreasing the availability of a publisher's *print* books because of a dispute over *ebook* pricing. That's nuts."
