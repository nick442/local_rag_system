I mean, the ultimate goal of the takeover would be removing a specific account, so if twitter shuts down all accounts, the it's a win (granted the investors don't care about monetary losses, which of course they do). Still, activist investors can get into proxy fights for board seats and even strategy with just 2% of a company. If there were enough people invested only in removing Trump, the trade of unhappy shareholders vs Trump seems easy to make.
