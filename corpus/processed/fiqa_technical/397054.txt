"Do you know who this guy is? He's the one who bankrupted himself building a replica of Versailles in Florida, then had the audacity to say >""people like me who made all the right decisions and invested in themselves are being forced to bail out all the people who didn't. The people that overspent their paychecks suddenly feel entitled to the same luxuries that I earned and sacrificed 42 years of my life for."" Bullshit! He didn't invest in himself, he spent money he didn't have on the most expensive house in America so he could live in a place that's entire history epitomizes decadence and luxory at the expense of everyone else. And how in the fuck does his personal tax rate affect his ability to run a business? He straight up says >""I have enough money for the rest of my life and enough to leave a good inheritance for our kids."" He admits that every paycheck from here on out is superfluous, so in what reality does an extra 5% in taxes so badly inconvenience him that he would be forced shut down his entire company? He's a scumbag. He doesn't care about his employees at all, he's a greedy douchebag who is trying to bully people into voting in his best interests, and his best interests absolutely *do not* line up with his employees'."
