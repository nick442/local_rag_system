Hahaha, I appreciate the comparison, but that's bullshit. Truthers are putting their own paranoid theories out there, you have no obligation to seek them out and respond to them. Socialists on the other hand are offering reasoned critique of your ideas. You can dismiss their arguments out of hand, but understand that it makes you look like an intellectual coward. Cock-surety may fool weaker opponents, but even then, only in the service of your own ego.
