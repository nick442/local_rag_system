"> You bring up the Feds but that confounds the issue because now we have to talk about monetary policy, taxation is fiscal policy If the goal is for more investments, you have to account for loans and money supply. Far more investment is done on issued bonds than on retained profits. >the firm has more money they are going to spend it somewhere That's an oversimplification.. they'll spend to maximize profit, not to grow GDP. The two are related, but the first isn't always optimal to the second.. if a firm captures monopoly, that's bad for GDP. The examples in the link are relevant in that context. They're only a part of the economy (""92 publicly held U.S. corporations that reported a U.S. profit every year from 2008 through 2015""). They're a non-trivial portion of the economy, and represent a large share of who will benefit from reducing corporate taxes. So when you say: >In general lowering taxes increases capital investment regardless of the investment rate The counter point is that.. no the investment rate matters. If spending those taxes produces a higher investment rate, you have to adjust policy accordingly. To know that you have to estimate the investment rate from a marginal reduction in taxes, and compare to the investment rate resulting form your marginal fiscal program spending increase. Saying that ""lowering taxes increases investment"" is insufficient, in the same sense that saying ""infrastructure spending increases investment"" is insufficient."
