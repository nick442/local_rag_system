One year patent limit isn't ludicrous for a simple reason. It doesn't require any measurement that can be abused. Ideally, the patent holder is recompensed for the cost for research and development and after that, competition should be allowed to take over. The trouble is anything involving cost can be and has been abused. A simple one year limit is hard to game.
