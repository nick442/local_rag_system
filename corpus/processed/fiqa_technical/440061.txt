It appears to me that the tax code gives significant advantages to being a corporation as opposed to being a person due to the relative ease of legal tax avoidance. As an individual, avoiding taxes is much harder than it is for a corporation. I mean, why can't I claim my deficit last year as an operating loss and use it to offset my taxes? I mean suppose I had to borrow money to afford food, that's pretty vital to my business (staying alive) operations. Why can't I offset my income with my borrowing like a corporation can?
