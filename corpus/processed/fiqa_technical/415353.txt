I would say, does the tv work? Will I get it at a discount? Sure, I will take it. You are trying to assign human emotions to an animal that simply does not have them. If you were to beat me, sure it would be mean, however, I am a human being, capable of thoughts and emotions that the turkey simply cannot. More to the point, the turkey is only brought into this world for a singular purpose. To be eaten. To be killed and eaten. Do you not eat turkey? Do you not eat beef? If you did neither, then your argument might sway me, but as the majority of folks do both, how that the same person that enjoys a turkey dinner, then say, oh, you have to be nice to that turkey, before you kill it, I stuff it, and then eat it? It just does not make any logical sense to me.
