I don't see that this system is very effective at rewarding productivity, which (particularly in software) is an inherently difficult thing to judge. That's why we've traditionally relied on human managers to make judgments between personnel in regards to compensation. But yeah, you bet I'm selfish. If I can get paid more than someone else for doing the same job, I'm going to do it. And I'd prefer to work somewhere that allows me to do that.
