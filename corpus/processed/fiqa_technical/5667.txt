R with RStudio is pretty damn easy to install/run, especially on Linux/Unix (includes OSX). The environment is great - it gives you package management, charts, documentation, a workspace browser, etc.., all in one. RStudio Server is also ridiculous - you set up a server that allows you to connect remotely, and gives you a full IDE in your web browser, allowing you to run scripts on your home server, analyse datasets, etc.., all done remotely. Not sure about Python, but I doubt it has all the packages that R has. It also has a fragmentation problem (Python 2 vs. Python 3, Cython vs PyPy, etc..). I like R's very data-oriented nature (all values are vectors), and R can be very quick if you use it idiomatically (as opposed to writing Python in R). R also has libraries for machine learning, neural networks, clustering, etc.., anything you could want. And if I were to use another language for algorithms, it would be C++ anyway. But anyhow, as a basic tool for gathering info and creating charts, R is great. A few very easy one-liners get you a lot of data very quickly. I mean, you learn it in stats class in university, no programming skills required. And if you do want to go deeper, learning it isn't that hard..
