> They come up with algorithms to deal with it. Google's search business has more to do with their bottom line that anything else. They will always provide their end-users with the best quality results possible even if it means relaxing their own regulations. Behemoth services have leverage over Google because they're providing the best content for thousands of non-competitive terms. Shit doesn't work that way here because this site isn't a traditional directory, and therefor sites have a different form of leverage entirely. Google issues recurring traffic payments to content providers; submit a link here and you are paid in one lump sum. Submissions cost Reddit money when they're more than a day or two old.

Anyone can fill the void for the fallen. There's nothing sketchy about a blacklist. Google nukes out thousands of websites every single day, and since they are a registrar they can see what other domains the owners of the website have actively registered. Occasionally they'll even takeout big name players in communities if they're highly active. If a company is offering index-like service online they have a blacklist.
