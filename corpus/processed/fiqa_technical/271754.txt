While I respect your opinion, I'm not so sure myself. There needs to be a concrete reason for these people to stop handling our personal security so flippantly. Putting the company out of business for complete negligence on their part sends a signal out. This incident, combined with increasing incidents of companies pressing criminal charges against white hat hackers, just tells me that this is willful negligence, and we should not allow it. Were it simply a mistake, sure, maybe we let them continue operating, but they knowingly put our security at risk. Fuck these guys. Someone else will step up, and fill the void they leave, hopefully with a bit more integrity. You know, the way the American system is meant to work.
