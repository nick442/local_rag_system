There is no, like, false advertising or misleading that you can claim? Or even reporting them to the Better Business Bureau or something, which maybe isn't enough, but is something. Is there a way to report web scams that is actually effective? Because this seems to border on being a very widespread scam. They did actually take my money. Ebay, Amazon, and other major sites have policies that are pretty tight and can hold up. I wonder if this company can be compared to this but with very bad policies. Ebay can't just enact any policy and get away with it. If they take my money, it seems like there is legal recourse. You buy a product from me, I can't enact any policy on the purchase you make. I can't have fine print that says that you purchased this toy gun and so if it turns out to be a real gun and it kills your kid, too bad. Maybe that is a bad analogy. I'm just saying, websites are subject to reasonable questioning of their policies under the law or at least business institutions. I posted a 3 star review, but the comment (if they post it) is very direct and negative, without making any specific claims. Again, we'll see. I guess they can reject that as well.
