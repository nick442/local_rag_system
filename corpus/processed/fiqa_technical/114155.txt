>When you debate someone, in a forum or somewhere other than your armchair, I suggest you forget about trying to demand a opposite answer from someone as an answer to a question. Its not only childish, its really quite silly When you post a statement as fact, you might want a single example to back it up, or at least admit you have none. *You* claimed that no empire purchased its own debt. Please back it up or admit you are wrong. You said, and I quote: >Show me some other great empire in history that managed to purchase its own debt. You still have not listed an empire that did not purchase it's own debt.
