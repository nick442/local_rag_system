It just occured to me that the larger the debt the easier it is for the Fed to strangle the economy, concentrate wealth even more, and choke off government spending on things other than debt service. It is a huge problem that the US government appears to be in a permanent structural deficit that gets bigger both during expansions AND contractions.
