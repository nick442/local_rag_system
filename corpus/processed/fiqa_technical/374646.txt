"I recently went full time self employed after doing photography on the side for several years. One of the types I do is real estate photography, but it's tough doing it alone so I signed up to freelance with a company that basically brokers out jobs in the area. They cover close to 70% of the market share so they're big. I now get ten times the work I used to, for less money but the volume and the fact I no longer edit make up for it. However, they made me sign a non compete that says I cannot shoot real estate photography for two years after I leave them. I've always thought that I'd really like to see how enforceable that is since I did real estate for two years before them, they didn't teach me anything new, so what gives them the right to tell me I can't continue doing what I already did just because I'm no longer with them? What kind of bullshit, un-American crap is that? The jokes on them, though, as they apparently don't read their own stuff very well. They told me I'd be allowed to still shoot independently with the agents I worked with prior to freelancing for them if I just wrote them in at the bottom of the non compete so they'd have it for their records. So I did; I specifically named the the big offices I wanted to keep working with (that didn't already use the company I was going to be working with) and also put another line that said ""and all current, former, and future clients of my business, xyzabc photography"" and they signed off on it and returned a copy to me. Still, the fact that they think they have the right to limit me from doing a career that I already did and received no training from them is so asinine and ridiculous."
