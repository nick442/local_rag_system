"Really? Because, the funniest thing just happened, I just scoured their news (undoubtedly more than you have done in consideration). Rather than finding just ""uniform crap,"" there are actually a few good investigative stories, like [this one](https://news.vice.com/story/weed-fraud-are-you-getting-cheated) about cannabis testing labs corruptly falsifying THC content to increase the value of crops. That isn't poorly investigated. That's not from a wire service. That's decent investigative reporting. You really shouldn't talk about things when you clearly don't put yourself in a position to be informed on the topic. You're just espousing unhelpful ignorance. Oh, and also thanks for the downvote, which you broke the rules of this subreddit giving, since my comment clearly contributes to a discussion (that you decided to join). Although, I don't really care about upvotes or downvotes, so feel free to give me another. Or two. Or three. IDC you little twerp."
