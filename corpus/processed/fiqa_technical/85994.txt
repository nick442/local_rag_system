So let me get this straight.. anti-tax warriors who argue from a right-wing libertarian stance that financial liberty is the most important form of liberty want to hold the taxpayers hostage to force the bloated federal government to fund a wall on the southern border of the United States that comprises the territory of multiple state governments, without allowing for those state governments and their citizens the liberty to decide for themselves, nor advocating for private capitalist interests to fund the wall out of their own pockets via private land ownership along the border, which is the hallmark of their entire economic theory?
