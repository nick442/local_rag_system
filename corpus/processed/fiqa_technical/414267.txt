Nothing has changed. I work with many 20 somethings and over the past five years none of them opted into the company health care and when I have talked with 30 somethings they stated that they took the same approach 10 years ago. It wasn't until they started to experience physical issues (due to growing older) and starting a family did they buy into health care. This is just another PR in the never ending pieces floating around the media these days. No fact checking.
