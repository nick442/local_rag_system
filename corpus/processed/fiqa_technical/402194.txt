I remember hearing a story about how on Monty Python's Flying Circus they wanted to pull a prank like this. For one episode they wanted to every so slowly pot down the volume of the show independent of the skits going on. That way the viewers would be constantly turning up the volume. Then at the end of the show set the volume to the normal level and have it blast everyone. Sadly the BBC said no.
