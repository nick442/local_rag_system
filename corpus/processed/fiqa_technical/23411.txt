Don't get me started about the law. I'm a lawyer and the business model is a mess. You'll hear about massive unemployment with lawyers. This is because lawyers are exempt from overtime. Firms slave associates for 70-100 weeks for years. No weekends, no holidays. Most associates make less per hour than their secretaries. Then they fire associates instead of making them partners and hire new associates desperate for a job. I know lawyers are hated, but please have some sympathy for associates who work 10-12 hour days and get paid less per hour than the staff. Happened to me. There are two necessary reforms. One is to allow ownership of law firms by non-lawyers. This has happened in the UK. If Costco or other companies could have law firms, it would kill the greedy partner aspect and make legal work accessible to many more people. I'm 100% in favor. I'll happily take a lower wage and serve more people. Everyone should be able to afford a lawyer. The other necessary reform is making *anyone* who isn't an owner entitled to 40 hour work weeks and overtime. If you own your own business and want to put in 90 hours, fine. But you should not be able to force an exempt employee to work 90 hours unless that employee is an owner. Those are entirely fair and reasonable and would transform the profession into what it should be. I've since started teaching. It doesn't pay as well, but at least I don't have to ram down a Christmas dinner and then go into the office. Or spend a Fourth of July on top of the parking structure to see a few fireworks before going back in to work more.
