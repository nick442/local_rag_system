"Are you a commercial pilot? If not, you have no idea how much training they have to go through on an ongoing basis, not to mention a medical every six months, etc. Trust me, if the system ""goes down"", you'll be damn grateful there are highly trained professionals in the cockpit to save your ass. EDIT; Sorry, didn't mean to rant, but I have a close family member who is a commercial captain, and I tend to get riled up when people don't understand what kind of training these guys have to go through."
