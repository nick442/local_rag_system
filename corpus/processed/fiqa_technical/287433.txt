I'm saying if she LIKES you (which she most like doesn't) she will help you regardless of whether your leave or stay. But you should not even view that as an option. You need to do what's best for YOU. If you know a better opportunity is around the corner, your boss should respect your decision and you find a neutral way to leave your job. However, I don't know your situation and it's not great to leave as soon as you got there, it makes you look like you don't know what you're doing or don't know what you want (which is what everybody is doing anyway.) Don't trust your boss unless you knew her prior to this job for a long time, or through family. That should not come into play in your decision. You can network with bankers to get a banking job, do you really need to spend months and months appeasing this one person to get referrals? On the flipside, you definitely want to be in good standing with your boss. Again, do what's best for you. Don't take empty promises or you will get burned.
