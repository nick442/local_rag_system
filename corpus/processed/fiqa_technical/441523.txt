I think you're being inexact with your comment about healthcare. Japanese healthcare outcomes are - by and large - not due to medical services or quality of clinical environments/hospitals. For example, Japanese who live in Japan have a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases (especially those related to life style and diet) than Japanese who move to the USA, or Americans generally. There are other areas - lung cancer, for example - where outcomes are better as well despite more Japanese who smoke (though relative amount of smoking per smoker may differ - I'm not sure how much). The point is, Japanese health outcomes are largely better than US outcomes due to healthier lifestyles. I would go so far as to say it is the primary cause of comparatively better health outcomes.
