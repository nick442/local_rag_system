I knew of their plans to introduce a lot more automation, but at least according to the article they aren't planning on introducing the AmazonGo system into Whole Foods stores. Interested to see what other automation they have in mind. Are there By other big players in that market, or is it just not large enough to support a national chain? I can think of Trader Joe's. It's been a while since I was in one, but I'mâ€‹ not remembering it being as large or as nice. Unless I'm mistaken, the other big one was Wild Oats, and WF bought them out..
