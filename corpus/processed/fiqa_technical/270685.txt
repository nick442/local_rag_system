I am quite aware that corruption goes beyond cash. I was merely pointing out that most tax incentives are not a literal, real-time transfer of money from the tax payers to the corporations. I have had quite a few discussions with people about this and some folks think that their tax dollars are literally being transferred form their paycheck withholdings to a company's bank account and that is not exactly true. It sounds like you understand the difference but some do not.
