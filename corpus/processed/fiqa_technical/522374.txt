"Holy crap you really bought what was being sold. For 8 years I watched as my gun owning friends, some I would call 2nd amendment ""enthusiasts"" go crazy as they talked about all the ways their gun owning rights were threatened by that man in the white house. All the while gun and ammo sales went like gangbusters. He acted once (twice?) to expand gun rights and, to my knowledge, did nothing to set them back. For 8 years FUD was spread throughout the ""2nd amendment community"" while gun and ammo manufacturers profited like crazy and nothing actually threatened them and the NRA was turned into a parody of itself. It's .. Odd."
