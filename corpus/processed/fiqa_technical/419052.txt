Democracy doesn't mean you automatically have free and efficient markets. India has many structural and regulatory roadblocks set up for businesses and for people. India should study what China did to transform their country. To me, it's crazy that even Indians can't buy land in their own country. (in J&K, for example.) Or the heavy FX rules. Things like that.
