They're basing it off data from Seattle, [where a minimum wage increase was approved in 2015](http://www.seattle.gov/laborstandards/ordinances/minimum-wage), and has not been fully implemented yet (and won't be until 2021, although large employers will hit $15 before then). Seems a bit premature to me.
