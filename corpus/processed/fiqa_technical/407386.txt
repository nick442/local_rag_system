Financial panics tend to last about 7 years. I mean, there may be nothing at all unusual about this last one. Having a steady hand, not panicking may turn out to be the right course. The US isn't Japan primarily because our population is still growing and we have a shitload of natural resources. So there is reason to believe we'll come out of the financial panic in roughly the same timeframe as prior financial panics.
