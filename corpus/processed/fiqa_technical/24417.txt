This shifting is costs is made even worse by the fact that the worst breaches are coming from companies that most consumers don't have a choice about dealing with. Therefore, there isn't even a market incentive to encourage companies to behave better.

However most of Equifax's victims didn't really have a say about whether Equifax had their data.
