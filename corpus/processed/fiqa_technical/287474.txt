This is not really directly answering your question, but I think it's something you need to hear, and it's too long for a comment: Your business plan for your company you are considering starting should include a forecast of all of your expected revenues and expenses. This includes a forecast for taxes you will owe the IRS on the profits from your business. If your business plan does not yet have this type of information, it is far too soon for you to be asking investors for money. It is often said that an 'idea' is worthless, it is only the execution of that idea that is worth something. If you only have an 'idea' for a business but have no track record of running a business and no proof that your concept will work, you should take some more time to consider how you can proof viability, before you approach investors. No investor will want to give money to someone without a business plan that includes a forecast of profits (which is backed up by evidence some how).
