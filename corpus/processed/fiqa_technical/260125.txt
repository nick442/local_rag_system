"I am not sure if you were disagreeing with me, but I agree with you. However, what is better for the economy is a slightly different issue. Welfare is part of a 1-2 anti-poverty combo punch. The problem there is no 2, i.e., decent paying jobs. This falls on the ""Leaders"" in the private sector who don't seem to be stepping up. You can't examine welfare without first examining wages, income/wealth disparity, and the plight of the US worker. You also can't use any warped conclusions from that first examination to justify eliminating welfare. ""Anti-poverty spending is up!"" Yeah, makes sense since employment participation is WAY down. Kind of makes the case FOR welfare not against. Less welfare! And more what? Starving? It is an insane argument to have in an advanced nation."
