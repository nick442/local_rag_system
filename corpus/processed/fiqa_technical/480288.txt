The maligned incentives go all the way up the chain. In Atlanta, staff and administrators stole the tests and changed answers. Even besides the incentive problems, student test scores were not designed to measure teacher performance. You get these crazy schemes where teachers in non-tested subjects are having fifty percent of their evaluation based on the average of teachers in a basket of similar classes, that some NCLB-funded consultant handpicked from his office. It's absurd.
