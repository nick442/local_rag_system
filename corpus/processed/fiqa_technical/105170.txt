> 90% CO2 emitted 100 years has already sunk, absorbed by biota and oceans. I understand your point. You believe the US is less responsible for temperature increases than the proportion of its total emissions since most of those emissions are no longer in the air. So, does that mean you also believe China is less responsible for ocean acidification than the proportion of its total emissions since most of those emissions have not been absorbed by the oceans?
