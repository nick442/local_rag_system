The problem, really, is Amazon generally delivers better pricing AND better service on top of a better experience. No club cards, nothing clogging your mailbox, no chip and signature getting beeped at bullshit, no super narrow aisles full of double-wides asses you can't get around, no shopping car that rides like it's a modded impala on Hydros, no going to multiple stores to get a decent price on things. Eff all that.
