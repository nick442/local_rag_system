In most mutual funds you delegate voting rights to the investment manager. The securities are typically held by a third party bank as part of the requirements for Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). You own equity in that mutual fund, which owns the shares (but are held by a third party); you don't have direct ownership as in most cases that would result in you owning fractions of shares.
