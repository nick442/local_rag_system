"Hiring outside the union is considered union breaking and is against federal law. In my state, teachers can select not to be a union member, but they have to still pay 75% of the dues. The underlying ""logic"" is that they benefit from the union doing the negotiations. Most teachers opt to pay the extra 25% and have the vote. It depends on the state. That's what all the recent discussion about ""Right to work"" states is about. People wouldn't have to join the union and still pay union dues."
