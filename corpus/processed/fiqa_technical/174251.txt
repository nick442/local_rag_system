Thank God that hospice can provide such care because the real problem is that there is a window of time when some elderly are too infirm to live independently but too poor to afford the atrocious high costs of assisted living care. This leaves quite a few elderly in the position of having to rely on the goodwill of relatives to take them in and who may not be emotionally or financially stable enough to withstand the stress that comes from being a caregiver for the elderly. If hospice can provide support for the family and the patient, more power to them.
