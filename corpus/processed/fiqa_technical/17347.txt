A simple rule of tax is , It doesn't matter where u live or your residence when it comes to income accruing in India . As far as i know , You will need to find out the purchase prices of the inherited land and calculate the index value . Then pay tax on the capital profit (Not sure , I guess its 20%) Example : Original value is 100,000 and the index value is 1,500,000 so the profit will be 650,000 . You pay 20% of the 650k only . For paying minimum tax (Tax saving) There are few sections which gives exemption like purchase some bonds or purchase a house . Its best if you ask a chartered accountant , For this simple case he shouldn't charge much. He should have updated knowledge of the situation and guide you better .
