In reading the Moody's report I found it funny that 2 notches worth of Morgan Stanley's rating id due to the benefit from implied TBTF protection. So here we are 4 years after the crisis and Morgan Stanley still has 2 notches of creditworthiness due to still being TBTF. So without that MS would be one notch above junk.
