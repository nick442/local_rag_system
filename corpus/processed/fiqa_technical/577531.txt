If that's not a politically loaded title to your post I don't know what is. Wal-Mart pays it's employees the wage that it is competitive, in line with similar types of work, and what it is able to afford and still offer the pricing they can on the products they offer (and still make money). What they're doing is legal and ethical. Additionally, if the people that work at Wal-Mart need more money than their jobs offer, what concern of their employer is that? If the people don't like that they don't make enough money at their job and have to take welfare, then it's their responsibility to improve their situation, not their employer's to give them more money for the same work just because they don't earn enough. Is Wal-Mart's (or any place of employment for that matter) mission to enrich their employees or to do business to make a profit? I hope your answer is the latter. If it's not I think you're less an advocate of business and more an advocate of socialism and wealth redistribution.
