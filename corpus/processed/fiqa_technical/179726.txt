> Are occasional use grid-scale natural gas plants economically viable compared to distributed gas generators? Yes, a good question. I'm sure that ecologically a grid-scale natural gas plant is better than distributed as it will have higher efficiency and better maintenance. But I can see that the overhead of the grid (needs to be maintained too) may be too big economically and people may decide to drop of the grid entirely. Where I live natural gas is not that widespread outside the cities, so this is probably not viable to most people. On the other hand we already today get 15% of your electricity from hydro storage, so on a national level, we are not too far from the presumed 20%. However, currently the pumped hydro storage plants have economic problems, because solar is eating their traditional high-price peak around lunch time.
