The order book looks fine, if it were a liquid market. However, a bid that matches with an ask will always be met on a first come first serve basis. There's no other way to do it. Most traders don't like doing that because they want to try to get a lower price. HFT don't have to worry about meeting the ask because they're just going to pass that cost on to the guy on the hook. By the time the HFT makes the buy they already know the guy wants to buy at 70.00 They did not know that at the time they placed the buy order. If the buy order from the HFT hasn't been cancelled it means they already found someone. How? By testing the market with sell orders at the same time they were sending buy orders. They keep a little bit of stock in reserve to perform these tests.
