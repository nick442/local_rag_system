"Look, I think the thought-process for (falsely) believing physics knowledge is a requirement to understand examples illustrating a completely different topic is as follows: You don't understand calculus/ODE topic. The teacher gives an example. You still don't get it. Therefore, you falsely believe that if you had understood the context of the problem, you would understand the solution. This is twisted and backwards reasoning. Let's say I am learning subtraction. If the teacher says ""Gherio wants to make Tyyau. For that, he needs 10 Lals. If he currently has 6 Lals, how many more does he need? Well kids, this is just a subtraction problem: 10 - 6 = 4"", it is completely okay. Who cares what Tyyau or Lal are?? If you know, great; if not, you can still understand the subtraction problem."
