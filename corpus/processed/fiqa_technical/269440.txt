Aside for the unsupported claims. I think we can all agree people are not a commodity that is valued in dollars. People are invaluable, their labor however can be. Secondly, the higher wage is in Portland proper with surrounding counties having lower minimums. It's only been two weeks. Give it time before criticizing.
