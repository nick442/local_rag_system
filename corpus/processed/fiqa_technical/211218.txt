> But then why wouldn't that be their primary mode to control their currency now/are they starting/hinting at doing so to move away from US treasuries? China is massively pumping their economy with easy loan. They have pretty much stoped/holding steady dollar piling. The question you have to ask, how can China accumulate surplus, not accumulating dollar, yet have their currency very much steady against dollar. China does not use treasury purchase as primary mean to control Yuan price anymore.
