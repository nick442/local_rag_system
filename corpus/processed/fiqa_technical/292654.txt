">You assume that student performance is a good proxy for teacher performance. One of the bigger influences on student performance is parent engagement. If the goal is success in actual conveyance of knowledge, then external factors are merely the ""environment"" in which the performance (or lack thereof) must be executed. If a teacher is incapable of reaching a particular group of students (due to whatever ""environmental"" reasons) then that teacher is obviously NOT performing IN that environment. It would be best then (for everyone, *including that teacher*) to get a DIFFERENT teacher in their place; and for that teacher then to attempt to teach in a different environment (where they may be capable of shining), rather than to keep them in an environment where they are failing. **A big part of the problem here is that ""merit"" is seen by teachers as if it were a judgment of them as PEOPLE** -- which, ironically enough is a rather juvenile mindset -- when in fact **it is merely a judgement of their specific performance in a particular situation.** And as far as pay is concerned -- pay varies in virtually EVERY profession and industry (and people MOVE and CHOOSE accordingly) -- the seeking of some utopian ""egalitarianism"" is woefully naive."
