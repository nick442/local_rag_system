Their messaging always weirded me out. They keep talking about you not needing a bank, but have no checking savings. Probably because it's low margin. They stick to student loans, mortgages from rich parts of the market for low risk. They tranche them just like old housing mortgages, but I wonder if there are enough high quality customers out there to satisfy the demand of their investors.
