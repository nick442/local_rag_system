"I hate to break it to you, but we have had this little thing called ""white flight"" since Eisenhower was president. Most American cities are now burnt out ghettos. People with high income potential don't want to live in them. It has nothing to do with wealthy assholes. Gangster thugs and the CIA have deliberately destroyed the tax base, because no one with any sense at all wants to be anywhere near them."
