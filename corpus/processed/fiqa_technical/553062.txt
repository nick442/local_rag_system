In other words, Wal-Mart offered them a job, when no one else would. But somehow that makes Wal-Mart the villain. I guess they should learn their lesson, raise wages, and hire workers with higher skill sets. That'll make you feel warm and fuzzy, and it'll give someone else a higher wage job. Of course, the low skill workers will just not be hired to any job, but I guess it's better for them to be on straight welfare than working with some subsidies. Right?
