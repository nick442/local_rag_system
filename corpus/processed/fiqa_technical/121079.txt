Actually it has been disproven that minimum wage leads to higher earnings for companies. You are without a doubt wrong on that fact. Because money has fluctuating value, more money does not necessarily lead to higher purchasing power. This is pretty well known by most monetary theorist. It's actually pretty ridiculous to believe otherwise. But hey, if you want to be wrong be my guest.
