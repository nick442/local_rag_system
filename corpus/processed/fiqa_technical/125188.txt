I am not surprised that things are changing in the economy there! I'd hate to be a small business owner in Renton who has employees they are trying to keep. The problem I have is that there are two views: 1. Wages on a supply/demand curve is the only analysis that needs to be done. This is the one that supports Republican talking points. High wages hurt people! That's it. 2. Or, we can consider everything else that can give. People commuting from out of the area, businesses re-inventing themselves to be more efficient to hold profits, less skilled workers moving to lower cost of living areas like Renton to find work. There are a lot of things that can move in this system, just as you point out. It's a gravity well, it's a change in the nature of the economic space. In the end of the day, we have simple measures (employment rate) that is saying that the effects are being absorbed elsewhere in the system. This study, which does a complex model, using those other places that are affected in the opposite manner by the change? Do you really trust it, when the tried and true tool is saying differently?
