One of my ex-employers stateside had a BES policy that disabled Push after 8PM each night weeknights and all weekend long. Was pretty neat. Too bad their IT people also decided to twiddle every BES bit they could find including encryption, memory scrubbing while idle, disabling USB mass-storage mode, and disabling MMS. We finally got them to reverse the USB mass-storage gaffe but they left encryption turned on for the SD card so if the phone died, your data on SD was gone. This whole employer/personal phone thing is a tough nut to crack. Solutions will be interesting to see. I like one paradigm on Android phones, installing a third-party Outlook replacement such as RoadSync (not a plug, it's just one I found that had features I liked, the UI is actually kinda weird, using radio buttons in e-mail lists that also act as checkboxes and whatnot) and have the third-party Outlook replacement enforce necessary Exchange policy on the application itself, if the app gets wiped, the app loses its data but user data is left intact. The neat thing I like about such software is most has scheduling, so YOU can control when you want it to stop checking e-mail. Mine stops in the evening and weekends and starts back up in the morning. Nokia had a pseudo-interesting method where you could have a home profile and a work profile but that mostly controlled ringtones, etc. Some have suggested doing a hypervisor scheme where you run two OSes concurrently and one is work, one is personal..it's a tough situation. Employers want to maintain a vice grip on their data, but people don't want an electronic tether, as it were. Carrying two devices for most people is impractical. Silly world with your technology.
