All cars have problems, especially those that are older like your husbands, how about maintaining it properly? Actually the older SAABs (SAAB 900s)are pretty tough, if you look after them they will last a long time , like this guy who made a million miles in his 900 http://www.jsonline.com/business/29181064.html , the rot started as soon as GM started to get involved and stifle the engineers in an attempt to get up volumes and share platforms.
