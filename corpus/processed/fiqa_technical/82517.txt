Tesla is currently unmatched in the industry for leveraging the software and built in communications on their vehicles. Other manufacturers talk the same game, but I've yet to see anyone else rev their software with feature updates like Tesla. I wish the others would step up their game. I hope they are the first to implement car following. Then every time an owner brings in an ICE car to service, it becomes an ad for Tesla as the owner drops off the ICE vehicle, then steps into the Tesla that silently followed them to the mechanic's.
