"Do you trade? I didnt think so. Never made a mistake in your life either right? Not that I am saying the securities rated triple AA was a mistake. But I find it amazingly telling, that america redditors, only hate the rating groups when they say shit they dont like. They down grade greece and ""it is about time"" The downgrade the us and it is ""dont you remember a couple years ago when they lied about securities"", of course the millions of other things they have rated have turned out to follow the ratings pretty fucking well but a couple of years they fucked up so lets throw out all the ratings except the ones we agree with. Like it or not, we need ratings, even if the industry was recently rocked by scandel. It is a crucial aspect of a market economy. (also mind you, the way this corruption would work, it is more handy to inflate somethings ratings than to deflate them, but what ever the conspiracy heads will see a conspiracy in everything despite not a single soul on reddit should disagree with the BofA rating, not if you have been paying the least amount of attention on reddit)"
