"I watch a lot of the Vice shows on HBO. Generally I like what they do. But they are obviously very liberal-slanted. I got a little irritated last week when they did a segment about health care. One of the reporters talked to a bunch of doctors about health care. They all talked about how the payments from insurance companies are small and/or unfair, etc. Then at the end, all the doctors just kind of said ""single payer health care would be the best plan"". But they never provided any kind of outline for what plan that is. There are many different ways to organize a single payer system. But to just say ""single payer is great"" seems unhelpful to me, and just trying to push a bias."
