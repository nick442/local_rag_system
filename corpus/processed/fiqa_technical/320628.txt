This. I'd ask around a bit to find out if more people miss the bowling alley, see if there is interest for a 'reboot'. Also, at the very least you should talk to the current owners about how it is going, what's happening etc. to put some feelers out without expressing direct interest. Maybe they have racked up a hefty debt, who knows. Scope it out a bit. Be wary of looking at it from a sentimental point of view. You had a great time there, you're not guaranteed to have that again, even with you running it. Running it and visiting it are way different. You will probably have to do a lot of marketing/publicity stuff for it, so plan accordingly. And what 9ersaur said, you probably need capital, especially if the business has been stagnant. If they serve food, the kitchen may not be up to standards anymore, etc. If after that you still want to do it, and have a plan, then definitely opt for buying them out directly or over time. You probably do not want the previous owners' emotional attachments getting in the way. (cue gordon ramsay's restaurant makeovers) That said, they may just like what you want to do and support you all the way, who knows. Good luck!
