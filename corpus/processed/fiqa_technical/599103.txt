My wife was once on a game show. The income was 1099 and wholly unrelated to gambling. I did offset the hotel cost on a schedule C against it (and filed a California return to get back the withholding) but a television appearance for a prize is not gambling. It is pay for a performance and she didn't risk any of her own money. Your friend's 8k loss can only offset casino or lottery winnings, sorry.
