Be cognizant of your own limitations when approaching this material. I've dealt with lawyers, doctors, engineers and other highly intelligent people from other disciplines, who then try to learn about companies and the stock market. Their own arrogance and assumption that they can just learn anything *quickly* ends up hurting them. It can take years and real classical training of finance to understand this material with any depth. Someone is wrong (a fool) in every trade. There is someone who is going to make money and lose money. Odds are the fool is you.
