"No offense but how is it inspiring given it took the socialization of risk markets (bailouts, tens of trillions in liability guarantees, wholesale changes in mark-to-market accounting rules, QE which continues to this day) and undermining of our judicial process (pretending no fraud was truly prosecutable) - all to the outsized benefit of the ultimate insider and anti-competition specialist Buffett? I traded before, during and after the crisis and any of my losses were 100% my own while guys down the Avenue had their bonuses guaranteed by TARP and I am supposed to be inspired? Buffett sure did ""bet on America"", it just isn't what most people like to think it is."
