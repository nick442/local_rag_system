Agreed; additionally, a good portion of our population knows no history. They are being manipulated with the same rhetoric that's been misleading the masses forever. American families should all be making significantly more money but those darn minorities and terrorists (insert non-sense here). Socialism is stigmatised and most people don't understand just how much they would benefit from more socialist policy. One of the two major political parties is also ignoring the very liberal direction their base wants to go. They tried to shove an establishment, status-quo politician down our throats and now we have the embodiment of the American disease as our head of state.
