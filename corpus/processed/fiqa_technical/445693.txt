"Sending your money off to do the heavy lifting is just a stylish way to say ""investing"". He is saying hold back 6 months of living expenses and don't invest it. Keep it in cash or some cash-like investment (genuinely safe and liquid). It's good basic solid advice you'll also get from Dave Ramsey, Suze Orman and any financial advisor worth a darn. While this is good advice, that does not mean all of his advice is good. A classic con-man trick is to tell you three things you know are true, mixed with a lie they want you to believe. They want you to think ""I know 3/4 are true so the fourth probably is too."""
