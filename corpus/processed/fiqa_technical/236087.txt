"Right, but there were tangible reasons that made sense. That was fueled by a cycle of predatory loans and consumers being dumb enough to think that just because they got approved for a $500K house with a 500 credit score meant they should definitely take out massive loans and buy it. This was piled on by the derivative market, specifically credit default swaps, which certain people recognized as creating a liquidity issue. They didn't know *when* the crash was going to occur. They just knew that the asset bubble fueled by massive debt, with this debt being falsely rated as AAA when most of it was Junk, left banks in a position of complete insolvency when the mortgage defaults reached a certain point. When people realized the extent of the debt, (e.g. knowing with common sense that people with a 550 credit score shouldn't have 7 properties and be allowed to be that over-leveraged, let alone be rated AAA) and the amount of derivatives that would have to be paid out on top of having no cash flow due to mortgage defaults, they recognized that a bubble bursting would wreak havoc on the economy. That had a lot of moving parts. Simply saying ""DAE OVERVALUED RECORD HIGHS CRASH COMING SOON!??!?!?!??!!??!?!?!? WHEN!??!?! HOW!!?"" is fucking stupid. Nobody knows. What evidence did OP offer? Not that he wouldn't still get laughed out because this topic is fucking annoying with thousands of people crying ""overvalued"", but he didn't even mention P/E ratio or anything. He literally came in and basically said ""when is it all gonna fall apart?"". Nobody knows the answer."
