"So did they start weighing their products a little better? We try to be vigilant now, but I've been burned a few times by WF weighing things incorrectly. I always check the labels carefully after paying like twenty bucks for a little thing of olives. Still got burned by a pound of meat which turned out to be more like 2/3 of a pound. Unrelated, but I hate that they don't seem to carry steak tips in my area. They just try to sell you garbage scraps as ""beef tips"" or tri-tip, which isn't the same thing."
