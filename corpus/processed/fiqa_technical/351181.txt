">Of course; the generation Xers are those in the age range where many were approaching the time when they would, but had not yet, transferred the bulk of their retirement savings to lower risk investments. **Your analysis is WAY off-base.** Gen X was more than a DECADE AWAY from even *thinking* of switching to ""lower risk investments"". The OLDEST Gen X'ers were born in 1964 and have (just now) turned 48 -- they were (at most) 44 years old in 2008 when the market crashed. The YOUNGEST Gen X'ers were born circa 1981-82, and (just now) have reached age 30 -- they were just getting started in their careers (around age 26) in 2008 when the market crashed. The MAJORITY of Gen X'ers were -- in 2008 -- in their mid 30's. NO ONE switches to ""low risk investments"" in their mid 30's. --- No, the only Gen X'ers who DIDN'T get ""screwed"" by the market crash were either: 1. Savvy enough to have SEEN the bubble & crash coming and so got OUT of the stock market and/or housing; or.. 2. Waited out the storm & sat tight -- and allowed their market holdings to both crash and then rebound (though they would still largely be ""down"" from where they were at peak 2008, they wouldn't have suffered huge losses)."
