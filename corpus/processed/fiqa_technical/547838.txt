But it goes both ways. Why should the people care about your business and if it's sustainable? The market will deem it unprofitable if he can't support paying his workers living wages. If there are no minimum wages that a person can scrape by on then you have preditory companies taking advantage of people or the business offsetting the cost to the public (like tips). The public would be subsidizing the business. I think you need to dig deeper into that logic.
