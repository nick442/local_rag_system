"Maybe I am a bit jaded but I don't spend a lot of time trying to convince friends or family members to avoid MLM schemes even though I personally see them as scams. If they specifically ask for my advice I will walk them through the economics of the particular MLM that they are interested in. I have found that if you get to pushy in showing your friends or family members that their new ""business"" is actually a fraud they tend to get defensive and it becomes counter productive to continue trying to convince them of their mistake. You waste your time and anger your friend or family member. It's just not worth it. There are a few key questions I like to ask people about their MLM ""business"". What does the business do? How do you make money? How do they make money? You would be amazed at the number of people that sign up and pay money to get into a business and they don't even have the slightest clue what the business actually does. Even fewer have an idea about how they can actually make money because the entire sales presentation focuses on what they could with all of the money they ""are going to make"". Why does this business need you? What do you bring to the table that the business doesn't already have (skills, contacts, money)? Most MLM's and especially the pyramid schemes focus more on recruiting people than selling products because they make their money on over priced initiation fees, and their products are mediocre at best."
