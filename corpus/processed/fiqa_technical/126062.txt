Ahaha you're so butthurt it kills me. I'm not sure wtf insight you think I should be giving on CIMs or pitch books cuz they're pretty fkn self explanatory. As for modelling, infra modelling (which is most of my modelling experience) is super technical and the models are really extensive so it's not really applicable to most other industry groups. You don't have to believe me about who I am or what I do but I really gain nothing from lying about it lmao
