"Not really. You can map the ctrl/option/command keys to the Windows equivalent of control/alt/win. In fact, the Option key is already labeled ""alt"" as well, so really the command key will become the windows key. If you're the primary user of the PC you'd get used to it really quick. Lack of a labeled 10-key may suck though if you're doing a lot of number entry, but I've never found laptop overlay 10-key to be really functional anyway, full-size keyboards are still the best for that."
