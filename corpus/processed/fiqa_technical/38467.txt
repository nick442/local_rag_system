What I'm seeing in US cities now reminds me of Europe: wealthier people living in walkable city neighborhoods, forcing the poor out to the 'burbs. The one, big catch is schools. In the US, urban living for families with kids often means a choice between bad schools or costly private schools, while some suburban public school districts offer both high quality and low cost. That's what locks so many families into the two-cars-and a-minivan life.
