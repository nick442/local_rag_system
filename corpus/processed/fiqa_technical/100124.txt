What does not seem reasonable about your plan is the payment and buyout. While $200/month payments are possible (but hard to find), buyouts are more typically in the five figure range. Given that your savings and desired payment for a car is low (the average car payment today is about 450/month), can you really afford the massive depreciation of a late model vehicle? Why not purchase a 2000 car now, and save the 200-300 per month? In about a year you could move up to a ~5000 car. You can buy a pretty nice car for 5K. Myself, I am on my third year of driving a 4000 car.
