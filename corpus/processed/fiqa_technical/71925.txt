Former corporate M&A team member here. We wanted to do deals just as much as anyone else, that's why those teams exist. We were definitely more disciplined than our banks, but at the end of the day we are all former bankers looking to do a deal. Plus you can only tell your CEO/CFO no so many times (believe me we did).
