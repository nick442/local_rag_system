"So, you only want people who are ""perfectly prepared"" to fit into your unique job opening.. Oh, and you want them to have a very specific set of ""Pre-Approved Stamps""; and for them to have been trained through their ""apprentice/journeyman"" years by *someone else*. And, of course, you would like to hire these ""perfect candidates"" at entry-level wages. **Good luck with that.** (Even if you do manage to GET such an employee, I can predict that you will generally NOT be keeping them long.)"
