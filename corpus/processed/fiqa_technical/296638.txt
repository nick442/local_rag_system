And when there's nowhere left to flee? What if it's not a foreign state but just 200 guys that roam town to town shaking down people? Too many for your militia to take without heavy casualties. What if they straight up enslave you to work fields for them? Are you not making a general assumption that people aren't bastards with this philosophy? These power structures exist for a reason; even isolated farms will form tribes eventually.. All you're doing is begging for the return of the feudal where a single actor has a monopoly on everyone else's safety with few checks and balances.
