The key is to shift the tax burden to the rich and the assets they own that earn money from your economy. Once you do that, the debt is just a measure of how much of the money that was created so the rich could earn more of it and get richer do some rich have to pay to the other rich at some point in the future. There isn't a reason to care about that. Right now, because we haven't done that, we need to keep creating debt to keep pumping new money into our economies to keep them running. The alternative is letting them stop running. That's not a good option.
