"I thought Derivatives Markets by Robert McDonald was a solid textbook when I used it for an SOA exam and a 4th year financial mathematics course. For a decent intro to interest rates, annuities, bonds etc I thought ""The Theory of Interest"" by Stephen Kellison was pretty good. Other people have mentioned Shreve's Stochastic Calculus for Finance. There's actually two parts to it. Part 1 is the binomial asset pricing model and this is the one you would want (for now). Part two is on stochastic differential equations. I've used part 2 and I thought it was a good book that covers a lot of amount of material. It is certainly not an easy read though"
