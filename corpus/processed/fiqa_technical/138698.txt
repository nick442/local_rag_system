"I suspect this is a function of deregulated banks' desire to write and flip as many mortgages as possible. The best targets for this sales push were naturally those with the most education, who tended to have the best credit ratings and most secure jobs. The last time I bought a house, the mortgage salesman practically lit up when looking at my income and credit score, pushing me hard to borrow more. ""You could buy a lot more house than this!"" he said. ""You could buy apartments as an investment or for resale!"" I resisted temptation, thank heaven, but it's all too easy to see how millions of others didn't."
