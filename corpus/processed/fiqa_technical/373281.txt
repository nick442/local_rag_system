Every product in Whole Foods has meet their quality standards which in essence means no artificial preservatives, no artificial flavorings, no artificial coloring, no hydrogenated fats, and no fructose corn syrup, amongst other minor things. This is for everything, including meats and produce. Other super markets may have some standards but none are nearly as strict as Whole Foods.
