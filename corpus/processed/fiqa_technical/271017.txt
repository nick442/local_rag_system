If the scratches are a bit deeper in that case, you can bring 100-grit sandpaper into use for limestone floor scratch removal.This sanding should be followed by one more sanding done by 300-grit sandpaper and once done, you can apply some mineral oil or colour enhancing sealer to make sure that the scratches canâ€™t be seen at all.
