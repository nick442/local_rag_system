">I think it already came in 2008. An arbitrary definition of GDP growth hardly means we aren't in a recession now. I'm surprised you haven't been eaten alive by the armchair economists who treat an economics text book as gospel and not simply one way of interpreting a complex dynamic system which has existed long before the study of human commerce. The economy isn't a simple device like a blender (put ice in, get crushed ice out). It's a complex dynamic system like the the human body. Just because someone feels sick but doesn't have any ""symptoms"" doesn't mean they aren't sick. What a lot of these economists are basically saying is that it appears the economy doesn't have any of the known quantitative symptoms of being sick, so let's disregard the qualitative aspects that everyone is complaining about. Add in all the market manipulation going on, such as massive quantitative easing, artificially low interest rates, and banks withholding millions of otherwise foreclosed homes from the market, and you can see that these economists are breathing their own exhaust."
