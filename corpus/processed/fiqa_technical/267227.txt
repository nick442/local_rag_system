> So your solution is take the all three away. I never said that. Nice assumption though.. > Take illegals, mexicans and potheads No one said mexicans, I said illegals. Some of them may be mexican and other nationalities as well. > Who exactly do you plan to fill those jobs with? The homeless? Who are all felons and potheads. We have too many applicants and not enough jobs. I'm talking about the US, not sure what country you're talking about. ***We have extremely high unemployement numbers.*** Just because we don't count people as unemployed once they aren't collecting benefits anymore doesn't mean they don't need or want a job. Plenty of people are underemployed as well. Also, automation is going to replace millions of jobs. Its coming very fast and some of it is already here. Ever use an ATM? Automated phone answering systems that direct you to the right department (Press 1 for billing, 2 for tech support, etc)? > Or ok automation. Fine but don't cry when society goes down the tubes because so many people are on the streets with no where to turn. It was your idea though that you support. Sorry bud but I think it's your idea shooting yourself in the foot, literally. LOL, whether I support it or not, its going to happen. There is nothing that can be done to stop it. And trust me, liberals support it more. When you demand $15/hr, you're supporting it because you're being unreasonable for your skill. ***That's actually what is causing automation to accelerate*** Maybe when it hits, you'll support throwing the illegals out.
