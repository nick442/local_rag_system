It's a good city. Better than I remembered from when I was younger. Went back a couple times this year and really enjoyed it. Lots of stuff open pretty late, and they have built up their bicycle lanes and public bike program to get around. Lots of art galleries (I went for a project I had in a gallery) and enough counterculture that no matter what you are into you will find something you like. I probably wouldn't want to live there though. I like my smaller cities I think.
