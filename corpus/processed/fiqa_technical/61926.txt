"Keep saving or investing, but set aside a relatively modest amount for ""fun money"". That way, you can go have a good time without thinking too much about what you're spending within the limits you spend for yourself. You don't need to spend lavishly to have a good time! Not having the stress on your shoulders of worrying about money is a huge thing. Savor it!"
