"> Gotta keep coming back don't ya. Yep! I like good discussion. > You admitted you were wrong.. I was not wrong. Insurers are now dropping out of Obamacare mainly because of Trump not enforcing the mandate. The fact that insurers dropped out before doesn't invalidate my statement. > ..then sent a opinion piece with no actual data - just feels. I included that to show the reasons insurance companies left before are different than their reasons today. It's fine if you disagree with that opinion piece's solution. > Then you tell me you agree but is another topic. Then 2 fucking sentences later ""address the cost of care"". I fucking give up. There are three critical elements to healthcare: cost, quality, and access. Low cost care is of no benefit if it is unavailable or of low quality. The ACA only focused on one of those three elements: access. The goal of the insurance portals and medicaid expansion was to get more people insured which is why the ""more people covered"" metric is the one you always hear. There were a few things in the bill to control quality but other than the mandate to keep premiums down there was nothing to control cost. This is why when talking about the ACA, the chargemaster is another topic. The ACA is about increasing access, not lowering cost. If you want something done about costs and the chargemaster, you need our government to pass a whole different healthcare bill."
