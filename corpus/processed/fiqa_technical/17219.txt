A reason that the wealth has never, and will never, trickle down is because as society goes on, the wealth transfer only happens between upper tiers of society. It USED to be that the rich would spend their money, and many people would benefit from it in a society. Small business owners were pretty much all their were, and the only people who had monopolies were the rail and oil lines. As time went on, more major organizations sprang up, for news, food, computers, etc. Now wealth transfers only between the top tiers and the lower tiers only get the crumbs the higher tier chooses to pay them, which is significantly less than they used to. Whereas employees used to cost a reasonable value to a company, they are now almost entirely expendable assets (exceptions made for certain portions of history). I am of the opinion that much like history, the cycle is going to repeat shortly, the Occupy Wall Street being a precursor to another wage fight between the rich and poor. With the dissemination of knowledge being much easier, more people are getting the general idea that they're getting shafted. They want to be rich, although not necessarily because the rich are wealthy, they simply want to be able to increase their class mobility. That's been dying a slow death for the past 20 years, and quite solidified by the bank bail out. It's unfortunate a sizable portion of the population actually sides with the 1% of people actively preventing them from moving up, gaining more mobility and improving the quality of their life. I sincerely hope that at some point in the near future people realize this before the lower class goes apeshit and starts busting heads.
