Except that doesn't really work. If a corporation makes too much profit, they get undercut. Which is what's happening here. BWW sells an expensive yet lousy product. People aren't buying. There are less expensive options that are better. Taxing people isn't some miracle cure, either. I'm older and could probably pull off retirement right now if I wanted to. But I keep working to make more. If I start getting assfucked with taxes, guess what? It's not worth it for me to work. You can't tax me when I'm not showing an income, or a much, much smaller income. If you're one of those knuckleheads that think communism works, there's a reason why it consistently fails and ends up with horrendous human rights abuses. I fall under the ADA and while I can work because I *want* to work, you better believe that I will stop working if everything is free. I can make a medical argument not to work and you better fucking believe that I would take that opportunity. When demand outstrips supply - like it always does under communism - then it collapses. But not usually before the communist regime starts killing and torturing people. Fuck everything about communism.
