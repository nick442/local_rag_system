Do You Consult Or Just Do The Job?…. For as long as I can remember I have always sought out information, knowledge, facts, figures. One of my ex-bosses once said to me that I could always be relied on to find untapped resources & deliver. This was when I was in my early 20′s & its a skill that I feel is vital for the success of any business. My second job, when I was 19yrs old was in an Advertising / PR company - I was the Secretary. Part of my remit was credit control & book-keeping, for some reason I was always naturally interested in sales units sold & values – then see how the total sales compared to the previous month / year. Little did I know, this was a good skill for Profit & Loss sheets in years to come!
