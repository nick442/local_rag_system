I'm not sure this is a safe assumption, necessarily. If the take is sufficient to permanently satiate whatever monetary need motivated the initial crime, risk in the ratio will remain the same but reward will be significantly altered. Having little wealth and gaining a great deal of wealth is different from having a great deal of wealth and getting even more wealth. As the risk/reward ratio would change, the decision-making process would not be the same.
