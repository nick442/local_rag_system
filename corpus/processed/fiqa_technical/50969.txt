> Most all chemicals are found in nature. I prefer no ammonia in my meat. And I prefer my apples and bananas to have the fewest pesticides and herbicides as possible as well. You are free to eat as many chemicals as you want and I am free to eat food without as many as I want. You ALWAYS challenge people, but do you really have any proof that ammonia washed meat is better for people? Do you have any proof that organic fruits are worse for people?
