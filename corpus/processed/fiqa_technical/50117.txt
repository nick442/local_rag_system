"is there a legal service online where, for a modest fee, you could have someone fire off a ""fuck you, we have no intention of paying"" letter to these companies in case you're ever contacted and shaken down? The movie industry are reducing their legal fees by hiring companies to automate the whole process and process lawsuits in bulk. Can't people targetted by these clowns have their own equivalent? I'd consider $30-$40 as a reasonable fee to fire off a standard letter by registered mail. There's no reason it should cost as much as putting a lawyer on retainer."
