I agree 100%. But you are both right. Millennial tastes have changed, and there is nothing wrong with that. But very few companies have 1200 restaurants. And remember, they are still profitable, just not as profitable as they were. So do you remake a profitable company or tweak things? To my mind the entitlement comes with the comments all over that says: this is what we want, you don't provide it, you suck, you deserve to fail. For myself, I have owned dying companies. I had my kids in private school booking wedding bands. DJs came along and I got out. Went into selling video equipment that was replaced by software. Technology is making this happen faster. It is hard to create a successful business, harder to have to recreate every decade.
