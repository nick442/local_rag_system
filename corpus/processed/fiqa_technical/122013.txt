"I find the sun country airline a unique example, it is owned by Marty Davis, CEO of Cambria (a countertop / stone tile company). They use the airline to promote their countertop business with in- flight magazines and even and Cambria logo on the door of the plane as you walk in. I have been a fan of Sun Country for a long time, but recently a new CEO took over and there was a memo leaked that they are going to start operating like an allegiant or Spirit ""super-discount"" airline. I hope not, I choose sun country for the people that operate their planes and for the simple, no-bullshit, I buy a ticket, I get bags and a checked Bag is $25. So far it's the only airline that I am a fanatic for, and I hope that their culture isn't sold in a race for the bottom dollar. I am pretty sure that Marty Davis bought Sun Country with a deep discount after the Petters Group Worldwide Fraud became known. Full history with some financial information if you're interested. It obviously isn't a ""Big"" Airline, but I am still a big fan. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Country_Airlines"
