As an analyst for an ad agency, I can assure you that you are correct. Studios are currently relying on ananomized imperfect data based on what media agencies say is the audience exposed to thier ads. They have a fuzzy picture of when and where the individual first heard of the new movie and if they converted to a sale. They then estimate the demographics of the ticket purchasers. They operate with a bad attribution model. This new company will allow their digital analytics team to synch up conversions to demographics, and with their mobile phone, and any social media or Internet profile or public traffic associated with that phone. This company will encourage signing in with your Facebook to permit Facebook api data scraping, and using your phone as the ticket device at the theater, giving them access to your geolocation. Just like yelp, it will send push notifications to you to encourage you to check out this new trailer based upon what it knows about you, thus becoming the newest and most targeted marketing channel for studios.
