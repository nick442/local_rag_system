The Oligarchy does not like small business owners. The successful ones challenge their monopolies. They don't dislike the working class as long as they keep refusing to demand living wages. Living wages cut into not only *their* profits, but it depresses the yacht industry. Who wants to pay taxes when you have so much income and wealth when you can leave that to the rest of us?
