Watch for Walmart to buy Blue Apron or the same time of businesssoon. Probably Blue Apron because the yare gonna be prime for buying the next year. I know people are all on the Amazon taking of the world bandwagon but losing sight at what Walmart is doing is dumb because they are far more primed to do so. Just my two cents though. EDIT: Also Amazon stock is insanely over priced and inflated while Walmart is right at the point where you want to jump that bandwagon and ride the wave to being rich.
