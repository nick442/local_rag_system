Um, you're the one that said this: >Talking about politics like this is not mature. If a business has no incentive, and furthermore has a disincentive to do something else they will do it. It is a political statement, but it is very much related to business. You might see it as somebody who is a jerk, greedy, selfish, but the fact is he knows his business better than you do. Which he has built over 40 years. If you think spite comes into it to where he would damage the business he has built over the last 4 years you don't know what you're talking about. He said if he does not have an incentive to continue he won't. Or if the government deincentivizes a number of employees above a certain amount, he will have to make cuts (such as forced higher % contributions to medical insurance above 5,000 employees would incentivize him to cut from 6,500 to 4,999 employees).
