How much finance and software engineering you're looking to do? I had a pleasure to work with a guy who did support (high level) for internal equity trading platform at IB (much less pleasure to work with). He moved to algo trading at another IB some time ago. He told me he started with 0 finance knowledge but by the time he was leaving by my account he was magician in proficiency in both fields. Took only a year or so.
