Is there a place to discuss Investment Strategy? Particularly as it pertains to Global Macro and a variety of asset classes ? Alot of the investing subreddits seem to be based around equity investment only, and focused on US large cap for the most part. I rarely ever see posts about EM equities which have outperformed this year for example, and it would be great to talk about things like Asset Allocation.
