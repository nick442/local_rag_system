> What it doesn't say is how many were opened, also how many were opened in the last 2 years thag they're closing. DineEquity [planned 25-33 stores in 2016](https://www.foodnewsfeed.com/chain-restaurants/applebees-slows-development-plans-sales-decline), I didn't find their 2015 plans, nor organic, non-strategic closings. They [moved their HQ from Kansas City to the parent company's Los Angeles location](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/blog/morning_call/2015/09/applebees-dineequity-headquarters-move.html), and [divested all remaining corporate-owned stores](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2015/07/24/applebees-100-percent-franchisee-owned.html) in 2015. They [franchise 2,016 stores system-wide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applebee%27s) as of 2016. This closing announcement represents an approximate four years of organic closings if 2016 was any indication of normal, franchisee annual openings; it is definitely four years' worth of the the marginal organic openings rate, and about 5% system-wide shrinkage. > I don't see Applebee's or chilli's doing well in the future.

Millennials worldwide see a much stretched-out period of income stagnation while waiting for older generations to retire out of the economy, then there will be a modest bump as they start filling in some of those vacant positions; automation will permanently eliminate many of those vacancies.
