Wage suppression has been the way of the country for generations. The same fucking ten-dollar-an-hour jobs that were there when I was young are still there. But *nobody* is making a single percentage point more than they were thirty-five years ago, are they? No, profits at companies large and small have remained flat. Well they must have, or they would have paid people more, right?/s Don't tell someone who's ~~watched~~ been vicimized by the process that it didn't, and isn't happening.
