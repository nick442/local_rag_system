"I am going to skip over the potential debate on ""zero-sum"" taxes and regulation because you are missing my point. I don't understand ***why that matters***. If Person A and Person B both have lives that are improving, is it that big of deal that Person A's life is improving faster than Person B other than jealousy? Both people are better off today than they were yesterday. That is a good thing. If real wages in the middle and lower classes were falling I would see a huge issue with that, but that is not what is happening."
