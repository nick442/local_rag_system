"Wait..what? Do you live in backwards land? They've let free market reign in healthcare that is why prices are through the roof. The healthcare industry is immune to antitrust, and negotiating with government programs. There is no such thing as ""preventing single payer programs...it only works if there is a SINGLE overriding singlepayer program (yes they wont pass it), anything else doesnt over come the problems of a fractured buying pool. Things they legislate is ""No negotiating policy"" ..and no."
