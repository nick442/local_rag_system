I’ve explained a lot of shit to you, and you don’t want to understand it because it hurts your worldview. I’ve given you a shitload of data to go off. You can even look at pew world surveys and Trump approval globally. http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/u-s-image-suffers-as-publics-around-world-question-trumps-leadership/ How do you think those opinions impact people choice of where they want to go for vacation. I don’t want to go to Russia, North Korea or Venezuela, because of their political situation. It’s a similar case for people who might’ve come here, but won’t because of things like the travel ban. 25% of our tourists come from Mexico alone every year. Do you think they want to come to Trumpland? You have to connect the dots. I told you I’m not going to hold your hand. I’ve done enough. If you don’t understand this shit, then stop voting for people like Trump and remove yourself from our political situation because you’re clearly unqualified to make an educated decision
