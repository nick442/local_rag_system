Skimmed this, but it is pretty true. Try to get into sales. Since you will basically need to be selling anyway, you might as well get paid as such. Sales teams make a lot more than the analysts in 90% of the cases. As long as you don't get fired a middle of the road to below average salesperson will make a lot more than all but the top analysts (who are probably on their way to being promoted to managment to no longer be analysts). Again maybe not all firms are like this, but from what I have seen it seems to be a trend..
