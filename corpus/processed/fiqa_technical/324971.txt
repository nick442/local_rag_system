He's not saying his business couldn't make it. He's saying the cut into his profits and diminishing returns on his efforts and stress would no longer be worth it and he would rather just retire. He makes it clear at the end that he's going to be fine either way. He has plenty of money, but he's not going to put in his time, effort, and energy for less and less money. If he closes up shop because it's not worth it to him, he'll be fine but his workers will be fucked. I hope they like their rules and regulations when it puts them out of a job.
