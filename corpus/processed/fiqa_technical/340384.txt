That's crazy! And I completely sympathize with working moms, it's a rough life. I worry about this when my wife and I have kids how we'll manage, more how she'll manage with her teaching job. If I can ask an admittedly loaded question with some assumptions, do you think if society wasn't so fiercely competitive and dual income wasn't as necessary to live a comfortable life, we'd be better off? What I'm really getting at is are we using technology to attempt to solve problems that shouldn't exist in the first place?
