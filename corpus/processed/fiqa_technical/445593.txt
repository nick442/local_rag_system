Well, what you are asking is EMI, which comes to 30.78 in your case. The formula you are applying is of compounding a value, which is completely different. In EMI, person keeps paying money every month or any other period as specified. This amount is firstly allocated towards the interest for the period and the balance for principal amount. So, in effect principal keeps decreasing and subsequently interest thereon. Also, since, interest is getting paid every time it becomes due, compounding actually do not happen at all. In the case of compounding, interest gets applied at certain interval, but do not get paid. So, in effect every time when interest gets applied, it applies on complete Principal outstanding as well as interest unpaid. Hence, this complete amount gets payable at the end. In this case, total amount payable is obviously high, because of 2 reasons: 1. Since, Principal gets unpaid during whole period, you are paying interest on complete amount for complete period. 2. You will be paying interest on interest (compounding of interest) since you are not paying it as it is becoming due. Hence, both are different. You need to find EMI calculator or EMI formula, to achieve your purpose. EDIT: The formula for calculating EMI: Assuming a loan of Rs. 1 lakh at 9 % per annum, repayable in 15 years, the EMI calculation using the formula will be: EMI = (1,00,000 × 0.0075) × [(1 + 0.0075) 180 ÷ {(1+0.0075) 180 } - 1] = 750 × [3.838 ÷ 2.838] = 750 × 1.35236 = 1,014
