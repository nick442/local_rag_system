"LOL!! A BBC report about ""hate crime"" only listing attacks on migrants, but does not list attacks on Germans. **Bottom line: Germany needed those migrants like it needed a bullet in its head. Meanwhile, Japan, Poland, Hungary, Norway, etc have not issue to deal with and they are doing just fine.**"
