"> It's only deceptive if you literally don't think about it at all. That's literally what the intent is in the aggregate. most people don't think of the task at hand when they are doing menial tasks like buying food. > Obviously a chicken meatball isn't 100% chicken. Then it would just be ground chicken. I disagree that it's all that obvious to most people how a meatball is made. I know because I also know how to cook but a lot of people don't know that. The usage of ""made with 100% chicken"" is absolutely a lie by omission. what else would it be made from if it's made from chicken? If it's not 100% or near 100% chicken there should not be labeled 100%.. you should be able to say ""made with real chicken"" or ""contains real chicken"" or something like that but not put a label with 100% on it because that is just 100% there to mislead."
