When population drops, housing frees up and rent goes down. This leads to people have bigger families, and earlier. Population goes up next generation. The cycle repeats growing a little or shrinking a little each time unless you hit a goldrush or something. Where is the urban hell your talking about? Sounds like a dystopia the government sells the pubic about what would happen if they didn't just *intervene more and vote for meeeee*.
