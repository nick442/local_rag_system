I would be a fan of non-cooperative game theory for life if the end result was a society entertains would enjoy and love. But that is never the case. There is always a stronger, luckier, better positioned player who attempts and hasvthe power structure to gain all the resources of the other players (or at least his biggest opposition). We arenâ€™t on an even playing field, and the factors of influence are more numerous and varied than our simulations describe. And when one player wins, everyone else loses. I love competition, but only if it is limited to strengthening the players. I love cooperation, but only if it is strong, and able to defend itself while recognizing the usefulness and utility of expansion and achievement. The best games are the ones where even if you lose, you win.
