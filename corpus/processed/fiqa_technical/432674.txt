Please just know that not all Orthodox Jews are like these people and its always the worse of any religion that gets the headlines unfortunately. Ive been waiting for the Yeshivas to get busted over technology grants because I find it disgusting they get the money when they tell their own parent body that technology isn't allowed. I can't wait till Tech because a mandatory core curriculum and is tied to either teach it or lose government grants/money
