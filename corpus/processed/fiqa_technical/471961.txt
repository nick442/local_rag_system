Sadly, I barely recognized 3 words in your first sentence. My area of expertise is corporate finance/valuation/consulting not the public markets. Directionally, I would generally agree with GreatOwl1's suggestion if you're looking to do something a little different that can leverage your existing skills. The sort of work I do opens up different opportunities (geographical and otherwise), would probably result in a temporary pay decrease, and wouldn't at all use your current knowledge.
