So does that mean a total of 20,000 people applied (22 applicants per job) or 17.5 million applied? (20,000 applicants per job). Does each application represent a unique person, or a unique person's application for a particular role? (that would mean less than 22 applicants per job). I think it should be clear from this that the language used in the article is intentionally unclear, 22 applicants per job seems perfectly reasonable for a large, perceived stable career path. Certainly in non-fucked industries like IT.
