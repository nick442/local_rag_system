Because insurance companies are required to take all applicants, healthy people (especially the young) would be wise to pay the penalty rather than buy the insurance. This makes the pool of insured individuals sicker and more costly, on average, and their premiums will higher. With higher premiums, more people will choose to pay the penalty, and a downward spiral will unfold. An assumption that no healthy person wants to pay for insurance means the whole system will fall apart? A lot of broad assumptions, although it is an OpEd.
