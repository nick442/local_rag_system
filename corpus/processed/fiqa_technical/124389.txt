Well, I believe this should be left up to the employer, but I think a good employer should offer some level of transparency. Knowing that someone makes more than you, for justifiable reasons, should be an inspiration to get better at your job. Everyone in the world knows how much athletes make, and it seems to make them compete a little harder because they know there could be a big pay day if they perform well enough. The problem in business seems to be objective standards of ranking employees, a lot of it seems based on politics (depending on the industry).
