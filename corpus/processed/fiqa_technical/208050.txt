"I have bought and sold 18 homes. Yes it sounds like a lot some were flips, some turned to rentals and we have moved many many times. I have had home warranties when the seller offered them. In my experience the warranty company does as little as possible. For example, hot water heaters; you call the warranty company because the hot water heater is making ticking noises, and its running the gas all the time and you still can't take a 5 minute shower with out running out of hot water. These are all signs that the water heater is full of slide and its gong to blow and flood where ever it happens to be. Will you get a new hot water heater? No, you will pay the $75 for the service call the warranty company will not replace it because ""it still works"". Now after it has flooded you basement or garage, front hall or where ever then they will replace it but not pay for any damage that has occurred. Same for other things. You can pay that service fee over and over for some slap stick repair that after all the fees and hassle of missing work to wait on the repair person well it would have been cheaper to just pay for a replacement."
