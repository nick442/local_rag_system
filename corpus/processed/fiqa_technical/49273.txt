No, these were exit polls. Entirely different organizations and processes than pre election prediction polls. As an aside, most of the respected pre vote prediction polls were within the MOE at the area level, and at the national level they were mostly correct, considering he lost the popular vote by a significant margin. It's clear you don't know how statistical models work, but to put it in layman's terms, if they give something a 75% chance to happen, that means the other thing can easily happen. Especially when you are balancing the popular vote (which they were mostly correct on) And the electoral college. Food for thought next time you think that snarky answer is an intelligent one.
