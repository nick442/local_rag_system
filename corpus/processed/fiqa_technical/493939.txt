It's a question of the type of globalisation, not the 'globalisation' in itself. Functioning democracies are bottom up affairs. Evolution is an essential and fundamental element of The Enlightenment and functioning democracy is one such manifestation. Top down affairs do not support evolution - they make the problems systemic and endemic and rot from within. The Enlightenment produced our fantastic wealthy modern technological society. One of the fundamental principles of the Enlightenment is evolution - in all respects - whether this be business, political or social. Fundamental to this is :- 1) a bottom up environment that supports the basic principles of evolution (personal, commercial, local and national, cultural etc.. ) :- i) many low cost successes - capitalised on. ii) many low cost failures - lessons learned. Also - problems are sorted at source (they don't become systemic and endemic). iii) diversity (not sameness). iv) constructive competition (localisation) - eg. countries, states, companies, people competing against each other. 2) the promotion of personal and societal capital - strength and quality of morality and character, education, skills and abilities, culture; traditional nuclear and extended families; national - societal - capital - culture. Self responsibility. 3) Conservatism - as per the 3 pillars of conservatism :- i) socially conservative - traditional marriage - provides stability. ii) economically liberal - bottom up democratic capitalism, freedom of thought, freedom of speech - allows evolution. iii) law and order - fairness and justice, honesty, stability and integrity.
