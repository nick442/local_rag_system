Involved with Lead Generation here. I knew about rapportive and email permutation for a while now. The problem is that it's very time consuming. Twitter is very useless if you're going after companies in a niche market or small businesses. I have no idea what mailtester is. I believe this was created in effort to have people find the emails, rather than assuming LinkedIn provides them (which they don't!). I find it funny how they don't mention Sellhack. It's most likely because LinkedIn gave a C&D to Sellhack this year. Now I believe Sellhack just uses dummy emails to extract real emails to build their own database.
