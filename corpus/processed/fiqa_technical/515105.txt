I'm aware but retailers should be getting things at a discount and shipping to each individual consumer also costs money. I believe both also free shipping so.. I'm not saying that footlocker doesn't have more costs I just thought Nike and addidas had higher profit margins cause I never noticed a price difference but I also wasn't really looking.
