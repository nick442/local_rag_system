I thought Microsoft overpaid, it could have gone either way. Microsoft wanted in the mobile market (who wouldn't) in a big way and this was the easiest way to get into it hardware wise. They had already developed an operating system (Windows phone) which I though was great but it never really gained traction. So, I'm not too sure Nadella should be bragging about this. If it had gone the other way I bet he'd be trying to hide.
