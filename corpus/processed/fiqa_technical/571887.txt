This is the worst business model for creating cash flow there is. Where does the actual business begin when all you are doing is teaching people to get more people? I went to a Herbalife smoothie bar once, I realized that they aren't there to make money off smoothies but to get customers to open their own shops. When people realize what it is, they never go back. If you want to start a business, start a business, Amway is not the answer. You aren't your own boss.
