"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/reforming-national-flood-insurance-program-toward-private-flood) reduced by 98%. (I'm a bot) ***** > The National Flood Insurance Program was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, with the intent of reducing the need for post-disaster federal aid by offering flood insurance and providing mitigation incentives to properties that have significant flood risks. > The 2014 Wharton School research outlined earlier demonstrated that private insurance firms have the technical capacity to price insurance more accurately than the NFIP. A proliferation of private insurance offerings could thus lead to savings for those NFIP homeowners who are currently paying overpriced premiums because of overly broad risk aggregation. > Congress took a major step in 2012 toward normalizing private flood insurance by requiring that federally backed lenders accept private insurance, but legal impediments to private flood insurance penetration remain. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6z4pad/reforming_the_national_flood_insurance_program/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~207249 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **Insurance**^#1 **NFIP**^#2 **Flood**^#3 **private**^#4 **risk**^#5"
