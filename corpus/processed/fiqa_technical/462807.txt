"It's also designed terribly for a currency. It has wild fluctuations in price, and as of late has been in a massive run up as this bubble has built. Why would anybody use their ""currency"" that they think will be increasing in value dramatically? It's the opposite of people dumping all their cash when they know they have high inflation and they can buy less in a day or week. Also, as a long-term worldwide currency option, it's moronic. It has a set limit, which isn't high, but it's supposed to be in use worldwide, with billions using it. The people who own a lot early/now will have something that is niche, to essentially like 1% of the major currency, which is an abusrd amount worldwide. It would increase in value, meaning people should hold it, meaning there is less supply while demand increases. This is terrible for a currency."
