Okay, using your example, you sat around and waited for the robber. You knew he was coming, matter of fact the robber told you the exact day he was going to come knocking on your door.. April 15th. And he was going to take thousands from you.. and yet you sat, did absolutely nothing, except bend over and give it to him. What does that make you?
