This. Test waters first. As humans, we are affected by different biases and sometimes we just want to believe. I know a couple of dudes who invested shit ton of money in trying to launch a startup which they didn't vet properly beforehand. They ended up modifying their idea multiple times, but nothing clicked. They say they learnt a lot. But I think they just failed.
