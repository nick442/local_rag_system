/r/personalfinance might be better. Not really sure where this falls.. this sub is more for just specific financial industry news and topics. Here's the DOL page. In all honesty, I'd imagine it'd be considered fair if the law only required him to pay you hourly for the work periods during the day so long as they expensed all your travel expenses. Seems absurd to give you 24 hours of pay if you're going to go stay overnight somewhere that's already paid for by the employer and work a normal day. http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs53.htm
