"Our current economic situation is a mess, and our current tax system is the problem, but the problem is too little wealth taxation, not too much. You are correct in asserting that land value tax is not the solution, since we don't live in a society where farmland is the primary source of ownership-based income. If you want to look at what you can own to earn money these days, look at the holdings of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Exxon-Mobile, Verizon, etc. It's not farmland anymore, it's IP, and it goes entirely untaxed. Taxing property is completely appropriate but the problem is that we live in a world where the taxes, even taxes designed to tax wealth like property taxes, fall almost entirely on the individual, since high value capital can move jurisdictions to dodge taxes and thus taxing wealth like we should creates a competitive disadvantage. When you push back on real estate property taxes you don't make things better for most people. Property values rise (since the value of an asset is proportional to how much money it can earn for it's owner) driving affordability down, rent up, homeownership rates down and generally worsening the quality of life for everyone. Pushed to the extreme, you get a 2 class system, where land ownership is for the entitled, and everyone else are worthless. History is littered with examples, which is why we know the word ""serf"". For a modern day cautionary tale, look at what happened in California since the Reagan property tax changes. They still seem convinced it was a great change, but the California real estate market is pure insanity."
