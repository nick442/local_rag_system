Please be honest when you cite figures. A more complete picture is this: Yes, 30% of new generating capacity (over last 5 years) has been wind However, only 4% of the US power grid is supplied by wind Meanwhile: 34% of US power generated is from natural gas 42% of total generating capacity is natural gas Natural gas is an easy replacement for coal. Natural gas is just as affordable, reliable, and scalable, while releasing fewer pollutants into the air. As coal plants continue to shut down, natural gas plants are expected to be built to replace them. Wind farm production is theorized to remain relatively consistent (rate of construction will be minimally affected by coal plant decommissions). Renewables all have cost, reliability, and scalability shortcomings. They are not an appropriate replacement for consistent sources (natural gas, coal, nuclear) until there is a reliable way to store the energy they produce. For now, renewable sources are far better served as supplements to others sources of electricity. It is natural gas pushing coal out, with renewables playing a small role at the margins. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29732 https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30112 (These are both genuinely good. Not exciting, but good.)
