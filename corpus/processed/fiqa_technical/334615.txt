First of all Dodd Frank is nowhere near Glass Steagall. Infact we need a Glass Steagall law in place to prevent any future meltdowns. Dodd Frank is some common sensical regulatory road bumps. They wont prevent the crash but they may slow it down a bit. Yet Wall Street and by extension the Republicans do not want any of that.
