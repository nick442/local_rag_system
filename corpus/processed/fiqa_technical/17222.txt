Well, the figures are from 2002-2003. 2015 alone there were from different sources 1.5-1.7 million illegals entering Europe. The number of people of immigrant origin is larger in the EU than in the US. I'll give you online sources once I am able to do it. Can't spend time on it now. I'm not really in this to win a debate, rather really curious of the reason behind the phenomena. I strongly suspect an ideological and political choice. Hence this becomes among other things a question of morality.
