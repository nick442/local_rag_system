It's amazing! There's only one Toys store company left in the USA, one Bookstore company left in the USA (Barnes and Noble), one Electronics store (Best Buy) and they all do terribly despite no competition. P/S: One of my newest colleagues at work is a former Toys R Us employee. She tells me that, now, Toys R Us is working on a website to sell toys on-line. If you did not know, up until recently, Toys R Us never had a website to sell, and, instead, they sent you to Amazon to buy over there from the Toys R Us store. Now you get what happened?
