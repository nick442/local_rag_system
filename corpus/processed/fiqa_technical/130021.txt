Interesting idea, except I know for a fact that the applying for and getting SSDI payments is not easy, simple, or quick. It commonly requires years or appeals, and the assistance of a lawyer just to have a chance. It's literally more complex and expensive than working. So, under what diagnoses are these so called able-bodied americans getting through?
