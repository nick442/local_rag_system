I can appreciate your point, but I will defer to WHO, US Department of Health and Human Services, Pew Health Group, and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health as sources. I can get downvoted by people on here all day long for quoting science, but that puts me in the right. Your points are interesting, however I will take the PHDs, and decades of research and data as a better source - I am sure you feel you are smarter than them and that is fine you are entitled to feel that all day long just not by me.
