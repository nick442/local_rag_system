I hear you there. Say the wax seal on your toilet exploded; are you going to wait 3-5 business days to get a replacement? Same with a water heater, an appliance..heck I was in the garden poking around last month and on a whim decided I needed a different setup for my tomato cages; 15 minutes later I'm back from HD and my tomatoes have never felt more supported lol..
