Well without Cisco's products you can not connect to internet at first place. I can tomorrow found a site like FB by jacking its script but in no way I can produce anything Cisco produces. I understand that it is expected growth rate is two times higher than Cisco but so is its p/e and its risk. When I was in high school there was a site called myspace which nobody remembers today.
