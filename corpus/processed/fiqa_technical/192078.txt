You seem to be focusing on the performance of their balance sheets. We've been talking about the quality of their products/services this entire time. AT&T and Verizon have declined in quality due to growth. I believe that is something everyone agrees on universally. As for Pfizer, one set of their products were of such poor quality (for not being fit or medically approved for the purposes for which they were illegal promoted) they [received a record $2.3bn fine](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8234533.stm) (which is still minor relative to their balance sheet but again, we're talking quality of goods/services).
