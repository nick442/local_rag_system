">I'm always amazed when people come to the defense of large corporations. Target would NOT HESITATE to do ANYTHING possible to squeeze every dime, dollar, etc, out of each and every one of their customers. >When the customers do it, though, suddenly it's ""looting"", ""stealing"", etc? Fuck that. You're right. They are both committing morally objectionable acts and both deserve to be shamed for it. I realize thats not what you were really getting at, but that is MY point. You criticize the article for not chastising Target (and imply that they should be), but for chastizing customers when they ""do it"". Im sorry, but just because you think the corporation is more well off then the customers, doesnt make similar actions acceptable for consumers but wrong for the corporation. Its wrong no matter who does it and who they do it to."
