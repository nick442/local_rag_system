"The mortgage tax deduction can at most apply to two mortgages. IRS Publication 936 lays this out pretty clearly. There might be other deductions available if you are using the houses as a commercial entity, but that's more ""corporate taxes"" than ""personal taxes"". I know there are tax laws for dealing with interest, depreciation, capital expenses that businesses use."
