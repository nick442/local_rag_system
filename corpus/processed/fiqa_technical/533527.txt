If you are worried about it, call up the loan company and confirm that they received the payment and that they credited it properly. If they received the payment but did not credit it properly to your loan, the customer service representative on the phone should be able to make the adjustment, as well as remove any late fee that might have been applied as a result of the misapplied payment.
