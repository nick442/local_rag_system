I guess it depends where you are. That would make sense. I'm always stunned by the amount of Latinos eating in Chipotle though (in CA). I know where all the burrito places are (not far) and I'm wondering what's going through their heads paying more for sub-par, rice-filled burritos. Given the shockingly high Hispanic percentage in Chicago, it's interesting to see you don't see the same trend. My guess is the Chipotles you're frequenting aren't in the more Hispanic parts of town? Most of the parts of LA I'm talking are Hispanic/Armenian and so those are the customers. In an area where you can walk for days and not see a white person in a car (unless you're near a Whole Foods), it makes sense that I'm not seeing them at the local Chipotle. Rick Bayless isn't just good for gringos, he's good period. Though I don't know Xoco. I thought his main restaurant had a different name. I love that one of his places is now in O'Hare. Lucky lucky! Chicago has the best food in America!
