Monarchy is a form of government. I make the distinction where the people have little or no say in who makes the rules. In a monarchy, they king makes the rules and people can either move away or stay. In a democracy, the dictators make decisions for them and spend 1/3 of their income, and the people get a 1 in several million say over which of 2 dictators gets to make decisions for them.
