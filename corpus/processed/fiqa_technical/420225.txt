You have no clue what you are talking about! It's all natural progress of Retail. When Sears sent its first catalogs, it killed most rural stores. When Mr. Goldman invented the shopping cart, and Supermarkets were possible, it killed most grocery stores. When department stores started, they killed most specialty stores. When Amazon started, and on-line shopping, it killed all book stores and many other stores. When 3D printers get fast and more versatile, the made-to-order will kill Amazon. Etc, etc, etc..
