> No it isn't. You specifically jumped to the most extreme and most *obvious* example of the application of consent as a concept, I'm going to say because you realize on some level that the less extreme and less obvious cases make it rather clear that what exactly does indicate consent and what exactly does not is just a matter of what society generally says it is. So I'm leaning now toward you just being a charlatan, albeit not a very good one. The rest of your comment has no relevance beyond putting on display how dumb and stubborn you're being, which might be worth going over if that weren't already established. If you change your mind about this it'll be with some reflection long after I'm done talking to you, so there's no real point sticking around waiting for you to develop on the spot.
