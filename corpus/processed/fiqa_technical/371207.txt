I didn't say you had to have had everything handed to you.. I said you could also just be naive. And judging from your subsequent paragraph, you are. Not everyone can choose their lot in life. Though I will say the price of education is absurdly bloated and alternatives to education may be a nice alternative. Though truth be told, for me at least, college was an invaluable experience.
