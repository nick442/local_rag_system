You are correct, however, Romney is touting his record at creating American jobs. If his record is actually shipping jobs overseas then he's lying..shocker, a politician lies! That being said it's very said that we as Americans put up with this. They only lie because we so easily forget, and it's probably not that we forget, but that our two party system limits our options. Rather than creating useful debate both sides have started pandering to the far sides of their party. We've allowed ourselves to become so enamored with what the party is for or against that we really don't even know what we are fighting for (in most cases). It's very sad that we live in a world where people feel it's impossible to see the other persons point of view just because we've convinced ourselves we are right. It is impossible to have the solution to every problem and pretending that we do just shows our own ignorance.
