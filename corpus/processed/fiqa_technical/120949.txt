"The writer just failed elementary math. It doesn't make a shit bit of difference how many jobs were added if the ""official"" unemployment rate went up. Why the fuck would wages go up with less jobs available? This is econ 101. We're obviously still in a recession and yet we have endure this propaganda every month for years. Either the public is extremely stupid or they think we are. Take your pick."
