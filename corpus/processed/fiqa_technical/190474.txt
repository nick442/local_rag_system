The thing with this test, ANYONE can take it. So fresh/soph, grad students, ivy league students, etc. Worth taking if they come to your school but not worth studying for. I took 2 semesters ago, halfway through I was like fuck this and skipped all calculations. 9am + hangover = nothxbro. Finished an hour + before anyone else I was told, still pulled a 62
