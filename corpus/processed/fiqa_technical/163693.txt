"In 2013, an allowance/exemption is like saying, ""Please don't tax $3,900 this year."" So 8 allowances is $31K not taxed. It doesn't wipe out your tax withholding. Circular E will show you the exact amount they'll withhold based on the allowances you claim. Keep in mind, the withholding is run-rated. i.e. it assumes a full year of work. If you had no income for the first 6 months of the year, you will actually still have too much withheld even though the number is right for the full year, starting 2014."
