"> In the future, if nearly every job is taken by a very advanced robot, which are even capable of maintaining themselves, humans would not just be left behind. The economy needs consumers. Instead, we would live in a world of infinite entrepreneurship, in which the means of production are nearly free for anyone, and people prosper by their ambition and drive. Everyone would own their own robots that do work on their behalf. The amount of resources available to all would be incredible, and people would be free to do things they actually want to do. The contrary of course, is a socialist ""utopia""; a world of everyone being dependent on the government to provide them their basic income. Instead, we're looking at a free world in which every person is a capitalist in control of their own robots. > Upfront investment cost to create a contemporary business is challenging today, and this is before a firm anticipation of the cost of labour declining in developed nations. The lack of value for one's own labour will impede investment in new capital machines; using one's employed labour to generate start up capital is key to your projection (short of inheritance) and if this market fails to empower consumers with capital demand will suffer. Secondly, I don't see every individual, or a majority of individuals endowed with the capacities to live in an economy of small businesses. In fact imagining that world sort of economy seems inconceivable to me. Dividends from certain automated industries might become an economic necessity, and this structure wouldn't necessarily disrupt private enterprise; but it may if that private enterprise were to evolve into something which gains overwhelming market power or monopoly."
