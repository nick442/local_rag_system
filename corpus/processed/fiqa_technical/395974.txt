I manned the broil at an Applebees during my college years in a suburb city close to Charlotte NC. We would have 100 people eating at a time. We would cook so much cheap frozen steak it was incredible. The food quality was atrocious. We were clean, it was just the corporate process around the stuff was nothing I would like to eat. Microwaved Chicken Fettucini, boiled all you can eat ribs.. just gross stuff.
