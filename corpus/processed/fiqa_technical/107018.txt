"What a scumbag. This is the same guy who lied about being a Vietnam vet too, and is one of the biggest liars in Congress spreading the ""muh Russia"" conspiracy theory re: 2016 election. I wish I could say that I'm shocked that he would lash out at hardworking business owners like myself, but sadly I'm not."
