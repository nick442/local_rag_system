Add accounting as a second major, you'll look extra good and will be able to get a good paying job straight out out of school. All of my friends who have been accountants (sample size of two) have gotten very high paying internships with BOA ($25-$35 an hour), with guaranteed well paying jobs straight out of school. I went to a decent school, not great or anything. I got into finance because of a family member. Finance and accounting are a great combo too, so it will increase your chances of breaking into finance. They often share a lot of courses, so it is not a difficult switch to make, and if you're going into your junior year it shouldn't add more than a year with a packed schedule; plus the classes are easy.
