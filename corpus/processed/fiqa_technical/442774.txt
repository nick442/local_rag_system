For corporate finance you probably don't need it. You say you want to have a year of job experience after you get your degree but instead I would recommend getting an internship next summer before your senior year, that would be a lot more helpful and if you do a good job it is likely whatever company you intern for will offer you a full time job after graduation. The CFA is more for people who want to work on wallstreet and such. If you still want to take it, my recommendation would be to try and take the first level test in college and try to find scholarships and help for it. I had a friend who had the test and all the study material paid for by the university (of arizona).
