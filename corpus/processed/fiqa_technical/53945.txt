Read about Upfront Mortgage Brokers. That site has a bunch of information on mortgages and brokers, including mistakes to avoid when shopping for a mortgage. You can also find lenders with upfront pricing. I've used it for shopping and you will find very competitive rates. I'm wary of brokers. When we sold our house, the buyers (young first time buyers) got screwed by an unscrupulous broker and didn't actually have a loan lined up. Delayed closing by 2 days while they scrambled to find a legit lender who could put together funding. The one time we used a broker (our first time), we got a deal that wasn't really as good as it should have been. (Hindsight.)
