"Last week I bought a Toyota RAV4 XLE that comes with Driver Assist (will steer you car if you are not in the lane), stop the car is slower speed if you are about to hit another car or pedestrian, Radar to keep distance and avoid slowing cars in cruise control, automatic high beam, etc. I called my insurance and asked if there are any discounts for all these safety features. They said ""No!"", but I do get a discount of passive anti-theft which is now standard on almost every car. It will take the insurance industry 10 years to start giving discounts for this new safety devices.. because, meanwhile, they don't have to give discounts and keep all the money."
