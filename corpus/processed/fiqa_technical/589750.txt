Where's the source for your average net profit? I know you can't get rich driving Uber but 7 cents a mile is definitely off. I drove for lyft and Uber for a few months 1.5 years ago and netted around $10 ( yes I am factoring in gas, service, etc.) Assuming a 45 mph rate for those 14 miles is approximately 20 minutes (for easy math). So in one hour (under your 7 cents a mile) you are saying the average Uber drive makes $3.00 an hour profit? Are you factoring in that drivers, US at least, can deduct 57.5 cents per business mile?
