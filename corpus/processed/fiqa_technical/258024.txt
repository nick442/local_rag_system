We already have remote-controlled drone planes. It's entirely conceivable that in the near future, airlines might have a tiny staff of pilots in a room on the ground, there to take over remotely if there's something odd happening, but otherwise letting the planes fly themselves. EDIT: Commercial planes are all fly-by-wire anyway, so if there's an instrument failure you're screwed anyway, whether there's a pilot physically there or not.
