Because lobbying. Otherwise such tax optimization schemes would be counteracted with laws after their discovery by our law-making entities.. who can be ~~paid~~ lobbied. Personally I believe if your company uses a country's infrastructure to sell goods for a profit, then you should pay a fair share of that profit to support that infrastructure you use. If you don't want to pay, just don't do business there. But lobbying can alter that logic.
