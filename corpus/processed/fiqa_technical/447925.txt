Geely owns the Volvo car corporation, which used to belong to the Volvo company. The Volvo car corporation was a relatively small part of the greater Volvo group, which Geely has absolutely no control over whatsoever. I know it's easy to look at Volvo and imagine a car, but it was really the least profitable part of the company for a long time. Volvo is involved in trucks, aircraft, boats, construction, owns a chunk of Renault and outright owns Mack trucks. It's a big company with some 90 000+ employees.
