"First of all, the recovery isn't ""right around the corner."" It's been in process since March of 2009. It might not be ""the recovery you want,"" or even an ""ideal"" recovery, but it's a recovery nonetheless. I could produce any number of official indicators that bear this out. Your views extremely hyperbolic. Do you know what a HELOC is? Do you know what it means to have a $500k HELOC? It means that you have $500k of *equity* in your house. Not what your house is worth, mind you - but the value of your stake in the house, minus the value of the bank's stake in the house. $500k? Into a house, over 20 years of stagnating wages? Doesn't make much sense. Why? It's total hyperbole. Just like your post: Total hyperbole."
