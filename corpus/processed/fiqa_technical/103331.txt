Must be the case. I went to a local chain electronics store here in the UK awhile back called currys. I saw a tv I liked. Looked up the model number on amazon to find it almost £300 cheaper. A crazy difference. But.. I thought I really wanted this thing asap. So if be willing to pay more (dumb). I asked if I could get it delivered to my house a 5 min walk away. He said sure. It would be £50 delivery and would take 7 days. I laughed and said I can have this tv for 300 less and delivered via prime tomorrow morning. He didn't even offer a price reduction. So bought it right there on the phone whilst I explained how ridiculous it is they would rather not make a sale at all then compete with amazon. I hope they go down in flames.
