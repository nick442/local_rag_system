"116 MILLION people are in poverty in the EU, despite their massive welfare states. All the welfare states are bankrupt. They can't continue supporting their systems. They don't even have the excuse of a military industrial complex. Norway, which is not in the EU, is barely scraping by because of its ""oil fund,"" that is currently falling in value. Half the people in Norway are on welfare, and their tax revenues alone cannot sustain it. http://www.cnbc.com/id/49564413 If this shit gets passed in the US, we're fucked for sure. Government ruins most things. Why is it so damn hard to just let the private sector run a competitive health care market? Obamacare has now been shown to cost us more for less coverage with health providers. Medicare and medicaid have escalated health care costs beyond control, and are bankrupting us. SS is a ponzi scheme ($30k in for $100k out). You only have to look to government interventionism in student loans to see how well they manage money (indebted for life, and even after!). Not to mention running GSEs that fuck up the mortgage market. Hell, we can't even trust our government with keeping our liberties safe (NDAA, Patriot Act, secret kill list, INCREASED surveillance, and terrible fiscal and economic policy all under Obama (don't think Bush, Clinton, and many before didn't contribute either)). After knowing all this, why would you trust government to run health care? You honestly think its sustainable in the long run? I've just shown you that it's collapsing as we speak. www.GaryJohnson2012.com - We can at least try to save the US"
