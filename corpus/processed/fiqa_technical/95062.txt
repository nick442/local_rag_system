"I'm looking forward to not having to read about Market Basket every single day. Claiming 2M customers ""joined a 6-week boycott"" is absolutely ridiculous and deceptive. Pretty much every shelf was empty. No perishable items were available. Customers didn't *boycott* Market Basket. Customers didn't go there because there was nothing to buy."
