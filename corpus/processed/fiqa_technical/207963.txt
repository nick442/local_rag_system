> I don't think anyone is blaming animal agriculture on its own for global warming issues. At the same time its undeniable at this point to say animal agriculture is not a leading environmental problem, even if it is 'just 14.5% of emissions', the deforestation, the ridiculous amounts of fresh water needed, and the untreated sewage wastage. . You have the same problem with soybeans ([Geraldes Castanheira, 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652613003442)), it's a problem with production that affects all agriculture. And when you look at plant sources of protein they have very similar water use as meat: Source|L/kg :--|--: Lentils|1,549 US Pork|1,406 US Beef|1,258 Beans|1,108 NL Beef|829 NL Pork|706 Dried peas|526 US Chicken|490 Oatmeal|439 Hemp seed|429 Artichokes|340 NL Chicken|242 Soybean flour|127 From ([Mekonen, 2012](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Mekonnen-Hoekstra-2012-WaterFootprintFarmAnimalProducts.pdf)) and ([Mekonen, 2010](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report47-WaterFootprintCrops-Vol1.pdf)) looking at blue (surface/ground water) and grey (water needed to clear pollutants) water use. > Also, so your argument is that hey we're producing enough food for everyone even though its an extremely inefficient way of producing calories - so whats to worry about? As much as we'd like to think we have unlimited resources, we don't. Our gluttony is destroying the planet. In addition to the environmental costs, it simply doesn't make sense to allocate the majority of our crops to feed and grow the billions of land animals when we could allocate those crops to foods that can feed people directly. The point is that we can double the earth population without running out of food, and then we can add another 40% in the US by simply not throwing away the food, then we can optimize land use, and not all land is suitable for growing crops so we get more food by using it for meat. Food production is simply not an issue. > You may not like to admit it, vegan and plant-based when it comes to food are the equivalents of 'clean energy', and animal based foods is akin oil and coal. Which is probably why vegan fast food is attracting the biggest investors. It's the future. An optimized scenario includes meat as not all land is suitable to farming, and you have seafood and wildlife. At this point being vegan is more like being religious.
