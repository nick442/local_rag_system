This or you can know someone. Without a 4.0 from a business school you're going to have a tough time getting an interview. Also, get your MBA from a top 25 school. The analysts at these companies make $50,000-$65,000 and work 80-100 hours a week. Not worth it. MBA grads will start around $100,000 with the same hours.
