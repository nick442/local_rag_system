Make sure you are paid on volume, not people. Almost all companies have a requirement to recruit a certain number of others. That's not bad - it ensures the company continues to grow without having to pay advertising and training costs. That's what the commissions are for. The largest cost of distributing a product (outside of MLM) is advertising and marketing. If I remember correctly, this adds up to about 66% of the cost of the product. If that's true, an MLM has quite a bit of money available to pay commissions and still have their products remain relatively competitive. But, when all is said and done, you should be paid on volume, just like a sales manager position in a company. A sales manager has to hire and train a sales staff, but once they are out producing, the manager is paid a percentage based on the volume of their sales staff. If an MLM is setup the same way, then this is good. If they are setup to pay on recruiting people, then run away as quickly as you can. The biggest problem with recruiting is not whether or not you can do it. It's whether or not the people you recruit can do it. I have been involved with an MLM of sorts for 10 years. It pays a nice continual flow of income. I worked it hard for about 6 years and have coasted ever since. The problem was attrition. It was greater than I ever imagined. It became very disheartening. I never have and never will be a high pressure person. I would show them the business and if they were interested, great, if not, great. The problem was that people became interested, but didn't have the skills to be successful. I should never have let them join the business. So, they leave the business and say that MLM is bad. No, it just wasn't right for them or they weren't right for it. Regardless of what business you join, make sure that you believe that EVERYONE you introduce to the business has the ability to do the same thing you are doing. If they do, great, otherwise don't even show it to them.
