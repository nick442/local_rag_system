No I have it quite clear.. I am an employer of a small business.. What people that support unions don't understand is the secondary collateral damage that Union support can cause on us.. He States it pretty regularly in the article.. The unions apparently did it in the past as a trap of sorts.. Think about it, if universal healthcare system were to be implemented, that would be a huge benefit package that everyone would get, not just union members.. If my employees were offered the same Healthcare as a union member, union membership would lose that appeal an advantage over small business..
