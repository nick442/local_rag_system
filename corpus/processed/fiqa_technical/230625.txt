">Taxes make money disappear from the economy. But those taxes are used to pay for labor, in most cases. The state workers that fix the roads are paid with tax money. As are all the supplies and equipment, for example. I think I understand the debt bit - If I buy a house and default on it, that money is ""gone"", but the house remains to be sold by the bank later. Only the interest is really missing, right?"
