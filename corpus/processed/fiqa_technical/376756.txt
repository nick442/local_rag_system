The most likely explanation is, as you say, that the letter was automatically generated a day or two before you met with your advisor. Assuming that your advisor is competent, they will probably execute the instructions you gave them at the meeting. The letter said you had ten days to change the investment, and your advisor should be able to do it in that time. To be on the safe side, since people have been known to forget things, I would call your advisor and tell them you got the letter, and check they are going to do what you decided. I would then follow it with a polite email, just saying that you both decided at your meeting on such-and-such a date to go with the three month plan. If that doesn't happen you can point to the email as evidence. Don't panic about this. Even though the bank says you are 'locked in' to the decision, if an advisor makes a mistakes these decisions are in fact reversible, with the advisor paying any penalty.
