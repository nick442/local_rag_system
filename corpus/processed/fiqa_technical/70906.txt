That's true. If you liked Vietnam, the Gulf war, and the financial crises then you'll like finance because they're all brought to you by Harvard and Yale. They're a bunch of egotistical know-nothings who have an inflated sense of accomplishment because of the name of their school. I agree, I would take a state schooler than any of those morons from Harvard, Yale, Naval Academy, etc. They had their chance and they royally screwed us up.
