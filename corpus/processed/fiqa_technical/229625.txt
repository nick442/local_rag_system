You could do all your shopping there, but most people don't. Between the price and the lack of things like Frosted Flakes, it's often an additional stop, not the only one. Their selection of non-fresh groceries is relatively small. If we are saying WF is the only stop and is a full fledged grocery store, I agree with the poster - Wegmans is better.
