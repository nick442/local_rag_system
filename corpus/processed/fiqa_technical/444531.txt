It's a debt derivative. Credit default swaps are contracts drawn up on a specific issue of a bond (in the case of single-name), or on a basket/index of a class of bonds (in the case of credit default index swaps/CDX). When it comes to derivatives you would have to look at the underlying instrument. For example, options on AAPL common stock are equity derivatives. Forwards on corn or wheat are commodity derivatives. Interest rate swaps where the floating leg is pegged to LIBOR are debt/rates derivatives.
