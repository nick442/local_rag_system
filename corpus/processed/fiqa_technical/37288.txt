We actually have [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/GroceryStores/comments/10sldg/im_so_tired_of_this_grocery_shrinkray_bullshit/) about that going on right now in r/grocerystores. It is a fine line to walk. No one wants to visibly raise prices. But they are still showing price per pound/ounce on the tag (right? Every store I have been in shows that). The consumer is partly to blame for allowing those shenanigans.
