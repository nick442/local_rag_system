Women going into the workforce didnt just increase the supply of labor, it increased the demand for products. now every house has to have two cars, in the 70s many got by on one car. More cars are produced now than in the 70s per capita. This is just one example. Saying that women entering the workforce changed everything is only looking at how the supply of labor increased, and nothing else.
