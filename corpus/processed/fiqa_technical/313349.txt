"I loved handling those complaints. Mostly for the times that the customer didn't have a leg to stand on. People would sound so smug when I called them about their regulatory complaint until I got to tell them they were shit out of luck. ""I researched your complaint and account..you have refused to pay for 8 months of services rendered over a $2 bill discrepancy, which actually was a valid charge..also I see that this is your fifth complaint when we have only received payments, hmm it seems three times over a year and a half. We are actually going to shut your service off and cancel your account so it can go to collections."""
