The heart of the problem is that nothing visible/substantial is happening before the next election cycle, so nobody will address the issue. Deeply ingrained myopia for difficult problems prevents most long time-horizon issues from getting a lot of political attention. It's much easier to ignore the issue and pretend that it will go away or be resolved by others. Secondly, politicians are less likely to speak about any subject that hasn't been funded and pumped-up by lobbyists. The only people speaking about this problem have no lobbyists/money, therefore, they have no political representation.
