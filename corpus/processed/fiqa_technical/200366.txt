Just a few months ago someone asked in this sub how he tanked so many funds. Shkreli came out and vehemently defended himself and refuted any suggestion his funds had tanked. The evidence in the trial said they actually had tanked. Badly, but he illegally paid investors back from the pharma company. He will be missed.
