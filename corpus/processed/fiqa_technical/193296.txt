Microsoft doesn't do salary negotiations.. The way the salary structure works at Microsoft is similar to how it works in many other huge companies. You have a rank/level/title (eg. developer, Senior developer, Principal developer, and upwards) and your salary is based solely on that. For example, every new college hire starts at a certain rank (whether foreign or not) and every new college hire starts at the same level of pay. When you get a promotion you get a new title and a corresponding pay increase. You can't negotiate for bonuses or salary increases, it's set in stone for everyone. This is for engineering positions, obviously sales/marketing/etc. all have different structures.
