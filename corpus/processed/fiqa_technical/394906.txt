There is nothing right or wrong about this. On such a short goals, you are essentially saying you need $2700 in next 4 months to buy 3 items. Essentially you can have sub-goals to save $675 each month. As you already have some funds; you can go by priority buy the bed and then once you have more saved, buy the laptop and then buy the bed. If you buy the bed now, it means that you will have to wait more for the laptop. If the goals are further apart; say something in few months and something in few years, you would have to create to separate buckets to save and contribute proportionately to both the buckets.
