The difference is pretty important here- it's the difference between wage slavery and actual, literal chattel slavery. *Show me* an instance where that difference is minimized without the person doing so ignoring the horrors of people being owned and having their children treated as someone else's property being minimized. Exploiting people is the common root of modern suffering- owning them as we own animals is unthinkable. The world would be a MUCH better place if exploitation were similarly reviled, but we can see from our own instincts that we're at least not as horrified of wage slavery as we are of real, literal slavery.
