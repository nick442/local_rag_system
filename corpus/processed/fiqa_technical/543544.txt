"While acknowledging that the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) had much success in providing coverage to low-income Americans—particularly through the law's expansion of Medicaid—Commonwealth Fund President David Blumenthal, M.D., said the U.S. healthcare system is still not working as well as it could for Americans, and it works especially poorly for those with middle or lower incomes."" ""Underscoring this point, the Commonwealth Fund's analysis noted that ""in the U.S., 44 percent of lower income and 26 percent of higher income people reported financial barriers to care."" In the U.K., these percentages are seven and four."" Want to bet that a good chunk of those 44% were in states that didn't expand Medicaid?"
