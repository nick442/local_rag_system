I'm sorry, I know that it's not your fault but you really need to think about what you're saying and stop listening to the financial advisors on tv.. If you think that all you need to do is give people money to spend then you need to read up on Zimbabwe. They tried that - at it's hight they *think* that Zim's inflation hit 6.5 x 10^108 % ([that's 6.5 quindecillion novemdecillion percent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe)). I can't even begin to imagine how large that is - basically bread cost billions of zim dollars a loaf. I remember hearing the one day that they were dropping 3 zeros from their notes. I'm ashamed to say that I laughed. No one is buying right now because, instead of buying stuff, everyone is paying back loans - or they're too scared to buy in case they need the cash to survive in the future. Look at the liquidity crisis; the housing bubble; all the bank failing/needing to be bailed out lately - all because people couldn't pay back the loans they took out. The US government is already $15 trillion in debt (nearly 16 trillion now) - and that's only the public debt. The gov is already paying $454 billion every year *just to repay the **interest** on the debt!* Never mind actually paying back the principle amount. Last year it added another $1.2 trillion to the deficit (that's another 1,200,000,000 dollars that it owes on top of the 15,000,000,000 dollars it already owes). At the beginning of this year, public debt amounted to 102% of GDP - that means that if everyone in America didn't buy what ever it was that they bought last year and instead repaid the public debt (not private mind you, just the debts that the government owed) then they *still* wouldn't have been able to pay it all off. Now after reading all of that, please keep a straight face and tell me that all that the government needs to spend even more money to sort it all out.
