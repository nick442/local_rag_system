"If you don't have a margin account, then you will not have margin calls. You need a margin account if you wish to ""buy on margin"", to sell stocks ""short"", or to sell options, or maybe some other esoteric things I have not thought of. If you don't do those things, then you do not need a margin account and will not get margin calls. In your example, it doesn't sound like margin has been used, If you deposit $20 and used it to buy $20 of stock and it then falls to $5, ""they"" did not lose the money, you did. But if no margin was used, then no margin call would result."
