"Your source does not support the claim above that ""foreign buyers are screwing everyone, particularly upper middle class people from China"". Foreign direct investments are beneficial to the economy and knee-jerk protectionism does more harm than good. Sure, in the short term, an increase in real estate investment will increase property prices due to the rise in demand. However, housing developers and tenants will respond by increasing the supply of affordable housing elsewhere eventually reaching price equilibrium. There will always be displacement in a dynamic and robust economy but I guess it's easier to make out foreign investors as the boogeyman."
