Hmm.. I don't understand how big of an impact that would have in the long run. In the short-run, I can see it being an issue due to price-inflation. But long-term, wouldn't the market adjust accordingly? If the prices are raised beyond the individual households' disposable income, people will simply find alternative products. I guess it would be a terrible thing if they controlled something that is necessary to us. But if that happens, I imagine a revolution will start. What incentives do the large companies have in doing this?
