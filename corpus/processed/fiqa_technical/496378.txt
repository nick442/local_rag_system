Ad Hominem isn't meant to apply to every comment about the speaker, it's meant to apply to situations where someone argues 'he must be wrong because of who's speaking'. In this case, crazymunch is just raising the point that we should be aware that bezos has conflicting/contradictory statements, according to who he's talking to. You can't be both down on patents *and* vigorously defending your own dubious patent.
