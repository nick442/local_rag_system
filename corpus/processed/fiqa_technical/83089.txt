Sorry for misunderstanding, but your point still isn't realistic. The government can't afford massive amounts of cash, unadulterated or otherwise. The idea that we can print money out and just pass it out like candy has caused so many problems right now it is unfathomable. A better solution is to just fix the economy so kids can get good paying jobs and pay their loans back. We can't afford these kinds of freebies, we've just been living like we can.
