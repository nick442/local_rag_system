quid's link should give you a definitive answer, but just to set expectations, here's an article from the UPI: Essex Chemical Corp. has agreed to be acquired by Dow Chemical Co. in a $366 million, $36-a-share deal ..

There's no mention of exchange for Dow stock, so it's likely that you would get $36 for this share of stock, if anything.
