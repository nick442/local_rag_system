I completely agree with requirements, like GPA. I think that weeds some bad loans out, and is a much better version of tough love than non-dischargable debt once you are out of school. The non-discharged debt problem is tough, and I think this aspect ties into the college cost inflation: If you, as a lender, basically have a perpetual lien on someone because they can't discharge the debt, then you (lender) can issue riskier loans, and more of them. I haven't heard the term 'subprime loans' used to describe student debt, but I think the term is just as applicable to bad student creditors as it was to bad home creditors in the housing bubble. There seems to be moral hazard involved for lenders that have non-discharge covenants, and so they lend, even after government lenders tell people 'no more.'
