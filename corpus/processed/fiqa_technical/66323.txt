yup. A related software services company anticipated this and have been migrating people to their own chat service for the last few years already by promising better features. They have already won the battle. I didn't want to use their service but now I am going to have to. If I could I would put together an investor group to buy the AIM network and try to monetize it. But I am sure trillian has already tried. But if anyone else is down I'm down. It can be monetized in my opinion.
