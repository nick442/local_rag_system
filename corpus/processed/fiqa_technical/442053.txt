I've been at it for 17 years and, in that time, seen thousands of companies skyrocket ahead of me. Are those founders smarter? No. But nor are they necessarily dishonest. In that same time I've seen tens of thousands of companies fail. One thing I know is that being transparent and honest with my clients and employees has led to more personal satisfaction in my life: I'm a very happy person. My friends, employees, and peers respect me. I can look in the mirror and feel good about the path I've chosen. Yeah, maybe I don't get a private jet or that sweet piece of real estate I wanted. But at the end of the day, my happiness is worth more than any trinket. Sounds like you understand that too.
