"One thing not mentioned is that in so called third world countries, a lot of ""stuff"" isn't actually less expensive. Food is almost always less expensive, housing is often less expensive, but cars, fuel, computers, smartphones, electronics, brand name clothing, shoes, cosmetics, tools, art supplies, internet service, bicycles, sporting goods and many other consumer items are typically more expensive."
