[The Peter principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle). They were good at some task, so they get promoted to a job with completely different responsibilities. If they are good at that, they get promoted again -- and again until they end up in a position where they suck at. And since companies really don't like to fire management people, that's where they'll be until they quit or retire.
