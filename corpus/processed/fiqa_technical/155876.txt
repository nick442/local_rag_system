Depends on your company, I guess, because FP&A in our company doesn't do a significant amount of accounting. Take all of this with a grain of salt because I haven't been in the FP&A group, but if I were to rank how much accounting work is done by each finance group from most to least it would be [insert outsourced AP/AR/etc. here], controllers, tax, finance in the business (like embedded in another group), treasury, FP&A, then trading. Your company may be different, but in my company the FP&A team isn't really booking entries, even if they're looking into a lot of GL accounts to aid in their work. Are you trying to avoid SAP altogether, or do you want to stop doing research in it, or do you just want to stop booking debits and credits? Because almost every lower level role in finance as a whole is at least going to have the research and data gathering part in system, and that's primarily the extent of what FP&A does as far as their work in SAP. Treasury has more responsibility in SAP/other systems because we actually have to go correct entries or make some payments on occasion.
