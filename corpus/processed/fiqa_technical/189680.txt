"This is an example from another field, real estate. Suppose you buy a $100,000 house with a 20 percent down payment, or $20,000, and borrow the other $80,000. In this example, your ""equity"" or ""market cap"" is $20,000. But the total value, or ""enterprise value"" of the house, is actually $100,000, counting the $80,000 mortgage. ""Enterprise value"" is what a buyer would have to pay to own the company or the house ""free and clear,"" counting the debt."
