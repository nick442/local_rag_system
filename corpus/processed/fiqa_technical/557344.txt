">Then, they would put them on whatever Java project as Java consultants/programmers. It was blatantly egregious. Avanade did exactly that. They will hire freshly out of college people and put them on MSDN cert. track and as soon as they pass one test. (No training, it's all self study and most of them just memorized the test) They will pimp them out to the highest bidders. However, it seem to be the normal practice among consulting firms. Since they usually have someone higher up with experiences to oversee them. This isn't really my beef with them. How else can a jr. dev get more experiences. It's the culture that you were talking about that really suck. They also lied to their clients and make up some numbers. It's about ""Chargeability""!"
