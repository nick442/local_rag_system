">What changes when you have kids is your lifestyle and how you spend your money. Bar tab = diapers, weekend getaways = 1 big disney vaction, convertible = minivan, etc. Ah, but singles don't NEED the ""Disney"" vacation (indeed many AVOID such things on purpose) -- they can go backpacking in the mountains, or vacation on the beach in Greece for significantly less (if they are even so inclined). Likewise, the convertible, unlike the minivan, is an ""optional luxury"" -- and ironically enough, one that holds its value on resale far better than the minivan. >There is an opportunity cost, but according to these folks they seem to be assuming you are spending money you are normally saving on kids, when in truth you would have more than likely spent it on yourself. Exactly. Or you would never be sufficiently motivated to earn it in the first place. I have seen several ""studies"" about how married w/children people tend to earn MORE over their lifetime than unmarried/childless people do. Now certainly ONE reason for that can be (and from anecdotal management experience I *know* it exists) a form of discrimination (where married w/children managers overpay/out-promote ""similar"" people out of sympathy, and where they underpay singles/childless on the basis of ""well, they don't NEED as much""). But I also think there is a factor of ""content"" versus drive/motivation/need -- married w/children do in fact NEED/WANT to earn more (because they have higher inherent costs), and are therefore generally more ""motivated"" about gaining additional pay (in order to live a lifestyle that is at a similar level to single/childless people)."
