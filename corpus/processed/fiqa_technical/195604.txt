I have no pity for them either, especially since the average Joe almost never gets to buy shares in an IPO, and FB shares were priced at 100 times earnings. However, if some folks had inside info that FBs earnings were down prior to the IPO, then they this needs close examination, and, if it really took place, prosecution. It is a dangerous precedent to allow this sort of thing to take place. Oh, and Zuckerberg didn't set the price. Morgan Stanley did.
