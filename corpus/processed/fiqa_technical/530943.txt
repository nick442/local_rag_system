"Resign may be a bit far, but as for backing up Damore, I disagree. You can criticise what Damore wrote, how he cherry-picked research and maybe his suggestions weren't the best. But this quote (quoted in the article) is the best way to summarise the backlash: > “I cannot remember the last time so many outlets and observers mischaracterized so many aspects of a text everyone possessed.” The backlash has truly been post-factual. And it's fair to criticise the leadership of a company whose culture has clearly become post-factual. And not just post-factual in describing what Damore wrote (very often where he went out of his way to repeatedly write the *opposite*), but also in flat out rejecting *any* research into ""Nature"" in ""Nature vs Nurture"" that doesn't say ""Nature matters 0%"". Many angry voices admit to not having read what they are ranting about. ""He said X! -- Uh, no he didn't -- I didn't read it, but it's horrible and he should be fired!"" We rightly criticise and fear the Faux News/Trump post-factual BS politics, but the left *adopting* it is only going to make things worse. And avoiding that in corporate culture falls squarely into the lap of corporate leadership. So why exactly is Pichai playing along (albeit much much less) with this post-factual interpretation?"
