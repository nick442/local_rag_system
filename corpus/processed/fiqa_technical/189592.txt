"You quite literally just answered why I never understood my own god damn currency says ""I promise to pay the bearer.."" What I don't get however, is that how wealth comes out of thin air.. why each continent cannot be eternally rich.. We're all (at the very basic level) taking things from the ground and providing a service to someone. But if the whole world were to become bankers (only providing a service to which some people would emply never actually existed), we obviously can't all make money from it. So how does money ""come out of thin air"" so speak?"
