"Note that many credit unions participate in a ""branch exchange"" program, which lets you access you CU's accounts and services thru the offices of the others. My CU is two states away, but there has been only one case where I felt a need to drive back there. Find out if your has joined this network, and encourage them to do so if they haven't yet. It makes credit unions fully competitive with interstate banks. The shared-branch CU locations may not be maximally convenient, but more keep joining, and the most common transactions can be done by mail or ATM anyway. The biggest advantages of a local CU or bank are that they know the local rules for mortgages, and they may have safe deposit boxes for rent. That, and having a place to unload the pocket change that piles up, are why I've got an account with a small local bank a few blocks from my house as well. Though I keep thinking about joining my alma mater's credit union, and will if the ever get on the shared-branch system."
