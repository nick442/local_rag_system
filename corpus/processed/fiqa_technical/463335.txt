No one here has mentioned electronic shavers. I purchased one for about $120 two years ago. It's still going strong and I've only had it professionally cleaned one time. I also find this method to be more time efficient as compared to shaving with a blade- I live in Toronto and commute to work and it is not unusual to see men shaving while sitting in their cars in high density highway traffic. If I'm keeping this answer generic, there is also the added benefit of lower water consumption with this method. However, this is potentially negated by the cost of electricity used to charge the shaver.
