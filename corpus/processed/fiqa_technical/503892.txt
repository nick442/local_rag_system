Climate scientists urgently need to explain why global warming has declined in recent years. I have a scientific background but this is not necessary to understand the relevance of this point. The nature of climate science means that the reverse should be true. Man has not reduced the overall amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Therefore the climate should have continued to warm. This is simple logic. What is worse for climate scientists is that the historical data suggests that climate is cyclical with much warmer periods apparent in pre-industrial times. The inconvenience of this has led to climate scientists concentrating on the period from 1980 onwards. The basis for this is that much more detailed information is available. Unfortunately the data for this period is showing the climate cooling rather than rising. Man is doing tremendous damage to the planetary environment in terms of pollution and fossil fuels are limited. These are worrying facts.but have nothing to do with climate science. To believe in climate change is akin to believing in the tooth fairy. To be a non-believer is akin to being the little boy in the story of the emperor with no clothes. Climate scientists are starting to run scared. They have a theory but no evidence or even worse they have evidence that shows them to be wrong. They have built up a whole industry based on a fallacy. Now they are willing to tell any lie necessary to perpetuate it. This is not science.
