Thats the thing i think most people in this thread are missing: the way we shop is evolving. We are far more comfortable ordering online now than a decade ago, and it's only going to continue. And thus actually makes sense, because our time is super valuable. For most consumers, a Best Buy is at least 15 mins away by car. So getting there and back alone is about 3% of your day. Thats a step price already, and it doesn't include the time wandering the store to find the damn thing, then standing in line, parking, etc. So unless i need the product now now now, online is fine. So, to answer your question, you didn't really do anything wrong. We're just changing.
