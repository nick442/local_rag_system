I'm currently reading the book *Divine Fury: A History of Genius* by Darrin M. McMahon which ponders the relationship between madness, creativity, and genius. I think some minds are a little more flexible in the possibilities that may be contemplated and this allows the potential for more discoveries. But when your mind is a little too flexible it can be seen as eccentric.
