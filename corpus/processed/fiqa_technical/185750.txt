Free healthcare is not a human right and the affordable care act is not healthcare, it's mandated health insurance - a guarantee of payment to private insurance companies. It is a tax on the poor. They can't afford the rising healthcare costs from the bubble ACA created, so now they have to pay a fine. That's a tax. In America, if you go into a hospital without insurance, you will be treated. But now, if you don't have insurance, you're also a criminal. It's the slow, constant creep of socialism. You can free yourself by becoming a member of a health share that is cash-based and exempt from the ACA tax penalty. I use Samaritan Ministries (top rated) and it's been a great experience.
