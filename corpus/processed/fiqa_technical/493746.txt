Here's my attempt, without talking about apples or anything: Essentially, the 'money supply' is determined by the central bank, since they are the issuers of money. You can read on your US dollars that they are issued by the federal reserve. An excellent measure of the money supply is NGDP, since this is the number of dollars traded every year (that sort of quantifies how many dollars are available to be captured by working, trade, etc.). Unfortunately, in 2008, the US Fed decided to adopt an ultra-tight monetary policy, resulting in a severe drop-off in NGDP relative to previous trend (the worst since the Great Depression, graphs here: http://marketmonetarist.com/2012/06/19/guest-post-measuring-the-stance-of-monetary-policy-through-ngdp-and-prices-by-integral/) It does not look like it will ever recover to the previous trend, so the money supply is much smaller than people would have expected before 2008. In theory, the nominal value of money shouldn't matter in the long run. However, since people before 2008 signed contracts (read, 30-year mortgages) anticipating a much higher aggregate money supply, this has triggered a shortfall in demand ever since, which has left our economy in the tank.
