"On the other side of the argument if you use your own capital you build a product that you own, not some random VC who doesn't care about anything but dollar signs.

The payoffs for owning what you create are priceless. I think that for some people it's just easy to fall into the ""wage slave"" way of life, but that doesn't mean that ideals in the post are wrong."
