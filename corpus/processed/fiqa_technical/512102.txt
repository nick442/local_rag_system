I find it odd that Google would buy them. They already bought Motorola and had plans to use them to make Google-branded phones, but when that wasn't profitable or practical, they sold off Motorola's hardware division and left the phone hardware industry to others. ..but now they want to re-enter it the phone hardware business and try the exact same tactic a second time? Seems odd.
