Agree completely. I too have worked non-union jobs my whole life, and I've worked with *plenty* of shitty people, I can count on one hand, maybe one finger, the number of people I've seen fired as well. It's pretty easy to coast, union or not. > I believe that they are responsible for a majority of improvements to our working conditions and safety. I believe the same.
