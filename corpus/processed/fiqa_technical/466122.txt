"For me it's a pretty fine line. I really hate when I go to a store and I have salespeople breathing down my neck the instant my foot touches the floor. However, if I've been in a store for more than 5-10 minutes, especially if I've been hovering in one spot or over one time for the majority of that time, one would think that a salesperson would think ""Hey, maybe that dude wants to buy something and I should help him out."" I guess what irritates me most is the lack of common sense and courtesy displayed in these situations, although I can certainly understand that oftentimes it is merely someone following ""corporate policy"" in order to make enough money to get by or even keep their jobs."
