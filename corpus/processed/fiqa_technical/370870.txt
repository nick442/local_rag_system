When I did my CSC waaaaay back in the day (when there was 1 4 hour exam and 2 assignments, fuck I'm old) this is what I did. I took the week after New Years off, and studied exclusively for the CSC. I did nothing else but study (but I had done a lot of prep before) then I wrote the exam after a week of non-stop study. To be honest, the exam isn't difficult - at least the finance parts. The tricky parts are the pure memorization ones, which are almost all compliance/ethics questions (e.g. how long do you have to notify the OSC of a change in address, etc). Do not ignore these sections as they do test on ethics/compliance a lot.
