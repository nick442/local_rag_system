> And for a brand new company, you can sure as shit guarantee that as an owner, you'll be held personally liable. You are personally liable for any debt you personally sign off on yes. But you are not personally responsible for more than that debt. So if you take a 30 thousand dollar loan to start your business, your company hasn't been profitable and lost 20 thousand and your employees sue the company for 25 thousand. The company has 10 thousand to pay that with. The owner is still liable to pay the lender the 30 thousand, but has no obligation to the employees of the 25 thousand they are suing for.
