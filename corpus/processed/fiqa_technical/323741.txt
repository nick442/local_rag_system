"the point is is that your hard work may or may not pan out based on factors which are completely not in your control, both in the past and in the future. that's the ""right time"" part of the expression. the right place is the part that everyone controls, but it's insufficient. i mean are you really going to tell some person growing up in a slum that all they need to do is spend time and get to know and become friends with people? 9999/10000 times that isn't going to cut the mustard, because of their unlucky starting point."
