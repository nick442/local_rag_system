What I am saying that in the time I have been importing from China I have learnt some important indirect lessons. One of the most valuable is that you really have to expect the unexpected as it most certainly will happen. Really no level of experience can counteract some of the things that happen but you must be prepared to recover from them. I think there are a lot of people online who like to blow smoke up their own ass and act like they are better than everyone else and that they never make mistakes. I am just not one of these people. Sometimes i make mistakes and sometimes I lose money, I'm just honest about it. I think this honesty helps people get that one step closer to obtaining their goals of importing by making this type of business actually sound like something that is real and obtainable instead of making it some shiny world that people can't just roll up their sleeves and get involved in. Thanks for raising this point.
