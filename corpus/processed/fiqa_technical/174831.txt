That makes me happy, they really portrayed Ray as an asshole, but it took a lot of vision and hard work to build that kind of empire, and it clearly wouldn't have been the same if left to the brothers. I'm glad they were happy with their buyout. I'm not sure I would be after seeing what it would become.
