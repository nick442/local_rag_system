Its sad to watch how selfish the reddit community is. These people only care about what will make THEIR lives easier. So many of these people working for Walmart are because of a horrible socioeconomic status. They had bad parents, poor schooling, and horrible peers. They had little chance to make something of their selves, and most has zero. Instead of having compassion for these people, you shun them. Humanity really doesn't deserve to be blessed with so much potential and a planet like this.
