"> Do you even know these people and their history to know that they are ""undeserving"" of higher pay? if they were worth more, other businesses would offer them higher higher pay. they aren't forced to work for walmart. but if their work makes a business $10/hr, it makes no sense for businesses to offer them more than that - it's a loss to the business. > Your comments show immense naivety and lack of empathy. i'm just a med student, but i plan on giving a lot in charity once i'm working. and i'll bet you my charity givings will do many times more good than the gov't would do with it. watch just 2 minutes from this speech. it explains my views. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18zqtVcGxAA#t=7m55s"
