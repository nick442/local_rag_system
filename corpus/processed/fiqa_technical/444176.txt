Detroit would do better to fix the city *first* and thereby attract people and companies rather than doing it in the backwards way it is now. Right now, though, there are plenty of local die-hard Detroit proponents that won't even raise their kids in the city or send them to school there. If Detroit can't even lure people back from the Detroit suburbs, how is it going to land lots of people from much healthier and more vibrant places?
