"You come off as a douchebag when you start a post, but I hadn't heard of duress in contract law. Does this apply to your average dental patient looking for a cleanup? There are other dentists and he didn't make any threats for them to sign the contact. I knew vaguely of the concept of duress, and was implicitly ignoring that. I meant contracts for goods or services of an ""everyday"" nature. But if you were making fun of me for being a kid or being naive or my lack of knowledge of the law, it came off like you were a total dick."
