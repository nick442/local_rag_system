"But if we raise the price of the juicer to something rediculous, it will seem like a ""premium"" product, and if we lock our customers into buying their juice from us only, and auto expire the fruit on an aggressive schedule we'll make a ton of money.

Open source fruit is a thing of the past folks. Squeezing fruit by hand is for plebians and suckers."
