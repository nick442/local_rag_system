Drawing on empirical research, we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get more happiness for their money. Specifically, we suggest that consumers should (1) buy more experiences and fewer material goods; (2) use their money to benefit others rather than themselves; (3) buy many small pleasures rather than fewer large ones; (4) eschew extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance; (5) delay consumption; (6) consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their day-to-day lives; (7) beware of comparison shopping; and (8) pay close attention to the happiness of others. Even TL;DR(er): Money doesn't bring happiness. Material things don't bring happiness. Things that bring happiness however are much easier to achieve with money. Novel Expriences bring happiness, and it's hard to afford vacations when you're poor. Being useful to society at large make people happy. Bill Gates is more useful because he is rich than a Peace Corps worker. It's the little things in life that make us happy, and the rich can afford more of them. Happiness, like death, is by a thousand cuts.
