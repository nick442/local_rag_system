"No kidding! Fancy words to say ""make the right decisions and execute on those decisions correctly"". Anybody does not know that? Now for the hard part: how do you make the right decisions and how to execute decisions efficiently and correctly? Here's my answer: nobody, including Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc always or most of the times makes the the right decisions or execute them correctly. The successful people are those who abandon bad decisions quickly and adjust their execution when they see things don't work as planned. Lastly, bad leaders and big failures are those who avoid decisions because of fear of making bad decisions. The worst leaders and worst failures are those who do not do basic checks and plans before making decisions or executing them."
