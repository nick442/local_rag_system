Can this be possible that I wish to convert some amount of INR to USD and keep USD in my bank account? This is not possible the way you have described. A resident Indian can hold a Foreign Currency account designated in USD. The deposit into this accounts are only due to specified transactions. One cannot directly convert INR to USD. Read the RBI guideline here. A simplified info is also available on ICICI Bank site.
