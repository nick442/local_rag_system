"Generally you do not pay taxes on insurance payouts that occur because of some kind of loss, provided you paid the premiums yourself. ""Generally, if you're paying premiums yourself, such as for homeowners insurance and auto insurance, then your insurance benefits are not a taxable event,"" says Adam Sherman, CEO of Firstrust Financial Resources in Philadelphia. ""Your benefits are reimbursement for expenses, rather than income."" It's not as straightforward for death benefits and life insurance."
