Good idea, but you can already imagine how that will turn out: Patents will be used in some pro-forma way, without intention of serious commercial use, to avoid using them. For trademarks, this already happens. After a merger, companies continue to formally use a brand/trademark of an acquired company that they have effectively terminated, in order to avoid other companies using that trademark (or a very similar one).
