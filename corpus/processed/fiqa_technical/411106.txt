Why is it so hard for people to shed their partisan blindfolds and embrace this simple fact: if you pay the middle class and the poor less, there will be less internal demand. It's basic economics, basic arithmetic really. What happens when the rich gain an extra dollar? 90% of it goes into some investment, like shares or hedge funds, and so out of the real economy. What happens when the middle class gains an extra dollar? $0.95 gets spent into the real economy, and only the rest goes into savings. Is it really that hard to understand the mechanics of this, and do the impact of riding inequality?
