For anyone not into guns.. trumps actually been *amazing* for gun *consumers.* Everyone thought Hillary was going to get elected (and ban guns), so manufacturers over produced during the rush leading up to the elections.. then Trump surprised everyone and won, so they've been dumping inventory at crazy low prices. So.. if you have any interest at all in gun ownership, now is seriously the cheapest time you'll probably ever see.
