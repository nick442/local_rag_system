"i know that hedge funds shouldn't be compared with index funds. they do different things. they serve different functions. but when the headline is they are reporting big gains, and then they report that ""Ken Griffin’s main Wellington and Kensington funds at Citadel rose almost 7 percent."" YTD, and ""Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking and an equity-focused quantitative fund at Renaissance are up more than 9 percent this year through July"" as reporting ""Big Gains"" it's a little silly when an index fund like SCHB is up 10.7% YTD with an ER of 0.03."
