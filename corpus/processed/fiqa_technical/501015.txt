Thanks for the response - ok so maybe the funds could be partially crowd-sourced and partially funded by an accredited investor? Also yes - having an experienced adviser and a plan in place to replace existing directors sound like good plot devices. There doesn't really have to be a limitation to banks, the idea comes from the protagonists being upset with the status quo of banking practices (foreclosures, fees, investing in weapons/warzones etc.) what would you suggest?
