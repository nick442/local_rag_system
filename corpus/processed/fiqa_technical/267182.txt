"I want to first state that I'm not an attorney and this is not a response that would be considered legal advice. I'm going to assume this was a loan was made in the USA. The OP didnt specify. A typical auto loan has a borrower and a co-borrower or ""cosigner"". The first signer on the contract is considered the ""primary"". As to your question about a primary being a co-borrower my answer would be no. Primary simply means first signer and you can't be a first signer and a co-borrower. Both borrower and co-borrower, unless the contract specifies different, are equally responsible for the auto loan regardless if you're a borrower or a co-borrower (primary or not primary). I'm not sure if there was a situation not specified that prompted the question. Just remember that when you add a co-borrower their positive and negative financials are handled equally as the borrower. So in some cases a co-borrower can make the loan not qualify.
