Simple rule for UK student loans. Never repay early. (http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/student-loans-repay) They are not real debt: only payable over threshold and wiped after 30 years (ish). They do not appear as debt with Credit Agencies. If you have other debt, it is almost certainly at a higher rate or worse terms and should be paid off first If you don't have debt, then you can put the cash to better use: whether saving, mortgage deposit or avoiding worse debt in the future.
