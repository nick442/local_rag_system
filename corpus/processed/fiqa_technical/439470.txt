As well as the visual impact - employees don't see the money disappearing directly from their paycheck so don't feel as heavily taxed - there's usually one practical difference, at least in the UK. Employers are generally prohibited in law from explicitly passing the tax onto their employees. Of course the presence of the tax will affect how much they are willing to pay, especially over the long-term and when deciding on pay rises. But if there's a sudden increase in the tax rate, that will fall on employers immediately, they wouldn't be able to reduce their employees' pay directly.
