"yes because we all know the little guy always wins when she on the right side of the law. even the government loses cases to the rich like OJ Simpson. who ever has the resources is gonna win. with the legal system in the USA in shambles I do not see justice happening. innocent people die on deathrow, officers in NYC are ""sprinkling and planting"" drugs on suspects..the system just does not work."
