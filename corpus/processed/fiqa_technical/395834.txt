"Income tax wasn't a thing in the states until 1913 and that was by design. Just because a few guys in a room wrote it on a piece of paper doesn't mean it's justifiable and/or moral, in fact it makes it immoral because now millions of people who had no say in the matter are now subject to the consequences of not following the rules these few men wrote. Just as a mental exercise go to Google and type ""define taxes"" and read that definition I'm willing to bet there's 1 word in that definition that will stick out to you."
