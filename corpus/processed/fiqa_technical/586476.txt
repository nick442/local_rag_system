But the odds stand at 20-1 that by their own parameters the models are overstating the warming. Interestingly enough, natural cycles like El Nino were put forth as a possible explanation for the warming in the 80's and 90's. That explanation was not accepted by alarmists at the time. They have long resisted using natural cycles to explain the pause, because they then have to admit it played a large role in the warming as well. But when you get desperate..
