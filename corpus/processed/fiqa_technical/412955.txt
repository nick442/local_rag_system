There are a lot of union jobs like that. I once was a union worker at a plant. The company had 11 plants, of which two were union. The two union plants were not coincidentally the lowest producing plants the company had. My buddy who got me hired there and I kept getting told to slow down and not work so hard. While I was there, the company fired a worker for sleeping and drinking on the job. The company had filmed him doing these things. He fought it. The union backed him and he won on the grounds that the company had singled him out - there were apparently other people doing these things, but he was the worst so they had picked on him first. The company was forced to re-hire him. A few months later, the company shut down the plant and *everyone* lost their jobs. Go union.
