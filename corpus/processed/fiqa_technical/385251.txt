I would not recommend borrowing your 401(k) money to buy a house for two reasons: When you borrow money from your 401(k), it is no longer invested. Yes, you pay yourself interest, but you miss out on the investment gains for the life of the loan. If you leave your job, the loan is due in full shortly thereafter. If you do not pay it back, you are hit with taxes and penalties. If I were you, I would roll it over into an IRA for the reasons you mentioned.
