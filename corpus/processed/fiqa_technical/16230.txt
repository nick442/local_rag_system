Yeah, fuck those hippies, making you shop at stores you don't want to and buy products you don't want to. Tip 1: grab from the back for perishables. Tip 2: pretty sure they'll do a refund or exchange on about anything for about any reason. Never tried it, though I have also been burned by early mold.
