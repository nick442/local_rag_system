nasty stuff = if used properly, it works (usually) at the same time, uhm.. how can you expect ANY effective herbicide to work selectively without some selective impact on humanity? Hell, general effective herbicides (agent orange) tend to be detrimental to all life in sufficient dosages (also kill the plants you want to protect).. and ineffective herbicides (in most cases) still cause problems (vinegar a common alternative). Granted I don't mind vinegar - then again, no ulcers or other gastric issues so far.
