I'd imagine that an 'emotionless' environment (maybe not the best word to describe it) will mean that people with autism (substitute this with any other attribute such as looks, gender, nationality, skin color, etc.) are less hindered in advancing, thus one should expect that more of them would congregate in in an environment that is welcoming to their natural bias. I don't have any opinion on the subject, rather I have lots of questions.
