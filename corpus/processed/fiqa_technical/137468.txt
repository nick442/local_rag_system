"Hahaha the good old argument of authority. China made more progress on medicine by massively training doctors after it's revolution and sending them to rural areas. Comparatively, in the same development phase, the US was full of medicine shows selling snake oil to gullible idiots. In Europe, the public sector is the only one that can authorize a drug and is the only buyer (monopsony) ensuring drug prices remain low and that drugs like opioids never make it to people.. The USA is one of the richest countries in earth, yet you perform worst that ALL other developed countries in health outcomes and health costs as a proportion of your GDP. but sure, you're the ""experts"", you know something we don't. probably how to rip people off."
