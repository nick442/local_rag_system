>when by definition, you are being paid less than your labour If that were true then why wouldnt the worker just work for themselves? They would make more or at least the same amount and not have to deal with their bosses bossing them around. The fact is that the worker is made more productive through the use of the entrpeneur's resources and business model structure. If there were no extra benefit to the worker in taking the job then they wouldnt take it, just like if the employer did not recieve an added benefit above and beyond what they were paying the worker, they wouldnt hire them. Extra value is created in the two voluntarily working together. No one is being generous or agreeing to the arrangement out of the goodness of their heart. They are both acting in their self interest and they are both benefitting.
