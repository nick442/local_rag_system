I just finished my bachelor and I'm doing my masters in Computer Science at a french school in Quebec. I consider myself being in the top 5% and I have an excellent curriculum, having studied abroad, learned 4 languages, participated in student committees, etc. I'm leaning towards IT or business strategy/development..but I'm not sure yet. I guess I'm not that prepared, that's why I wanted a little help.
