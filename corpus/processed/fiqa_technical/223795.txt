The holders of the shares have to agree to sell them to management in a share repurchase. Typically, share repurchases are done in the open market, causing market activity to increase the share price marginally. This is how the company returns the value to shareholders. The company could also negotiate a price with a mutual fund, or founder, for a large block. If they get close to the point of purchasing all outstanding shares, this would be exactly the same as the management of the company taking the company private, buying out all existing shareholders. To prevent a single holdout from keeping say the very last share for one million dollars or the like on the open market, they would generally propose to the board of directors the buyout terms with a price per share, and most corporate charters are written such that the directors' vote binds minority shareholders to buyout or merger decisions. Michael Dell famously took Dell Computer private in 2013, raising external money to offer a fair price to the board, which accepted it, letting him take it back to private status.
