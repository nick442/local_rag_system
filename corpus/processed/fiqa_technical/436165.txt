(Oops - I had been meaning to come back to this Q. sooner. Just saw my reminder, so here goes.) Shortly before this question was asked, I actually read a good blog post on the subject of disability insurance at Evolution of Wealth - 7 Ways Your Group Disability Will Fail. I know the OP doesn't have group disability (and hence the question), but the reason I'm highlighting it is: Even somebody with a group disability policy from their employer may want to consider supplementing it with an individual policy that has better coverage. In my case, the reason I opted for an individual policy was due to point #6 from the post: .. ways that group disability coverage will fail you: .. [etc] 6) You can go work somewhere else. With disability insurance there is a feature called own-occupation. This means that you are unable to perform the duties of your specific occupation even if you are able to work in an other occupation. Good group disability coverage will cover your own-occupation for a period of 2 years after that if you can work anywhere (yes, even McDonald’s) then you receive no more benefits. Notice I said ‘good’ coverage, a lot of policies don’t even have the own-occupation benefit. .. I made sure my own individual LTD policy included coverage of own-occupation until age 65. So, do pay attention to the specific features and limitations of LTD policies when shopping for one.
