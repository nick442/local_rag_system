"Depends what you mean by simplify. I thought I would save money when I talked the family into dropping cable TV, but it ends up coming out as a wash because we rented more and bought TV shows online from amazon.com. (Then we bought a new computer so I could keep working on my laptop while the family watches streaming internet, we save money, but not as much as I thought) We did a great purge of ""stuff"" from the garage and closets a couple of summers ago because I wanted to simplify (some clothes, extra pots and pans, a coat rack, unused electronics) and now I am seeing their replacements coming back into the house in the form of new purchases. I guess my lesson is that you cannot make another person simplify their life. I love my wife for trying so hard to help me with my plan, and I certainly don't blame her for wanting a coat rack again (it is just who she is, she doesn't see the irony) but I should have considered how my desire impacted those around me."
