Hours appear to be relatively consistent, at least in my experience. Analysts (all levels) have much more flexible schedules and travel much more but are responsible for more information/responsibility. The difference is that associates do the grunt work with models/writing and analysts provide more direction/fine tuning and interact with clients more(they're on the phone half the time from 7-4 every day). Its generally not night work but if a company announces earnings after market close and then has an evening conference call, we need to have the report out by the next morning well before the market opens, so yeah sometimes it can get pretty late.
