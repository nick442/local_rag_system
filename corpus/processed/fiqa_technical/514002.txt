There are stores that buy ugly or close to expiration produce and sell it super cheap. Its great if you're baking, canning, or making a big fruit salad for a party because you can get a bunch of stuff super cheap. Its not that good if you're trying to stock up on produce because most of it will start going bad the next day.
