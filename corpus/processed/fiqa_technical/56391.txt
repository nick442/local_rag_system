Well, it's the manufacturers who provide the software, not the banks. Very often, the banks have little to do with the ATMs other than ensuring they have a good network connection (unless said ATM has a cell modem) and loading them with money. Sometimes they don't even load money and have armored companies do it for them. As to why NCR, Diebold, Hysosung, etc have opted to use Windows, you'd have to ask them. I'm no IT guy, just someone who learns what I need to as different things come up. Put it this way: I also use drills and angle grinders on safes, vaults and other things, but I'm not trained in metalwork.
