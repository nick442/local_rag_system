"1) Don't leave anything off your CV, get a little job. 2) Upload it. It helps to know that you have done certain modules without fucking them up. 3) Turn any question (including this one) into a dialogue. ""I was always aware of JP as a company, but I really got more of an insight when I was studying them for my final project .."" 4) LEVERAGE THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR DIVERSITY! The majority of the applicants are white males and these large companies have diversity initiatives which they have to meet. You are doing yourself a huge disservice if you do not mention your background on those forms. 5) Launguages are a great skill so make sure it is on your CV clearly near the start. You should keep your name AND include your full name on the CV. The bad press Muslims get is not going to affect you negatively. You will not be discriminated against in the way that you think. Everyone who I know who works at JP is Nigerian. When was the last time you read a nice news article about Nigeria?"
