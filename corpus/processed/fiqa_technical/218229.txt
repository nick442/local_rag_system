Thanks. I see the term 'cofounder' used for those who were instrumental in the creation of businesses (such as Twitter) despite only being employees at the time. I think with Twitter there is an argument that employees were founders because they pivoted a failing business with employee ideas for products. But in my case, I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do and if a founding-employee were to drastically change the idea for the better, I would probably allow the title 'co-founder', if they pivoted from a failing idea to a winning idea. As for employee stock, it's pretty common these days to give away some capital (maybe 10%) to employees in order to spur them on. The idea that they could potentially all become millionaires if the product launches and is successful down the track is a good incentive to work hard. Of course it would have to vest over time.
