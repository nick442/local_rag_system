THIS. That's why I'm fortunate enough to work a remote job where I live 3 hours north of NYC and have traveled 30 years back in time when it comes to prices of homes. I feel like even with shit credit, the hope of a dream home is much more attainable now that the cost/income ratio is where it should be.
