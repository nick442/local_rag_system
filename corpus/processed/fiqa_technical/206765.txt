"you bet that a quote/currency/stock market/anything will rise or fall within a period of time. .. So, what is the relationship with trading ? I see no trading at all since I don't buy or sell quotes. So, if you just wander in and say ""oh, hey, look, a bunch of options, i'm going to play games and have excitement"" then that is, in fact, some sort of gambling. Indeed, most trading activities will be like that to you. On the other hand, you might be engaged in other business where those things matter. You might be doing a lot of trading elsewhere in the market, for instance, and suddenly everyone freaks out and the stock market goes crazy and you lose a ton of money. To protect yourself from losing a ton of money, you might buy a binary option based on VIX (the volatility index) going over a certain level. If you're not in a business where you're buying it to protect yourself, then you should probably only buy the options if you have reason to think it'll be profitable and worth the risk. If you don't understand the risks, skip it."
