And then there's Washington, DC, which subsidized fiber throughout the city but cannot lease it commercially due to red tape. EDIT: I hate making statements like this without support: > But it’s unlikely that we’ll see last-mile service directly from the District. That’s because the city’s franchise agreements with Internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast prohibit the District from competing with these companies by offering its own service.
