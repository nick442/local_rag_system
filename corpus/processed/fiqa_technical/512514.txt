Please. Say what you will about Trump, but let's not pretend the ACA was working, or that it was good for young people. It did *nothing* to rein in the healthcare and pharmaceutical corporate-cartels. Under the ACA, Americans still had the most expensive drug costs in the world. Young people were also the group most screwed by the ACA. The entire plan rested on forcing young people to pay for the health care of boomers. One of the reasons the program was failing so badly is that young people turned out to not be stupid -- and they were opting out in numbers vastly higher than bean counters had predicted. The ACA was literally written by health insurance companies and Big Pharma. Anyone who doubts this should pull up a chart of healthcare, insurance and pharmaceutical sector stocks for the time-period the ACA was signed. If the ACA had been anything other than a forced buy-in to an already ridiculously overpriced sector, those stocks would have cratered. Instead they soared. If you want to know who got screwed by the ACA, it was people under 35 -- whose healthcare spending *rose* per capita as a result of that atrocious tax. And let's not forget that the annual price-tag for all of us was climbing by unsustainable rates every year. (Along with those fat healthcare stocks). That turd was failing of its own accord. It was a terribly crafted bill. If you want to fix healthcare in the US you need to get rid of money in politics, and by cutting the absurd legal/financial protections granted to the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. (Which by the way, Trump isn't doing either. We *still* don't have a candidate on either side of the aisle with the balls it takes to fix this extremely busted industry. And it starts with campaign finance reform)
