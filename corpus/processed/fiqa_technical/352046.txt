"The blurb from the law site is accurate. I'm not going to say any other info from them is or isn't accurate though as I have not read their site at all. If you check the public resources from Fair Issac directly you will get similar wording to that of the law firm: Presence of adverse public records (bankruptcy, judgements, suits, liens, wage attachments, etc.), collection items, and/or delinquency (past due items) Once the items are on your report they will weigh the score down (though less over time). Also, paying the accounts off, other than a successful Pay For Delete (PFD), can have a negative impact on your score. By paying the account off you'll trigger a status change that will allow the account record to stick around for up to 7 more years (10 for medical debts). Which is why it is a better idea to let accounts fall off than it is to pay them once they are over a certain age. Be aware that paying off a collection account on which you previously missed a payment, will not remove it from your credit report. Your FICO score will still consider this information, because it reflects your past credit pattern. Source: Fair Issac: Understanding your FICO Score [PDF] Paying an account off and getting it marked ""Paid in Full"" or ""Settled"" or anything else really won't help you at all. The adverse account record drags on your score just for being there."
