"When employers can get everybody and their dog to apply for a given job, you need to have that four-leaf clover (or at least a referral, which, lucky me, I don't in almost all cases). Or the best skills. If you aren't at the top of your game, you probably won't get hired when there are 10 other people that are just as good. You need to think of ways to creatively differentiate yourself from the competition. ""And that terrifies me when I think about it that way."" unsuccessful people generally think this way. Everything happens to you rather than you being able to change it yourself. ""Of course, all I can do is keep applying"" All of my best jobs came through my network for friends/acquaintances. If you aren't getting any interviews, start going to meetup groups in your industry and make friends. This is another problem: people don't want to leave the comfort of their keyboard. Sometimes you just need to get out there."
