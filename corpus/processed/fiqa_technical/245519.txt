So let me get this straight, the only solution we can come up with for a healthy farm and cheap produce is to let illegal immigrants in? That's really our best solution? That's an acceptable solution? With that logic, why not let in even more illegals to replace all American workers in every industry so consumers have it better in terms of prices? Give me a break.
