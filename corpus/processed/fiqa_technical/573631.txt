Millionaires? No offense, but you're talking out of your ass. My mother lives in a house that my parents bought in the 1980s. She's definitely not a millionaire. Nowhere close. But she owns the house free & clear and can afford the taxes. I bought my house from a retired lady for about 5x what she paid for it in the sixties. Maybe more. I don't recall, but she was the original owner. Definitely not a millionaire. Just a retired widow. Most of the folks who own these 1950s to 1980s tract homes in good areas are beneficiaries of good locations and lack of development. The reason those homes are so valuable is because we're not building new housing in anything resembling the scale needed. We need something like 40,000 new units built annually in Los Angeles and Orange counties to catch up to the population growth and lack of new construction happening now. It ain't gonna happen, but that's what we need. In 20 years, I'll benefit from Prop 13. It flows. And it benefits property owners. It encourages property ownership. If you wanted to argue that property taxes on commercial properties should be different from residential properties, I'd be up for the debate. It's an interesting topic and I don't know the answer, but it would result in wholesale reduction in commercial property values in the state because of the reduced cash flow from higher taxes. Huge dislocation and a massive transfer of wealth from commercial property owners to the taxpayers.
