my wife and I own a 2 br/2 bath house on .25 acres in western MA. We were able to refinance it and now pay about $400 a month in mortgage, and another $350 in taxes each month. Insurance is $50. We grow our own produce during the spring/summer/fall and put up a lot of canned stuff and whatnot in October. We don't eat much meat. I make about $20k/yr teaching music. Our 2 year old doesn't go to daycare. I care for him during the day and pay a babysitter in the evening while I teach. My wife is a cook and earns slightly more than me. Our combined income is about $42k/year. We have savings, investments and no debt. We do not use credit cards. We don't shop for the latest gadgets and gizmos. We look for bargains wherever possible, we go without and we do a lot of barter. See it is possible to do it. It takes hard work and creativity
