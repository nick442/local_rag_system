You started with the insults. Your argument is weak, based on anecdotal evidence and hyperbole. I'm sorry you keep digging yourself deeper and unable to find a way out. Insults and condescension aren't the way friend. I strongly urge you to educate yourself. Read factual documents on the matter, not just comments from other redditors. More than not, their comments have some sort of agenda and when you try to pass those comments off as your own and as fact, you just spread more misinformation. I sincerely do hope you get out of the Reddit hive mind and think for yourself, it's really quite refreshing.
