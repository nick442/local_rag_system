It's not too difficult. Every state has a few local banks that don't do this shit and with new current technology most have apps and allow you to deposit money without going to the bank itself. Yeah you don't have an ATMs everywhere but the need for ATMs deacreses each year. My local bank will even refunds me ATM charges up to 100$ a year.
