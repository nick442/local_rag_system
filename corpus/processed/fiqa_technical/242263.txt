The made with 100% chicken example is absolutely intended to deceive if it contains anything less than a few % off 100% chicken at the raw ingredients. I think you might be a bit too close to this industry to see the forest from the trees. A minimum of 50% chicken to be able to call it made with 100% chicken is such a low bar to hit that it's crazy. I might agree with you if the min was say 95% but it's not.
