>The banks needed as many loans as possible because they thought they could sell them all. You mean they could not sell them fast enough. There was more demand than the supply for this trash paper. When the demand was still there and the supply of even half-way legitimate loan salad CDOs ran out, the banks started to push into ever riskies and riskier loans just to fill the limitless demand. This insane demand is part of the problem. It means the wealth is too concentrated and there are a shitton of billionaires with nothing to invest their idiotic billions into, no reasonable account to park their money at, etc.. If there was no demand for this trash paper, the whole thing would have gone nowhere.
