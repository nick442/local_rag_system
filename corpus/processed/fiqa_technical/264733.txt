My original point, which was challenged by a republican hater (and I hate them as well) was that the USA has not found a magical formula for EVERYONE to experience prosperity and happiness. Well neither has any country in the world. All I was saying is that the ones the previous person claimed did that and your democracy index for that matter are incredibly not diverse countries and your response is china and Russia as examples of also being not diverse. Well china and Russia are extremely powerful so I am not sure I see the point.
