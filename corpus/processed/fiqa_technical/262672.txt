"I'm 25, make ~40k/yr, have about 18k in investments right now. all money I've earned mind you. I sold some stock last year for a capital gain of 1800. that's a cap gains tax of $270, if the cap gains tax didn't exist I would have paid 450. that's an extra $180 in taxes that hits me right in my middle class, trying to build a nest egg, guts. would you please stop with all the bullshit about the capital gains taxes being there for the ""moneyed elite"" you can see how just a small sale could have incurred extra taxes for me, could you imagine someone who may be older and has larger gains to report?"
