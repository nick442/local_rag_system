"Yeah, I mean it's natural economics that jobs go to low-wage countries, so I guess I can't be ""mad"" at that. But in addition, there's also a ""shift"" in debt from what was usually mortgages to student loan debt. It's not good because you're no longer ""paying yourself"" as you did with a mortgage, so money just gets burned..*and* you can't shed that debt..ever. People frame it like a ""bubble"" but it's more like a long-term hamper on consumer spending. IMO, if the fed wants to help the economy, THIS would be the most effective bailout for lifting long-term growth. I don't have any student debt and I still think this is probably one of the better answers."
