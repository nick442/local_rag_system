I think you don't understand the Boston area. Sure Boston has tight roads, but only certain areas. The seaport is pretty much a grid now. Also, Amazon most likely won't be building a campus in any city center. Whether they go to Toronto or Pittsburg or Austin, they will be building on the outskirts of the city or a place where there is land. Even Austin doesn't have land right in the downtown. Boston is like the city center of all those other cities. You could build an entire campus from the ground up 15 miles from the center of Boston and not need to deal with traffic or tight roads or any issues you mentioned. I mean, they're building a Wynn casino 3 miles from the city center. Boston is a tiny land area. If you plopped the land area of Toronto on Boston it would encompass a ton of towns that aren't boston. And as for the location away from Seattle. My assumption is that they want a second headquarters not near their old one. Having an operations base on both coasts makes sense. I don't know what their criteria are, but Boston and the greater Boston area has pretty much everything they would want. Especially access to talent.
