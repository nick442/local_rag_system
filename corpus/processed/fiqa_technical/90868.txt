> I was under the impression that ads do better when people don’t know they’re an ad. This is very true. If I were getting to make the rules, selfishly as a marketer, I wouldn't require this. Trick is, this isn't Instagram making the rules. It's the FTC. The FTC requires these disclosures or we could face major fines. They've done it before and have been stepping up their enforcement. So if I have rules, I'd rather a company like Instagram make it easier to comply with those rules. Right now it's iffy. The influncer has to use certain language in certain places or the FTC isn't satisfied. But I still want the post to sound 'organic'. With this method, I don't have to mess with including certain phrases in the copy or certain hashtags. I can just roll with a normal looking post and check a box that labels it as sponsored. Easy, simple, and I'm covered. On top of that - the best part I really, genuinely love (and the 'carrot' that will get even sketchy marketers to use this, is that I get to see live data on the post's performance. Right now only the user of the account can see the post's performance. So I have to trust that the user is right that the post got 39000 impressions. I can see likes and comments, but that's it. With full access to reporting on the post, I can also see reach, impressions (which gives me engagement rate), and saves - all of which are huge factors in determining the success of these sorts of posts.
