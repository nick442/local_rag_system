> If you pick someone up and take them somewhere, you're a taxi. It's really as simple as that. It's nowhere near as simple as that. If you pick up your friend, you're not a taxi. If you pick up a friend of a friend, you're not a taxi. If you're a livery car, you're not a taxi. Taxis are usually defined very specifically, requiring medallions, certain car models, certain behaviors (being able to pick up fares straight from the curb), etc. And the donation thing has been gone for at least a year. And these ridesharing companies tend to follow regulations where they exist, like in California's [Transportation Network Companies](http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/Enforcement/TNC/). So, when you take the time to educate yourself about the issue, the issue tends to be less simple than you previously thought.
