This has often been one of the things that eats away at my sanity. I'm sure that these people know full well what they are doing to the environment and they're planning ahead on how they're going to profit from that too. Poison the land and make fresh water harder to get, no problem, charge more for habitable land and fresh water and ignore the fact the profits come at the cost of human lives.
