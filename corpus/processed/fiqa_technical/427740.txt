People with skills can still find good jobs. I live in one of the shittiest economic states in the country right now. The people that I know that went to college **AND** busted their ass to find a good job when they got out all had one within a couple months. The people that fucked around, sent out their resume to a few online job applications and didn't make it priority #1 to get a high quality job didn't. Good jobs aren't easy to come by right now, but they are available.
