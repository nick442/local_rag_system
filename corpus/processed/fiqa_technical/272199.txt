Typical consumerist bullshit. Post some chat transcript with some flunky as proof of how evil corporation is. Yes, I'm sure Comcast won't sell you the box. But consumerist should be seeking interviews from upper management about this issue. Flunky order-taker is probably just not in the mood to deal with some asshole who wants to buy a box. Next week Consumerist is going to post about how Burger King will not make a Big Mac, and present video of someone placing the order at a drive-through as proof of how horrible Burger King is
