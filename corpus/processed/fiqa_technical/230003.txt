"> ""So I'll either stop shipping prescriptions or switch to FedEx or UPS -- which cost me three times what the USPS currently charges."" Basically, the USPS is delivering overnight packages for 1/3 the cost of FedEx and UPS and can't make that work. So now business costs will go up when sending things overnight as they're forced to switch to private carriers. Thus, in essence, the USPS has been ""subsidizing"" business that send things overnight."
