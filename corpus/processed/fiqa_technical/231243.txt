"> The economic term for this concept is ""velocity of money"", and it gets into stuff that I didn't really cover above. I noticed that it wasn't covered, and it seems to me that this actually has something to do with the original question, about where all the money has gone. It's my understanding that the velocity of money has slowed, with corporations, being uncertain of future prospects (both due to the economy itself as well as to an uncertain regulatory environment) and thus hesitant to make new investments. However, this doesn't make complete sense to me. It's not that they're hiding the money under a mattress; they must have it invested into something, and presumably the holders of those investments are themselves doing something with it."
