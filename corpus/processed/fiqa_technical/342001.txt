As an employer, why would I not want to hire someone who is philosophically similar to me? Now I only have around 10 employees, so my case is a little different, but if everyone can be free to believe what they want, can I as an employer believe to hire those that have similar interests to mine? Fortunately I've never had to ask these questions (facebook is a beautiful thing). I'm an athiest. Why wouldn't I hire an athiest first given that I work in such close proximity with my employees and is much more like a family or a close group of friends? I'm going to pick people who fit in. I find that if the chemistry is better, more productive work gets done.
