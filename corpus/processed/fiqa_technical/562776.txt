I would at least encrypt the part of the drive you keep forms like that, but not to protect myself from the odd villain who works for the IRS. Your broker does report your capital gains to the IRS, whether in sales or dividends. I received a bill last month from the IRS for dividends I forgot to report on my 2013 return. The bill contained a partial duplicate of my 1099-DIV form from the brokerage, and included account numbers and SSN. Therefore it's safe to say IRS employees don't need to hack your laptop in order to get that info. :) As for minimum information, it depends on your broker. Call them and ask; they'll tell you everything you need to know. Vanguard, for example, has some security questions, among other things.
