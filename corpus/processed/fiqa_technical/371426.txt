"Another aspect is decision makers must CONSTANTLY re-evaluate not only the current climate, but the future. I'm not sure if anyone noticed but the economy and consumer confidence is in the toilet. If business owners arent careful it very well could collapse and in the end if it does fail there is nobody else responsible but themselves. So in times of success, yes the business owners reap profit, but in tough times so too do they have to take full responsibility and consequences of reality. Salary employees have no such liability, they go to work at 9am and leave at 5pm and while most want increased responsbility because that usually yields increased competition, most have no interest in taking true responsibility for the company's health. As the sole principal of the company it is wholly his choice what direction and decisions to make for the company. I guarantee you his decision will not be based on vengence or grudge but rather weighing incentives to continue, and being an older gentlemen decide it's no longer worth it and retire. I've personally see many smaller companies do this in the past 10 years. ""Why go through the stress? I've got cash. I'm going to sell or close the company and retire."""
