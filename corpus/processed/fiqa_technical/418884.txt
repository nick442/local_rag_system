Book keeping as a sole proprietor will seem like a headache. Basically you have to have two accounts for everything and track specifics for any company assets that are mixed use (such as mileages). No real downsides aside from that. We just bought a start up kit and then modified it an then did a lot of research on proper registrations. I found out later you can have a legal expert do it for like 250-300. If we had known that it would have been worth it. The state and fed registration is a boring headache. Your time is better spent earning.
