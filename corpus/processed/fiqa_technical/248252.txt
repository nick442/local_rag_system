Ummm, let's see what the outcome here is: 1. Lawyers get $16.5M 2. We get pretty much nothing. 3. Ticketmaster gets a settlement against them that they just pass off in the future to us. 4. Ticketmaster *still* charges these fees, they just now mention that they make some profit off them. 5. We get no concessions from Ticketmaster on fees, and *more* fees added on to pay for the settlement in the future. Yay! If the damn lawyers had just left this well enough alone, we would all be better off. They smelled a payoff and chased that ambulance to a $16.5M payday. tl;dr; Fuck lawyers.
