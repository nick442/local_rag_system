Idk how to word this better but Is it possible to make 4000 in a month? I work full time for a school making 14.70 and my wife makes a little less full time at her job. Is there a way I can help myself maximize price to save based on what we have outgoing? Need a down payment for a home and really don't wanna use a government loan. (Moving snarky just want a better rate and lower closing fees). Thanks!
