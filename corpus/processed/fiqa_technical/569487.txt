">JK. I have a job in engineering. I was writing sarcastically as well (I didn't really think YOU were a barista). But doubtless there ARE many PhD barista's out there (and, regardless of whether there doctoral degrees is *really* in ""underwater basket weaving"" or some other nonsensical inanity is pretty irrelevant and nonspecific, Lord knows there are plenty of worthless degrees being bought with dear effort {and huge debt-loads}, I know several people who were just so ""suckered"" by the academic scam). >Interesting article on the machinery. I can't count how many times I've had my coffee burned by those blasted humans. Well, as I have advised several young people, just about every fad/fashion ""service"" job out there CAN (and inevitably will) be either automated, or is such a low-paying job that it isn't *worth* automating. Instead I tell them to do their best to apprentice, train, or get schooling in some trade or profession that CANNOT be easily outsourced (plumbing, electrical work, etc); or which cannot easily be automated (dealing with mechanical things that require ""brain-power"" to diagnose, perfect, etc). The other option of course -- is getting into some aspect of the ""death & dying"" industry -- nursing homes, rehab hospitals, and of course funerals and such are going to be ""booming"" as the Baby Boomers age & begin dying in the coming decade to three decades (and along a *very* predictable statistical/actuarial curve, give or take a year or two at most {probably take, as it appears Boomers are actually statistically LESS healthy than previous ""silent generation"" retirees})."
