I read the article. They've shut down foia requests with the recent updated foia legislation, the guy says that big business owners will slander them in the news if they publish anything on them, try to sue them, insurance companies won't insure them, wealthy people won't donate. Essentially is you go after big corporate power you get shut down. Edit: I am for it.
