Who wrote this? Just because some people -- and aparantly the author -- don't know the meaning of some of these doesn't mean they are useless phrases. But to close the loop on thisâ€¦ = Always the more theoretical Business Development/Strategy guys who say this, so they can sound thorough? Not. Try: put a process in place to make certain that the things we just decided to do actually get done, either by assigning a third party to or using an automated system to regularly check for failure to progress, and deliver that information to someone that can do something about it. This is low-hanging fruit = Get this done quickly? How about, this can be done quickly and brings disproportionate and important immediate benefits, so we should do it first.
