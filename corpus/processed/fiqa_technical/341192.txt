"In the case of a specific fund, I'd be tempted to get get an annual report that would disclose distribution data going back up to 5 years. The ""View prospectus and reports"" would be the link on the site to note and use that to get to the PDF of the report to get the data that was filed with the SEC as that is likely what matters more here. Don't forget that mutual fund distributions can be a mix of dividends, bond interest, short-term and long-term capital gains and thus aren't quite as simple as stock dividends to consider here."
