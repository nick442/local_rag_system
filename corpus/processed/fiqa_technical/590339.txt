Depends on the level of risk in the specific p2p provider. I've looked at lendinvest which secures loans against property. You can select loans based on loan-to-value ratio etc. Even if a recession happens, if the LTV is around 50% it would have to be a pretty awful recession for you to lose any money once they recover, although there will be a delay while you wait for the recovery to happen. I would thus consider this lower risk than other p2p options, so I'd be willing to put more money into it. At the end of the day as others have said there's no objective answer. This is just one factor to consider which I don't think has been pointed out yet on this discussion
