>The labor theories of value (LTV) are heterodox economic theories of value which argue that the value of a commodity is related to the labor needed to produce or obtain that commodity. (Wikipedia) Note that it does not say that value is always _directly proportional_ to the labor needed, only that the labor needed is _related_ to the value. Ergo: labor does not _create_ value automatically, but value (when existing) is determined by labor, because someone will demand more for something that takes a lot of effort and/or time to create.
