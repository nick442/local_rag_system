Having spent all of 3 minutes reading about this, my impression is insurers are going to have to have more money on hand to cover every line of business as independent silos, instead of keeping it all pooled together and being able to shift money around as needed between their lines of business. In order to acquire this capital, they will take on more debt now; as the expectation is interest rates will rise in the future which would increase their cost of debt vs. acquiring the debt now when interest rates are low.
