"Can we just call the Republicans 'evil, money-grubbing hucksters', and have done with it? I mean, I get the whole ""people should take more responsibility for themselves"" idea, but that kind of is hyperbole when ""taking responsibility"" means paying off a $12000 medical deductible on a $52000 household income, after paying $10000 per year on insurance. And if that's the case, why don't we apply that to roads? Libertarians are certain that Wal-Mart will help you pave the way from your home to the nearest Supercenter, because it's in their best interests, and it's your *responsibility* to take care of your own problems, like transportation. And healthcare. And let's talk about the fire department, shall we? Because I don't see anything in there about fire protection. You know what? Just forget about a paycheck. You work, and you can just automatically pay for all the stuff you need directly to the corporations that can supply it, after we take a cut off the top for national defense, of course. And we'll make sure that there are no protections for workers or consumers, because that just makes the stuff you're paying for more expensive, right? Yeah, that's it. Have another cup of Flavor-aid."
