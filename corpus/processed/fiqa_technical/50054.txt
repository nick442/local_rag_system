Its not a mystery what it does. Its clearly not good for society, especially in America. Any economist that is confused is not an economist but a leftist ideologue who knows enough economics terminology to persuade irrational people to support a doomed system of market interference and policies that aim at equality of outcome instead of the tried and true method of providing economic freedom and mutually beneficial (and consensual) deal-making. LOL that this is in the economics sub. Just shows how far leftist ideologies have penetrated business and government. Aren't the conservatives supposed to be the experts in business?
