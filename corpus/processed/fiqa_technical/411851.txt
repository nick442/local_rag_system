Well, I think that vba will still be maintained, but the emphasis these days is on increasing compatibility outside the traditional ms ecosystem, making development/scripting for office applications available to a broader base of coders. There's another AMA coming up in a few weeks so you can ask them there, but I don't think there's a risk of vba not being compatible in the next many years. As an alternative, you may also want to look into powerquery (the get&transform feature of '16), if you're dealing with large datasets and transformations/database-like-operations it is great and lifts the functionality of excel quite a few notches, while being much more transparent than VBA. It is being pushed heavily by Microsoft for a good reason.
