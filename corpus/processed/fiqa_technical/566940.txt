I appreciate your take, thank you for responding. Thats another thing i didnt mention; i also have several connections in the welding field that can possibly turn into lucrative careers. My cousin has his own rig and crew and makes about $90/hour welding in colorado, ive networked and met a supervisor for the local boilermakers union, and my gfs brother is a structural engineer with the railroad so i have plenty of opportunity to find work and make some money. I guess im looking a bit too far in the future with the restaurant expansion but it is in the realm of possibility once ive built up some capital. That being said, youre right. I should probably focus on welding jobs right now rather than taking a higher risk. At least until i can afford to gamble 50-100. Thanks again man!
