"I'm in agreement with what you write. I think these are good questions. From my perspective I think the staggering growth of technology is both the cause and the answer to stagnating wage/productivity increase conundrum. Today a small business will hire a secretary to use email and Excel while in 1980 they would have hired a team of accountants with piles of ledger books. We are paying less employees while accomplishing more. At the same time technology gives us all in the general public a higher standard of living through better phones, more access to cheap/free education, better health care, better infrastructure more cheaply than anyone in 1980 would have imagined. What happens when we get to the point that any person that is halfway capable and not on drugs can survive just fine in a 40 hour workweek? If we got to that point, the normal barometers of rate of growth and wage stagnation and economic mobility would flatline. There would be people happy to live a stress-free life at that baseline ""survive just fine,"" and there would be people working their butts off to acquire more than anyone might need. I think it all comes down to people wanting what someone else has and calling it unfair because they don't seem to deserve it more than anyone else. I think the real goal we should strive for is liberty and opportunity for anyone to pursue their form of improving their quality of life. Government intervention and distorted views of ""fairness"" tend to hinder that."
