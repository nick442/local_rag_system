netflix should quietly open a bunch of small, free vpn providers that aren't visibly attached to them but are marketed as a way to get better netflix streams. they could sell it even harder by having illusory competition between them. the most effective way to push back isn't to try to beat them in their own territory, it's to make them ineffective in yours.
