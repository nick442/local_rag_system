Learn to use contractions before you insult other people's intelligence. You won't get audited for use tax only, but you might get your tax filings audited. If the state audits you, they will check for online purchases on your credit card statements. I know from experience that the state of Florida put state troopers in trucking weigh stations on the interstate to look through freight bills from .com companies, gathered the delivery addresses, and audited at least some of those people. I also know North Carolina and Louisiana look for use tax dodging during a regular audit. I would urge you to think about why facts upset you to the point of name calling. It make no sense.
