Can you even answer a simple question? Economics is not game unless you're thinking playing with people lives is a game? Government saving is giving away money? What? Do you even know what saving means? Also it's not because I don't agree with you that I don't have an open mind. I go with the facts and the facts suggest you're on another planet. Going against the status quo isn't a sign of an open mind.
