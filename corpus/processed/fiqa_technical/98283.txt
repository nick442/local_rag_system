You misunderstood my post, I know how batteries recharge. [Tesla intentionally slows down how quickly the battery can be recharged if you regularly use supercharging stations](https://electrek.co/2017/05/07/tesla-limits-supercharging-speed-number-charges/) to prevent the battery pack from losing performance prematurely. This is a limitation of the batteries that are currently being produced, however solid state batteries don't appear to have these shortcomings.
