What's uninformed? I take this tone often because people who have no clue what the fuck they are talking about go off and lecture other people, bringing up facts that have no thought behind them, and are merely definitions posing as an argument. Making a statement, then getting corrected, then coming back and simply lengthening the original answer is not an argument. I'll say it again: our currency is fiat. It is backed by nothing. Through the way the national banking system is set up, the vast majority of the money supply in our country represents not only fiat entries, but also debt. If people can't understand that there are alternative systems that existed other than this, and they are fine with banking corporations having the ability to gain real assets by extending loans which are backed by money created merely by ledger entries, and only backed 10% or whatever by the deposits they have, then I don't know what to tell them. Some people just like to feel comfortable by appealing to the existing system, and you aren't going to get through to them. This site is so full of smug morons it drives me up the wall. It's why I hardly comment anymore. Pointless.
