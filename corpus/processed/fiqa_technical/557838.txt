Yes, of course there's a fundamental difference between legislation and business practices. But what you just described is the very definition of a globalist: >a person or organization advocating or practicing operations across national divisions If you talk a big game about restricting people from coming to one place, while you work a business that makes money from everyone all over the world, you're still a globalist. A true anti-globalist leader would do all of his business inside of his chosen country, and would go out of his way to not rely on external markets.
