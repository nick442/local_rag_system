"Look, the title states that the Fed signaled the economy is in trouble. It didn't. All the Fed did was release a survey. And just because their survey said Americans believe they're not better off, that doesn't mean it's their ""official"" stance on the economy. They don't believe the economy is in trouble. They believe that Americans think they're worse off than before. Those are two very different concepts; therefore, it is a very misleading title."
