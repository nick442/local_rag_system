[Evidence?](http://governmentisgood.com/articles.php?aid=17) What you are asking for is evidence based on theoreticals. You canâ€™t have that evidence unless it has actually been tried. So what you get instead is the same thing we see in Congress: a discussion of theoreticals. The biggest problem is the way we react to taxes changed based on the current circumstances we are in. Our circumstances have yet to repeat themselves. We are s relatively young country. Good luck finding evidence to support either side. Instead, look for and debate good arguments from each side.
