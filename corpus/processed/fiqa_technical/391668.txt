A company would have significantly less capital to pay a skilled worker at that point though. Keep that in mind. So, to circle back now. Small businesses make up a decent amount of our GDP and job creation. Let's say you have had it working fir someone else and want to strike out on your own. You decide to start an e-commerce site, reselling from a factory on amazon. Simple enough set up. Online marketing made simple through amazon, google and facebook. But you don't have any idea how to translate that info into QuickBooks and push out the financial info needed for taxes, payroll, etc. You need to hire a bookkeeper to sort it out, but it os only 5 hours worth of work per week. Do you hire them as a salaried employee giving them a liveable wage or pay them the rate you agreed upon for those 5 hours?
