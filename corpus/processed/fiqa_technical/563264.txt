Thanks for the reply. To answer your question, it is always preferable to be paid in advance, however how does that impact valuation in a change of control transaction. Using your airline ticket sales as an example. I buy an airline today. I get to recognize the revenue from any pre-sold tickets starting tomorrow and reduce my deferred revenue liability. However, I don't get that cash as it has already been paid to the previous owner. On the expense side I recognize the expense for the flight and have to pay the cash (fuel, staff, etc.). So even thou the accounting matches, the previous owner gets the cash gets from the presales without having to spend the cash to service those presales.
