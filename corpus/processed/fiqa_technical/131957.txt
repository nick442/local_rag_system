Are you trying to figure out if a project would increase the market value of equity? I think your issue is that the Market value of Equity will not be updated with the NPV of 40M (Assuming it is truly +, not sure if it's true with 50M of debt). EV = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash and CE Ev - Debt + Cash and CE = Market equity value. So I think you would have to update the market value of Equity up with 40M. This would then lead to EV = Equity Value + future income stream discounted + debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents.
