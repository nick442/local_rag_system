"This is colloquially referred to as a ""pump and dump"" scheme. You basically buy up some stock, and then try to pump up the demand through false and misleading positive statements and market activity. You then close your position once market interest is sufficiently high. If your firm has access to high frequency trading mechanisms, you may even be able to front run other market participants attracted by your buying activities. >I am wondering what is the best route to go down. Definitely micro-cap stocks. Things listed on the OTC markets, especially penny stocks, have this tendency to attract retail buyers just begging to be scammed. Emerging biotech firms also have a lot of potential due to investors' hopes of successful clinical trials. I should warn you though, this is very illegal and falls under market manipulation [according to the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerspumpdumphtm.html) and can lead to up to 25 years in prison. So make sure you stay small enough to avoid the regulatory radar. (But seriously, this belongs in r/personalfinance or elsewhere, r/finance isn't the sub you want)."
