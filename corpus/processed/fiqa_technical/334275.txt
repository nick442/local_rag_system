I'm going have to go with a gigantic FALSE for the PS3 and PSVita. While the Vita hasn't done as well as projected, it's still doing relatively well. Ever since Sony launched the original PS3 Slim, the PS3 has outsold the 360 and over took the 360's market share. [Source](http://www.vgchartz.com/article/250111/2012-year-on-year-sales-and-market-share-update-to-april-21st/). Nintendo is a juggernaut and the Wii was targeted towards a COMPLETELY different demographics than the PS3, so the only direct competitor to the PS3 would be the 360. However, for underperforming, the PSVita still managed to take nearly a 30% chunk out of the 3DS' market share within a year. I'm not going to comment on Sony's other product lines because I don't have the data on them, but as far as the Playstation brand goes, they're doing considerably well since they debuted the Slim, and over the lifetime of the systems, the PS3 only trails the 360 by 9/10s of a percent of market share. That is remarkable considering the 360 had a year's jump on the PS3 and dominated the PS3 for the first three years of it's life. Again, here's the [source](http://www.vgchartz.com/article/250111/2012-year-on-year-sales-and-market-share-update-to-april-21st/) for all of the above. For their smartphones, I will say that, while they have horrible market share, they could still be a viable player with a few small changes. They do support AOSP already, so by being practically the first OEM to go pure AOSP for their Android smartphones could give them a significant boost. Add to that a potential Sony Nexus Play, and they could easily get caught up to LG and HTC. I'm not foolish enough to think that they can compete with Samsung Mobile in the near future, but they could still make a significant comeback in the next 12-24 months rather easily.
