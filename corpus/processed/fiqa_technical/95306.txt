Breaking up these dominant companies would be very different from industrial monopolies in the past. These tech companies provide a service, which is not measurable like other goods. Therefore it’s difficult to estimate the rents that consumers pay. Facebook for example get their revenue from selling user data and providing ad space, would a forced competition reduce the ads that we see? In the case of Google, I think there’s also many synergies within the different services. Breaking up these companies might not have a consumer welfare increasing effect.
