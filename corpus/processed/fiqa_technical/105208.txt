Networking encompasses many types of devices and there are now better or cheaper competitors to Cisco in each category. Off the top of my head there's Juniper and Huawei for routers and switches, Palo Alto Networks for firewalls, and F5 and Citrix Netscalers for load balancing. Physical gear aside, more and more networking functionality can be handled through software instead of dedicated hardware as well. Companies like Facebook and Google design their own networking equipment and have it contract-built as well. There's also a war going on between the old guard enterprise tech companies where they're poaching each others territory in search of growth. Cisco makes (good but pricey) blade servers while HP makes networking equipment, etc. Cisco's far from dead but they're no longer a growth company and need to stay nimble if they want to survive. Fortunately they do seem to understand the current environment and announcements like this should ensure their future.
