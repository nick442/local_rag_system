Lotteries and casinos have standards on their rates of failure, though. They're actual gambling, and heavily regulated. An MLM actively sells to you an idea of success that's completely unreasonable. Also, people that are investing are given all the information. If a broker behaved like one of these MLM people they'd be investigated for fraud.
