Probably more like ELI10. Bob gets 10$ a week in lunch money from his parents. Jim's dad works as a travelling salesman and makes a fixed salary plus a weekly commission, jim gets 5$ in allowance + whatever extra his dad makes, some weeks 20$ some 5$ some 7. So Jim wants to make his allowance a bit more constant and bob wants a piece of the commission. Mathematically: Bob's allowance = 10$/week Jim's allowance = 5$ + C / week C is unknown. So they make a deal. Jim will receive 5$ from Bob every week. In return Jim will pay bob the extra allowance every week. The new deal is Bob = 5$ + C Jim = 10$ How they get to this arrangement is every week they sit at the lunch table. Bob takes out 5$, jim takes out his extra commission. They net the amount and pay whomever profits.
