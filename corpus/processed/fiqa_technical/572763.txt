We were booming for 5 years straight. We netted 2 million one year and the rest 1.5 million. I fired my office manager with a 2 week notice. Trying to be nice giving him a 2 week notice rather than throw him out. He went behind my back and ruined all my relationships with my customers and partnerships with other companies. I had to start at square one. I went from making theses 7 figure incomes to scraping by. Most of my money is invested into real estate so I didn't wanna sell right away. It was a good move I contacted my old clients some understood some wanted nothing to do with me. I started taking the shitty jobs no one wanted. I was running around all over trying to get as much work as possible. Now I'm not back to 7 figures but I hit a comfortable 200k net-income. I'm slowly getting back up there it's been 3 years. You just have to keep pushing and keep an open mind. Don't make the same mistake twice.
