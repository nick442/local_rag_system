I just started in ER a month ago - I think part of it is being in the right place at the right time because the industry is smaller than IB (less positions, less openings). I came from an accounting background and during the interview process I really sold how much I enjoyed investing personally (knew the fundamentals, had decent stock picks/pitches), which happened to be what the hiring managers were looking for. Hope this helps and happy to answer any other questions you might have!
