Regulation is necessary for preserving competition. Regulatory capture is the problem. Capitalism is all about efficiency, costs are very similar for all participants, so if you're more efficient than your competitors you gain market share (even if that means marketing or lobbying efficiency). Monopolies, cartels are always natural attractors for markets, and with serious barriers to entry (infrastructure by its nature is very much about network effects overcharged by economies of scale gains) it's not much of a surprise that we're in the current situation even after Ma' Bell got split up. Or, you can go for the maximum property rights libertarianism, but then you are very much in the danger of getting eaten by marketing-fanaticized big-estate zombies. (Since people are not to be trusted even basic acceptance and coordination of property rights is/would be difficult, and with increasing craziness in the wilderness your security insurance premium would go up until you just can't afford it anymore. That's why I'm a bit afraid of all out anarchy as touted on AnCap subreddits.)
