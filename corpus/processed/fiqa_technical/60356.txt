"Companies ""make"" sales. The receivable from those sales are typically and commonly referred to as *""money""*. In that respect, when a company makes sales, they make money. Whether or not they are realizing a profit from those sales, is entirely different. There's a huge distinction between a company that is generating no sales, and a company that is generating no profit."
