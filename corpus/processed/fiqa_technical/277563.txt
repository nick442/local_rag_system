"Let's say you bank with Ally bank - one of the largest online banks in the US. First, find out what your daily purchase limit is on your debit card, for Ally bank it is $5000, but you can call them and request a one-time extension. Then: You walk into a bank, any bank or credit union; you don’t need an account there. You tell the teller: “I’d like to take a cash advance against my Visa card.” (or MasterCard, if your debit card is a MasterCard)"" Don’t mention it’s a debit card. You will only confuse them. As long as the card carries a Visa or MasterCard logo, they will do it the same way whether it’s credit or debit. They will ask for your ID. Then they will run your card on a terminal. It’s very similar to how you swipe your card when you buy something at a store. You sign the slip before they give you the cash. You can think of a cash advance as buying cash."
