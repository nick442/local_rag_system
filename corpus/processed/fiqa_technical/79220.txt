"This would be on your credit for ~8 years. If it goes according to your plan, it will take 6 months to a year to do the settlement by getting behind enough to let it go to collections and then settling. The write-off will then be on your credit record for 7 years before it ""falls off"". Your cash out refinance would have to cover you for at least the next 8 years to be valuable. And you have a lot of assumptions to get there: In short, there's one way (or only a few ways) this works out well in your favor. There are many ways that this has the chance to hurt you. I don't like ""investments"" with those kind of odds."
