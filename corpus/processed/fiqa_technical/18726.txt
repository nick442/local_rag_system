Really? Care to back up your claim there? Most employers are looking for MBAs. Please explain why - although the competition is doing EXACTLY THAT! you wouldn't want to be on the same level. I got it dude, you may have graduated a few years back (like me) when things were different and they wanted experience first, but that's not the case today. Things have changed, and every Tom, Dick, and Harry has an MBA, so if you don't have one, it's kind of like not having any education. Remember how it used to work if you didn't have a Bachelor's? Same for an MBA these days.
