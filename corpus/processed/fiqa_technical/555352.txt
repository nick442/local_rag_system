"> Ultimately though learning how to stand up for your self What you said is very contradictory. If you learn new ways to behave, and you accept what you are taught, then you do not stand up for yourself. If you learn new ways to behave, and you don't accept them, then you stand up for yourself. If you learn new ways to behave, different than what you accepted in the past, then you may stand up for yourself. Standing up for yourself is done mostly in a non ""respectful way"". Actually, if you find yourself to have to stand up for yourself, it's done always in a non respectful way, whether mildly or not mildly at all. The bottom line: schools need to teach knowledge and professional behavior and not go to the business of social and political engineering as it's always done in a non respectful way by professors who stand up, not for themselves, but for their political and social agenda."
