"Your contributions must come from ""compensation"". Quoting IRS Publication 590 on IRAs, ""Generally, compensation is what you earn from working."" So it is unlikely that your stock sale proceeds, if they're your sole source of income, can be used to fund your IRA. If you do have W-2 income, or self employment income, you can use the proceeds of a stock sale to fund an IRA. The IRS doesn't care where the exact dollars that go into the IRA come from, only that you earned (from working) at least as much as you contributed."
