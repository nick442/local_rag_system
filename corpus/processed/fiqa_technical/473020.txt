Nobody owes anyone else a living, or preservation of a business model. [Creative destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction) is good for progress. Note that it is already the case that physical retailers charge less online for picking up the exact same item in the same store. For example Walmart will sell you an iPod touch for $189 for same day instore pickup, but if you walked into the store and bought it from the shelves they charge $199. I don't use Amazon because I'm probably one of the only honest Californians and don't want the hassle of working out use taxes. If Amazon did collect sales tax I would consider them. The correct solution is of course to get rid of sales tax everywhere as it imposes a huge burden to collect and is [regressive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_tax).
