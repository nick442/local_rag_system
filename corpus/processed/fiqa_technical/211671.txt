Hot damn, I wish there were more democrat assholes that would happily announce they'll fire people if Romney goes into office, because neither really affects their business at all. Actually, Romney would be worse, because he wants to make it illegal to discriminate and illegal to have a waiting period but also not require people to buy insurance. I will wait until I get sick to buy insurance, then cancel right after I'm well. It'll be really cheap and mean I pay in less (and so will everyone else, because it would be fiscally stupid to not do it) than I take from the pool.
