There is a lot to it then that. I personally reject the idea of eating food that has been genetically modified. I also don't approve of the fact that farmers are not allowed to re-plant the seeds they get from the GMO-germinated plants. What also scares me is that one of the provisions of the TPP is to allow a company like Syngenta (or Dow, or Monsanto) to sue the Chinese government because it doesn't want to deal with GMOs.
