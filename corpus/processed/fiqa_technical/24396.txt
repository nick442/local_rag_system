I think it will be some time before we see the full effect this legislation will have on the overall markets. Insurance, as an industry is a tricky beast. Logically speaking for an industry outsider it may make sense that with more customers the insurance industry will mak emore money but, in actuality many people who could not previously get insurance are going to be getting insurance. What this means is that though the insurance companies will have more clients thier costs are likely to go up substantially. Which in turn will create downward pressure on profits and as a result stock prices.
