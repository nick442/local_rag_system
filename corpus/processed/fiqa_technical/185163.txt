What?! At that level of military, nearly everything that person does is through email (at least, in the Army, it is). I was enlisted, but for a couple years they put me at division level. Working with a 1-star, 2-star, and half a dozen full birds and sergeant majors, I can tell you every. thing. is done through email. Even though these people are in the same building, they're emailing each other constantly and passing docs back and forth. Maybe Navy admirals don't get much official mail, I don't know. But it definitely wasn't like that in the Army.
