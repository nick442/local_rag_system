I'm not pointing specifically to category 5 hurricanes, more that they are becoming increasingly common and powerful as time goes on. Additionally, most of these climate change issues are exponential, and so it may not seem like a significant change in the last 20 years but it points to a larger trendline that is disturbing. When it comes to sea level changes, it's not about the last 8,000 years. It comes down to polar ice caps melting at ever-increasing speeds, which will hit us quickly and harshly.
