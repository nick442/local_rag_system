"Assuming this is real, the Q's (QQQ) is an ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100. It would be the approximate equivalent of saying ""Just put your money in SPY"" or any other ETF. I didn't see the thread in question (looks like it was in /r/personalfinance not /r/finance; so, not the ""rules"" here), but my guess is people down voted you (and you were eventually removed by the mod) for ""low effort"", which simply stating ""Put your money in an ETF"" could possibly be construed as. That said, the top rated comment in that thread *did* suggest putting some portion of the funds in an ETF, it's just rarely an appropriate answer for *all* of someone's investment capital."
