Nah, that's just opinion. The benefits far outweigh the detriments. So far, I don't see anyone panicking with sea level rise. We just spent 62 billion rebuilding New Jersey, RIGHT BACK ON THE SHORELINE. Those are way in the future problems. Right now we are just seeing benefits. More superstorms? You mean more category 5 hurricanes. Probably, but nothing to worry about. But, please, show me some long term scientific data that says we ARE having more category 5 hurricanes. Back to sea level rise. Read this chart. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise#mediaviewer/File:Post-Glacial_Sea_Level.png See how in the last 8000 years there is hardly any change at all. The earth goes through shift of 120 meters in glacier cycles and you're worried about 6 inches in a hundred years?
