"IT actually doesn't have the issue with the charg enumber thing because the Manhour allocation charge covers IT support so we don't bill our time out. It is mostly just people who work direct for projects that pull the ""give me a charge number"" business. Also, it isn't everyone either. Mostly just the douchebags. Additionally, a department policy like you suggest actually sounds like a great Idea. I think I like you. However, in a company our size, it would get abused more than it would be respected. Great programs and policies like that always get bombed in my company because of a a 20% group of dickbags."
