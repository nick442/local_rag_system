"Clear malice? lol The article isn't even about ""the market"" it is about the economy. The article is about how GDP growth is not looking that great. The stock market can go up for reasons that have nothing to do with a good economy. If investors believe Trump will cut corporate taxes, stocks should rise, because an investor will make more money when the company pays less in taxes. Stock prices have gone up, but the economy isn't looking great."
