>However, recently a new government law was enacted stating that to bid on the contract, the CEO of the bidding company must be a woman or minority. What country? What law? Not the U.S., that's for sure. >Despite doing the best job at the best price for years, my company was banned from bidding because our CEO is a white male. Sounds like legally enforced racism to me. Imagine if a company was banned from working for the government only because their CEO were black. Well then it is a good thing there are so few companies with a black or woman CEO. Any idea why that might be? >Is there anything that can be done? I mean, isn't this legally enforced discrimination? I think the technical term is bullshit: a statement made with utter disregard for whether it is true or not.
