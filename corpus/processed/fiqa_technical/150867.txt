I agree with a lot of what you said, and I know a great many esteemed economists are trying to point the big finger of blame at the rating agencies who could have and should have scrutinized what they were evaluating as opposed to capitulating because of cash. However, you did not mention leveraging. Leveraging, when left unchecked becomes very dangerous. Although you have an opportunity to make far more than the initial investment would supply without the added leverage, any loss becomes exponentially more devastating, and quickly your loss from this one transaction is more than your initial investment. Not to mention when everyone finds out, and nobody wants to buy the bullshit funds you were peddling, and you can't repay the person who gave you leverage....then kabbboooom
