All fair points, and I agree that there is no silver bullet. Perhaps it's human nature, maybe a product of our polarized ideologies, whatever, but I think you hit it on the head when you said that people treat their agenda as a perfect solution when, in reality, there is no such thing. Automation will kill jobs, livable wage is variable, not everyone fits a uniform mold, and conversely, not every business operates the same; some are completely profit-driven, others are more conscious of their societal obligations regardless of legal requirement, so shoehorning all businesses into the same obligations seems like a losing battle as well. If the long-term data backs up the finding that higher minimum wages kill jobs at a disproportionate rate when accounting for factors like automation, then the evidence should be heeded. Conversely, I do believe that we will reach a point, possibly even in this lifetime, where so much automation exists, there will be fewer and fewer opportunities to 'get your foot in the door' or things of that nature and a universal basic income will be needed. How that is paid for, what the societal and social implications are, those are questions for another day, but that day is also fast approaching.
