Again, you have completely failed to grasp willingness to pay as an Economic concept, viewing it instead through the lense of your personal feelings. A wealthy man has more money to spend on protecting his life, therefore in purely concrete terms an Economist would say he has a higher willingness to pay. An idiot would make a value assessment based on the moral equivalency of a wealthy mans life to a poor mans life, fundamentally ignoring the important observation that a wealthy man will pay more than a poor man. We're modeling behavior here, we're not sorting souls. Thats far above our paygrade as mortals.
