How would you even go about firing someone for voting? You couldn't possibly know how they voted -or *if* they voted. No, no, you'd have to fire them because their political opinions led to irreconcilable differences in the operations of the company. Doesn't seem to be any law against that. Anyway, all that is just foolishness. Why bring up politics at all? You just take mental notes, wait a while, then lay them off at the end of the next quarter. Problem solved.
