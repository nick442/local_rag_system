The two terms seem to be used interchangeably. Even the IRS' website uses them interchangeably from one sentence to the next (emphasis mine): Many 401(k) plans allow employees to make a hardship withdrawal because of immediate and heavy financial needs. Generally, hardship distributions from a 401(k) plan are limited to the amount of the employees' elective contributions only .. It might a difference in perspective: The account holder withdraws the money, but the fund manager distributes it. Another way to look at it would be for cases that are only in transition to another tax-advantaged account. You can withdraw the money without it becoming a taxable distribution if you get it into another tax-advantaged account within a certain time limit.
