We moved and decided to drop cable a few years ago. I haven't really missed it at all. I also don't pirate anything. I imagine people willing to pirate have absolutely no problem dropping cable TV. The *only* thing I miss is my hometown sports. I can't always get them over the air. The thing is that it is a redundant system. It is a less appealing information delivery system. Why would I pay for internet service and a worse, time restricted service? It is one of the reasons I think that Netflix's move to original content is smart. I pay a small price for quality content that just uses the best information delivery system I have. Honestly, I suspect that phone service (even mobile) is going to head in that direction too.
