"You will definitely want to look into odd jobs, if possible. I'm sure this sounds patronizing, but the biggest problem you have right now is your credit card debt, most likely at very high interest rates. You said you have enough to ""make your payments"", but you didnt specify what that meant. Are you making the minimum payments only? If you're only making the minimum payments, you'll want to really find SOME way to scrounge even an extra $50 together each month (odd jobs specifically. You might also want to try mturk, where you get paid to fill out surveys). You see, by making only the minimum payment, you are actually probably only putting a few dollars at all to principal. Most of the rest went to last month's interest charges. The best thing to do is lay out each card and what the interest rate is. You have 9 of them, so this seems like a bit of a task. The first step is to identify which card has the HIGHEST interest rate. There are two things you can do then. You either throw every extra penny you have at that specific card, OR, you find some way to move that balance to your LOWEST interest rate card. In all cases, your goal is to move debt from the high-interest rate cards to the low interest rate cards. Once you can't move debt around anymore, your goal then is to pay only the minimums on all the low-interest rate cards, and put EVERY SINGLE SPARE PENNY you have towards the higher ones. If you don't mind me asking, can you outline all 9 cards and how much you owe on each, adn what each's interest rate is? It's possible you don't know, and that's problem one. If you don't know the interest rate of each card, then you don't even really know which card you should be paying off first. Edit: How miuch do you spend on food a month? If you were really really determined to get over this, you'd basically just eat rice and beans, or buy nearly-bad bananas and eggs. These are the cheapest foodstuffs you can find."
