Government subsidies could be provided if we could all agree what activities are of higher social worth, this is not an insurmountable obstacle. For example, in Hong Kong and Singapore civil servants are paid vastly more than in the US. The reasons are that society wants to attract some of its best people to serve in these positions, and they want to insulate them from the temptation of corruption. In effect, these positions are considered to be of high social worth and society rewards them accordingly. Also note that HK and Singapore have even freer capitalist market societies than the US (speaking of economic freedom here)..
