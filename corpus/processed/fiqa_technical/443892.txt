You're assuming the Supreme Court will take this case, they may not. Uber is a private company, it doesn't need to follow the Constitution. The Constitution places a limitation on what the government can do, not private companies (as long as they are operating in a lawful manner). No one is forcing you to use Uber, if you don't want to sign away your right to sue, don't use Uber. It's as simple as that.
