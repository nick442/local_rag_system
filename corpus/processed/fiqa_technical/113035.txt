There were a lot of people that didn't vote for him that still supported him (my father lives in an incredibly conservative area and knew the electoral votes there would go to Trump, so why he didn't feel like wasting his time, for example). Polls that aim to deduce national approval have settled around a 30% approval rating (maybe they will go lower), which means, for now at least, he has the support of around 1 in 3 citizens.
