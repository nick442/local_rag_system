"Yeah, I don't think anyone is suggesting you'll be able to print an entire car and drive it off the lot any time soon. What *could* be done, however, is printing any number of odd one-off parts on the scene. These are the kind of parts that evoke the ""sorry, we don't have that in stock, but I can order it.."" replies you seem to hear everywhere these days. With a combination of a 3D milling machine for metals and a 3D printer for odd shapes, you can make a large variety of parts that functions *equivalently*, even if the replacement differs in appearance or construction. For most people just trying to get a broken thing functional again, that won't matter much, if at all."
