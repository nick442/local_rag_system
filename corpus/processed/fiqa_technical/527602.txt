Regardless of your thoughts on what was happening in late 2012, financial prices should not be used as the sole barometer of a recovery..this is why the Fed uses tons of macroeconomic data, not just that BAC has been up 20% in the last 6 months. My point is if you are going to tout what seems to be a market timing model, where the authors are proud of the fact that the entire thing is data mined, you need strong out of sample evidence (over a few business cycles) that it works. Nothing here comes close
