"I suspect that to ""make money"" it isn't enough to know the current value (""high currency""): to make money you'd need to know/guess/predict/bet on the future change in value: will the currency value go higher in the future? Or will it come down again? Or will it stay the same? Everybody knows the current value, so that by itself isn't enough knowledge to make money from. That said, if you know you're going to need American dollars in the future (if you have future expenses which need to be paid in American dollars), then now might be a good time to buy those dollars."
