You're mistaking random chance with luck. I did absolutely everything I could think of to maximize my chances and I deserve the credit for it. There may have been some element of random chance, but I'd say I reduced the odds of getting a full time job out of college from 1:4 to 1:1 at least. Others with the same opportunities as me do not. Time and time again I see college grads doing nothing but sending out resumes. It just won't work on its own, you have to work every angle.
