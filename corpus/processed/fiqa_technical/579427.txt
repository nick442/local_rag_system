It seems outsourcing tech usually turns out to be a disaster for most companies in the long term, and yet they keep on trying it because it appears to save money in the short term. My last two jobs were helping re-write code completely from scratch because they used outsourced programmers and the code was so horrible that none of it was worth saving. As someone else mentioned here, it's entirely possible there are some good coders in these developing countries. But they seem to be very rare. More typically, they lack knowledge modern coding standards and practices. And even if they are good programmers, the lack of direct in-person communication results in a mess anyway.
