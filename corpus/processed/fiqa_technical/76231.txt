Thing is, it's not exceptions we're talking about, it's the rule. This 1 million average is skewed due to top 4-5% students who go on and become top executives and earn hundreds of billions of dollars in their lifetimes, while 90% of the rest do not justify the investment in their overpriced education. 90% are not the exception, *they* are the rule. Plus, the examples I gave are based on rough calculations, and anyone can play with their specific numbers. Even then, it's already hard to see how huge differentials you must reach to pay for your investment. You can look at university sites for hard data - for MBA average starting salary goes from 140K before to 149K after, at one university I looked to apply for. These 9K are nice, esp. for a 1 year of income forgone, but then again, 80K tuition is also not something you come across easy, most likely you need to calculate interest as well on those. + living expenses, books. The mind-boggling thing for me is that people going into universities do it just automatically, just because that's what they think they should do. They don't even do a back of the envelope calculation if it's worth it. That's what more surprising and worrying for me, to be honest.
