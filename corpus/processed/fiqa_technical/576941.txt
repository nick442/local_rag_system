That this comment got voted up proves to me that r/econ is filled with a bunch of idiots. Technological advances (productivity) means we should all have more than we did 30 years ago. People SHOULD be able to make the EXACT same amount of money (adjusted for inflation) and have the exact same lifetyle AND have acomputer vs having an Atari in the 70s. Our society can produce a computer easier than we could make an Atari back then. But that isn't what happened. People barely have the same conveniences (just more advanced versions) and cannot afford MUCH more expensive things that people took for granted in the 70s. My factory worker father, on one income, bought a $1000 stereo. new clothes for 2 kids every year for school. Plenty of food. A car. A house. A Beta VCR that cost $400 in *1980*. Today people buy a dvd player for $80 and you say we are doing just as well? We had health insurance and never even thought about it. Now people cant afford homes or health insurance, but the problem si that we have .. yearly vacations to europe. You obviously have no idea how the middle class lives in the US, do you?
