I'm 23 and working in finance after graduating with a degree in finance from University of Wisconsin. I can tell you that you that if you work hard to get relevant internships during the summer months between semesters, you won't have any issues getting a job in finance. However, if you decide to go the computer science route (like my two roommates did), you won't have any troubles finding a job. However, you will have way more opportunities to choose from if you have relevant internship experience. Long story short, work hard to get a good GPA and line up internships for the summer, but you should also make sure that you're having fun during the school year.
