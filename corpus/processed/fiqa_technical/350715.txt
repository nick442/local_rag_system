Uber truly is awesome. Think about how many people Uber home from the bar instead of driving home drunk. Think about how much of a pain in the ass it was to call different taxi companies, stay on the phone, and order a taxi for pickup at a certain time. And then you needed to have cash on you to pay the guy. Now you can connect with a driver who picks you up in a nice new car and you can watch in real time as he picks you up. Badass. My life is way better now with ride sharing, and Uber has been willing to take on massive losses year after year for the customers' benefit.
