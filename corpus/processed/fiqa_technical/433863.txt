Right, but doesn't this apply to the owner operators too? Meaning, the drivers that only occasionally get work from either company? That does hurt, when those drivers operate low margin trips and the fewer high profit trips (typically seasonal or situational) from the big companies make their year. Walmart won't get their way at scale, and even then this type of policy is not an impasse, but is only a temporary roadblock until the market moves around them.
