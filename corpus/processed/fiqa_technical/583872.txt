"I took it a few months ago. Overall - just doing the practice/sample questions is pretty sufficient. If you don't know much about IB, I doubt it's worth your time to go out and ""study"" it before the test. The problem with the BAT is that you can't contact companies thru Bloomberg. You just make a profile, and if an employer is searching for someone that matches you (including your BAT score), then they contact you."
