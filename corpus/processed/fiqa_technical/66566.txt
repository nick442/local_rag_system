My one beef with this article is that the author seems quite sympathetic to the company, and does little to acknowledge the actual harm done to the plaintiff (apart from the factual description of his claim). Nonetheless, I thought this was worth sharing, and I'll highlight this part from near the bottom: > Although the Minnesota statute at issue in Vaidyanathan is unique, other similar causes of action, such as common law fraud and negligent representation, are available throughout the country, meaning that any employee or applicant can bring a lawsuit against an employer claiming that the employer made misrepresentations about the material terms or conditions of employment and/or fraudulently induced the individual to accept the position.
