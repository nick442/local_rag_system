>Basically the banks (Countrywide was the worst about this) failed to uphold lending standards when they were giving out mortgages because it wasn't in their self-interest Is there such thing as lending standards? As in by law or by regulations? (Not ethics) As far as I know the major regulations banks have to follow are the capital ratio requirements (Basel I,II) and the min 4% leverage ratio (FDICA). I'm assuming the banks kept to the ratios by keeping illiquid securitised loans off their balance sheet. >after the banks would give someone a mortgage the banks would make their fees off the mortgage and then bundle these mortgages into securities. The banks then had these sub-prime mortgages that are now bundled together as securities, From my understanding the bank did originate the loan, and they will assign this loan to a trust fund who will securitise the loans into CDOs or mortgage backed securities. I have 2 questions from this: 1) What is wrong with this and 2) if it is unethical or greedy, what can be done to solve this? Stop them from securitising these loans? Wouldn't that destroy the reinsurance market? >then Moody's/S&P and other ratings agencies gave them AAA ratings despite nearly everyone in the industry knowing they were time-bombs waiting to go off. Goldman Sachs and everyone else knew what was going on, but they didn't want to get stuck holding the bag, per se, so they committed fraud by knowingly misleading their clients to buy these securities. So the responsibility lies more with these guys then? Goldman Sachs were the ones committing fraud and now the SEC is going after Fannie and Freddie. The banks didn't break any laws or regulations.
