Because people who work with practical skills work for their own means, and not for corporations. The banks are HEAVILY invested in Corporations. The banks are also HEAVILY invested in debt. Our entire system is orchestrated by the banks. They want a workforce that is highly specialized and in debt- this ensures that they are entirely dependent on Corporate jobs for money to pay debts and on big agro for their food.. It's all a trap. Any one want to blow off the Corporations and go live/work directly for our own needs on a homestead/commune farm?
