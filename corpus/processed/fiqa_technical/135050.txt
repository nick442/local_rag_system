It's two things. One, hg Tv is reality television.. It isn't real, never has been, never will be. It sells the 80s American dream. Two, cost of living and relative wage varies across regions. E. G. The big mac effect. Bigger question, in my opinion, is why do we care? I'm not a hippy, check my history, but my wife and I very recently downsized, with kids on the way. And it's fine. We went for a smaller home in a safer area with better schools. Couldn't be happier.
