We're pretty small about 20 employees. He refuses to allow me to get a second office person claiming he does not get along with other people. The issue is I've had him for such a long time I don't wanna break an 8 year employer relationship over something like that. I also believe there are ways around money tracking. For example he can add extra hours on employee time sheets and have it cashed and then keep the extra money after employees are paid. He always puts emphasis on how much good he does for the company when he's just doing his job. I'm looking for any kind of bait I can throw or some kind of trick. My friend was telling me what he did is give his employee an unexpected paid vacation and she had no time to cover her trail. Are there other things like this I can try?
