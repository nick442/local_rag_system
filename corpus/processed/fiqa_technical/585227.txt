> There is only so much to go around and as the top 1% pulls more and more of it off, it leaves less for the rest That is incorrect. The more we produce, the bigger the pie gets for everyone, as long as people are allowed to freely trade for the goods and services that they want. The people that become very wealthy don't get that way by stockpiling their money. They get that way by investing. People are given an opportunity to create new ventures because of investors. What I would like is for more people to be empowered through economic knowledge. I was never taught basic principles growing up and after learning on my own, I must admit, I'm a little vindictive about that. If people can learn the value of saving and investing their money and not making stupid financial decisions, they will be much better off.
