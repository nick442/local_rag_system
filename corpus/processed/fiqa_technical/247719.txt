Not the guy you asked, but I'll answer anyway. Each of us has to decide what is most important to us. If it's money, you wouldn't be asking. If it's being a respectable person with integrity, then you must accept that all things have a price. The good part about sacrificing quick money to maintain integrity is that your name and brand will grow in value as a result. Build your reputation for quality and honesty and reap the benefits over time. They will come. Do not compromise your integrity, because once it is damaged it is very hard to repair it.
