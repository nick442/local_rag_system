Agreed my friend, and the UK is the country that is the furthest away from the European reality. You have schools charging 1 to 8k for a full years tuition. I know a case of someone having to sell his home to afford a top MBA in Europe (obviously it paid off), which goes to show how hard for europeans it is to afford US prices for education, meanwhile in the US they just hand it over to you. The problem comes when the Navients of the world come knocking on your door and you can't even save a penny
