"give up nuclear weapons and then, its game over for the Pakistani people. What exactly does this look like? ""the United States would have attacked Pakistan a long time ago."" What, like those constant drone strikes raining down on Pakistan for years? Look, Hitler McJewhater, sure, Pakistan has a few nukes. I don't think they have an exit strategy to use them effectively in a military action. Like North Korea, they would be effectively annihilated before the first mushroom cloud cleared."
