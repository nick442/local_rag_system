>Going to have to stop you right there. Most Fortune 500 companies pay a LOT of tax. Additionally, they get targeted for audits quite a bit because of their size and complexity. But at the end of the day, if it shows a net profit on their income statement, they're generally paying tax. True, but they make an effort to create a structure that compartmentalizes profits and maximizes expense. Income tax is a real thing, but it's not the primary vehicle of taxation that some people think it it. They pay more in other taxes, like payroll, social security and other kinds of tax. >A progressive scale for capital gains will just lead to high-income individuals transferring the form of income to something else. You're probably right.
