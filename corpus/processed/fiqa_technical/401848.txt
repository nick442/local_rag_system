"I can't speak for Canada but in the US banks and other financial industry firms will lobby the SEC to some extent over proposed regulations. Basically any time the SEC proposes a regulation they have a period where anyone, including financial firms, can comment on it via letters. The purpose here is for the regulators to get different perspectives on the regulation to help them shape rules that go far enough to protect investors but don't go so far as to over burden or harm the industries they're regulating. Now obviously this can be a problem largely because financial firms of course are always going to be opposed to new extensive regulations but also because more often than not few investors/members of the public actually comment so the SEC gets a LOT more comments from the industry. The SEC frequently treats the volume of comments almost like ""votes"" so in return the massive volume of industry comments tends to shape their proposed regulations towards being more industry friendly. You can see this in action as a huge majority of revisions to proposed regulation is use to water down the proposed rules. All in all, industry members lobbying and working with their regulators isn't inherently bad, after all these are the people/firms that know the industry best and so their feedback is valuable and can truly help regulators to make more efficient and effective rules but it certainly can be excessive and will undoubtedly cause bad optics."
