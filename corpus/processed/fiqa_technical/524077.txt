Ashwagandha is biologically known as Withania somnifera. It is a shrub, normally found everywhere in India especially in the northwestern part of the sub continent, but is nowadays cultivated in fields because of its great commercial demand. Ashwagandha restores vitality and has an effect on the libido. The herb is bitter in taste, aphrodisiac, germicidal and diuretic.
