Hello Ms./Mr. , My name is someguy82 and I'm a fellow alumnus of xxxxxx University - class of 20xx. I hope you don't mind, but I got your email address through the alumni network at xxxxxx University. I am interested in hearing about how you have progressed in your professional life since xxxxxx University/current role/etc. I would love to know more about your current work in financial services/investments/etc. I am sure that you must have a very busy schedule, so I can assure you I won't take up more of your time than you are willing or able to give. If you're free I can meet you for coffee/lunch near your work/building. I hope to hear from you soon! Kind Regards, someguy82
