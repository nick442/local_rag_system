What secular religious wannabe non-sense. Sure some things are random and you have the same chance as the next guy all other things considered equal, but the chances of all other things being equal is nil to zero. Luck is an illusion of probability, and it's better to shape those odds in your own favor than not. You say as much in your post, so why even argue with me about it?
