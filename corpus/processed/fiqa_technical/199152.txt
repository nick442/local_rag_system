Mind if I ask you a little bit about what you do? Such as: job title, what time you hit your desk, what a typical day schedule looks like, interactions with clients, relationships with superiors? I just graduated with a bachelor's in finance from DePaul in Chicago and am still looking for a job. No bluntwraps for me until I get my career haha
