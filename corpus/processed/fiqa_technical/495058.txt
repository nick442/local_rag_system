"That's, in part, a business urban legend at this point. There were lay-offs under Jack, but it wasn't the 10% least effective that they claim. Those people might just not get a raise. We're so far removed from that business environment that it has gone beyond obnoxious and into ""quaint"" territory. GE suffers from a major gap in mid career experts. They can't retain younger people, and their older people are retiring. GE keeps operating like there's a big carrot keeping people working there, except there isn't anymore. The health care plans have been gutted, the advancement opportunities have been gutted, the compensation is sub standard, etc. So people leave after they get what they want out of the company. GE doesn't even need to lay people off if reducing their work force is really their goal. Just freeze hiring, wait a couple years, and they'll get the numbers in attrition. This is just more ""meet the quarterly numbers"" nonsense with no long term sustainable strategy. Rebranding existing projects as ""Digital"" isn't going to make the company more competitive or save it from falling further and further behind as their knowledge and experience walk out the door."
