Sure, the bible says you should stone gays. Do you see a bunch of people stoning gays? No. But the Koran's peeps, well, they're acting out the Koran's commands to the T. Did you read any of that link on the Koran, or do you need me to cut and paste some of the verses? I think you will find them interesting unless your mind is closed off. Is racist your favorite word?
