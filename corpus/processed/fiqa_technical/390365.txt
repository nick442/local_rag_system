Humans are not innately evil and manipulative creatures that try to screw others over. We just happen to live in an economic system that disproportionately rewards those willing to do those behaviors with money and power. People using the human nature argument are just trying to make themselves feel better for supporting an exploitative economic system. A form of self validation.
