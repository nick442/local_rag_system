Sure it is quite easy depending on income. If one receives a bonus that is high in relationship to their income, it is very easy to max out a 401K prior to when one intended. The later in the year such a bonus occurs the more likely that one will max out prematurely. If one only has a single employer in the year, the custodial company will not accept amounts above the max, so one need not worry about that case. If there is more than one employer, a refund is typically issued with the appropriate tax withheld. Assume that a person makes about 60K per year. They intend to put 12k into their 401K, thus have their contribution set to 20%. By the beginning of September, they have 8K into their retirement, but they also receive a bonus of 50K. Their 401K contribution for that bonus will be 10K, and thus they have maxed out their individual contribution for the year. So they will not be able to contribute for the rest of the year, including the first paycheck in September. They will miss out on any match that the company may supply. While that sucks, it should be relieved by the bless of receiving such a large bonus.
