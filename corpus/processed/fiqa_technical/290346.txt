Where is the best place to get a small loan? (~$200 at least). I have to pay off a speeding ticket and make a car payment, and my weekly check isn’t going to cover it. I’d like to get it ASAP. I don’t know if it’s better to go through my bank, a loan company, or wherever. I don’t know if this question is applicable to this thread either, I just thought I could get some realistic information.
