Yes I know I never claimed they did haha. I'm not saying to cut a $15 billion share buyback and make it a $15 billion dividend payout. Depends on the company of course but I'd prefer a more balanced approach with sitting cash rather than using a large majority on buybacks, which seems to be a trend these days. I think it bodes poorly for the future and that's all I'm saying.
