"The *supporters* hate globalization because ""dey took errrr jerbs"" (while, more than a little ironically, sauntering into a Walmart). The *party* loves globalization and capitalizing on cheap labor to pad exorbitant salaries and higher EPS boosting stock option prices. Especially helpful when their dividends are only taxed at 15%. All that extra money translates into well-padded reelection campaigns and lucrative contracts. The party talks up their hatred of it to the rabble while doing everything in their power to foster it in bills and deals seldom talked about."
