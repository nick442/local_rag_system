Ok, so you like posting on reddit. but you won't actually do the work to make sure you're making sense or are correct. Gotcha. I'm someone who knows her in real life. As I've stated in this thread elsewhere, her and I have disagreed on things we've talked about professionally, we don't work togeather, but I respect her success, and my ONLY purpose here is to talk about how most of you are calling her out for sounding dumb, and accusing her of not knowing anything, when she actually DOES! You may not agree with her perception of the world as it is. You may not like what she's suggesting. And I have had disagreements with her on other topics, but watching people look like complete assholes and accusing her of ignorance when she isn't, and its EASY to find that out.. is what I can't stand.
