"This article is centered around a ""study"" conducted by Michelle McQuaid who just happens to be selling books, seminars and career coaching services. Surprise surprise, her newest book tells you how to fix your bad boss! Even the link in the Forbes article points to a press release on PRWeb. I will say that Michelle McQuaid's marketing agency is nothing short of relentless. In trying to find the methodology used in her study I found nearly identical articles in several business magazine sites and thousands of blogs and tweets about it from all directions. This ""article"" is pure tripe."
