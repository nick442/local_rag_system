What you mentioned are mature enough technologies to have planes fly themselves now; in fact they already do most of the time. What is missing is software to handle complicated contingencies and probably some additional computing power on-board the plane itself . Computers have been responsible for most of the flying done in the past 10-15 years and there haven't been many tragedies at all, in fact air travel is the safest form of travel; your fears are unfounded.
