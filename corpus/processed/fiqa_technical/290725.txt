I disagree. Compensation is linked to a lot of factors, many of them too intangible to quantify in a simple 8-step chart. Maybe this works fine in a (very) small company. It would be very difficult to maintain in any large organization, and I would imagine that it makes recruiting good talent much harder. I can see certain benefits too, but look - as an employee, I want to work in an environment where I can advocate for myself and, occasionally, negotiate for better compensation. Some people aren't good at these things, and frankly, that sucks for them. I'll eat their lunch if they let me.
