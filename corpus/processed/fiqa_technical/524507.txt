"I realize. I never would claim I did a .. ""triple"" full time (?). I was responding to the comment that any credible university wouldn't let you do more than +1 extra class. Obviously, +1 class in terms of hours is variable since it can range from 3-8 hours at a traditional semester university. Our recommended was something like 18 though the upper limit was 20 IIRC (been awhile)."
