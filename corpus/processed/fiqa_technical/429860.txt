"> I guess all those other experts in the ad industry and tech don't have any idea what they're talking about Dude, that's a really safe bet. Do you even remember the housing bubble? The dot com bubble? Those people were the ones inspiring confidence both times. You know what they were doing in the 1990s when the internet was being delivered to consumers? They were getting high and chasing girls. They were hanging out in the hallways at school, talking about cars or their abusive fathers or their college plans to become MBAs etc. None of them owned 486s, or used dial-up modems before AOL and Hollywood introduced them to ""You've got Mail"". Meanwhile I was ditching school to learn about how the internet worked. Computers have been a part of my daily life for more years than many of those ""experts"" have been alive. They masquerade as experts on the subject now because the internet is what's on everyone's minds these days, and talking about it is what those folks have to do to get a paycheck, but that doesn't mean they have any idea what they're talking about. You buy their bullshit because they're on TV and I'm just some guy on the internet, which is what I've been for the past 3 decades, on the internet."
