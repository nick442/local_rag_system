Sort of free market system when there are resource limits. The city doesn't sell the medallions for $2M, but they do artificially limit the number available. All the mediallion owners bought and sold the medallions on the grey market, and that drove up the price. They all speculated on something very risky. Just like Pogs or Beanie Babies, if the city suddenly decided to double the number of medallions, these owners would have likewise been screwed.
