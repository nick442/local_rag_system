That's because *healthcare* is in a spiral. If insurance is paying 0.28 cents on the dollar average for care, any sane doctor is going to raise rates which in a grasp for more profits will cause insurance premiums to rise. You shouldn't be insuring something subjective like quality of life. It's dumb. Insurance should be based on binary states, and healthy/unhealthy just isn't an actual set of binary states.
