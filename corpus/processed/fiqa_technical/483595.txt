What the other's said is right. You build credit by paying over time. Keeping your balance under the halfway mark of your limit and paying it down over the course of a fair amount of periods yields the best results. So if you have a limit of $1500 then charge a $600 credit and pay $100+ interest over 6 months. Best yet are loans with fix installments. This behavior tells the credit agencies you are responsible and you pay your debts. In their eyes you are a low risk high ROI, statistically speaking.
