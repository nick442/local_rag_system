The black cab industry needed a shakeup for sure, but Uber's labour practices are terrible. You can't go around not giving employees the rights they deserve. And yes they are employees, just like Deliveroo and all the others are too. Shitty labour practices should be stopped - that's what regulations are for - protecting consumers and employees. If Uber started treating their drivers better I'd hope London would welcome them back. We'll see if that ever hapoens.
