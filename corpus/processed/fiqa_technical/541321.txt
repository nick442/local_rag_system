"The relative value of Gold (or any other commodity) as measured against any given currency (such as the USD), is not a constant function either. If you have inflationary pressure, the ""value"" of an ounce of gold (or barrel of oil, etc) may ""double"", but it's really because the underlying comparator has lost ""half"" its value."
