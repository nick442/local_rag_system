"No, they are outselling select models than competitors who have a much broader product range. Each of those sells many times more cars than Tesla and here's a newsflash, they don't make their bread and butter selling the high end cars. Get back to me with total numbers of cars sold and a real market share figure. If the Model 3 outsells the entire range of 3-series cars or A4s, let me know. For the record, BMW sold nearly 150,000 3-series cars last year, and delivered over 2.4 *Million* cars worldwide last year. Tesla, across all models they offer sold less than half of JUST 3-series sales. I don't know if you need a banana for scale or what but Tesla is hardly even a blip on the radar when it comes to market share, period. And no, you cannot compare their Model S to ONE model that anyone else offers, or ""COMBINEDZOMG!"", that's cherry picking and utterly useless data."
