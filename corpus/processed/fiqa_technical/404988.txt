"Agreed. >Yes: Android is way more fragmented, and has many more ""shitty"" devices, but we're talking basic messaging here, not games or complicated shit. Android is no longer as shitty as it used to be. Th latest versions of Android are just as clean and good as iOS. Maybe it's me but Apple is getting desparate day by day. I really wonder if they are ever going to release another product as successful as the iPhone, iPad or MacBook."
