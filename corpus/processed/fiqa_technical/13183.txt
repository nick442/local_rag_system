Might be good if you want to be a Business analysis. But from everything I have heard about a comp sci major it is almost useless for actually learning stuff Edit: Seriously. Both of my friends are programmers and go on and on about how everyone who comes out of college with a comp sci major doesn't know shit about programming. They just know concepts. They are useless when it comes to actual work. Im not saying it's the worst thing but take some programming classes or just learning a language would put you light years beyond what a minor could do.
