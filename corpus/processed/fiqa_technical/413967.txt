In a free market, supply and demand control the equilibrium point of a commodity. Price is one of the variables that moderates demand. But the problem is - 'employment' isn't a free market - you cannot freely decide not to accept a job, because you need _some_ income to live. The wage of an employee - especially at the 'unskilled' tier - is much more about availability of workers vs. jobs. And better yet, those jobs can be subdivided into shifts, and so you can employ _more people_ for _less hours_ or vice versa. The employer therefore has a lot of control over effective wages as a result, and it's only tenuously connected to the 'free market' of the value of service of a burger. So I'd guess the 'market value' would steadily drop to 'about the cost of living in the local area' - maybe a little below even, because you can still employ people who are partially subsidised by family. And further still, you can have people subsidising _themselves_ by working additional hours. So I reckon you'd get equilibrium at 'about' 90% of local cost of living, if you work an 80 hour week.
