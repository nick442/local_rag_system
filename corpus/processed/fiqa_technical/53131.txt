> I believe transparency when it comes to our food is important. Totally agreed. Here's my amateur solution: All food companies are required to have the answers to a set of questions available, via email or website, phone, or standard mail. Those questions are determined by a combination of independent panel and consumer polling. What those questions are may change over time, allowing for a reasonably generous grace period for the companies to prepare. For example, if consumers really have to know what GM ingredients are in their food, for whatever (asinine) reasons, then fine. Require the company to answer. If consumers really want to know what color shoes the workers wear, then so be it. I also think we need a series of third party organizations, rather than the USDA Organic system we have. What's acceptable and what isn't is super arguable, and rather than just taking the standard that exists (which IMO is not meaningful), folks can choose which standard they wish to head. Combined with the mandated transparency above, this would lower costs by removing the need for active investigation, and lead to more informed decision making on the part of the consumers.
