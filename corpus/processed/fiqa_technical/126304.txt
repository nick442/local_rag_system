Will they retire the name or just move collection to some poor town's spring and dry it up and create havoc in the process? I personally LIKE the fact that Aquafina is just Detroit river water. No real environmental damage, the river is large enough to supply it, no harm no foul. (I don't drink bottled water because it is akin to starting a tire fire in my mind).
