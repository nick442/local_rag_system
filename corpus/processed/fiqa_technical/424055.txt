The problem is, increased productivity is what's eliminating jobs, a lot of jobs. And its not going to be something governments can change. (What they can change is preventing their existing jobs from going elsewhere by not giving companies tax breaks to do so. And they need to stop the promotion of privatization and offshoring and outsourcing via FTAs like GATS and TISA!) If you take the long view, its pretty much a good thing for society for people to be freed to move beyond many of these jobs that as our technology improves, are highly amenable to automation. People should be able to get the kind of educations they need to do them, for free, as part of the public education we give people, (and should continue to give people, despite these changes!) so we can all remain relevant and employed in the 21st century. We need to really take advantage of those years during which time the brain is growing so rapidly. Basically, we need to make 12 years do the work of 18 years now. Meaning that people when they graduate their basic education (K-12) should be able to function at a MA or MS level. Thats what we need to do to stop this permanent loss of employment. Because people with less than a masters degree are losing their jobs now. That should be the new normal.
