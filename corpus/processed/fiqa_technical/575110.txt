I see no reason why not, I just opened a joint account with my partner and all we needed was proof of our address and some valid ID - driving licence/passport plus a utility bill worked for us. Of course if you both already bank with HSBC they will already have this information and your bank card may suffice, if you don't have utility bills for example.
