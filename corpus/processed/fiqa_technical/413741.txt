"While I'm sure you're right, I still think it's a fairly generous offer. Whole Foods is not the ""the only name in organic food"" anymore that made them what they are today. All kinds of shops want in on that action. I've heard rumblings from friends in Whole Foods management that numbers have been down and tension has been high. Of course, that was before. Perhaps a factor."
