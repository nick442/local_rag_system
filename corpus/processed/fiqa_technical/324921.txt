Tax Deducted at source is applicable to Employee / Employer [contract employee] relations .. it was also made applicable for cases where an Indian company pays for software products [like MS Word etc] as the product is not sold, but is licensed and is treated as Royalty [unlike sale of a consumer product, that you have, say car] .. Hence it depends on how your contract is worded with your India clients, best is have it as a service agreement. Although services are also taxed, however your contract should clearly specify that any tax in India would be borne by your Indian Client .. Cross Country taxation is an advanced area, you will not find good advice free :)
