it is not a creative career. you don't make anything, you serve your purpose in the economy ofcourse, and it is interesting to be surrounded and in the middle of business like this..but at the end of the day, you sell a service that anyone else can do, and your clients, the businesses, are the actual smart ones. they are the ones that make something and make real decisions. in finance you just trade, or research, or sell your investment banking services..its pretty bs, you leach of what actual creative people are doing. unless you are at a buy side shop, and high up, but then you would be incredibly intelligent and lucky. that all being said, i have no regrets choosing finance, it is still a great career, and any job gets boring after a bit. i wish i worked in a different area of finance yes, but every area you need to start as someones bitch for a few years, and I'm not sure if I can do that again. More math education always helps in finance
