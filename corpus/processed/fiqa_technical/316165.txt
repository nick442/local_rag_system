Eh, Five Guys just isn't that good. Of course it is better than places like McDonalds and I haven't stepped foot in a McDonalds in at least 10 years. But why would I go to Five Guys when I can choose from at least 10 other burger joints in my area that make a much better burger for the same price or cheaper. If anything Five Guys appeals to the people that don't know what they want and have been going to McDonalds their whole lives.
