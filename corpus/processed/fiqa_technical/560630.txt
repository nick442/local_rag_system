The 15% Alibaba stake was invested in way before Mayer's came on board. It's worth $51.75B right now. Yahoo Japan is an autonomous company, that Yahoo has a 36% stake in, spun off well before Mayer's came on board and that stake is conservatively worth$10B. Yahoo market cap is only $49B right now. If anything, Marissa Mayers tenure just killed off the core value of Yahoo itself to the level that it's a liability and it's asset portfolio is the only thing holding it aloft.
