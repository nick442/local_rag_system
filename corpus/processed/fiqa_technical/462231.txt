So what are the underlying causes of these changes? I find it hard to believe it's just inclement weather. Iraq was the home of the first civilization but hasn't done much since. But it does seem like every region has had its heyday except Africa where it reigned supreme. So is it Europeans willingness to adopt new military technology that lead to their success conquering, developing a dominant culture and society?
