> Whether their members come to the gym or not doesn't matter; they still have to pay rent, labor, utilities, buy equipment, etc. Those costs don't change much if people subscribe and don't show up vs. subscribe and do show up. This isn't strictly true. There's a threshold at which enough of their members do show up to the gym that the facility and equipment aren't adequate.
