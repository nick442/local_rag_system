I've read a study about this. If you have twice the generation capacity in renewables (wind/solar) and can store 20% of your yearly consumption, then you are fine. So let's calculate this for the average americal household (4500kWh/year): * You need to be able to generate 9000kWh/year, this requires a 6kW solar installation (Arizona), estimated at $ 15'000. * You need to de able to store 1000kWh, this requires 70 Tesla powerwalls for $6000 each, grand total of $ 420'000. So even here, storage will kill you financially.
