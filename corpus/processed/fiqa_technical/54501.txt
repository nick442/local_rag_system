"> Net Neutrality has more to do with the fact that companies could start prioritizing or blocking access to certain websites and services where they have an incentive to. Great. So just like Walmart prioritizing the display of their in-house brands vs. brands of their competition? Or a car dealership showing you only Toyotas and not Fords as well? I mean, what's the difference here? >To use you example of roads, say for instance that a car manufacturer paid the govt to have the speed limit raised for their vehicles or even reduced the speed limit for other manufacturers. This would create an I level playing field. ""Speed"" is actually a secondary function here, because we're actually talking about *bandwidth.* Light travels at the speed of light; electricity travels between 50-99% of that. Those are properties of physics, not anything Comcast can control. We're talking about bandwidth. So using your roads example, imagine now that a car manufacturer wants to use 50% of the road capacity to ship its goods everyday. And in doing so, it practically crowds out every other entity that wants to use the road. Who is in the right here? How would we regulate who is using the road? What is fair?"
