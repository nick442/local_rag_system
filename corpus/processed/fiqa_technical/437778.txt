The issue is online stores driving prices down and that drives down revenue and more importantly profit. The most effective way to cut costs is to cut wages and that leaves uneducated and under-qualified employees at a retail establishment. The business model simply cannot be sustained. Walmart has it right. Leave everything to the consumer to decide and neglect to give them assistance. Until a sales associate earns more than their wage in profit, they are losing the company money (assuming their only job is to sell). Electronics sales has very little profit outside of the extra items such as cables, cases, protection plans, etc. So they really have to be a professional sales associate to be valuable. Professionals cost money and become the managers (or more) which brings us back to the uneducated and under-qualified associates that walk the floors.
