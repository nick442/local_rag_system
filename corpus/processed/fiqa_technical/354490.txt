If not Target, then who is the party who is and ought to be most knowledgeable about the details and outcomes of the promotion? In my view, they did choose to honour it when they let the promotion run a second time with the exact same set of rules, with full knowledge of the slickdeals thread. If they had any opposition at all, they would have stopped the promotion, minted new coupons with unique codes, sent down new policy to retail management, or programmed the tills not to allow the purchase of gift cards with gift cards. If you disagree that all the above signifies consent, then fine. Target was negligent and now they are paying for it. Satisfied?
