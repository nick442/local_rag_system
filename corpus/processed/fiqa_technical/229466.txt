Thank you. Some of these guys don't seem to understand several points. Too wrapped up in politics instead of economics. * Any job that went south of the boarder was leaving anyway. I think Mexico uses a lot more of our raw materials and services than China would. * I pointed out on that link that almost 40 million jobs were created in the three countries until 2007. Someone responded and 47 million workers. But I think it's better than 47 workers and 0 job creation.. I should also point out that I'm pretty sure the US added more jobs than Canada or Mexico. * NAFTA provides you with much more buying power. 20 years ago a poor person could not buy an iphone if it existed back then. Currently anyone can afford any combination of Iphone, Xbox, computer, above ground swimming pool, etc. * If you are against NAFTA, you might as well be for tariffs on trade between states. After all, if we were better with tariffs as a country, imagine how much better your state would be with them. Imported beef from Texas? Pay an extra 30% for what you buy. Your local economy will improve so much while you pay more and are buying less stuff. Especially if Texas gives an export subsidy to their beef guys, now why would beef producers sell in Texas for 3 a pound when they can make 4 a pound exporting? Even Texans would feel the sting. Tariffs on trade is genius..
