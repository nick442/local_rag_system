"Living in the Netherlands. Laws are being changed (""reforms"") that lead to the same problems facing the US. Labour markets becoming more and more flexible, following the Anglosaxon model. Wages aren't rising, because low wages are more competitive. Cheap labour from Eastern Europe lead to lower productivity gains (who needs a machine when there's cheap migrants who don't know their labour rights?) and lower wage competition. The ""last man standing"", France, is now turning to economic liberalism too, thanks to Macron. They have to, otherwise they will become less competitive. They didn't have to if the rest had good labour standards/productivity/wages, too."
