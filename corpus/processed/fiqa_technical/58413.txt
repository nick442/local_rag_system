Like I said in my comment below, it depends on price action and potential reward. The guys who called the housing bust too early in ~2004 paid pennies on the dollar to hold those bets for years before finally getting paid a jackpot. If those same guys were losing 20% a year, then I'd agree. Holding for 4 years is suicidal. At this point I feel it's too early to tell. If 2020 rolls around and we never saw a muni collapse then I'll say her overall theory was still correct, but she failed to account for variables which could save the muni market.
