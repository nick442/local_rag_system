"J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax is, remarkably, a great read. It's a line by line review of the tax forms, and offers commentary and examples for every scenario. Of course, it's updated every year to reflect new rules and numbers. I actually read it from cover to cover the first year I started working. It's not going to offer convoluted strategies to use, but, you'll understand your tax return well enough to respond to the advice you encounter elsewhere. To mhoran's point - ""Don't let the tax tail wag the investing dog."" Taxes are important, but should take a back step to earning and investing. Those who didn't sell at the height of the dotcon bubble ""to avoid the big tax bill"" only saw in hindsight that paying taxes is part of success not failure."
