Your statement is a reductio ad absurdum fallacy but i will address it and validate it in part. Here we have Burger King following the law, following the tax code which was legally passed by Congress and in fact which the D party had 2 years to change when the GOP had no ability to interfere. Yet a combination of hard core leftists and nationalistic tea party protectionists want to boycott anyway. And to your point of ownership. Government through income tax DOES own a percentage of every profit earned in the US (with no obligation to share in any losses by the way) and through regulation and police power DOES have control of every business in the US. That is tacit ownership.
