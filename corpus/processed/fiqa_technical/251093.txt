How is that someone can make a machine that removes lids from jars for $19 and these guys couldn't make a machine that squeezed a fruit bag for less than $400? I also sense that they had a very big challenge in making those bags. Buying the food, processing it. That takes work. A lot of work! Even just getting a steady stream of consistent food would be a challenge let along stuffing it into a bag. Besides, what does this get you? if the juice is squeezed on site, is it better than juice squeezed a week ago and sealed in a glass jar? I don't think so. Lastly, juice is just fortified sugar. Fructose. You lose a lot of the real nutrients by not using the pulp. This must have looked amazing on paper, much like the Segway, but in reality they just couldn't pull it together.
