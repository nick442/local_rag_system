Going through the same thing right now, about to lose our company phones (that I use constantly, since my workday doesn't end at 5) and they cut our training budget to $0. Yet execs can run out and buy whatever software they want, even if its pointless, we're constantly bringing in sub-contractors at 4x the hourly rate of staff, and they sure aren't putting their paid country club memberships and private plane on the line.
