Guy from the 1800s has no relevance to modern times when everyone has access to the world's knowledge for $30/month. There's NO excuse for anyone to not come up with $400 in an emergency. My grandparents were poor, but they lived under their means so they could have a surplus. My parents did the same. I do the same. The surplus is now sizeable, through nothing extraordinary. The people I blame the most for poverty is people who have kids they cannot afford. That's the root origin of most poverty, without which, poverty would be eradicated within 2 generations at most.
