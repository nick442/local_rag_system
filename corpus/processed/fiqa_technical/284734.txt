Sorry man, for most finance jobs you are to old for an entry level positions. Firms would much rather give it to a guy fresh out of college (and there are plenty of them) then a 27 year old with no relevant experience. That being said, there are some areas in finance that are less strict about this, so if you are willing to start at the bottom with a bunch of 22 year olds you have a chance.
