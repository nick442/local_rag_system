Which I just think is a que for Google and Microsoft to start integrating your friends opinions on their status updates into your search experiences. If So and So didn't like this restaurant and left a bad note on Yelp! or another restaurant aggregator, well damnit you are not going to see that in your results. Your friends have spoken. The next best thing (Social) is going to be a bust for the average internet user.
