I still don't think it's a complete replacement. In all honesty, I would shop at Staples more if it was affordable. I'm in college and the other day I tried buying a presentation binder for a project and they wanted $5 for it, I went to my college bookstore and picked up the same brand, design and color for 75 cents. Staples is just too expensive and I honestly don't feel bad because they have always tried to gouge customers and now it's coming back to bite them in the ass finally.
