"I've got a Chevy Bolt, and can confirm that handling is much better when the weight is down low in the center. I've never driven a car like it, and it doesn't even have the ""best"" handling type of suspension. As far as moving parts go: Report from a teardown, comparing the Bolt to a conventional VW Golf. http://www.advantagelithium.com/_resources/pdf/UBS-Article.pdf Powertrain findings (Bolt vs. Golf): * Moving parts - 24 vs. 149 * Moving parts in engine - 3 vs 113 * in gearbox - 12 vs 27 * other moving parts - 9 vs 9 * Wearing parts - 11 vs 24 * Moving and wearing parts - 0 vs 6 * Total - 35 vs 167 They found the Bolt requires no maintenance or replacement of these parts over the life of the car."
