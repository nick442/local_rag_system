I actually have a problem with these sort of cases because they imply that the issue in the housing bubble was fraud or deception. It wasn't- the problem was overoptimism. Borrowers and lenders jointly indulging in a fantasy that housing prices could never seriously decline in a correlated manner. The longer we pretend it was only the liars who were culpable, and not everyone, the farther we are from being able to prevent this sort of thing.
