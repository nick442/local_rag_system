I feel like the economics based on slave labor should have a name but I can't think of one. It's not really capitalist because that would require a voluntary trade and slave labor is not voluntary. But in economic theory slavery can be powerful. The Nazi's really surprised the allied planners with how effective their use of slave labor really was.
