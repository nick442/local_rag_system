Seriously. I was there last week, and could not get help from anyone at the sporting goods department. All the people assigned were missing. It took me several tries to get the department manager to come over. Once the manager arrived, all of a sudden all the workers showed up out of thin air. Of course, I was annoyed by the time it them to finally help me. Maybe this was an isolated case, but it sure didn't feel like they cared about my business.
