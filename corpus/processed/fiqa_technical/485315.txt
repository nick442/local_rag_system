It's also a lot easier to repossess a car than it is to foreclose on a house in most cases. They don't have to wait for months of non-payment. They don't have to follow an eviction process. They don't need to get local law enforcement involved. They can just show up and take your car when you aren't paying attention. Hell, there's been more than one reality TV show about the auto repo industry. Besides being quick and easy, people think it's *entertaining to watch*. Compare that to foreclosures.. nobody wants to watch a TV show where the sheriff's department shows up to kick a family out on the street while landlords dump all of their belongings on the curb.
