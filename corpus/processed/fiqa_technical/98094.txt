Businesses aren't a charity - they pay for work and exist for profit. They aren't supposed to have feelings. So austerity and getting the most out of your employees causes the company to become lean and efficient. A lot of companies run with a lot of fat - just organizational bloat and inefficiency. I don't take issue with changing the culture of complacency at a company and laying people off to make the company run without unnecessarily paying a bunch of people. You wouldn't hire 3 or 4 companies to mow part of your lawn and pay them all for mowing the whole thing, you wouldnt go out to eat every day if you were on a tight budget, so why would a company carry extra employees to do the same job, and why would you expect that a company should not use a zero budgeting system? You wrote everything to seemingly suggest that 3G is a cancer to the business world, that they do things in all the wrong ways. But they've owned Burger King for almost a decade now. They earned a 46% return over a two year period and continue to own a majority stake in burger king. I think Burger King has a better reputation now than it did then. Tim Hortons was only acquired 3 years ago. People have been bitching about how they no longer make fresh donuts since before 2010. In other words, Canadians have been becoming more skeptical of Tim Hortons since **before** the buyout from Burger King and 3G. 3G didn't significantly change the values and product, they cut costs and made it a less cushy environment. The ill will toward Tim Hortons was not caused by 3G, as you suggested.
