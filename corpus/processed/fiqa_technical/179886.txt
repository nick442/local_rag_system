Cat has always had plants in IL. HQ is in Peoria (grew up there, several members of my family work for them), and plants all over the place. Canada probably had other things going against it at the time they pulled out. Depending on the timing, it's quite likely that the exchange rate had shifted such that, even without a raise, the workers were effectively costing the company considerably more. Articles like that seem to leave out all sorts of details. For instance, I only saw one point where salary was increased and it wasn't anywhere near a 60% increase - more like 15% which isn't entirely unheard of. There's also what looks like a one time cash payment - bonus for a good year. 3-4x salary isn't unheard of in executive bonus land. It's also highly variable and not guaranteed year to year. The rest would be in stocks and options. The trick there is that the amounts of those were probably determined when he signed his contract. The reason it makes for a big raise is because the stock price has gone up (though it's down nearly 20% over the last month - May kinda sucked for the stock market). You also need to look at whether the profits are higher because of higher volume (and possibly more workers), better margins, better deployment of capital, etc. And when there's talk about asking worker to pay more for their health care, is it more as a raw dollar amount, or more as a percentage of the health care costs. As to whacking defined benefit pensions -- personally, I'd rather have a 401k. The problem with defined benefit pensions is that you're tied to that company for life. Put in your 40 years and then retire with 80% pay or whatever it is. Leave after 4 or 5 and you've pretty much got nothing - with a 401k, leave after 4 or 5 and you have what you've put away + what the company matched.
