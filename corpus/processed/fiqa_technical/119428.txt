The people in this thread thinking that this won't happen soon are don't realize the extent to which we already entrust our lives to automated solutions. Go to a hospital and if you have a serious injury you'll be hooked up to machines that monitor your life and if they break you can die. Already planes have been automated to the point that the pilot just sits there to give the illusion of comfort for the passengers (and can handle the few dangerous situations which the AI can't handle yet). The military is investing in this technology in a major way, and once it reaches maturity the savings companies would make off of it would ensure that they'd get it to be legal. In the end, it would be better than a human pilot, because of its ability to network with all the other uavs in the air, its unwavering concentration and its faster reaction speed. I can't wait for the day when I can get onto an automated plane, or an automated car (which I think will arrive first, they're already street legal in Vegas where Google is testing their car).
