I think the debacle they are referring to for Facebook's IPO is the Nasdaq debacle. Nevertheless, Wall St ripped off retail investors pretty good with Facebook's IPO. * Step One: Hype up major online company * Step Two: Overvalue IPO * Step Three: Sit back and watch the money roll in * Step Four: Watch all those suckers take losses and maybe even short the stock to make more money. * Step Five: Repeat with next IPO. Just business as usual with Wall St, when will America ever learn?
