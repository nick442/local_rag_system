"Google just spammed me on their own product. I got an email (in Gmail) to probe me about using their calendar application. Seemed very un-Google like. The pointless Youtube and Google Photos notifications have gotten out of control as well. I know they lost the ""do no evil"" thing ages ago but now their products and resorting to super cheap transparent gimmicks to try and drum up more usage."
