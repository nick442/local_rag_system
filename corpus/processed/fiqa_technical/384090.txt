There needs to be a test to prove that pot was consumed in the recent hours following a work incident (and if suspected of driving impaired), similar to a breathalyzer. If I drive a forklift through a wall 3 weeks after I smoked a joint, it's not the pot that was responsible. Insurance will continue to use the pee/hair tests to reject claims until then. Thus, companies will need to have clean employees all the time to avoid getting stuck with the bill.
