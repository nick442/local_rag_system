"Statistics is a sub-field of mathematics. Don't say you like or dislike ""math"" as a whole. You've probably only been exposed to arithmetic, basic trig, Euclidean geometry, statistics, and calculus. Struggling to understand something doesn't make it impossible or mean it will be a setback. Plenty of people have taken academic weaknesses and turned them into strengths by diving deep until you have a real understanding of the material instead of just memorizing operations (such as the ""power rule"" in calculus or some dumb iterative shit like that). Up to you what you make of it. The elementary level of statistics is pretty significant part of nearly finance (along with a multitude of other professions and daily life) so know that and choose according to what you want."
