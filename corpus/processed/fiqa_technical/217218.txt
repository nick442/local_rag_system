Firstly, I highly doubt anyone on this site will be able to provide you with accurate input on this matter regarding what TO DO. It's the what not to do that may be possible. That said, if you want to offer equipment for rent, which in a developing country is probably a decent idea, I'd start by asking around and doing some research on what people really need and are wanting to rent. I would suggest studying other developing/developed countries histories to see what companies were successful around a similar stage as well. I'd start small: pressure washers, generators, concrete mixers, fork lifts, hydraulic ladders, etc. Getting things that are just a bit too expensive for someone to own and something they don't need all the time. These can be great revenue generators because they're cheap to purchase, but can be rented at a premium.
