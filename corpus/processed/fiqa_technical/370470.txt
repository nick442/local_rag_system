An interesting read. As of lately, my office has been getting calls from Hartford, Fidelity, Oppenheimer, First Trust, and now Prudential regarding their ETFs. A lot of them just received their 3 year number and the companies are trying to get inflows into them. Prudential's has not launched yet, but is expecting to drop end of summer or early fall. Fidelity is currently the only major competitor in the space. They have a slightly lower internal cost compared to Vanguard and their position are almost identical to the iShares ETFs offered by Black Rock. You can think of Black Rock as Bounty brand paper towels while Fidelity is more like Kirkland Signature. Essentially the same thing with a slight savings on price. One thing to look out for is the very thin trading volume on some of these new ETFs. Oppenheimer and Hartford have very thin levels of volume which makes owning them feel like a game of old maid. You don't want to be stuck holding the bag if something happens in the sector ETF that was purchased. Always make sure there is a market for some of these ETFs before you buy it. Fidelity has overcome some of these volume problems.. but some of the ETFs are still a little thin. Just stick with Vanguard for the thinly traded sectors and consider Fidelity if you want to shave a few bps on internal cost. This has just been my personal observation of the industry.
