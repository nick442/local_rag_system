"If you're under 18 there's not much you can do. As a minor, your kinda just stuck. There are routes to go, but not many. If you're over 18, here's what you can do. Now these steps won't help you not anger your mother. They're ""what you can do"" but it doesn't mean you ""should"". Keep in mind that it might be better just to have a conversation. In that conversation, if you think you need to say, ""I will file a complaint with the FBI, and have you arrested if you don't stop! You're breaking the law and invading my privacy."" Again these are drastic steps to take. More moderate steps may be advisable."
