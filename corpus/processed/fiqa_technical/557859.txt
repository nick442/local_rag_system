Well, they are 'entry level' jobs in the sense that they are the first jobs you get after walking in the door. But in the sense that these jobs are going to lead to something significantly better paying for any but a very few, there is nothing 'entry level' about them. If you work for crap wage at McD's or Walmart in 2000, you are probably going to be working for crap wage at McD's or Walmart in 2014.
