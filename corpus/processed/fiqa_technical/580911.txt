I think the article is looking at this from the wrong direction. It's not that Google is building anything but that retailers are looking to move away from Amazon and Google is one of the best alternatives. Brick and Mortars have relatively been subsidizing Amazon's 'intrusion' into their space by using Amazon's services. It's why we're seeing Walmart saying that they won't work with companies that use Amazon's AWS and Target looking to Google/MS/Oracle as an AWS replacement. Why give Amazon money if they're going to use that money to directly compete with you? As far as Amazon being a monopoly, they aren't. They're just very good at vertically integrating their services to be very comprehensive.
