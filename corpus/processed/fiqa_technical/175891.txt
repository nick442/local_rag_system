As someone who is changing careers to get out of TV, I can tell you that it's clear from the inside that TV is on it's way out. I know a lot of people who work in TV who are unemployed and have been for a long time. There just aren't as many shows being produced in a predictable frequency anymore. I know as a consumer that it is no longer a profitable model, but it's also clear that networks are running out of money.
