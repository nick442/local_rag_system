>Education is totally depending on the skills and mindset of the student. Many many students can be self taught and/or are motivated to learn. They don't need teachers. This is a good niche for automation. IMHO the best model would be to allow students to access resources in isolation then arrange a catch-up class with a facilitator to encourage discussion. That way the benefits of automation and human interaction are realized.
