Yes but the trendy new term is plant-based diet, and I think the attraction for a vegan fast food would be to get a quick, healthy meal that is reminiscent of typical fast food. The way meat protein is consumed in the US and elsewhere is typically in conjunction with other processed ingredients. If someone figures out a good menu with relatively healthy vegan food, I definitely think they could be successful. Something like Jamba Juice where they have many locations inside or next to gyms seems like it could work. Smoothies don't always cut it and a quick, cheap, healthy snack would be fantastic after or before a work out. Honestly I never go to restaurants that serve meats and order something that is strictly vegan/vegetarian. If there was a place I could go to quickly that specializes in vegan food I would love to give it a try.
