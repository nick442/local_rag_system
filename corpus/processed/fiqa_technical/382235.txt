"Yes they were quite shady and terrible on many fronts. They hired 40-50 yr old business solution guys and 1/3rd of new hires quit within 6 months. Wowza. Didn't know about hackathons and ""startup weekends"" having prowling companies, makes sense though.. Was never interested in such things. Also I am female so I kind of fear being physically in places with disproportionate gender ratios/where I stand out.. But that's probably stupid in a professional setting?"
