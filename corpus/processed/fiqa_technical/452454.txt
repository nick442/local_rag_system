The mushroom republic, keep the public in the dark and feed 'em shit. Money buys choices and influence. The richies are cowards and fear they might have to get their fingernails dirty and perform a legitimate service in society if others are allowed to compete with them. When does the mass boycott start where everybody stops paying their mortgate/rent, insurance and taxes? That would reboot an economy.
