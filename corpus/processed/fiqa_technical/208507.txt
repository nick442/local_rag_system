$15 being how much it costs to drive a car about 10 miles, and does not account for a driver's time. Hilarious shit, from the biggest payday loan scam the planet has ever seen. Because Uber is nothing but a scam where you work your ass off, to steal money from your future self, and give 25% of it to Uber! But if you think 6 cents a mile is a decent wage for a cab driver (which is what you can make, if you are lucky), then by all means, please sign up!
