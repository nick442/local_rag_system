"His conclusion doesn't match the background. > Gladwell cites research from UCLA's Mitchell Chang that shows that a person's odds of earning a science or math degree fall two percentage points for every 10-point increase in the average SAT score of his or her peers. This says that a person at an Ivy League school has a lower ""chance"" of graduating with a degree. It would be fine to say ""don't hire incoming Harvard freshman for your engineering or technology job because there is a lower chance of them completing their degree"" but nobody hires incoming freshman, they hire graduates. What does this even say about the quality of the graduate once they actually have their degree? As far as I can tell nothing."
