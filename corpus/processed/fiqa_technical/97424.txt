>According to a Journal Sentinel article, financial incentives for Foxconn are expected to well-exceed $1 billion via a combination of local, state and federal incentives. According to their calculations, if the deal cost $1 billion and the company created 10,000 jobs, the government would spend $100,000 per job. i wish the jobs were for real. aren't these kind of jobs vulnerable to automation in the very short term future?
