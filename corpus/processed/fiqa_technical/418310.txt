The complexity of the side effects always amaze me. For example - fertiziler is bad for fish. Why? Because it ends up entering the water table and eventually ends up on the embankments of rivers. The fertiziler allows plants along the embankment to grow more, meaning that there are more leaves etc that fall into the river. This in turn increases the amount of bacteria in the river because of the increased food. The increased bacteria absorb more of the oxygen in the water, making it more difficult for fish.. Their are many such chains, and it can be very difficult to follow and understand them.
