Yes. Stick to the deal you made. Help the girl pass the exams. Consider it a life lesson, don't worry about the money now because it's only payment if she passes. It's more about helping the girl pass the exams than it is about what you knew at the time was going to be short money. You have to prove yourself before you even think about an increase in payment and payment here is only due with a passing grade. You put yourself in a situation that you will not do in the future. You made the offer so honor it like a champ and be grateful you are able to help someone else.
