people have been comparing bitcoin to tulips for the past 8 years, meanwhile the value has grown from $0 to nearly $6000. Do you have any specific reason why you think bitcoin is comparable to tulips? Do you not see a value of having a currency that is not issued from a central bank, that can be sent anywhere in the world without permission from governments, and wont be debased? please do some research before you just parrot the same mantra that others have been for years.
