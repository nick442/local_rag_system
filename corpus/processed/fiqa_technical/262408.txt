Why would any of that matter? He said it would give him an edge. It doesn't. He has to be smarter to deal with a normal situation due to his disability. The outcome is the same, but more effort is used to achieve it. I'm saying that a normal person can use that excess effort to achieve more. I don't have any statistics, but for every disabled person who outperforms a regular person, there are probably 10 that underperform. It's a called a disability for a reason.
