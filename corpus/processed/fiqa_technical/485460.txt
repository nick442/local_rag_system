"I was not aware of that. However, the rest of that article seems to point in Google's favor. > The public suffers under a monopolistic market because it does not have the quantity of goods or the low prices that a competitive market could offer. Doesn't apply. > ..the act only applies to those monopolies attained through abused or unfair power. Monopolies that have been created through efficient, competitive behavior are not illegal under the Sherman Act, as long as honest methods have been employed. Google may have 65% of the share of internet searches, but not the online travel booking business. You can't say they've cheated to win the search market, and you can't say they have a monopoly in the online travel booking business. > Once sufficient monopoly power has been proved, the Sherman Act requires a showing that the company in question engaged in unfair conduct. Finally, even if they were somehow declared a monopoly, you'd have to prove they were being unfair to competitors. Eliminating competitors from search results might be unfair, but just listing your own product at the top of the list seems a fairly weak argument. If the government says that Google's product at the top of the list is unfair, questions will then be raised about the entire order of the list. How far down should Google's listings be? Is this going to spread to all of Google's side-projects that show up in their search results? What if Google placed their listing in the paid advertising section? Is that still ""cheating""? Does a company not have the right to show new products to its existing customers? I don't see Google losing this battle in court, but then, I don't even see it going to court. Google will go out of its way to appease the complainers."
