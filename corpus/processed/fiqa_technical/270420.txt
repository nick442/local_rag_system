I'd start by doing a ton of research, talking to anyone you know who's in the business, making a business plan, hiring someone to consult on said plan and make sure it's feasible and potentially taking on a partner to help you with the logistics. Tons of entrepreneurs have created successful businesses without any sort of prior knowledge, but they worked their butts off in order to get it started.
