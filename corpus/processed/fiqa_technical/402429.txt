Lets be honest. Credit bureaus are too integral to the financial system. Equifax wont see any consequences from any of this, and none of the executives responsible will be held accountable. The investors, executives, and government officials all know that this crisis will blow over after a few weeks and everybody will forget it happened. Hell, the mainstream media have barely even covered it, and everyone i talk to about it either doesnt care, doesnt understand the impact, or doesnt even know what Equifax is.
