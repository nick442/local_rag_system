"I didn't idly pick the SF Bay as my model. That place was literally ""Rust-Belt West"" after industrial contraction starting at the end of WWII and continuing through the '70s. But the Silicon Valley boom didn't revitalize the former industrial areas, but merely a few 'gentrified' spots, *like where those buses originate*. Those 400K new 'service/support' jobs *won't pay enough* to allow the workers to live *in the city*. They'll be commuting from *beyond* the upper-crust suburbs you mention, [just like these Californians](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/business/economy/san-francisco-commute.html)."
