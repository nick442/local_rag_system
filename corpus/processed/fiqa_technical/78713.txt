I believe it. Violin lessons - $5k/year Piano lessons - $5K/year Sports - $5k/year (or more) daycare/kindergarten - $10-20-?/year (depending on where you live) private school (or higher taxes if you want a decent public school) - ? a lot.. and either one of the parents has to go part time and lose income,you you have to hire someone to help (just taking kids to all the lessons is a second job..)
