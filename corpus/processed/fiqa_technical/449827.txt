Foreign business doesn't land in Russia because of its despotic nature. Russian state assets have been looted since the year 1991. The first generation gang was Moscow based Boris Yeltsin providing it breastfeeding. Since the year 2000 the Baskov Lane dwarf has seated the throne breastfeeding his buddies from Petrograd. Not Germans nor anyone else is willing to invest to a country driven by a bunch of ill behaving buccaneers. Not even Russian money stays in the country but is emigrating. I wonder why is that.
