"70k is doable, but to get that right out of school you will need experience at a real company. The investment club sounds cool, but it doesn't carry as much weight. Companies need to be able to call someone you worked for and verify that you are a worthy employee. Also, your club won't count towards ""experience"" - which is required nowadays for an entry level position. Get an internship, ASAP and put that ahead of everything including grades. source: '15 grad"
