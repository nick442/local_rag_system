Three years ago I had couple of coins. I was scammed for 1btc, couldn't spend them properly, lost passwords.. And was quite disappointed after using them for some time. I still have some amount in the wallet I cannot access - forever. I don't know why are people so enthusiastic about this cryptocurrency stuff, it's valuable because it's scarce and innovative, but let's face it will not save the world nor win against the banking system. It is a bubble and it will pop eventually
