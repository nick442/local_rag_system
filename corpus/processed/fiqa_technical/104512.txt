I would add him to Google Places, Yelp and AngiesList. Not 100% if you can add yourself to AngiesList but once you start getting referrals from there, it can be a nice flow of users if you can get them to leave good reviews. I hired a plumber off AngiesList and liked him a lot. I referred him to my in laws and they liked him too. He had about 70 positive reviews on there. It's all about reputation online and off. Might even want to get in with realtors to give your cards to people that need the work for referral commissions.
