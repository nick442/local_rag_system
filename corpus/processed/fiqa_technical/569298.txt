In investment and corporate banking, Analyst is a catch-all term for entry level positions. They are expected to be proficient in Excel and financial markets/modeling, but not necessarily programming unless it's a Quant role. Specifics are different for every group but the common factor is time at the office. They work at least 60 hours a week. In my experience the only certification that matters to employers is CFA and it's an intense multi-year commitment. But passing the Level 1 exam would look good on a resume. Analyst can mean different things in research or corporate finance, but I don't have much experience there.
