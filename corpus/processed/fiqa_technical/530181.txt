I'm not saying they aren't properly structured to take advantage of the conditions. But they are absolutely being subsidized for better or worse. California alone has spent $500m in electric car subsidies and is considering earmarking another $3b. The vast majority of those funds have gone towards Tesla. No other Mfg has been a bigger recipient. Call a spade a spade. I don't personally care enough to oppose it, but it's an advantage nonetheless.
