"Your argument comes down to ""he is presumed guilty until proven innocent"", a common injustice found in many authoritarian dictatorships and theocracies throughout history. Your argument seems based on the assumption that M. Armstrong is guilty without a requirement for any evidence that he did anything. I reject your 'guilty until proven innocent' as ethically bankrupt."
