There often is. And that's a problem often not faced when these *same users* pick up an Android or Apple-based OS device. These users (often Boomers) just want something to work, and wonder why things don't work as easily in Microsoft environments as they do in Apple or Android environments--same users! If Microsoft continues to alienate those users, they'll simply move to Apple/Android. Oops--too late--many already have. Microsoft may not survive this latest blunder, particularly not in their current, disconnected, bloated form.
