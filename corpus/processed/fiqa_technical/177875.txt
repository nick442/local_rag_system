Family of immigrants here. Working hard and earning it has absolutely nothing to do with it. That kind of comment absolutely denotes the complete ignorance most people have of the process. The factors that matter, like where you were born and luck have nothing to do with the applicant. The thing you have to do are 1) be patient (sometimes to the tune of 20 years) and 2) be able to follow an arcane process to the letter.
