Supplier prints are a huge challenge. Every revision release is a pain in the ass and like you said you have no idea what their process capabilities or tooling constraints are. We pretty much only use them for commoditized parts where just about any supplier can make it the same exact way. Boeing did a bad job of supplier development. I'm sure the Apollo purchasing group didn't just wait for parts to hit the dock before finding out that they were nonconforming. A lot of times these problems are more of a cultural issue than a technical shortcoming.
