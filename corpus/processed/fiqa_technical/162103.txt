That's not how pension funds work. Individuals don't have their own account. They have a promise for a guaranteed amount of income. The money gets managed all together in one giant pool by professional investors. And these are the investors that the article is talking about. They're not a bunch of billionaires refusing to invest idle cash. They're often bureaucrats in charge of sovereign wealth funds that are desperately trying to earn enough interest to meet their obligations. Taxing them more isn't going to help anything.
