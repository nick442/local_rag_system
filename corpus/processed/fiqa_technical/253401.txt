That's a common misconception about capitalism. Capitalism, as defined in works of free market scholarship, says those who earn the most money through voluntary exchange (not through deceit or force), have the most merit, and this is correct. The problem we have is that the standards against deceit and force have ceased to be effective. Someone needs to create and offer the goods and services we all take for granted. Without the profit motive, there would be no reason to risk starting a new venture. Government can't do it, because that's been tried, and that always leads to severe shortages and mass starvation.
