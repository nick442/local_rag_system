This is part of the reason that job hunting can get so frustrating for me. I often do get the feeling my resume sat in the database, was scanned for keywords, and when none were found over the hiring period I received the standard rejection email after 60 or 90 days. I wouldn't even mind a rejection email as long as it looked like an actual person wrote it and wasn't a template.
