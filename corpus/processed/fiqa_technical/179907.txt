I don't like Trump but you're not wrong. There is too much circlejerking and schadenfreude against Trump in reddit by taking pot shots at every opportunity. Reddit doesn't seem to realise that ridiculing Trump doesn't do anything because he is immune to It. We've already been ridiculing Trump even before the elections on how sexist and stupid he is and yet he won! Edit: grammar
