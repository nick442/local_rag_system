As a manufacturing and facilities engineer, I might be able to provide some insight. It's one thing to have the technology. It's another to make a business case for implementing the new technology. Factories are big expensive things. They take a long time to pay for themselves (generally). The switch from steam to electric power, as the article pointed out, required a completely new approach to facility design. This isn't something that happens overnight. For most companies and most applications, the business case would indicate that you run with the old technology until you need to replace, then you replace with the new technology. This delays your spend and allows you to get better ROI on the existing facility. If the change to electricity only effected the local manufacturing cells within the plant, we would've seen its implementation much faster. That wasn't the case. The only way to run it efficiently is to build an entirely new facility. It's a lot easier, and quicker, to turn a jet ski than it is to turn an oil tanker (just ask the USS John McCain! :-P).
