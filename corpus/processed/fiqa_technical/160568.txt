Why is that acceptable? That's just bad math. Currently, autopilot for cars isn't fleshed out yet. Humans cumulatively have 1 crash every 470 million miles, while Tesla's autopilot has 1 crash for every 220 million miles, but that's with the old hardware, with one forward camera. the new hardware suite has 8 cameras, along with all the other radar/sonar sensors. It's yet to be turned on. If that system proves to have 1 crash every half billion miles, then the car is safer than human driving. If it reaches 1 crash per billion miles, then it's kind of a no-brainer. When you get in a taxi, bus, or airplane, you're still putting your life in the hands of something that's not under your control. You just trust that they have a good safety record and let them drive you. Driverless cars will be the same way. Nothing will ever be 100% safe, ever. That's just not possible. A sinkhole can open up under the car at any moment. A meteor could hit the car. No matter what, something will be able to beat the system and cause a fatality, but the goal is to minimize fatalities, not eliminate them all together. 100% will never happen.
