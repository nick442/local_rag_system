> I think if you do a new passport application, or you need to include new photos you can't do the whole thing online and need to do some verification steps (but you can do those at post offices IIRC.). Your solution to mailing in documents and a check is for me to go to the post office? I'm trying to save time, not simply figure out how to eliminate checks from my life.
