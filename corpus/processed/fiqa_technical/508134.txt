So you'd prefer someone else to do your work for you? Someone figure out who's the bad guy, and figure out how to punish them? You are too busy filling your Jeep and drinking your latte to actually be a responsible member of society? It is attitudes like that which lead to tyranny. How can you trust those in power, if you have no idea whats right or wrong?
