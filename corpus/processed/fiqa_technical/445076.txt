Ok, thanks for your explanation. This makes much more sense. I'm still confused on a few things though. Does the US government charge a higher fee to UPS and FedEx because they use a higher percentage of the traffic on us highways/freeways? Moreover, is the US government allowed to work out an exclusive deal with UPS to give them priority traffic (perhaps by selling them a tag that allows them to use the fast lane while others can't)? I recognize that the government is different than telecoms, but to stretch the metaphor imagine the freeways are owned by private business. Should private business be allowed to sell priority delivery on a system subsidized by taxpayers? A system that is subsidized primarily because an open neutral network provides a broader marketplace than a patchwork of privately owned roads/communication channels? Also, doesn't Netflix have to pay significantly higher prices to get adequate upload speed to serve their customers? Shouldn't those fees cover the huge bandwidth they are using? (This is an honest question, I'm not informed on how data servers pay to connect to the internet.)
