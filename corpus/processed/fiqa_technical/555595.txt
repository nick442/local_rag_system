"> reasonable conversation where everybody treats everybody with respect is out of the question You can't have a reasonable conversation with N.Korea. Bill Clinton tried it.. and we ended up with nuclear weapons from his ""Nuclear agreemen"" with N.Korea. P/S: Reasonable conversation did not work with Nazi Germany. Even giving them Czechoslovakia did not appease them. Ask Chemberline from the UK."
