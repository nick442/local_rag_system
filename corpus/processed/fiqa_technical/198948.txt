on a per capita average only 1 country spends more than us on bullshit and thats Saudi Arabia.. (look up per capita spending based on country) and I am sure their 30 million people spend alot, but the united states has 330 mindless consumers who spend the 2nd most amount per capita in the world, numbers a business like a fast food giant cannot ignore, especially since America is so fat and loves its burgers and soda.
