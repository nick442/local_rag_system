Just wanted to say that was a very interesting read, and I agree with most of what you said. I always find it interesting how many people (gods I hate to generalize but it seems apt at this point) seem to assume outright that anyone opposing the Libertarian viewpoint are lazy,poor,unmotivated, drug addicts or stupid. I always find it hard to maintain my composure with those individuals but you have done a smashing job keeping a calm rational demeanor while your adversary maintains his/her descent into childish name calling which is rather disappointing. Because if he could just form a counter argument without them it would be such a more interesting dialog.
