I'll try. First forget everything OP said (your point? yay!). Gold has value because it is stamped with a value on the front (say, 10 denarius). This coin can then be used to pay taxes to Rome. The value of the coin is the stamp value, not the value of the underlying gold. The seignorage is the difference in price between the underlying metal and the marked value. Because the coin has a very valuable use (paying taxes) that the metal doesn't have, the government gets to keep the difference between value and coin price. Paper dollars are just like gold coins with a higher seignorage value.
