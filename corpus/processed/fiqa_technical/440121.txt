Well they don't have a fiduciary duty to be politically correct lol. Just politically correct if it relates to profitability. And I guess you're right that if they waste time and energy there.. they might have been able to use it elsewhere. But honestly this is a gang of crooks. And you can see it in the compensation plans. Most of them have nothing better to do.
