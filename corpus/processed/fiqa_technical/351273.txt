$34/month for doing 12 transactions or more. If your time is worth less than about $2.50 per transaction, then it makes sense. I'd also check to see what happens if you miss and make only 11 transactions one month. Do you lose a finger or something? Or (less dramatically) do they take away your nice rate forever or slap you on the wrist financially? The fine print taketh away in these deals. I'd be sure to see what it says.
