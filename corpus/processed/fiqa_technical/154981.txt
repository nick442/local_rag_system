">But Facebook, which claims more than 900 million members, had 158 million unique visitors to its site in April, according to researcher ComScore, up just 5% from a year ago. That compares with year-over-year growth rates of 89% in April 2010. So, about 1 in 6 users (~16%) visited facebook during a particular (recent) month. The other 5 of 6 (~83%) of users didn't visit during that month.. Hmmm.. Sounds like a lot of relatively dead/fairly inactive accounts/users to me\*. And the thing is that -- different than other social sites like LinkedIn (which is in a lot of ways an ""online resume"" & business contact database) -- facebook pretty much NEEDS continuous and regular use (that's the premise that their whole model, especially advertising-wise, is built on, if FB reverts to people simply using it to maintain a once or twice a year ""update"" on movements of friends {i.e. it becomes the equivalent of a Xmas card list storage site} then it's potential ""value"" diminishes rather dramatically). >Also, the social network is testing ways to allow those under 13, currently prohibited, to participate with parental supervision. Which seems (from a cynical perspective anyway) to be a sign that they are potentially getting ""desperate"" to maintain the purported ""growth"" in number of users. (And in a certain sense, they are doing what all companies with ""saturated"" markets do.. a futile attempt to pull future demand into the present; which of course -- to the extent that it succeeds anyway -- really just moves the inevitable ""dropoff"" that much closer.) --- \* EDIT: And in addition (not surprisingly) it looks like Pareto principle, which tends to be recursive. Of the roughly 20% (~16%) ""unique"" visitors during the month, probably the majority of them (roughly 80% of the 16%) engaged in minimal activity, with only some 20% of it (and thus somewhere round 3.2%~4%) of the total user base being truly ""active"", and then again, probably only 20% of *that* (maybe at or under 1%) were of the *hyper*-""active"" users that everyone thinks facebook'ers are."
