"Since I can't vote up the answer yet, I will agree with it here. I find the best tactic when you call is to tell them you have an offer in hand and will use it if they don't match the rate exactly or discount it enough to save you the trouble of going through the process of a balance transfer. So if they balk and say ""No,"" then walk and go (to the in hand offer). Just remember, the worst they can say is ""No."" If you don't even bother to ask, it's as if you did and they said ""No,"" as either scenario leaves you with the same result: an unchanged interest rate."
