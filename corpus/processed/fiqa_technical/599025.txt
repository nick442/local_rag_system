"I know that's always going to be the thing that people are talking about when they claim that not enough people go to jail for financial crimes.

It's arguable that the Feds should have tried harder to find ways to accuse specific people of crimes, but the actual housing price crisis was caused by a widespread belief that housing prices just couldn't collapse as much as they did in any circumstance. That set off a chain reaction that had never happened before in any known modern economy. If you really want to go after everyone involved, it would include everyone from bankers to economists to home buyers who bought more house than they could afford, generally by lying about their income on ""stated income"" mortgages."
