"This is only true if you define ""intrinsic value"" to mean backed by an asset. I think that is a stupid definition, and so too do lawmakers and economists which is why we abolished the gold standard. There is intrinsic demand for dollars because of US federal law, to me an asset with automatic government-backed demand has intrinsic value because I don't believe people and companies will suddenly decide to be tax delinquents en masse."
