For the hundredth time? Your argument was that no one would pay anyone for weed once it got decriminalized. Like you said, you *can* grow carrots and potatoes legally and yet people still go to supermarkets and pay for them. Thus, your argument makes no sense. There still will be value for weed in the market.
