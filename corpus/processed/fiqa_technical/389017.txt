"It would be nice if Microsoft would invest in the freaking local infrastructure that supports all these workers. Currently our local elementary school is overrun by the kids of H1-B workers. I don't particularly care that they are H1-B's or anyone else's kids, but the school has 800 kids and was built to support 450. Because there is nice and reasonably affordable new housing (under $600k) with a ""gold ribbon"" school, the H1-B immigrants are flocking to the neighborhood, so all other schools are at or below capacity and ours is overflowing. The main problem is that since all of the other schools are ""OK"" and all of the H1-B's in our neighborhood can't vote, a levy can't be passed in order to build any new schools. So we're fucked."
