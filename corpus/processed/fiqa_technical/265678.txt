Tesla is losing money due to crazy capex setting up the Model 3 production line (>$2B). [Their gross margin for the S and X is ~25%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/08/03/tesla-beats-estimates-forecasts-attractive-margins-on-model-3/#32c3d21f2d53) and the same is expected for the Model 3. They have an order backlog of $18B that is still growing. That doesn't look like a company in trouble.
