I suppose if it's been raining, I'd swap my tires for some nice CX tires, but really. my road tires can handle a bit of mud. I mostly don't go near them in the rain (only a couple of months of the year around here) because they're on top of big hills and I don't trust my skills descending the roads to/from them in the rain/on wet pavement.
