Seriously. Lately it seems like it's shrinking as well. Just last night I figured I'd pop on and watch a couple episodes of MASH, nope gone. Ok, maybe start another binge of Futurama, nope first 5 seasons are gone. Ok, fine I'll just go back and pick up on Bones, nope another one with the first 5 seasons gone. Oh but hey, there are a bunch of WW2 propaganda movies and stand up specials that were just added.
