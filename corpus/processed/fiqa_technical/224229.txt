I just briefly looked into the gravity battery and it looks like a pain in the neck engineering wise. Making that economically viable with the requirement to replace the installed base seems unfeasible. Also it doesn't seem to take care of one of the main issues - transportation. Running electricity through wires is extremely inefficient because the wires have a certain amount of resistance. So energy company try to minimize the amount of wires used by localizing power plants. For solar and wind, which are efficiency is dependent on region, transportation is the real issue for widespread adoption
