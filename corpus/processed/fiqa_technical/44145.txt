Car rental chains are so dependent on location/airport.. I could tell you that I prefer Budget, cheap, easy to deal with, great cars, etc., but someone could reply to me and tell me Budget murdered their dog. But with that said, I do prefer Budget in most areas.. even if my first car choice isn't available, they have other great options: 1. Mustang convertible 2. Mustang 3. Charger RT 4. Camaro Those are my preferences with them (in order). Be warned though if you've never been in a Camaro.. a Mustang feels like a fucking Suburban compared to a Camaro.
