My problem is these massive national/global companies don't give a shit about their employees. Why care where there's a thousand more that will work harder for less. They are taking advantage of us. If your business cannot sustain itself while properly paying it's workers, it isn't a business that should exist. Why do I need to make shit when my CEO makes millions upon millions. Trickle down my ass.
