Shouldn't all pieces from think tanks be thoroughly fact-checked? Whether it be CATO, Center for American Progress, Brookings, Heritage, or AEI, it seems reckless to me to publish their pieces without fact-checking. I don't even fault Stephen Moore for this. His job is to spread certain economic views.(ones that I tend to disagree with strongly, but that's his job) If a news publication is to go by the assumption that what he publishes isn't dubious (or sometimes factually incorrect), I think it's their fault.
