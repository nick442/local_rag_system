"n1. go to tradeworx.com and you can read some papers. 2. Revenues of hft have gone down substantially. About 15 years ago the total market was around 7 billion, it has dropped to 1 billion this year. 3. ""no goods or valuable services are produced.- That is false. hft provides liquidity and low spreads. There is a reason why you can buy or sell a share of a stock and the spread is 1 penny. One of the main reasons to go public is to have the secondary market liquid. There is a reason you can instantly sell or buy a stock..
