I use the following: DealNews.com - A general deals site. SlickDeals.net - A general deals site. Lots of activity in their forums. CheapAssGamer.com - Great for gaming deals. They have a price tracker that shows the best prices for a game across multiple stores. Groupon.com - A deal of the day type site. RetailMeNot.com - A coupon code aggregator. TheFind.com - A shopping search site. You can filter for free shipping, sales, or coupons. IMShopping.com - A site that lets you submit a description of the item you're looking for. Actual humans respond with links to the best deals that they could find. I've had good results.
