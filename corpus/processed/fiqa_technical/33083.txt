Buying and selling cars a lot is something that makes money if you are a dealer but usually doesn't if you are not. The question to ask yourself is why you want to sell it. If it is because you are feeling poor and need money, it might make sense to sell it, particularly if you don't need it. But $12k or whatever is not a ton of money. If you do need a car and will have to replace it if you sell it then selling it is likely not a good idea. If it is because you want a nicer car and can afford to upgrade, then selling it is likely a good idea. The fact that you have had it for years and not paid off the loan tells me this situation is unlikely. You should think of the value of your car to you (and the potential cost of replacing it) and the amount of money you owe on it as two different things. The debt you have is a debt that you will need to pay no matter what you do with the car or how its value changes. The value of the car to you is pretty much a separate issue from how much you have outstanding in debt. If you want to sell the car to pay off the debt that is fine if you don't need the car or if you can get a suitable replacement car for MUCH less (which I find unlikely).
