I would stay away form these. I have had clients gave real problems when it comes to withdrawing the money..not only do you not have control of the investments themselves, but you also do not have a lot of control when it comes time to withdraw the money. I have also heard from one client that the fees can be outrageous. There was a securities commission investigation a few years back because a number of salespeople were over-promising. My suggestion would be to find someone independent, with access to a number of different products, who can advise you.
