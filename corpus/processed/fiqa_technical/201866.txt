"We get HelloFresh and, for the most part, really like it. From opening the box to sitting down and eating, we spend about 35 minutes - typical dishes used are a couple pans and a cutting board. To mix things up, we tried Blue Apron for a couple weeks.. hated it. Exactly as you say: ""15 minutes prep time"" was more like 40 minutes. The meals were just okay overall and the portions on average were smaller than HelloFresh. HelloFresh has definitely had some misses.l, but we've enjoyed most of the meals. Long term, we plan to still get a box 1-2x per month. We save all the recipe cards from meals we like and then buy twice the ingredients at the supermarket to remake them."
