Definitely not with gift cards and to a lesser degree not even with debit cards. For most transactions they work the same but you'll run into problems when dealing with situations where a hold is placed that's higher than the transaction amount. This is the norm with gas purchases--at the time you run the card you don't know how much gas you're going to pump so they put through an authorization for some fixed amount--say $75 or $100. If you do not have this much available it will fail and you can't use the card to purchase the gas. Unless you're living paycheck to paycheck the debit card should work in this case but the gift card very well might not. I've also seen this happen on a larger scale with a car rental. A co-worker only had a debit card--and the substantial hold the rental car place wanted to put on the card was unacceptable.
