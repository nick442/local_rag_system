I'm still short UVXY since a couple reverse splits ago, but I start to worry when everyone is shorting VIX, with VIX now under 10, and even VIX futures a few months out around 13. As far as VIX calls; I wouldn't play VIX options myself unless it's very near term (weeklies) and done as a quick trade at opportune times. This big trade however was an interesting approach.
