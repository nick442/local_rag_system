I was with you until you started talking about the state doing this. How about we repeal some of the regulations you cited, and we allow more competition. The natural monopoly bullshit is exactly that. Before the governments started granting monopolies, there were multiple electric companies in each major city. This is EXACTLY what is need in telcos. Lift the monopolies and let people compete. If the government lays the fiber, they will almost certainly grant a monopoly ( do you remember AT&T ).
