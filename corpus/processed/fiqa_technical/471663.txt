This almost seems worse than Google buying HTC's phone division outright. 2000 HTC designers and engineers are now Google employees, yet, HTC still claims they'll be able to design and build phones. $1 billion cash and 1/5 of their labor pool gutted. It will be interesting to see how it pans out for HTC.
