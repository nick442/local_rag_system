Dallas. I didn't say comfortable, I said happy. Being poor was much harder than not (thankfully, we're not any more) but we were fine and we never took (although we could have) govt assistance beyond standard tax credits. My wife is a great cook, she works wonders on a budget and there are creative ways to handle childcare, transportation and schedules as some here have already mentioned.
