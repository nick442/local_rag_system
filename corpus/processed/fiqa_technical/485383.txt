>Now a crucial thing here is that while the 20-24 cohort is the largest now, in a few years, the largest group will be those of prime-age workers: 25-29, the age when people really begin to earn better money and buy homes and cars. Unless- 1) Those jobs are still being done by baby boomers, or have sent offshore/ eliminated by robots, google, etc 2) That extra money goes to paying down student loans instead of consumer purchases. 3) Interest rates rise. At all. Pushing monthly costs for homeownership from unjustifyable to truly unaffordable.
