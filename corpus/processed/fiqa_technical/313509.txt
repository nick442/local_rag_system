No link ~ I agree. That's the average style of marketing on social that most small business owners and clients do. I had a social media client I was managing. I provided them with authentic and creative content. All for brand awareness tailored to generate real live traffic into the business. It was doing well until they canceled my service because they felt that the lower tier text based discount and promotion content would be better. ~ Its sad that the average entrepreneur does not understand the principles of providing authentic real value over cheapening their business to make a buck. Its not a long term mentality.
