The reddit staff is just being lazy on this one. Google has had to deal with people gaming the search business for years. It's an extremely hard problem to solve but a good company doesn't choose the nuclear option of just banning entire, credible domains. They come up with algorithms to deal with it. At the very least, if reddit wants to be seen as a beacon of information sharing and democracy, they need to post publicly what it is they're doing. Creating a secret list and keeping it from the public, well, that's kind of like Nixon's version of democracy.
