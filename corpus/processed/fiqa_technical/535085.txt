I literally never opened the official books a single time for any of the three levels. Schweser Notes and QBank for level 1, wiley for level 2, and Schweser Notes for level 3 (don't waste money on QBank for 2 or 3). Do those readings and as many practice exams as you can find, mixing and matching from different providers.
