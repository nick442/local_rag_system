> In fact, a part of me is ready to accept America becoming what France and the UK are now, still having relatively good standards of living but nowhere near the height of their historical powers. Problem will be maintaining that lifestyle without that power level. The rest of the western world has a high standard of living in stable, safe conditions in at least some significant part because they live under the US security umbrella, and we win the ability to dictate terms in a lot of situations by virtue of being able to back up our policies militarily. We don't have anyone else to benefit from the strength of the way France & the UK benefited from us; it's not hugely likely there'll be the sort of bipolar or monopolar world after the US decline, but the lack of a single heavyweight might bode poorly for international security.
