I think you just hit the nail on the head as to why I enjoy it so much. I find I have a much lower attention span to music played digitally, the fact I have the power to skip songs, queue other artists. Even though I tend to be pickier with my Vinyl purchases I still struggle to listen to the same albums through Spotify.
