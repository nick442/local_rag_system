An ingredients statement would be required on bulk packed product but not retail packages. —All,“ —Pure,“ or —100 percent,“ may not be used if partially defatted beef fatty tissue (PDBFT), is used or mechanically separated species (MSS), are used. http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/larc/Policies/Labeling_Policy_Book_082005.pdf
