"The debt isn't ""paid off"" until you've brought the balance back to zero. If you pay less than the full amount, some goes to pay down the balance and some goes to paying interest on the balance, and you're left with a debt on the account (which you add to if you continue using the card or reduce when you make a payment to the card.) Note that the ""grace period"" in which you can pay off recent charges without paying interest is often available only when you have paid off the card in full.. so carrying a balance costs you money on new charges immediately. Check your statements and plan paperwork to see if this applies to you; if it does that's another reason to pay off this debt as quickly as possible. Not to mention that credit card interest rates tend to be moderately obscene."
