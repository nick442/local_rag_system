">> Boy, you are so disappointed that Trump cut the debt more than any other president in this short time.. because ""it not enough""? > What are you talking about? Did you read what I said at all or are you just projecting your insecurity? Yes I read what you wrote, including the example with the cookies. But the correct example here and what's happening with Trump, is that he DID enact fiscal changes, he DOES fight corruption and waste, he does invest, and you can ALREADY see the results."
