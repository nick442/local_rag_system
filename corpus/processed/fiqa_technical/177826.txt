Mr. Swatch Nicholas Hayek first stated around 2004 that he wanted to reduce supplying movement kits (ebauches) and hair-springs to other brands for the betterment of the Swiss watch industry. Of course there is competitive reasons for not supplying your direct competitors with the most essential parts of their product. Hayek, despite being ridiculously successful and wealthy, was one of the better men in Swiss industry. He is missed. His son (who's running things) on the other hand is a bit of an ass. I wish I had some references I could supply, but it's buried in a wall of paper watch magazines.
