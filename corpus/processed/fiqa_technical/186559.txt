Batteries that are stored for long periods of time will most likely lose their charge, a natural process that occurs over extended periods of time. Simply charge any batteries that have not been used for extended periods of time. This will avoid sudden power shut downs, resulting from weak batteries. This also applies to batteries left in laptops that are plugged in for long periods of time.
