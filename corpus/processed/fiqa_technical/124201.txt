This is a topic which requires a lot of reading, but here's a place to start: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/EXTDECSTAMAN/0,,contentMDK:20908551~menuPK:2648276~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2077967~isCURL:Y,00.html Essentially, (in an effort to make the GDP more accurate), we adjust it for things like inflation. The problem is that our inflation numbers were severely affected by changes Clinton made, including Hedonics. GDP is adjusted by a inflation model that is different than our inflation reporting, meaning that the two do not represent comparable data, (which is why we can have a growing GDP but an apparent loss of purchasing power, even when the GDP growth isn't being concentrated in the already wealthy). GDP itself is a concept that was introduced by Keynes, and is itself of limited utility, something Keynes himself talked about. It should never be used as a universal measure of economic health, although that's what we pretend it is today.
