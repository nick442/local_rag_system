"As Yishani points out, you always have to do due diligence in buying a house. As I mentioned in this earlier post I'd highly recommend reading this book on buying a house associated with the Wall Street Journal - it clearly describes the benefits and challenges of owning a house. One key takeaway I had was - on average houses have a ""rate of return"" on par with treasury bills. Its best to buy a house if you want to live in a house, not as thinking about it as a ""great investment"". And its certainly worth the 4-6 hours it takes to read the book cover to cover."
