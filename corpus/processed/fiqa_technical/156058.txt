"As somebody who just went through making these arrangements, I got the title right away. I understand is a business, but when you got fees for ""bringing flowers to the grave"" then you know you're in for a scam. Best part is when you tell them, ""well, look, I want the most economical cremation box."" Yes, we have one that's only 100 dollars, but you're not able to put any engraving on it. And how much is the one where you can put an engraving on.. oh, those start at 200 dollars, but on those, we can just put the name; people love to put a dedication, and those urns start at 250, and they go up depending on the dedication..blah blah blah.. I mean, wtf; i think we paid 50 bucks to have a tropy engraved, and you're going to tell me an urn is minimum 200 dollars, and price increases the more text you engrave? Anyway..yea, is really a fucking pain in the ass to go to these places. Is like buying a car, but man, fucking worse cause you're all stressed out dealing with death and all the family drama. I just wanted to go in, go out. Nope, spent at least 1 an hour trying to get upsells. And then these assholes tell you, we are very understanding and compassionate, we will help you in makign the right decision. More like, we will try to steer you to make the most expensive arrangement. Bunch of fucking assholes."
