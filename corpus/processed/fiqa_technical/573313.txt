The way I read the title, I thought the game was trading stocks in other Redditors. For example, you could invest a certain amount in other redditors, and depending on the net karma for the duration of the game you would make gains or losses. You could put all your money into someone with a two month old account and hope they hit the front page, or invest in someone like Forthewolfx and have a safe bet that you'd have at least marginal increases. Studying trends on the redditors past posts would influence you to buy or sell. Then I realized this would pretty much be impossible to pull off, and that I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about.
