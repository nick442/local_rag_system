You do not hold leveraged ETF for longer than a few days. You have UGAZ and DGAZ, both 3x leveraged, one longs one shorts. What happens if you buy both? You don't get 0% return. In fact, you get -10% return if you hold both for 3 months. No matter what happens, they both go down in long term. Call it Leverage Decay, Beta Slippage, Contango, Rollover, etc. If you want to gamble that NG goes up within 3 days, go ahead. Just be prepared for the worst cases like losing 15% in 3 days. If you want to speculate the NG will recover in a year, buy Natural Gas industry ETF http://www.ftportfolios.com/retail/etf/etfsummary.aspx?Ticker=FCG
