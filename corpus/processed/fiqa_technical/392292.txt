You do realize that the deficit grew as a factor of the GDP faster under the last couple of GOP administration's than it did under the last couple of Dem administration's? Hook, line and sinker. The GOP thinks that they can talk about deficit neutral bills and people won't see all the tax cuts for the wealthy which add to if not accelerate the deficit.. Shoot, just compare the deficit of to states like Kansas and Missouri to see how GOP run states fare..
