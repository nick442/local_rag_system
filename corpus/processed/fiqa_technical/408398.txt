I understand that it is an evil people have to put up with. I would still bitch about it regardless of whether it is something I use or not (CFDs, which I think are dangerous, should not be banned IMO). But then again, this is off topic. On the issue, to my understanding (and putting aside whether the 25k minimum applies to futures or future options as well), if you buy an option on a future, and if it works anything like a stock option in terms of paying a premium for a right to buy the underlying security (call option), then technically you would have the RIGHT, but not obligation to buy a future at a past price. I am not an export on futures or options, but from my understanding, that is what I understood future options to be . I first heard about them from Jim Rogers in hot commodities.
