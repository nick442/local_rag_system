"The UTMA is actually very liberal in how custodians can spend the money: ""A custodian may deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the minor's benefit so much of the custodial property as the custodian considers advisable for the use and benefit of the minor . . . ."" A custodian might reasonably consider expending the UTMA money on groceries the benefit the child, for instance."
