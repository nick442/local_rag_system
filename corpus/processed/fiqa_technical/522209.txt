One theory I've heard on INTC is that it's part of a widely held pair trade with [QCOM](http://www.google.com/finance?q=QCOM), which does appear near the top of the list on the [opposite list of GS VIP long holdings](http://www.marketfolly.com/2012/05/goldman-sachs-vip-list-most-important.html). I don't own INTC or QCOM, but this trade doesn't make much sense to me. While INTC is lagging in mobile, it still has exposure to it, and its [valuation is at the lowest level in 10 years](http://ycharts.com/companies/INTC/price#series=type:company,id:INTC,calc:price,,id:INTC,type:company,calc:pe_ratio&zoom=10&startDate=&endDate=&format=real&recessions=false). A pure long play on QCOM or even AAPL seems like it makes much more sense for this thesis, and avoids having to pay INTC's 3.3% dividend. Disclosure: I don't own INTC, QCOM. Long AAPL.
