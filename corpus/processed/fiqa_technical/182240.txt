It is possible that the person you were on the phone with was in possession of the credentials of a paypal account that was not actually theirs. The sad truth is that there are a lot of scammers out there and they can be very convincing while talking to you on their burner phone. Then they send you money and before the actual owner of the account can do anything the scammer gets you to surrender your goods. Then the payment gets reversed and when you call that phone number they used no one answers, or the phone is not in service. For this reason do not release the product until you actually have the money. For software work use an escrow account at a reputable bank to ensure that the funds will be available when you complete the work.
