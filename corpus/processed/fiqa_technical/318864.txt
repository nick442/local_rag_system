"Step one: keep this information from friends and family, or ar least state a lower number when asked how much you inherited. It can be amazing how many old friends and family members come crawling out of the woodwork. I'm also a college student, so I dont have much experience under my belt to give you a ""good"" advice. All I can say is put it into liquid assets (if you decide to invest). I've had major car repairs and medical emergencies I never had to sweat because I could just pull a relarively large lump sum out. Or say ""fuck it"" and blow it on hookers and cocaine in Cancun. You're your own person. Good luck!"
