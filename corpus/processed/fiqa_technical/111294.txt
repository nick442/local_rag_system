This chart showing percentage of smartphone market by operating system is interesting: https://www.statista.com/statistics/266136/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-operating-systems/ It shows that Apple has a cyclical trend where the percentage of smartphones sold by Apple peaks in the 4th quarter of every year at around 20% and then gradually goes down to around 15% in the 3rd quarter of each year. Apple basically survives on a fad-like cycle very similar to automobiles where a new model overcomes the price difference with primarily android phones to create a surge of buyers each year around Christmas.
