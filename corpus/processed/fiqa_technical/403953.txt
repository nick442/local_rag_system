I was just clarifying cause t3tsubo thought that BamBamCam was taking a jab at Warren Buffett when he was just mentioning Buffett Sr's wish to pass the company to Howard in a non executive role. I've got no problem with small businesses doing it, hell the children probably have more passion for the business anyways. But yes, I would say this practice becomes a little more dicey with huge/public companies
