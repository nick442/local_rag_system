erm.. a) H1b applications went down over 90% in the last two years because the US does not offer anything better anymore (keep in mind, H1b means a Corp. vouchers for you and you can only stay as employee in the country, you can switch employer but you can't just start a startup or something. fired and no new employer? you get kicked out of the country. which also happens 6 years later no matter what because the visa only lasts 3+3 years and is a lottery so applying doesnt mean you actually get it. so why come in the first place?) b) H1b visa holders must be payed appropriate. c) if I can get hired by MS in the US, I can also work for a US office anywhere else, and they have plenty. d) H1b means you have either 4 years university possibly with degree or you can prove that you worked 3 years for each university year and have therefore a minimum of 12 years job experience in the field you're hired. again, if Microsoft, why in the US? pay in your own country is probably better. the whole worker visa system is doomed. they should give out IT greencards like Germany tried it many years ago to bring in foreign talent. a visa that is not chained to the employer that vouched for you but let's you open up a startup and stay for longer. h1b pretty much let's you stay in a country that takes taxes for you, you have to obey their laws but you get no benefits and 6 years later you get kicked out. if you want to come back after 6 years you have to stay out at least 1 years, then you're allowed to participate again in the yearly H1b lottery which means almost 2 years after you got kicked out you might win again and you can return to work for the company. seriously, would you like to be in that situation? building a life in a new country with a countdown attached to it? (I just left the US after 6 years on H1b) edit: btw. they are already charging 8 or 12k since 2012 per application. up from 1500 - one of the explanations why applications are down.
