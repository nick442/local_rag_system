Trade credit is fine and works without a central bank. All it needs is contract law. The perversion of that is using trade credit collected from somebody else to pay for goods and services mandated by the government as legal tender. That creates false savings that expand exponentially. It probably wouldn't happen much in a free market unless bought at a steep discount by the person receiving it. This is how collection companies work, they buy receivables from telephone companies or other businesses at a steep discount and try to collect on them. In a non-fiat system there would be plenty of trade credit, because how else are you going to drum up business? Personal relationships would ensure that debts were made good, everyone in the economy would be a banker with their own money or goods. I'm not saying we need libertarian minarchist government here for any of this to work. The government could intervene from time to time and tax to build infrastructure or raise a military for defence or whatever they really wanted but at least they wouldn't be creating booms and busts with their borrowing activity.
