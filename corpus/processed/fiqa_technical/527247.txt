"Hitting air-bridged systems has been done before. It requires copious resources, time and patience. [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet#Operation) did it by infecting the windows system used to program the air bridged system, embedding itself on the code, which eventually got dumped onto a floppy, and finally crossed the ""air"" onto the issolated system. But as I said, in this case the point is mute, cause once you gain physical access to the ATM, you gain access to the money."
