To be fair, I learned about HN on Reddit myself, and I would say it has made me think twice about commenting superfluously. (Not that I don't, I just do it less now) I was thinking I could just mention it and the people who were truly interested would search for it, it's almost the same title there as here. But then I got downvoted hard so fuck it.
