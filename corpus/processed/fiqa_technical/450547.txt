"Leaving the issue of purchasing gift cards aside, xeroxing the coupons and reusing them is fraud. Your statement that ""well Target should have made unique coupon codes, they have more knowledge so it's on them"" opens a very dangerous path. If someone makes copies of dollar bills (but generates new, fake serial numbers since those are unique) it shouldn't be fraud because the government should have known better? If you read the actual thread (plus it's mentioned in the article) there are discussions of timing ""raids"" to catch cashier shift changes, people going from Target to Target, *people wearing disguises*, etc. How is that not clearly people knowing that what they were doing was fraudulent?"
