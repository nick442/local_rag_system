Ha, I thought you would backpeddle. An indefensible stance is indefensible unfortunately, sorry bro. I can't imagine how your mind works if you don't see this clearly. Life must be rough seeing it through shit stained glasses. Get some help, boy. Look, if muslims weren't running around fucking people up, I wouldn't give a fuck about them. I'd leave them in peace. But that's not the case and we both know it. Trying to hide it is insanity. And if you happen to be one of the good muslims, I feel bad for you. I really do. But you have to realize you are part of a terrorist organization, not a religion, and you need to get out and find something else to worship if you really need it.
