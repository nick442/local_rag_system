"Nowadays, some banks in some countries offer things like temporary virtual cards for online payments. They are issued either free of charge or at a negligible charge, immediately, via bank's web interface (access to which might either be free or not, this varies). You get a separate account for the newly-issued ""card"" (the ""card"" being just a set of numbers), you transfer some money there (same web-interface), you use it to make payment(s), you leave $0 on that ""card"" and within a day or a month, it expires. Somewhat convenient and your possible loss is limited tightly. Check if your local banks offer this kind of service."
