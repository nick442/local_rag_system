You can't say I'm wrong and then go on to explain why exactly what I said is correct. :) You (and I) are in complete agreement that there's no LTCG on either Roth *or* Traditional 401ks, because you pay both as straight income - The former up front, the latter when you withdraw it. My point was that, for virtually everyone, their regular income tax rate is **higher** than their LTCG rate.
