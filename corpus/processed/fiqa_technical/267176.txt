"Individual product prices do not necessarily rise at inflation rates. What inflation means is that the purchasing power of one unit of currency decreases by x% in a year, which is typically measured by looking at a broad spectrum of products in an economy and extrapolating to ""all products"". So for all products across an economy, the aggregate price of all goods will, on average, be X% higher that they were this time last year. Some products will be cheaper, some will be more expensive, but on average their prices will rise with inflation rates. For the other part of your question, inflation is an annualized percentage, so an inflation rate of 12% means prices are 12% higher than they were a year ago, so if you extrapolate that linear trend, prices will rise (again, on average) 1% in a month."
