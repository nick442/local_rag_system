Well said, but I disagree with this: >All natural means having no teeth and dying in your 20s-30s. That depends entirely upon the era and civilization. Also, many of the chemical 'enhancements' you mention are really just to allow you to function given an unhealthy diet. They're just bringing you to a level of function that's less below what it would have been had you lived a healthy lifestyle (and not been unlucky to get some horrible disease).
