ZeroHedge is valuable because it provides an alternative perspective. I rarely, if ever, agree with their conclusions or make investments motivated by them; but they are sometimes insightful and bring up datapoints of interest. Most financial journalism is written by non-finance people; that's why it's so shitty and useless.
