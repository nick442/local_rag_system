"> Bernie wasn't even accountable to his own donors, that's why they're suing him ;) Haha silly boy.. lame joke, but donors are suing the DNC, not Bernie. >The only solution is for the government to stop inserting itself between people and Healthcare. Only then with direct pricing, lower barriers to entry, private charity and consumer choice can we lower costs. Cartels only exist because of state mandated regulation, patent law and government mandated Healthcare. You have been sold the ""freedom"" pill by corporations that want their Ayn Rand puppets in the Republican party to do exactly what you are proposing. How will consumer choice improve if you let health insurance companies set their own rules? how will you lower barriers to entry when behemoths like Aetna and co. can come in and swallow up competitors whole? where are the private charities that help poor black kids in forgotten areas? (unless you think they are sub-human and don't deserve any help). How can we keep corporations accountable when we let their cartels, monopolies, and oligopolies do what they please with our lives? You live in a fantasy world where all of a sudden Jonny Schmoe Insurance will swoop in and create more affordable choices for all. You are deluded if you think this is how the real world works. Cartels exist because if you don't put up barriers to profit seekers, they will seek to accumulate more and more, and they will seek to consolidate more and more power and market share. Government officials are simply a commodity they have to buy, or else consumers/communities might actually organize and have a voice against their rapacious quest for MOAR. Without that representative ""public servant"", they could give three shits about appeasing anybody but their shareholders. It is the wet dream of assholes like Trump and his tea party Ayn Rand sociopaths."
