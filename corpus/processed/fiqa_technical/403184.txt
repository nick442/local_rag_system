> Our corporations pay some of the lowest taxes in the world, with some of the larger ones actually paying none. No, they don't. The top marginal rate for income taxes is 38%. Meanwhile, in the Republic of Ireland, rates vary from 12.5 - 25% depending on the exact source of the income. So, no, 'our' corporations do not pay the lowest taxes in the world. As far as them paying 'none', that stems from one of two things: one, corporations that pay out all their money in salaries and therefore have no retained earnings (hence, all their money is taxed at the individual level, and workers get socked at a full 35%), and two, corporations that create a price-transfer agreement with a foreign corporation so that income is shifted to a low-tax region where they end up paying nothing to Uncle Sam. That money will still be taxed if they ever try to bring it home and distribute it .. but as long as it stays overseas then no one can touch it because, technically, it hasn't been earned as income yet. That's how companies avoid greedy bastards trying to take their money -- because contrary to your opinion, you're not actually entitled to any of their money, or anyone else's money either. It's not 'your' money, or 'our' money, its 'their' money -- and they have an effective method to make sure it stays that way. > Btw, if wanting decent opportunity to take care of me and mine is greed, then yes, I'm greedy. You can already do that -- it's called getting a fucking job and living within your means. You don't **DESERVE** anything in life -- you have to earn it. No one is obligated to just **GIVE** you things just because you want them. Ultimately, this whole 'lets sock it to the rich' attitude doesn't actually take any money out of their pockets .. the only people harmed are workers who can't take advantage of the methods they use to shift income overseas. In short: you're not simply wrong, you're criminally ignorant.
