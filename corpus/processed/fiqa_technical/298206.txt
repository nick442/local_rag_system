First, what is waste? Is waste defined purely as financial waste? If we were to choose this definition, running electricity to houses is ridiculously wasteful. Same with running water. Itâ€™d be easier to setup hubs for every resource and ship them to the hubs. People can either pay more for personal delivery, or can come to the hub to get their resources. That would be financially efficient.
