>I just wish people who hate on keynesian policies (which while not perfect, are not as terrible as people point them out to be) would at least acknowledge that Keynes advocated maintaining budget surpluses when the economy is doing fine/alright. I do acknowledge that. However, the powers that be that implement Keynesian policies these days don't see that. Nor do they recognize that Keynes advocated strategic spending to stimulate the economy. I support what he called for, but he would probably be rolling in his grave if he saw the shit our politicians were doing in his name. I assume we agree with each other on this? We are in a major depression but after years of massive deficit spending we are almost powerless to use any real keynesian policies that could really help us.
