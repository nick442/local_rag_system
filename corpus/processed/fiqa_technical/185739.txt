Not an HLS-er myself, but that's basically my experience with HLS students/grads as well. There are many HLS grads who are mind-numbingly brilliant and provide a unique contribution to their focus or organization. There are also plenty who kept their head downs for 20 years and kept perfect grades, but who just apply existing techniques to known problems and add no unique value over a cheaper counterpart from a lower-ranked school (other than maybe social connections to other HLS grads).
