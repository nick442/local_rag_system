Something doesn't have to be defective to return it to Walmart. You can return it for any reason. This let's you buy something and if it doesn't work out for any reason, return it. I end up doing this at Walmart for all kinds of reasons. You can't do this with Amazon. If you try to return something to Amazon that isn't defective they will want you to pay the shipping.
