"It's a separate conversation but I struggle as a remote worker. I work for an enlightened company and so I am remote 90 percent of the time. I also have no prescribed schedule outside of calendared teleconference meetings. There is no question I am more efficient when engineering or doing technical work at home. And I get paid more than I can spend. My friends are all jealous. But honestly I think a lot about getting a different job, even if it means a paycut. Six years in, I miss working together with people. When the job is stressful there's no one to joke with and no way to get perspective. As a remote worker I feel disconnected and expendable because no one understands what I do or how hard I work. Maybe I'm just burnt out, but I think I'm over it. I never get to go home and turn it off because I essentially live at my workplace. I want my employer to get the fuck out of my house. That said I could never do productive work in an ""open office"". Fuck."
