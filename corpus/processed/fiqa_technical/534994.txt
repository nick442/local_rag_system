ok as it goes here on reddit and across the world, thanks for offering a host of reasons as to why, what worked in the past wouldnt work again. It is easy to knock what worked in past, note the victorians, the US 1930's-1970's. So Now why dont you offer a viable alternative. let me just say a couple of things you while your thinking about it. Without the middle class, there is no real working class (only slaves), without disposable income in the hands of the masses there is no market, thus no production, thus no more profit for the 1%.(and only slaves, slaves have no money they cannot buy the production, a slave is a working man without disposable income) The Rich are not producing, they are hording. The middle class are been screwed totally. Many small business'are folding due to the extreme lack of funding as ll the funds are held in speculations. this has all happened many times before in the history of man and money you should know that. Temporary jobs lead to the creation of more jobs, which lead to the creation of more jobs, disposable income leads to more jobs. And just in case you have not noticed, we have mass unemployment unlike ever in the history of mankind, and it is not looking to get any better.
