Zimbabwe's stock market also did very well until people realised that it wasn't the companies that where doing well, it was inflation pushing the prices up. Chavez has price controls on tons of stuff so it is difficult to see the inflation he's causing, I bet it's the same thing in Venezuela, only on a lesser scale.
