I always considered the fast casual criteria to be a lack of a drive-thru and food prepared after you order, I never thought the decor factored into it. The Smashburgers I've been in weren't much fancier than Five Guys, and most Chipotles are relatively plain as well. Meanwhile, the decor of most new Culvers are just as nice or nicer than Panera and the like.
