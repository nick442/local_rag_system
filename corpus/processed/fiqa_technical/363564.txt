The key is measuring. Like any project you need to evaluate a baseline, make a change, then re-evaluate. Otherwise you are blindly spending money to save, or worse, being manipulated by advertising. Like Chris W. Rea said before me, using a tool like a Kill-A-Watt to measure the effectiveness of what you are about to do is the most important step. For example, if you have an incandescent light bulb in a back part of your basement that you never turn on, it doesn't make much sense to replace that bulb with a $9 LED to save money. If you have an empty freezer in your basement, turn that thing off. Measure your power usage, then you can know for sure what is the most effective action. If you have a family like mine, the best of intentions still leave lights on all day or tvs on a screensaver all night. Invest in simple automation like motion sensing outlets or light switches to automatically turn off power. (It is my full time job to go around a turn off lights, and I want to retire) The biggest payback that I know of is insulation and caulking of your home to make the energy you do use more efficient. If you don't have enough insulation, that is a great place to start. Here is a calculator to estimate the payback of adding insulation. The US government has a cool website with a bunch of tips for saving energy.
