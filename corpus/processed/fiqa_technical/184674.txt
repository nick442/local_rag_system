So this is the point I'm trying to make here. The recruiter and hiring manager WON'T be up front with you because -- whether you'd like to admit it or not -- you are entering a potential business negotiation. They want a good deal. You want a good deal. They are trying to assess your value to their company. You have an idea of your value to them AND other companies. If you think you're worth 100K but I think your worth 50K to me, sorry we can't make this business agreement work. Best of luck. Sincerely no hard feelings. I've got a stack of other resumes and you've got a schedule full of other interviews. We both go on with our lives.
