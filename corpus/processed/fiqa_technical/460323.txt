I can understand if people think I'm showing off. I'm not trying to and I'm extremely sorry if it seems like I am. Trust me, my Beta is probably much larger than it should be relative to my returns. However, I think I can keep the pace up but I just didn't know if this was too short of time to try and make a decision off of or not
