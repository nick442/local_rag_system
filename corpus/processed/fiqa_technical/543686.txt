"Because it ignores several important facts, namely: A) The base value from infrastructure is derived on a per-capita basis. It is a ""fixed cost"" as opposed to a variable one. In other words, roads are just as useful to me as they are to you regardless of my net worth. A tank, a missile, a police officer protects me the same as it does anyone else. B) As a percentage of income, infrastructure is far more valuable to low-income individuals than high-income individuals. A simple example: if I have $5M in net worth, I can invest it in the stock market and stay home. If you don't have that option, you need to go to work and that will likely require roads. I won't be taking unemployment benefits, but you are far more likely to. And so on. C) The activities of business owners generate massive tax revenues. These far outweigh their personal utility from infrastructure. D) Society captures the majority of individual commercial efforts (estimates vary, but typically 85%). In other words, if I generate $10.00 of value as an entrepreneur, I will realistically be able to capture only $1.50 of that. The ""infrastructure"" argument has been shamelessly used to fool low and middle income voters. The truth is that infrastructure benefits these voters (and the government) far more than it does wealthy individuals."
