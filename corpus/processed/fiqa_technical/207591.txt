To answer your question, the $30 and it accrues monthly if you carry the balance forward. However, don't do that. Only use your credit card on things you can immediately pay off right away. Don't pay extra money for things and don't pay for things you can't afford. As a recent college grad, I've seen way too many people have $1,000+ in credit card debt while in school. That's just nutty. If you have any other questions let me know.
