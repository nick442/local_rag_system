I disagree with the other posters, the best sales person has a very easy job, but a great network of connections to clients. The company is paying a lot for the connections, because that's how they make money, and some amount of money for the salesperson's (less technical) work. Depending on how much you trust the management above you to treat you well, you should either continue working hard and hopefully get promoted, or slouch, do no more work than your job requires, and write off any advancement at your current employer.
