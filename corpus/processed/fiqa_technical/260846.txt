Still does, as far as I know. This applies only to hand tools, however. I worked in the Sears paint and hardware departments in high school and college, and at least once a week we'd have someone come in and demand a replacement for a five-year-old saber saw or drill. Sorry, power tools only have (had?) a one-year warranty. Lifetime warranty on power tools would obviously be suicidal.
