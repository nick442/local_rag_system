How frequently do people make the switch from back office to front office for S&T roles like that? WSO says its nearly impossible. I know a guy who went from equity research at MS to trader at JPM; he networked hard and did a huge front office transition. Which is more common out of big front-front transitions and back-to-front on the same floor?
