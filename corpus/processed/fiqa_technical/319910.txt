They are a distributer. They're not doing anything but making products available. If Shimano wants to sell me a reel and I don't like Bass pro now, I'll go to Shimano website. easy. Or you know, another company who can do it better can come along. My main point is this isn't like a utility company that has a monopoly where you only have one choice on how to get gas to heat your home in the winter. That have much different powers and potential problems.
