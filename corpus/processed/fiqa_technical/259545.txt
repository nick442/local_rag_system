I agree with all your points- I'm currently job hunting in cheaper areas so I don't have to financially tread water. I meant that I see a lot of people with nice cars, going out to eat all the time, buying places. I have friends in their 20s buying their first apartment, but I know that they don't make nearly enough money for that from their jobs. Where does the money come from? Am I wrong to assume that their parents pay for everything?
