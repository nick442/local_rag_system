As long as you don't finance and the payment is upfront, its up to you and your customer how to pay. If you provide the product before the payment is being made or finance in any way (i.e.: there's debt), then the Canadian dollar, being legal tender in Canada, must be accepted. Considering the large amount, you would probably not be accepting cash anyway, so the point is moot. How they pay their credit cards is not your problem. However, do take into the account the currency exchange rates and fees that add costs to purchasing your product. If you don't have any physical presence (i.e.: online store only, no physical location on Canadian soil), then it goes by the rules of the jurisdiction where you've incorporated. Check with the local legal professional to be sure.
