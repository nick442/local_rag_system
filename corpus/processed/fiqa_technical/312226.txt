Exactly. That's one of my biggest issues with my company. People seem to think they have a guaranteed job for life and only learn their narrow little task. Many of them push buttons and have no understanding of the task they are performing..they just follow the instructions someone gave them and don't think beyond that. I work in accounting and the woman who sits across from me knows nothing about using Excel. When I suggested that she take a class or read a book, she threw a fit. In her opinion, if the company wants her to use a program, they should hold her hand and spoonfeed the training to her. These are the ones who will be out of a job sooner or later and find out they have no skills that will transfer to another position.
