"Even for me (I keep a fair bit of ""cash"" on hand because I'm self-employed) it would be a challenge to keep 5k in my checking account all the time when it could be in tax-deferred accounts making me money instead. I put the bare minimum in checking every two weeks as I've found when I leave money there it gets spent."
