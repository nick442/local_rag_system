"To answer #3 specifically, there are a number of exemptions from The Individual Shared Responsibility Payment (the ""fine"" or ""penalty"" for being uninsured). One of those is: You lived in a state that didn’t expand its Medicaid program but you would have qualified if it had. That exemption (others may well apply based on income to many people in this category) applies for the entire year if: You live in a state that hasn’t expanded its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act [and] Your income and household size would have qualified you or your family for Medicaid if the state had expanded coverage As such, people who are stuck in the Medicaid gap in those states will not be fined. People in this category also have a special option to enroll in a non-Medicaid plan if their estimated annual income increases later in the year, even outside the normal enrollment period."
