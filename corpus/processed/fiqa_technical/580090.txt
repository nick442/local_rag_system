It'd be interesting to break it out by first-generation college students vs. student's whose parents and immediate family also graduated from college. Oh, also this is looking at students who graduated in '04, and it's well known that the recession hit black people way harder than everyone else (see employment rates). I can see those two things having linked effects.
