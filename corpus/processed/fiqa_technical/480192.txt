Funny you say Toronto (fellow dude from Toronto). It's next to impossible to break even now. With costs so high, you'd seriously lose long term (houses going for 1million+ won't be worth that much for a while once the market crashes). But, the best example I can give. If you would've bought a house in the 80's for 250k, it'd be worth about 1.2 million today, but according to inflation, it's valued at 800k. That's where you make the money, plus whatever you made on rent. Best advice that I can give you, don't invest in real estate as a anything more than a principal residence, because the times now make it very difficult, and you could potentially lose a lot of money (eg. Paying a 1 million dollar mortgage on a house that's not worth that).
