The government won't, as I understand it, it keeps the debt from spiraling out of control. It also promotes spending which keeps our economy from recession (which is a natural occurrence and is needed to shed dead weight). This boosted economy can only last so long, it will eventually keel over dead, again as I understand it - when is a matter for speculation.
