"BINGO! Another egregious example of lobbyists being behind and guiding the actual decision-making process. For the good of democracy, it's tragic and detrimental that so many people are so easily swayed by TV commercials, lawn signs and campaign paraphernalia. Instead of having their vote guided by actual issues that matter, people respond to commercial visibility, ""hot button issues"" and sloganeering. It's the ease with which uniformed voters are manipulated by money that gives lobbyists their ultimate power."
