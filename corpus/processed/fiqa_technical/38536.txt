Got it. I can definitely see how it can come across that way especially with all of these big tech companies lining up against the proposal. My understanding is that a lot of that is more driven by their size than anything else; the media focuses on the impacts to Amazon and Facebook because they're huge companies and it's easier to get information on them. But when it comes to who would get hurt the most by removing NN, it's actually small businesses and startups that would suffer the most. In a world without net neutrality, ISPs would be able to provide access to web services at different speeds. For example, if you are a Comcast customer, if Comcast has a deal with Amazon Prime, they can make it so that your access to competing services like Netflix and Hulu are throttled -- moving so slow that it will be hard to use anything other than Amazon Prime Video. Now, if that happens, it will be annoying for companies like Facebook, Netflix, Google, etc. to have to pay extra for internet users to be able to use them. But they could do it; they have the money. The people who would struggle are people who own smaller businesses and smaller websites; when they're just starting out, they won't have the money to pay the ISPs to let people access them, and as a result they could be essentially locked out of many marketplaces. This is the argument made by people who say that removing net neutrality will stifle small business; removing the regulation would create this built-in structural advantage for large, established businesses and leave smaller businesses locked out.
