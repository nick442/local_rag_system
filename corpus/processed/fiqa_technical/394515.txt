"The mods have been alerted and are on watch. PLEASE report the links yourselves for them. I've also notified them that the ""breaks subreddit's rules"" option is broken -- not allowing you to pick the rule. So feel free to use the spam option. Either way it alerts them..and they've already taken action on the ones I just manually reported! Thanks Mods!"
