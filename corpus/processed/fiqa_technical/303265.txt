We're transitioning over, and the transition team wants to make themselves look good by getting people over to the new computers. They want to blow a ton of money on new VMWare servers getting everyone on VM's because everyone's jobs are still on the old systems, because nothing has really been accomplished. (these systems would only be in use until the transition happens, then trash?) They can't just wait a month until things are ready. Best of all, it may not even be possible because they haven't made a decision, they have until the 1st, and we may not have the manpower or time to even get it done.
