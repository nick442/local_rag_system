Or I am in it for the long hall and am full expecting it to go down again. Probably two or three more times before I retire. Just gotta ride it out and have a stomach for when it goes down. Stick to the plan because history always repeats itself. I think 2007 showed us anything is that the governments will risk massive inflation before it lets the market fail. And if inflation hits you want your money wrapped up in the market to grow at the correct rate.
