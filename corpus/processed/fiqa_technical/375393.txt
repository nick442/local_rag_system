BA though, not BS so you don't have college calculus training? It's good to get some STEM training even if you don't end up working directly developing technological products. Quantitative analysis as a coder might be feasible. I advise you to attempt to get those types of interviews. Learn where you may fall short, and bone up on those areas either formally or informally and keep interviewing. I tutored one student through an Executive MBA at Wharton, and that prepared him to expand his business. And he met several influential people who could help him. The price was out there.. $150,000 over two years of weekends. but I don't know where you are located. That kind of training opens doors to top level firms. I got an MBA myself back in the day, and I got several finance interviews. I found financial people compromised ethically even from just the interviewing process. I decided to go into business for myself however as an IT shop.
