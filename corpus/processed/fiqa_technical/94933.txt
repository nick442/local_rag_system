"> I think there's an extremely slim chance we won't become a South-American style country, with 2-5% owning everything and a brutal police force keeping the poor at bay. Then I guess I know what I need to do: be in that 2%-5%! > You can see glimpses of that possible future today. Ferguson will be an every day occurrence, and it won't be just black people anymore. Ah, this means that security technology and services will be in high demand. Opportunity abounds! I've always thought it would be great if a major metro area went to real shit for a while. I'd love hiring myself out to filthy rich people who have kids at NYU or Georgetown. ""The rails aren't running, and the roads are shut, and food is short, and people are rioting! My poor baby is in her dorm in NYU!"" ""I'd be glad to her out and deliver her to you!"" ""You're such a savior!"" ""That will be 1/4 of your net worth now, and 1/4 when I deliver her."" ""Whaaaaat! That's outrageous!"" ""It's just the market."""
