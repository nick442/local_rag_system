Register an account with multiple transfer services and see who will actually give you the best rate, including any fees charged by the service itself, at the time you want to make the transfer. Research the available methods to get the money into and out of the transfer service to five the lowest cost options, which would ideally be free on both ends. Be patient. It can take a week for money to arrive in your recipients account depending on the methods of getting the money into and out of the transfer service. You might also be called to verify the transaction before it goes through.
