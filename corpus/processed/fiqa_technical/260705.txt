"This is a very vague question and could not be fairly answered without knowing additional details, some examples would be: * What is the total revenue of the non-profit? * What are the total expenses of the non-profit? * What is the effectiveness rate to the ""cause"" of each $1 donated? Non-profit organizations and charities have grown to large scale business operations that are focused on delivering value to their determined cause. The Top 5 largest charities each had total revenues over $3.3 billion in 2012. This included United Way, Goodwill, The Y, and the Salvation Army with the largest being the Y at over $6.2 billion in annual revenue. All of these non-profits bring in enough revenue to be in the Fortune 500 (The 500th company on the list is Newmont Mining Corp at $3.2 billion in revenue). When you consider the scale of these operations I think you need to acquire an experienced CEO that has a career history of leading large and many times multi-national organization. These CEOs command high salaries because of their talent and expertise. I believe when they are passionate about a cause they're willing to take a discount, but you have to understand the term discount proportionately. I made a quick table below just to provide some context and show reference points of several Fortune 500 companies in comparison to The Y, the largest non-profit in total revenue. You can quickly see that a salary of $450,000 for an organization of this size would be a significant discount in comparison to the CEO salaries of comparably sized organization in the for profit world. When considering charitable contributions it is entirely valid to consider the CEO's salary, but also consider the potential value add. For example, if that CEO generates a significantly more effective ratio of utilizing donated $ then it may justify the salary. In some scenarios it is fair to say that $450,000 would be a fair and adequate salary for a CEO running a large scale non-profit. Is this the case for every non-profit? Probably not. It should often be thought of as a function of total revenue and effectiveness of the $ donated.
