Oh, yeah. I'd definitely take an ax to the military; I made a note in my other post that the military has thus far remained unscathed by spending cuts, so I think that's a logical place to start cutting. That, and taking a look at Social Security and Medicare to see if we can _streamline_ the programs and make them more efficient rather than just taking their funding away. Those two programs cost us a shitload of money; but, as they're nearly universally loved, it makes sense to figure out how to make them more efficient.
