yea, and the other half is owned by Berkshire, didn't see op mention that at all. Also, There is something to be said about zero based budgeting, if the military used it, they wouldn't be buying $30k toilets before their fiscal year ends. Although, Kraft was spending hundreds of millions with my company when they were bought, and I was working on the Kraft team. Pretty much anybody over the age of 40 was let go and replaced by the next in line. I was actually the lowest ranking member on the team and at one point I was put in a meeting to explain 100k worth of spend to the new honcho.. that was pretty scary.
