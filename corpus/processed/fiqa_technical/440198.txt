> I insist that their real wealth situation is better than ours because of the consistent positive infusion of foreign wealth from superior physical exports Yes, let's talk real wealth. In real terms, being a net exporter means you work and use real resources to make real goods which you then ship away to improve someone else's standard of living. In return, you get a *smaller* pile of real goods that contribute to your standard of living plus a pile of foreign currency to make up the difference. ..hooray? You're coming out ahead in financial terms but in real terms of trade you're losing. >That's the argument you've been supporting this entire time! Nice pivot, man >: [ Not a pivot at all. Emphasizing the bottom line, which is *real* constraints as opposed to financial. Saying we can't run out of dollars isn't the same thing as saying we can't run *into* other limits. I want to make clear what those limits are. The fact you called it a pivot confirms the need for me to spell it out.
