It’s really hard to interpret the scale of this effect. How many listings does an area need to have for this to hold true? If a town goes from 5 listings to 25 (400% increase!) would that translate to a 15% increase in average rent? Probably not. Percent of total housing stock being listed on Airbnb would probably be a better measurement. At least in NYC, the city of perpetually too high rent, the rate of rent increases has been relatively low, despite the rise of Airbnb over the last few years. Without reading the (not yet published ) study that this article is reporting on, it’s not possible to say whether the .39% increase in rent is a meaningful contribution, or a barely measurable statistic.
