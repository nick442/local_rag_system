"Don't care.. Uber is cheaper most of the times for me than Cabify, I am not a wealthy man so I can't afford the premium on Cabify just to ""support"" their better business practice. Cheaper is cheaper. If cabify can be a better buisness AND have better prices. than that is something i am willing to support."
