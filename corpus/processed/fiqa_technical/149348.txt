I'm okay if the union sticks up for those only in the Union. If I get a pay raise because of my union affiliation, you don't deserve the same benefits. For what it's worth, in many other countries they've always sided with the Union. To me this is a a direct attack on the middle class. If it hasn't already eroded enough it's only going to get worse.
