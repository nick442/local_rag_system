"It's not a talking point, use google. What ""one thing"" do they have? You know what I find funny? The fact that there are virtually no ruins in Africa, especially subsaharan Africa (aka black people) to speak of. Your continent still has people living in mud huts with technology no more advanced than the romans. You can't govern, there is an entire continent to prove that testament. But yes, surely that's all due to sunny weather."
