You need DEEEEEP pockets to get it going. The city that is most famous for municipal FTTH is Chattanooga. I think $300 million was the number people were throwing around just to do one city. IF the costs are accurate, doing the cities that Google is doing, you'd need several Billion in capital to build that infrastructure.
