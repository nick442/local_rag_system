>Here's the real scoop - I would hire more people and buy more inventory and put more into capital investment if I paid less taxes, You would do so if there was money to be made doing so. It's as simple as that. Corporate Taxes are on net income. If hiring one more person contributed further to your bottom line you'd do so. That is the only thing that drives you. If the incremental cost of the hire is lower than the increased revenue. Period. Corporate taxes are on net income. Meaning you're still going to get more money, you're just going to get a little less of that incremental income growth than you thought. You'll still hire.
