> A $15/hr minimum wage would ruin our economy and cause a lot more suffering and homelessness. I think reasonable people can disagree but I think you're being a little melodramatic. It could in theory hurt our economy and even the workers it's trying to help but I think it's a stretch to make it sound like our economy would collapse due to a $15 minimum wage.
