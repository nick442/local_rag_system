In an interview for an internship, how to justify leaving a previous internship after just 6 months? I learned a lot there, but I didn't performed very well and was laid off. I'm quite shy and, even though my relationship with my previous boss was good, he though that it was making me underperform. I'm trying to improve a lot my social skills and my resume is good, so much so that I got an interview in a better place. But I just don't know how to properly answer that question without making me look like a sociophobic.
