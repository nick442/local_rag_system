It it's paste form? Probably not if only because it would be a pain to form into food I can cook easily, maybe if I wanted to make sausages or something but that is a bit beyond my personal interest and abilities. But as a product I can cook like other food, yeah I got no problem with it. I use to raise my own cows and knew how to slaughter them but I still sent them to a butcher in large part because I would be wasting so much of the meat otherwise. It is too much work to do all the processing they do for trim and waste meat to make it palatable. I don't want to eat a straight up cow tongue or cow heart, but if you blend that bitch up into a sausage ill gobble it down.
