"It would be ideal if the last would change regarding anything that goes horribly wrong. The whole point of setting up rules is to avoid both hypothetical and past mistakes. The fact that so many coastal cities don't have proper systems to manage the stormwater that comes into their cities is appalling. And that's just an extreme example, whereas many infrastructure problems are more passive. I wouldn't trust a private corporation to set up a highway. It may be considered economically stimulating in some ways, but they will do the bare minimum in terms of quality and safety and then charge you $5 a trip. When government gets involved in building the infrastructure it tends to be frustratingly slow and inefficient from the outside, but there is so much planning and preparing for eventualities that goes into it that it just can't be set up in a few months. There may be future developments coming or it may be integrated with other systems to streamline travel or any of a plethora of reasons. I work in infrastructure so I know I have a different view compared to people that just want to have their today built so they can use it. It's really hard to see but problems and have to say we'll be getting to that in 5-10 years, just live with it in the meantime. But I don't want someone to say ""I'm tired of waiting in traffic, here's a piece of land, let's put a road through there"" with no plan for what to do with it. So many problems that we're dealing with now are caused by shortsightedness fifty years ago, and now it's a hell of a lot harder to fix than it would've been to do it right in the first place."
