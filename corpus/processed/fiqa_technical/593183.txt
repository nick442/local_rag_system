"My question is, using previous data how do I calculate my returns? ""Stupid"" is the person who does not ask. Better to have visited first, but even asking after the fact will get you an education, at a very low cost. You would only see those returns had you invested at the beginning of the period advertised. ""Past results are not a guarantee of future returns."" Since we have no idea where you are in life, there's little advice I can give you except to invite you to learn. You can easily spend 100 hours on this Stack reading advice on the beginning investor, and every stage after that. We all needed to start somewhere, and in your case, just showing up was a great first step."
