Well, it's the same fundamental principals as all investing. Buy low, sell high. Buy things that will be scarce in the future while they're abundant. Buy up everything and create artificial scarcity. It's the same thing that's done with diamonds and was done with oil for quite some time. Small markets like tickets to a show are just much more vulnerable to being cornered. How do you legislate against ticket scalpers without turning yourself into a hypocrite? Obviously you're not going to pull the plug on Wall Street or angel investing or any other investing strategy, and you'd have a hell of a time shutting down DeBeers. Capitalism isn't perfect if your desire is fairness.
