I agree! Definitely not a black and white situation and there's a lot of factors. Maintenance really isn't that big of a deal if it's done correctly. I've never had to replace an engine or transmission on a car younger than 40 or 50 years old. My 88 Chevy Blazer is still going strong and my girlfiends 56 oldsmobile still has original engine and tranny, not rebuilt. I'd like to own a Tesla once it's feasible to drive 500+ miles at a time like a normal car.
