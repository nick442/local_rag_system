Yeah, but your professional programs are insanely expensive. I'm in pharmacy school paying 26k at a private school. UCSF costs 35k for an in-state resident and 45k for out of state. The supplemental cost for a professional degree is 18k and then 12.25k more for being out of state. There's a reason we have quite a few Korean kids who chose to go to my school rather than pay an extreme amount of money more to go to UCLA or UCSF or whatever.
