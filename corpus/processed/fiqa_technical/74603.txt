You don't need to recharacterize. If you are married and your spouse is covered under a work retirement plan and you are not the AGI limit in 2013 for folks that are married and filing jointly is $178,000 before the phase out begins. That was raised to $181,000 for 2014. A quick call to the broker/bank where your IRA is should confirm this.
