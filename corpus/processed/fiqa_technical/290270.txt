so probably a stupid question but anyway. Suppose I take a loan of 10lakhs INR(20k C$ or 15US$) in india for studying abroad. and get a job after studying ther like 2-3 years later. How easily I can pay off the loan. Considering I can get a 50k c$ job and live frugally. I think i could easily pay off the loan in a year or two. is that right. Or would I suffer and end up paying installments (right word?) every month for like 10 -15 years. I know i may be exaggerating too much on latter part. But still. Would it be easy since currency is quite 'strong' as in you earn quite a good money for even a starting job or even minimum wage job. Thank you
