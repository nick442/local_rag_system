"> ""Our biblical mission,"" an online statement reads, ""is to 'sell' our lighting products so that we may 'tell' everyone we can about God's soul-saving, life transforming gospel message.."" First piece of evidence (but legal) > In the interview, Wolfe claims he was told most employees at Voss were Southern Baptist, but employees could go to any church, as long as they were ""born again."" Second piece of evidence (trending towards grey area, but legal) > According to the complaint, the manager asked Wolfe ""to identify every church he has attended over the past several years; where and when [he] was 'saved' and the circumstances that led up to it."" Third piece of evidence (not legal) > The complaint claims the manager asked Wolfe if he would ""have a problem"" coming to work early, without pay, to attend Bible study. Fourth (not legal, but often overlooked) When I say the business laid out what they expect out of employees, I did mean ""during the hiring process based on the questions asked"", not laid them out in public view. It's still illegal whether they did it in public or private."
