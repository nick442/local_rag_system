None-fanboy source [here](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/12/05/top-android-phone-maker-faces-u-s-import-ban-tuesday/). Links to the two patents here: ['647 - System and method for performing an action on a structure in computer-generated data](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=5,946,647.PN.&OS=PN/5,946,647&RS=PN/5,946,647) ['263 - Real-time signal processing system for serially transmitted data ](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,343,263.PN.&OS=PN/6,343,263&RS=PN/6,343,263) I don't believe '647 will be a real threat because the language it uses means the patent is extremely broad and describes something that is fundamental to the operation of practically every web browser, indexing software and electronic guide on the planet. Like Samsung's (I think) attempt to injunct the iPhone using its 3G patents, the ITC will likely rule that the technology/system is too critical to modern function and hence cannot be a valid reason for injunction. '263, however, is a real problem for Android. My interpretation of the patent is that it's claiming a system where the OS parses data from a wirelessly transmitted stream based on type and offers it to other apps instead of having apps actively request data from the OS. As I understand it, this is exactly how Android's intent-activity model works. Because this model of data sharing is at the core of Android and fundamental to its design, it's practically impossible to circumvent without completely rewriting Android, which would break everything. Furthermore, because there is a clear alternative on how to share data (ie. apps request from OS, OS gives data parsed from stream), the protection used against the 3G injunction attempt against Apple cannot be used here. Simply put, the ITC can easily put an injunction on HTC on the basis of '263, and if it does, then *all* Android phones can expect to receive similar injunctions very very quickly after that. It would be nice to see what /r/business thinks any possible injunction may have not only on the stocks of the smartphone companies but also on the entire smartphone market as a whole. Personally, I think any injunction based on either patent will make the stocks of any Android makers and Google plummet. It would probably chill the mobile market for a while as investors try to guess just what other patents Apple might be able to use against the remaining platforms of Blackberry and Windows Phone 7. And then things will probably return to normal, sans Android and the companies that strongly supported it like Samsung, HTC and Motorola. Samsung and Moto will probably the worst hit, while HTC will end up focusing on WinPhone 7. Thoughts?
