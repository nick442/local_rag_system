"What are you doing to help those starving children all over the world and how does having compassion for living animals affect your efforts in that area? All of those man-hours spent armchair debating another fruitless election cycle will really debilitate your empathetic capabilities, huh? ""There's just no time to have a heart; my internet might be changing for the worse!"" I often wonder how otherwise reasonable people in ancient nation states (and at present in various places around the world) were able to regard slaves as sub-human and treat them accordingly; similar to the turkeys we're talking about here. I also would wonder what it would be like to talk to and reason with someone like that. Here you are in the flesh. Your lack of cognitive dissonance is staggering."
