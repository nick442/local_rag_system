You start taking on some big risks when go to absolute zero. Unlike your plane analogy, you don't have to fly or not fly - you can opt to take a safer hybrid form of transit. Or to extend the analogy: now you're driving or walking instead of flying, which, per mile traveled, is statistically more risky, even if the plane 'feels' and 'looks' riskier. Consider reading up a bit on the risks of all-cash/bonds (including: shortfall and inflation). Yes, real estate is a hedge, but most of your portfolio is still exposed to inflation. Why not also buy some Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities via a bond fund? Why not put 25% in the stock market to help do well when the markets do well? I think if you do some reading on this you'll find yourself shocked at the risks of being all-cash. FWIW, I'm a relatively conservative voice on investing subreddits - the guy who is usually saying 'hey be sure to keep some bonds!.' So I'm all about a safe/balanced portfolio, but tilt too far in either direction and you take on more risk, not less. You mentioned a pension and real estate. Those are presumably good inflation hedges and relatively stable holdings. The pension especially suggests you can take more stock risk, since you have that stable, bond-like holding. The weirdest thing to me is that you would be 'all in' during the good times. If you're this risk adverse when you see warning signs, I'm curious: were you 100% stocks before? Totally on/off like that seems kinda intense.
