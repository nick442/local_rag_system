Lack of demand? There is no such thing as a lack of demand. People will always demand stuff they want and need. If you're saying people are lacking demand of the goods and services that have been overly inflated and misallocated then yes I agree and therefore this lack of demand is the right medicine to signal to the market that we need to reallocate supply and production to create products/services that people want and can afford to buy. More stimulus and propping up failed industries/services will only mean that we will just continue the failed path that brought us here in the first place.
