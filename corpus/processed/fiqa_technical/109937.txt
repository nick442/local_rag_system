we have massive numbers of people out of work and our infrastructure is crumbling. We put people to work just like we did in the 30's; our infrastructure gets fixed and so does our economy. I totally agree that for an economy to grow we have to make more stuff. We're not making the stuff now because people cannot afford to purchase it. If given funds, people would purchase stuff, and stuff would get made. This got us out of them great depression and has kept Scandinavia strong, and even got Iceland out of it's terrible brush with Libertarianism. Brazil is becoming a first world powerhouse by this sort of redistribution. Redistributing money down the ladder has the benefit of working. Austerity leads to Greece. And Spain. And Portugal. And Ireland. But not Germany, because they deficit-spent their way out of their recession.
