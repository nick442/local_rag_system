Yes. And employer's often make you buy required uniforms from *them* and keep then in serviceable condition until you need to... buy them again.. from them of course. That's not to mention upholding certain health and grooming standards. Again good luck with that when you can barely afford food and have to go to work sick because you have no sick days (even if you DO!). Hopefully you work in food service and can eat cake. Maybe they'll even *let* you without having to sneak it behind their back.
