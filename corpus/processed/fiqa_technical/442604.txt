It's not just you. A few things have changed, though.. * US GDP increased nearly $5 trillion * SP 500 Book value per share is up 50% * Real income per capita is flat * Participation rate is at late 70's levels It appears that NOT solving problems is very profitable for some of us. Maybe the Iphone 9 and a self-driving party bus will make everything better.
