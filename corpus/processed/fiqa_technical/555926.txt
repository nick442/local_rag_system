"This has been me for the past few weeks. Side by side, the iphone has a superior screen and build quality. Screen is much brighter stock and I don't want to root android to tweak the settings and crash battery life, while build quality doesn't feel cheap. I checked out an HTC that had a brighter screen than the gs3 but its specs were poorer and os was dated. There is no ideal phone for consumers like me, and it feels intentional. What I really dislike about the iphone are the cut google apps, elongated screen with no horizontal-display growth, and very easily scratchable Al back. Bezel-less display would have been great. Ideal: 4.5"" screen, iphone-quality no-bezel display, speed, build, while android-powered."
