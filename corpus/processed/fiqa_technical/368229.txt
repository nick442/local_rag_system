You conveniently missed the part where I said THEY'RE THE BEST SELLING CAR IN THEIR CLASS. They literally have more demand than they can produce for the next 5+ years. The reason they're posting losses is because they can't reinvest their money fast enough to keep up with their demand growth. Are you going to argue that because Amazon posted a $126 million loss last quarter they are not as valuable of a company as the Mom & Pop book store down the street that barely broke even? I will reiterate: I don't think you understand how business works.
