Amazon's online retail end-game is clearly for them to be the platform that all other retailers use to sell goods online, as in Amazon manages the inventory, delivers the goods, collects the payment, takes their cut and gives the rest to the retailer. At a certain point that efficiency gained from managing and delivering inventory directly at such scale will make it literally impossible for anyone to compete without using Amazon's retail services. UPS/FedEx will not like that new reality where they won't be able to compete with a company delivering their own goods directly from fulfillment centers and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see anti-trust/monopoly suits filed.
