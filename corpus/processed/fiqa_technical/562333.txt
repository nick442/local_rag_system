Are you fucking kidding me? You lack common sense and to be honest, I have never have read anything so ridiculous. You are saying that despite the fact that it is not only safer for pedestrians to use a consistent and well known area to walk, specifically made and designated for pedestrians, the US should just allow random chaos and let the streets be wildly unpredictable and open up every driver on the road to crippling lawsuits. I can think of many reasons of why you lack any sort of logic, but I just don't have the time to pick apart why this is the worst comment I have ever read on reddit.
