You've just pushed the problem off to trying to figure out the market value of property, not to mention that property values are subject to bubbles. I don't particularly worry about the problems that would cause the government, but it makes it really hard on businesses (and people) that now have to pay a lot more than they budgeted for. Property taxes are a useful thing, and serve an important purpose, but you don't want to bet budgets on them alone. Diversification is important in all kinds of investments.
