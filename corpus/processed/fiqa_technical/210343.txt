I am from Santa Cruz. McDonalds closed over 5 years ago. It was hugely popular here, probably the most popular Hamburger place. The problem was the guy who brought the franchise, promised a much higher volume of sales. These figures were unrealistic for Bolivia and the Headquarters cut the chain. However, such is the demand, that there are talks about McDonalds being back next year. EDIT: I don't get why the article makes it seem as this happened quite recently. McDonalds has been closed for some time, before Evo was in power even. I'd also like to add that at the time McDonald's hamburgers while extremely popular were overpriced for the Bolivian market. However, due to inflation and all the drug money rolling around now days, it would certainly be competitively priced and hugely successful. EDIT 2: Here is an article dating McDonalds closing in November of 2002, so nearly 10 years ago. http://www.eldeber.com.bo/anteriores/20030308/economia_9.html
