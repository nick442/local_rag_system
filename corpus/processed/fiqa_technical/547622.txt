You'll most likely need additional funding at some point in the future so that'll dilute your position below 51%. I think it's best to do what you can with what you've got before you NEED those additional funds from outside investors. They only cause trouble and if they're focused on short-term results & getting their cash back as soon as possible rather than long-term sustainability, it'll be a nightmare dealing with them.
