"Honestly just keep track of your income and spending on a piece of paper. Write down every single thing. Also set goals like ""ok I will make $1000 this month, and my goal is to pay bills of $200 and only spend $500 therefore I should easily be able to save $300"" or something like that. Just do it there's no magic trick despite what some million stupid articles and forum posts will lead you to believe. Saving money is like being in good shape.. or keeping yourself clean.. it's an every day, every hour kinda thing"
