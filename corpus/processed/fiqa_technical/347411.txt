Too expand on /u/stoneeus, mortgage rates were/are also heavily influenced by the FED QE program, which holds about $4.5T in mortgage-backed securities and treasuries on the FED's balance sheet. The FED has been holding this balance steady since it ended the QE program a couple years ago, purchasing new securities as old ones mature. However, the FED has started signalling that they are going to end these purchases and let their portfolio wind down. Once that happens, you'll start to see mortgage rates rise.
