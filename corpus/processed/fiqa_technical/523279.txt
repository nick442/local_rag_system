Not absurd at all. Without social media, you and I and many many many more others would have never known about the uprisings as quickly as we did. Without social media, there wouldn't have been conversation and understanding about what was happening. Twitter and Facebook were monumental in spreading awareness of what was/is happening as a result of the Arab Spring.
