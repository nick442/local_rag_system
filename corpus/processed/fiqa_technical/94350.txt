"A golf course project driven by an African-American university trained Hypnotherapist who wants ""to see this turned into a great place to live, work and play and have it be predominantly black. A great place to play golf, go to the beach, with great schools, a place that turns out scholars, athletes and artists. A place that’s banging, as they say.” I love me some internets."
