> I have been an owner of the Planet Hollywood Westgate unit in Las Vegas for 2 years! Every time I've tried to use it, it is never available. The one time they told me it was available; they told me it was at Flamingo Bay in Las Vegas, not the one that they have me paying $900 a month for. Then they had the nerve to charge me an exchange fee for using a unit I didn't even want to use. I'm to the point that I want to get rid of this unit. The payment is $200 more than my own house payment and now that they were purchased by Hilton, the payments and fees are going to go up. 2 years? 2 years paying $900/mo for a property you were never able to use? You'd figure by at least the end of year 1 you would have smelled something fishy. I'm sure this CEO and his company are generally shitbags, but c'mon.
