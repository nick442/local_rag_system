Isn't the premise a bit off? A *single* minimum wage worker can't afford a *two bedroom* apartment? What about two earners sharing a one bedroom apartment? That would make much more sense both for the workers and for housing costs in general. My wife and I both make much more than minimum wage and we simply choose to live in a one bedroom apartment. We get to save a lot more and plan for our future. A two bedroom apartment is a luxury for a single person, not a necessity. That's like saying he can't afford a brand new Ford F150 either. No shit. Live below your means and you life will be much better in the long run.
