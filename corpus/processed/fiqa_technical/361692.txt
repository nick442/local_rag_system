You're focusing on the wrong thing here. You should be paying off debt, not borrowing. Thus your credit score is of almost no relevance. There is no lasting effect from credit utilization, one cycle after you have everything paid off it's going to have the same credit score no matter what order you pay them off in. I would look at which of the first three has the highest interest rate and pay it off first. You can pay any of them off in one month so whichever you pick you get one card down to $0 and restore it's grace period. After that, sort them by interest rate.
