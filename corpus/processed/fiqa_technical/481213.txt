"> Every company with a ""Strong Culture"" Ie Office bars and happy hours, nap rooms, pool tables, zen/mediating rooms, etc,etc seem to be the most successful. Its unfortunate that they people pay for no work/life balance.. but at least they get to get drunk in the office.. I think most people (most serious folks at least) realize that there's a number of elements to culture beyong a ping pong table. I've worked at a number of large and small tech companies, and there's zero doubt that a shitty company culture with pong and kegs is still a shitty company culture. It's a lazy shorthand for observes (and some management teams too). When I was younger, and before I got into management, I used to think that those things were what culture was primairly about. Not so much anymore."
