I can render mandelbrot realtime whereas 30 years ago it would take all day for low quality. if this is the reason I bought a computer solely I would consider I had gotten a much much better deal now. Expecially if I bought a computer from five years ago that can do the same thing and it ends up being cheaper overall and able to produce many times greater.
