If you are from any university in NYC (other than for-profits) you have so much access to networking that you actually have a shot (slim, but still a shot) of breaking into the industry. You should be reaching out and trying to connect with as many people in IBD as you can. At the gym, through friends/family, through school career center. When you contact them, your goal is to meet them face-to-face. That is the advantage you have over the kids from schools outside of the city and that is what will get your foot in the door.
