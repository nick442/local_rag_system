Well, yeah, but did they affect *everything* equally? You don't get two houses, one for your extra worker, so it decreases demand for the *number* of houses relative to the number of workers. A textbook author or journalist authors the same book or newspaper article; it's just printed more times. It does cause a shift in what types of labor are in demand relative to supply.
