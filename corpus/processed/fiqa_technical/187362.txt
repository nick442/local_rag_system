Waaah! Call the Waaaambulance! Google nuked my SEO!!11!!ll! I know exactly why this happened, but I'm not going to tell you. Suffice to say, it is your own fault due to bad configuration. But I don't intend to help you fix your SEO to compete for market share. The sites and subscriptions I maintain attained their Google ranking the hard way: by earning it.
