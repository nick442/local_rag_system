Are you dropshipping (I'll have to tune my answer a bit if so)? Suggest you're probably looking for a supply chain consultant. As you've found, ecomm is a bit of a loaded term and will get you the wrong kinds of folks. Sounds like in your case, you're looking for more classical-style supply chain help and e-commerce just happens to be the vehicle with which the consumers place orders - though correct me if I'm off.
