That's fair, but given the calls in this thread for the share price to drop 15% off this, for wells Fargo to be treated as a criminal Enterprise, etc., these are pretty small numbers considering. About a third of a percent of annual profits is not exactly something to call for the share price to tank, and a lack of effective controls is not a reason to define a long-standing business as a criminal enterprise.
