"This is stupid. Employers don't pay overtime â€” they make you go home. But you need money to support your family. So you take another job. Now, instead of working 50-70 hours a week at one job, your working up to 40 at one and then 10-30 elsewhere. Add in the commute, changing uniforms, schedule conflicts, and it's an even worse hell than ""slaving away"" at your main job/career for over 40 hours. It discourages hard work, investing your time into learning your job and getting promoted faster, and decreases your base pay rate in case the employer has to pay for your time and a half in some situations. You can't legislate away the major economic problems our society faces in this way."
