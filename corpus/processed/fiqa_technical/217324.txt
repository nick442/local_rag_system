"> love how you're walking back toward the positions I've taken previously, I was about to say the same about you, when you agreed that Susan is not good at anything and got her job due to her connections and not because of, or despite of her educational background and degrees. > you said you would not consider someone with a music or communications undergrad degree for a security position, full stop. Diversity hire? Yes. I will not hire Music people for Security jobs unless they have proven experience and I would definitely hire former soldiers and IT graduates with zero experience over a music major for a security job, because ""diversity"" is not even a factor and should not be a factor in choosing the best for the job. > their [HR] role is to hire the best talent and protect the company, not to protect employees, Correction: HR role and actions is to hire the cheapest employees, even employ freelancers, contractors and outsource. They will never pay for good talent but they sure will offer a fat salary for the cousin of the CEO's tennis trainer. You are 100% correct when you said that HR does not protect of even on the side of the employee. P/S: the HR department at my firm is using contractors and temps for various tasks. They have a huge turn over of employees and were rank one of the lowest in the company's ""employee engagement"" survey.. like HR department is most companies. What a great image this gives to the rest of the employees in the company."
