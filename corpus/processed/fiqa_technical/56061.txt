Apple does not have a philosophy of marketshare at any cost. They have a goal of making a healthy profit from whatever they do. So the only share they do care about, is profit share, and they are winning that one.([1](http://www.macrumors.com/2012/05/03/apple-and-samsung-claim-99-of-profits-among-top-mobile-phone-vendors/)) This race to the bottom that android makers might be participating in, is not interesting for Apple to take part of. They want the status of a luxury item, and have people desire to at some point have an iPhone of their own. They are already making the iPhone more accessible on the marked by keeping production of older models and selling them for a reduced price. But is only as long as those models can keep a good profit margin, and keep up sales.
