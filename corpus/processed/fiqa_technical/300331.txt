You're assuming that landlords base rental rates on what tenants or potential tenants can afford to pay and that is not the way it works: They base their rental rates on what they think they can get on the market, not what they think the potential tenant can pay. Complicating things now concerning rental rates, at least in the U.S., is the monsterous influx of foreign capital looking for a safe haven for storing wealth and it's really messing up our housing markets. Complicating this complication is that housing is really an infrastructure issue and should not be left willy-nilly to capitalists to provide since they have proven a thousand-million times over they are completely incompetent when it comes to adequately dealing with anything more complicated than a quarterly return projected over five quarters. Seriously, capitalism is at its end times and it will either evolve into something that works or it will be swept away and replaced with something that does work.
