"Serious answer: This would be a horrible idea for you, so don't do it. Theoretical answer: This gets more complicated. If you are refusing to pay your student loans, this is bad for the economy because you just destroyed the value associated with that payment. You essentially robbed the person holding the debt (since you promised to pay it off). However, you also stimulate the economy by buying goods. I'm just an armchair economist, but I would say that the detriment of not paying your debt is higher than the benefit of paying for the goods. Now, lets say you never say your not paying of your loans, and instead just pay the minimum payment and buy the goods. Now you are helping the economy because your debt is still generating money *and* you are injecting real money through your payment. So you essentially made more money for the economy. So long as the ""system"" believes you can pay of the debt, the ""system"" is able to hold more money. This is actually why most credit companies *want* you to pay the minimum balance (that, and the interest earns them far more money than you borrowed)."
