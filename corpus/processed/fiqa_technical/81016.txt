College costs are increasing 8% per year. In 18 years that's 4 times the current costs of college. The [current costs](http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/26/pf/college/college_tuition_cost/index.htm) of college are $21,000 annually for a public 4 year degree, and $42,000 annually for a private 4 year degree. In 18 years that's $336,000 for a public college bachelor's degree, and $672,000 for a private college bachelor's degree. Per kid. Suddenly $900,000 doesn't seem so big.
