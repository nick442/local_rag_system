I would like to add that coworkers who do give their employer free time are half the problem, as they are enabling this behavior from management. And, why do they do this? Because they are trying to impress management. So, the employee who gives free time to a company is actually *more* selfish than the one who refuses to work more than 40 hours. They are adversely affecting other fellow employees in their own self-interest. I severely resent any employee who regularly gives free time to a company.
