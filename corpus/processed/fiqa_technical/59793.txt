The Canadian government position is that 35 states and nine million American jobs depend on trade with Canada. Wikipedia's position is that a little over 7 million jobs in the US are dependent on trade with Canada, and that all 50 states have jobs that are dependent on trade with Canada. That's from a 2007 report.
