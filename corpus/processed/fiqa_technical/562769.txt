But nothing was stolen. Americans voted and according to the rules Trump won. Americans cast their ballots. Now Trump very clearly worked with a foreign power to obtain that outcome, so hang him for *that*. But hanging Trump for being a cheating law-breaking scumbag does NOT mean Clinton won the election. Sorry, she lost. If we go down this road that the election is overturned because the silly voters were hoodwinked (and you need to trust someone to tell you that), that will be the argument for overturning every lost election from here on to the end of the world. Foreign actors interfere in other nation's elections all of the time. Good luck stopping that in today's internet-driven world.
