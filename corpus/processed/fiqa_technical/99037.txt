For about six months now, every 3-4 weeks, I get a misdelivered packaged from those idiots. It's to the same person. They have the same house number, Asian name like myself, but ten streets away. First couple of times I reported this to Amazon, but I got real tired of spending my own time to help fix their problem. I figure let Amazon keep sending replacement packages and maybe they'll finally get the hint. Meanwhile, my housekeepers have been enjoying these gifts.
