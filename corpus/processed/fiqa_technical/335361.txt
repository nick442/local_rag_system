"She may be right. If she gets the usual thing of half the family assets gained during marriage, she's also entitled to half the car. Well, not quite. Imagine you had sold the car at the time of divorce. You would have gotten some cash for it (this is typically shown in the Blue Book). And then you would have had to pay off the loan. So the cash value at that time, minus the loan owed at that time, was the equity in the car at that time. That would be a family asset and she'd have been entitled to half of it. A lot of auto loans are a ripoff, so this might not be much money. Or could be zero. Or could even be negative - it's common to owe more on a car than it's worth, especially the first year after you buy it. In which case she owes you LOL. The judge already dealt with this, and he did it by saying ""you two get together and try to work it out"", and come back to me with a proposed settlement."" If you are at loggerheads, you can go back to the judge, but he may not give an answer you like."
