"That's pretty typical for stores closing. Remember that once the stores are conducting their closing sales, it's no longer the company that's in charge. It may say ""Sears"" on the sign, but it's actually an outside liquidation company that's operating the store. The liquidator is the one pricing the sales and applying the discounts. Their job is to get rid of everything and get as much money for it as they can. Liquidators will also sometimes bring in outside merchandise to closing stores in order to capitalize on the excitement of the going-out-of-business sales. [This news report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMiBVlXctM8) shows a case where an outside liquidator brought in some oriental rugs to sell at a Linens N Things that was going out of business. Linens N Things never sold oriental rugs when it was a going concern, but the liquidator brought them in, complete with a sign saying what the price ""was"" and what the sale price is. Once you realize that a closing Sears store isn't actually Sears anymore, it all starts to fall into place."
