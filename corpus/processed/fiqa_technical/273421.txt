If Bezos wants subsidies Chicago likely can't / won't be able to match other places. If you ignore those, I'd agree it has almost every other box checked in terms of labor, infrastructure, space, etc. Unfortunately, I'm guessing they'll go with the subsidies. If they moved in and helped build up a new area of the city though that'd be awesome.
