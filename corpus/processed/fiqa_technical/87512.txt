IB will get you in the ballpark but Lightspeed obviously for the more low latency stuff. You can colo w Lightspeed at Nasdaq and can get direct market data feeds etc. that's not something I'd recco for someone starting out.. Expensive for most budgets. Once you get going though, worth it. IB will let you work with opportunities on the 50-100ms level. I don't think telling these guys to go with NewEdge from day one and colo globally would really help anyone get started algo trading. Wouldn't have the capital or scale. Trying to give actual useful advice to them.
