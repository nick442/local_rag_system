I would agree, if Americans were willing to do those jobs under the current circumstances. It's hard work; in the sun, for minimum wage (sometimes more), and many farms are exempt from paying overtime so you just get straight time for the 80+ hours you work in one week. However, there never seems to be the line for employment. Don't come complain about illegals taking jobs from Americans, when the American don't want to do the work.
