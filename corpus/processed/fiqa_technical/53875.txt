Actually it's much cheaper to just keep employees in the dark so they don't see the inequity. The more expensive option (in the short-term) is to do what this article suggests, so the company can keep employees happy, which makes us more productive and reduces the costs of constantly hiring new people. Unfortunately I think most employers would rather gamble that their employees will never find out (because it's taboo to ask how much your co-workers make), or are too scared to look for new jobs anyway.
