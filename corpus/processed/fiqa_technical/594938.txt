Firms don't have to pay too much after a wrongful death. The Fed actually put a price on a persons death. [Its $250,000](http://www.wrongfuldeath-law.com/CM/Resources/Wrongful-Death-FAQ.asp#types0) for emotional distress and any other non-economic loss they can prove. For a large energy company having [on average 30 wrongful deaths a year](http://www.msha.gov/mshainfo/factsheets/mshafct2.htm). It probably wont change any numbers on a balance sheet.
