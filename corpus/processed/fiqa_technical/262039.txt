It's the levels of immigration. Currently it's limited to ~700K / year. Republicans are against raising that limit. Bannon has advocated for lowering that limit; Trump has made efforts to restrict undocumented immigrants; which means that much MORE needs to be made up by legal immigration. He's also restricted the flow of legal immigration (e.g. limiting the window to apply for H1Bs)
