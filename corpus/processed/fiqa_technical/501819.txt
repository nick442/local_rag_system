PA just recently opened a few casinos after previously not having the ability to do so. So all the Philly/Suburb people are no longer taking the day trip to AC and are staying 2 minutes from home. Personally, I go to AC to be by the beach and get free drinks quickly (Harrah's machines have order screens..The casino near me does not!) but thats about it. Highly overpriced.
