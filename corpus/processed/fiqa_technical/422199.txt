My father owns a small business that employees ~50 people. He's been in business for over thirty years as an agricultural establishment. Because the threshold on Obama care for small businesses to pay for employee coverage is 50+ employees we will have to fire people who don't deserve to be fired - all because we could not possibly afford an additional 50-60k per month expense for covering all employees healthcare
