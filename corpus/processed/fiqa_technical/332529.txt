Well, you could get long kw/hr to effectively lock in your high rate, but not suffer from anymore shocks. You could also (and this is what I would do) get short and activate change through a legal pursuit. So, get short your light bill via kilowatt hour swaps, and hedge your downside with some longer-dated swaptions. I'm looking at the implied vol for these swaptions on my bloomberg -- it's looking surprisingly cheap. As far as position sizing, we're looking at some notionals of about $200/month. A pretty large sum. Look into getting leverage through total return swaps or repo financing. Does that help?
