"Yeah, this is an awfully petty article. The writer wants to make a big deal about ""The safety and security of her methods"" and why that's a bad thing, but it isn't. Beyonce bought 500,000 copies of her single on Itunes because she didn't promote it and it would have flopped otherwise. Don't get me wrong, there's a certain flair and style to weirder, less mainstream marketing campaigns, but if you're trying to sell an album's quality on how weird you sold the album, you're going to fail. It's not like everybody can be Buckethead and release progressively weirder shit just for the hell of it. Why even criticize the current Album release trends? It's one of the best parts of music. If I'm a fan of Taylor Swift, then I don't need to worry about following some bullshit ARG, or cracking a code or checking her facebook the day her no promotion album is released and being lucky enough to notice. I want a few reminders, every couple days, so I can get excited. I want a single to drop, so I can get a feel for the general tone and theme of the album, and see if I want to buy. Being different for the sake of being different is no better than liking something just because everybody else does."
