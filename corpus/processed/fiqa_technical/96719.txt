I think the point is that the rest of the public is basically subsidizing their payroll. Wal-mart could afford to pay workers what the workers make up for in food stamps, but they don't. What sources of income you have is less important than the total balance, so as long as it's enough to get by it keeps people from taking to the streets and demanding more.
