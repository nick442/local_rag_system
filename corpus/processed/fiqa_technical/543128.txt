I'd try that in a heartbeat. Mind you, I'm not a lonely individual, but I greatly enjoy catching a glimpse of alternate lives, both my own and those of others. I'd pay the extra fees to pick the person with whom I'd lay, most likely opting for the five-hour session. If need be, I'd even pay extra to be able to converse with my temporary partner, talking about their life, and giving them a glimpse into my own, if they are interested. The emotional and physical discovery from such an experience would make me that much more rich of a person.
