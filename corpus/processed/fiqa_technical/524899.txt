The first DirecTV DVRs were TiVos, and they were fantastic. My family had a few. DirecTV decided they'd rather keep the $1 per month they had to pay TiVo and released their own DVRs, which were widely panned. But if you wanted HD you didn't have a choice. That's why I bought a Series 3 and moved back to cable. Some time in the last few years DirecTV though better of this decision and started offering new TiVo based boxes.
