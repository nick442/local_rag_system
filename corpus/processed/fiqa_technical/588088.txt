With the Kohls job I could fuck around alot more. The first one was in a warehouse where we would constantly unload trucks. With Kohls we only unloaded like a truck a night then we would actually put the product on the sales floor, so after unloading the truck which never took more than 2 hours Id like work for a bit then basically go hide for a while, know that makes me sound like a shitty worker but you get what you pay for.
