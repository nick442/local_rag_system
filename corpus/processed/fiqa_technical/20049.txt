Thank you for your feedback, I'd asked her all week about communicating to me a date of returning to work but at this point its costing me time and productivity. I cannot not help but feel I am being taken advantage of (because she knows she is killing it). I sent a message letting her know I'm seeking temp help and that if anything opens up in the future I will contact her. Currently on hold with local temp agency. Wanted to be concerned about being considerate but she is 10 years older than I and I couldn't ever image my boyfriend leaving as a reason for me missing a single day of work. Glad to be reassured I wasnt being insensitive.
