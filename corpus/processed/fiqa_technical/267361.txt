I have to ask. Why? Wendy's burgers taste like shit. Their fries taste like shit. They overfry their chicken. I can't believe they claim they did countless hours of research to make the W burger. The bun is too hard. There's not enough sauce. It uses cheap, watery lettuce and unappetizing pickles. Burger King FTW.
