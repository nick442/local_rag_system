As opposed to our constant and unrelenting inflation, yes. Under normal circumstances, I'd rather neither. But honestly, right now, yes I think deflation would not be terrible. As I said, prices would decrease, it would ease the burden on lots of families and it would take years of non-stop deflation before wages fell. So yes, in the short term.
