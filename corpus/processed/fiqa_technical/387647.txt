Don't worry about minimizing taxes too much - worry about maximizing post-tax income. Keep in mind that if you just got a job then it's likely that the taxes being automatically withheld are based on the assumption you've been earning this much all year, which could mean that you're likely going to be due a refund come April (basically, if you're making 100k/year, but only actually getting 20k this year, they'll still take taxes out as though you were making the full 100k). If you're maxing out your 401K, you can also contribute to an IRA to reduce taxes (or contribute to a Roth to invest more if you max it out). For investment I like Betterment, it's well diversified and avoids many common investment pitfalls. Much better than a savings account, but you should also consider the need to have readily-accessible money in case of emergencies.
