WP7 was indeed a totally new OS. There is nothing it has in common with the desktop Win7. In Win8 they're trying to merge desktop and mobile, but WP8 will still be an entirely new interface for most users. > You want you OS to feel familiar and comfy, not different on every device. From a consumer's point of view, that's perfectly true. One of the biggest frustrations with Android is the lack of updates. However, from the manufacturer's point of view a platform-wide homogenous experience is a bad thing. How can a Samsung differentiate itself from an HTC if not for the UX? Hardware quality does play a role but it isn't as in-your-face and easily sellable as the UX. This is one reason why manufacturers other than Nokia aren't pushing WP7 as aggressively as they push Android. MSFT is betting the company on the Win8/WP8/Metro combination, and I agree that this combination can be lethal to competitors. But the only way they can do it is by going vertical and manufacturing their own devices.
