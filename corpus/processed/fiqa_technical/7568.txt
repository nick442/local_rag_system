Depends on the logo and the company. Chrome bags I love, and they put their logo on the buckle and the the bag in a tasteful way. They are cyclist oriented and supportive of the community. One company that I love the products of that advertise too much is Rapha, but on some of their clothes the logo/name is actually buttoned on and is removable. If the design is going to take up most of my shirt, it is probably because it is for a band I support (friends' bands most likely). Hopefully that helps with your understanding.
