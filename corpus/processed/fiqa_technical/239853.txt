I had this same thing. We both just got out of a relationship and neither of us wanted anything like a relationship, but both desperately did not want to sleep alone. We weren't even attracted to each other sexually but we'd study together till late, then head to one of our places and sleep in each other's arms. Quite cathartic really.
