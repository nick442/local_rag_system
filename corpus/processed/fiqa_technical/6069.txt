My first computer was nearly 20 years ago. A computer tech I knew brought home dozens of boxes of computer parts from a hospital that was replacing and upgrading. Asked me to see how many computers I could build from the parts. Didn't have any sort of computer experience at the time but I built about 16 windows 3.11 boxes from those parts. I was given a very nice motherboard with a 200 MHz processor for it. That was my first computer. I mounted it on plywood.
