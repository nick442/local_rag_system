>We actually had to request a few of them to come back in part-time since it is rather difficult to find experienced machinists. That's the scary part. There's no entry path into these jobs. A lot of companies only seem to want to hire people who somehow earn these skills through osmosis and don't want to hire people on straight out of school. Some career paths are easier than others, but it really feels in some cases like it's a closed loop. Teachers for example are clinging to their career long after they should.
