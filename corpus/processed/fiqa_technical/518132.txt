"A living wage =/= ""giving them everything"" I really don't think anyone disagrees with you that entry level positions result in lower wages than more advanced/skilled positions. I think the notion of this thread is more ""pay people enough to eat, have a roof over their head, and be able to afford transportation."" That's what I mean by livable wage."
