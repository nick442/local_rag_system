Yes we do still get paid. When someone get's a burnout, they pay six weeks. There's a lot of pseudo-sickness anyway, and people living unhealthy lives and getting sick through that, so i wouldn't actually find the australian system a problem.although you only have to get really sick once to feel it hard.
