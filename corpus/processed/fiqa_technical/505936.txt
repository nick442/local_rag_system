When I read Lukacko's comment, I assumed he was referring to the managers of the (failed) big banks as being unproductive, nowhere did I see him claim the poor were at fault. Obviously, one of us is misreading his comment. I suspect it's you. You see, the managers of the big banks failed. The Government responded by throwing money at them. They are *still* failures. They are *still* losing money (see: JPMorgan). Throwing money at them didn't solve a damn thing, did it? It only made the problem worse.
