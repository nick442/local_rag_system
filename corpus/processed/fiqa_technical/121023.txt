>They're already on food stamps with one estimate that more than 3/4 of Walmart's employees receiving some sort of government assistance. I doubt 75% of their workforce is on food stamps. Walmart has increased their wages and increases their full time staff. >There are very few Walmarts in Minneapolis partially because that's where Target's offices are located. So? >The most calls for police was to one of the WalMarts. This isn't just in Minneapolis. Across the nation law enforcement devotes significant resources to WalMart. Why pay for security when the police come for free? Despite Walmart having its own security. By the way your second link isn't exactly creditable to say the least.
