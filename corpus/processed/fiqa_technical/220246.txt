Oh god yes please! Ticketmaster is so bad I'd be happy if Comcast took market share from them! Actually, instead can we kill Comcast too? And maybe Verizon while we're at it! Seriously though, buying tickets for shows has become so bad over the years that I stopped going to most shows over a decade ago. Besides small venue local shows where you pay at the door or buy in advance from the venue itself, I just refuse to waste my time money and sanity even dealing with Ticketmaster. It sucks because there's a lot of 80s/90s bands that are still kicking around, or have reunion tours that I just skip and I never know if that will be their last tour or show even. The last big venue show I went to was the 2003 Pixies reunion after they had a 5 year hiatus. I know they've toured since then, but I was glad I got to see them though.
