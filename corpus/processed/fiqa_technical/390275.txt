I thought the line is much blurrier than that though. Say you have a company with divisions. An overseas division makes an item, sells it to another division overseas for final packaging, then it's sold domestically. The domestic division should only pay taxes on the profits they earn, and overseas on the profits from what they ship. But the company only wants to pay minimal taxes, so they set the foreign price high so that a majority of profits are made overseas. Who will argue that this isn't correct? Isn't that it? It's not foreign sales but interdivisional markup?
