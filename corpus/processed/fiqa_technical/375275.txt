The era ended a long time ago. Sears effectively carried less and less quality merchandise and consistently more garbage year over year for nearly 15 years. The local Sears here was a constant clearance sale of lousy brand clothing and a hodge lodge of things typically done far better elsewhere. Their television department had a selection of 6 TVs to Best Buy's 80; their lingerie department was a few random shelves mixed into heaps of their low quality house brand Jessica products and a bizarre amount of real estate committed to Vanity Fair nylon briefs that haven't been in style since '53; their tools were a random mix of shop, yard and household standards available in more orderly arrangement from any genuine home or hardware outlet; and their men's suits were 8 racks with one brand name offering and a sprinkling of hideously ugly, ill-conceived, and off-trend coloured garbage in fabrics akin to cardboard. In short, Sears had turned into a dump.
