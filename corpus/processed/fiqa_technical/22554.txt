It's actually embarrassing how bad some of our infrastructure is. If you've ever spent time in most of western Europe or the more modernized Asian cities, you'll realize that our infrastructure and public transit is essentially far behind the other leading countries in the world. It's a complicated topic, and there are a lot of reasons why (much of our public transit was built decades before European and Asian public transit, the State vs. Federal funding model, etc), but it's an issue that needs to get fixed and should be getting bipartisan support.
