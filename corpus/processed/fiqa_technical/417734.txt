"That's just it...the ""going rate"" is inflated. All ""piracy"" is is a market correction. If you have a product that is easily copied, easily stored, easily duplicated, and easily distributed for next to no cost your products value is essentially zero. But this doesn't mean they cannot make money off of it. Like TV, where the shows are worth nothing, but the eyes that watch it are they can leverage media in other way. It's just the media industries CHOOSE not to."
