>Can't wait to see Toys'R'Us implode. I don't think that will happen because they've got BabiesRUs. What they've started doing is closing old ToysRUs locations, and opening new, combined versions of ToysRUs and BabiesRUs. Moms come in to get clothes and diapers and leave with toys for the other kids.
