that's not the joke so much as it is natural progression. for a while, consumers were less interested in customer service and more interested in the product they were getting. now, so many products have nearly identical specs, quality, and etc. that good customer service can be used as a distinguishing fact to push a consumer to a given company, so companies are now caring more about their customer service reputation.
