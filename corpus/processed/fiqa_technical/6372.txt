"I like it.. maybe a little fixed gambling via those new ""slot"" machines that are a cross between video games and just-keep-pumpin'-those-quarters. Mandatory line dance on the bar every hour by the comely servers. Hot but not so hot you can't park grandma for the evening. I'm all for a true celebration of Americana and local roots and the whole idea in the abstract is not bad at all.. but I will be surprised if they can pull together the right talent while sidestepping politics at the same time. More than likely it will end up as Applebees the Hotel."
