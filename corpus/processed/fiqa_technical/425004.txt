Same here. I'm 61. My work requires long hours sometimes 18 hrs/day during production. It is filled with people half my age and I love it. It's invigorating. When my mind is on fire I could go forever. Working with younger people has shaved about 20 years off my mental age and they seem incredibly grateful for my experience. I can answer a lot of questions in minutes that would take them days. I wouldn't MIND working three days a week. But I don't NEED it.
