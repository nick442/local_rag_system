The bigger problem isn't the people making career posts. It's that this subreddit has grown too big to have the intelligent conversation it once did. This subreddit has gone from being mostly finance professionals to now including the types you see in /r/economy and other idiots that are only tangentially interested in finance. I'm not sure what you can do about this, it's probably too late.
