While I guess you can never tell for sure, I think it is a potential problem. Why buy from you, ship it from the US when probably a similar computer is available nearer to them? I mean, this person is using a computer and the Internet somewhere, so it can't be that far to a new computer store. Certainly somewhere in their province if not country or continent. I suspect they will offer to pay with a cashiers check or a money order or something. Then you will ship the item and the funds will be found out to be bogus a couple of months after you try to cash it. You have no computer and no money for it. It really makes no sense for this person to go so far out of their way for your standard laptop unless they are trying to steal it.
