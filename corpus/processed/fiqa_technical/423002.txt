"> having to wait around for the delivery If it is advantageous for you to stay at the house (e.g. you have small children), online groceries will be your friend. If you have a certain brand that you like, I am certain you will only need to find it once when buying online. Just like I use the ""reorder"" button to place the same online order over and over again on Chipotle.com. It sounds like you might not be in the target demographic for the service, but that doesn't mean there is no market for it."
