You can be a millionaire and either not own a home (e.g. rent) or have a home whose value has declined to less than the original purchase price. Bankruptcy is for people unable to pay their debts. There is a difference between being unable to pay ones debts and unemployed. Unemployment benefits exist simply to help those out of work. Additionally, hiring a lawyer and filing for bankruptcy is neither free nor cheap.
