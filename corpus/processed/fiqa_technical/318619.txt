I get it; money is money and shareholders demand businesses make as much as they possibly can. Great. That doesn't change my opinion that tax inversions are wrong. They deprive the US of valuable income which has been earned through infrastructure, defense, education, etc. It's legal right now so fine but I don't have to patronize businesses which choose to do this. So if the deal closes, as much as I don't eat fast food often, Burger King will lose my future business. Just my choice. And my choice to make the suggestion to others in as many public forums as possible. <shrug>
