"You will need to file a US income tax return, and declare all income world-wide. Whether this results in any tax owed depends on your particular circumstances, and the effect of any tax treaties between the US and India. There are additional requirements for the filing of information on the amounts in foreign accounts held by ""US tax persons"". Depending on the nature of these accounts, the complexity of the forms, and the penalties for non-compliance can be quite high.. Short version: Consult a professional well-qualified in US/India tax matters.."
