In America, the government is ours. We vote for all the people in it. It is within our power to make it what we want and it is our responsibly to keep it functioning properly. We have been doing a poor job for the past couple of generations, but we have the ability to turn it around. To restrict the power of the US government is to reduce the power of the American people to determine the kind of society we want to live in. I do not want to live under the tyranny of huge multinational corporations who only care that I work and consume. Corporations haven't always owned and controlled the government to the degree they do today. They have always had influence, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. For the past 40 years, as we have been gradually moving towards a more laissez faire philosophy, government corruption has gotten worse and worse. Tax cuts for the uber rich, blanket free trade agreements with 3rd world countries, and deregulation have caused corporations get much larger and far more powerful than they were a generation or two ago. So much money has flooded into Washington because of these bad policy decisions, that it will be very hard to undo. But the only way to undo the damage caused by supply side economics is for the American people to decide they want something else and to vote accordingly.
