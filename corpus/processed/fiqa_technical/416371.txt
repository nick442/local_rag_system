"I have never seen anything that suggest it's illegal to charge ""fair"" interests on loans, personally or commercially. Even CRA has long allowed the use of properly written ""promissory notes"" as the proof for personal loans between individuals, as long as the rates are consistent with their current ""subscribed rate"" (think bank's prime rate, if you don't want to having to look it up on CRA site). Loan Shark is someone or some entity that charges significantly higher interests than the rates posted by FI's. We are talking about 30+% versus the bank's 10%. Yes, we can argue the FI's are acting like Loan Shark when it comes to credit card interest rates, but that's another discussion."
