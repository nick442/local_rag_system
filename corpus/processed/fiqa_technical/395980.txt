Well yeah, because for right or wrong people age 16-19 are young, idealistic, getting fed propaganda about fossil fuels (note I'm not saying it's right or wrong propaganda), and attracted to the shiny tech stuff. Millennials are now older, and they are in the position where many realize their best bet at a decent life is in the O&G industry or its support industries. Things get different when you're an adult and have to make more and more real decisions for your life.
