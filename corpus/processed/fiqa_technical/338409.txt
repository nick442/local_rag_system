"I wrote a longer reply then deleted it. Socialism as a term has developed so many conflicting definitions that it has become almost completely useless. That being said, I don't believe that a group of countries where several still have their royal and noble classes, and their economy is a commodity and market driven economy qualify as meeting the basic tenets of Marx's Socialism. On the other hand, they are certainly leftist and their model is working well for them, and many western countries could be better if they moved toward the Nordic Model, but again they are not ""True Socialism""."
