By the by, I'm 27. I've been living on my own since I was 15. I've worked at startup-style companies with a rich founder and no investment (Limewire), worked for funded startups companies as a consultant (ex: Ning), personally know the founders and/or very early stage employees of many famous startups (Gowalla, Twitter, GitHub, Shopify, etc), and I've also consulted for companies like Bear Stearns, Pepsico, Fordâ€¦ But you could already tell all that from my picture, I'm sure.
