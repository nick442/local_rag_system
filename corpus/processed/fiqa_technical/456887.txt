>> Hey! Do you mind giving your credit card to the waiter.. > I'm not especially fond of that, but it's easy to report fraud to the bank and most of the time the bank will reverse the charges. No kidding! Of course, even I give credit cards to waiters. What do I care? **As you said, you are not liable to any fraud on your credit card.** None at all!! It's only Merchant, not the credit card company, that pay the price for fraud.. **and you pay higher prices to cover for losses from fraud.** > The PIN situation is different because a mugging is life-threatening. Nonsense! Mugging at the ATM is so rare, each ATM has a camera. **In any case, I am not talking about using PIN to withdraw money!** I am talking about PIN to authorize charges on a credit card or ATM card. >> We already determined that nobody even care about signatures or check them. > You can't use a stolen card at an ATM with a signature. Huh? You totally got it wrong what I said, or, you argue for the sake of argument. **I am saying that cards that require you to enter a PIN cannot be used used when stolen or copied. Yes or no?** **On the other hand, cards that require signature can be used when stolen or copied because signature is a worthless method to validate the charge. Yes or no?** LASTLY, my Costco credit card has a picture of me on it. **Question for you, since for some reason you argue so much against PINs: Wouldn't a picture on the card better than a signature?** Yes or no? Do you see? There are so many ways to make this system so much more secure and fraud proof.. but, ON PURPOSE, the credit card companies don't want that.. because they are not liable for fraud. Simple as that.
