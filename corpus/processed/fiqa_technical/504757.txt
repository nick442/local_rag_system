> You want me to predict the future. Nobody can predict the future > Nobody knew what would happen when cars were invented, or when computers were invented, or when the internet was invented, but we figured it out. The difference being that those were the tools to help us do the work. We are now building tools that do the work for us. Pretending that automation (which is a good thing, I agree) is the same as industrialization is just naive.
