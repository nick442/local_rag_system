Yea I think a lot of this article is poorly written stats mashed together to make a weak statement. 4% for a card present merchant is way expensive. For someone with an average ticket of above ~$25 I'd say 2-2.5% is more the norm. But saying interchange fees are generating more revenue than overdraft could be attributed to so many things, like people just using credit cards instead of debit cards. Note there's no data here (that I saw at least) about the volume spent on cards overall either, for example was the volume just transferred from debit to credit or did the volume actually go up even? Overall pretty garbage article imo that provides no real value to the reader.
