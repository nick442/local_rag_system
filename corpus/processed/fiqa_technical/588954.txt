"Just came across [this Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21608751-restricting-companies-moving-abroad-no-substitute-corporate-tax-reform-how-stop) article, they make it sound quite straight forward and I don't think they can be called totalitarian leftists by any stretch. Here is the money quote. > America’s corporate tax has two horrible flaws. The first is the tax rate, which at 35% is the highest among the 34 mostly rich-country members of the OECD. Yet it raises less revenue than the OECD average thanks to myriad loopholes and tax breaks aimed at everything from machinery investment to NASCAR race tracks. Last year these breaks cost $150 billion in forgone revenue, more than half of what America collected in total corporate taxes. > > The second flaw is that America levies tax on a company’s income no matter where in the world it is earned. In contrast, every other large rich country taxes only income earned within its borders. Here, too, America’s system is absurdly ineffective at collecting money. Firms do not have to pay tax on foreign profits until they bring them back home. Not surprisingly, many do not: American multinationals have some $2 trillion sitting on their foreign units’ balance-sheets, and growing. It seems clear that the 35% rate is not the driving reason for these huge companies doing inversions. That 35% rate should almost certainly be cut down, but the loopholes and tax breaks need to stop as a condition of a rate cut. Clearly this is not a dead simple issue, but I just don't want to hear the silly argument of ""oh our poor mega corporations are having to pay the highest taxes in the world!"" when the tax environment in the US is clearly rigged in their favor. Small and mid sized companies that can't afford their own Congressman sure are getting fucked though, and that makes me sad."
