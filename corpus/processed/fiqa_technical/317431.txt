They clearly learned that this was a bad move **and then backtracked**. If you reward them now, you positively reinforce their backtracking, and their thinking of consumers' needs. If you punish them now, you negatively reinforce these behaviours, making them less likely in the future. Also, just because you didn't see a line item on your bill doesn't mean that you were not paying for this service. In fact, the people who use the service are being subsidized by other people who use cheaper-to-provide services, like paying via their bank. Should Verizon force some customers to give money to others because they won't use a cheaper method? This status quo is what is being reverted to.
