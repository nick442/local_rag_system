It is fine to think about options you may have when X to Y years down the road you move out of the condo. The reason you move may be kids, or job opportunities, or a shorter commute, or wanting to move back to Germany. The thing is that nobody can tell you what the investment situation may be when you move out of the unit. You may want to sell, you may need to sell; but the market may say no way to sell and get back what you owe - so you have to become a landlord. Or the prices could go through the roof, and selling makes the most sense. In those ten years the local market could crater because the water system is full of lead (see Flint Michigan), or the biggest industry moves. Other bad things could be overbuilding so that there are too many condos on the market. On the good side the neighborhood could become the place that young people graduating college in the mid 2020s want to live. Of course you can't ask them because they are currently in 6th grade. Decide what make sense for you now. What is the likelihood that you will have to move in 2-3 years. What about 3-7 years. I would only start evaluating the investment part if I had lived there awhile and now had to plan what to do when we are ready to move out a year or two from then.
