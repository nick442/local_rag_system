"First of all congrats.. very nice work indeed. Secondly, i do not offer this as legal advise. lol. anyhow. you need to make sure to hang on to as much as possible, being a single earner, our Uncle (Sam) is going to want what's due.. That being said, you should probably look into investments, for starters, purchase a primary residence or start a business, or purchase a primary residence and use that as a business residence (both). what you basically want are write-offs. you need to bring your ""taxable"" income as low as possible so you pay minimal taxes. in your case, you're in danger of paying a hefty sum in taxes.. i'm sure you can shield yourself with various business expenses (a car, workplace, computers, etc. ) that you could benefit from, both professionally and individually. and then seriously bro.. making 250k leads me to believe you've got at least more than half a brain, and that you're using more than half of that. so dude. get an accountant.. and one you can trust. ask your parents, colleagues, people you've worked with in the past. etc. there are professionals who are equally as talented in helping you keep your money as you are in making it. -OR- you could get married, make sure your wife stays at home and start popping out kids asap.. those keep my taxable (and excess) income pretty low. LOL! I'm going to add to this.. as a contractor, i've generally put any ""estimated"" taxes into some kind of interest accruing account so i can at least make a little money before i have to give it away. in your case, i'd say put away at least 2/3's into some kind of interest earning account. start by talking to your personal banker wherever your money is. you'll be surprised at how nice they treat you.. you ARE going to have to pay taxes. so until you do, try to make a little money while it sits. again, nice problem to have!"
