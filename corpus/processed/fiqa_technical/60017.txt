"The others nailed it, great answers. I'd add - the two things I'd prioritize ahead of this debt, higher interest debt, obviously. And matched 401(k) deposits. I can't repeat enough - many people are so anti debt, they walk away from guaranteed 100% returns. ""after I pay my mortgage, I'll max out my 401(k) and catch up."" I've read this, and it will never make sense. After that, pay off the 9% rate as soon as you can."
