If you want to use the original material then you will, essentially, need to negotiate for it. You are in ugly, muddy territory. Don't expect a simple, easy legal solution to exist; civil courts exist partly to help navigate these kinds of quagmires. A negotiated solution would, on the other hand, clean everything up nicely. Do you have your copyright ducks in a row? If the contract does not stipulate otherwise, the creator will still maintain reproduction and moral copyright to the work; i.e., the creator will continue to own the copyrights to the work and you'll be unable to license or sell them to a third party.
