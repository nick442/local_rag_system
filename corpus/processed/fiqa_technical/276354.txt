"I'll second what littleadv says about the ""entertainment"" expenses; they do seem high relative to your income. The numbers for electricity and vehicle insurance seem high to me as well, but that depends on where you live and how you heat your house, etc., so they may be normal for your situation. You've got almost $500/month going to debt payments (vehicle, window replacement, and student loan). You didn't list the credit card payments on there, so that will add to the debt payment amount. Finding a way to get those debts paid off as quickly as possible would free up a lot of cash flow. You could consider trying to find extra income (second job, your wife getting a job or finding a way to make some money from home, sell some things, etc.) I'm wondering about the things I don't see here: food (including restaurants), clothing, fuel, maintenance and repairs (both car and house), etc, etc. With the numbers you list above, you have money left over every month, but when you add in the things I just mentioned, that may not be the case. I suggest that you keep track of all of your expenses for the next month to see what you're really spending (including the things not listed here). Then, using that information, make a plan for the following month (and every month thereafter) about how you're going to live on what you bring home. Just tracking your expenses will likely show you some areas where you could easily cut back on spending. Also, I recommend that you start working on a plan to increase your income, both temporarily as I suggest above, and longer term by focusing on your career direction. You are above the poverty level (assuming you live in the US), but below average in income."
