Is the balance (in dollars, say) automatically converted to rupees when I try to: You can't transact on this account like you do on savings account. So there is NO ATM/Debit Card/Net Banking. You have to walk-in to the Branch and withdraw in local currency or in travel cards as required. Am I correct in understanding that a resident foreign currency account cannot have deposits made into it in rupees, say if someone wants to transfer money to me using IMPS? Deposits are restricted.
