"In a way I would almost welcome it becuase ibeleive the outrage from so many millions might actually generate the groundswell public reaction we need to drastically limit software patents. It's outrageous. U.S. Patent No. 5,946,647 on a ""system and method for performing an action on a structure in computer-generated data"" (in its complaint, Apple provides examples such as the recognition of ""phone numbers, post-office addresses and dates"" and the ability to perform ""related actions with that data""; one example is that ""the system may receive data that includes a phone number, highlight it for a user, and then, in response to a user's interaction with the highlighted text, offer the user the choice of making a phone call to the number"") every fing computer has done that for ever. U.S. Patent No. 6,343,263 on a ""real-time signal processing system for serially transmitted data"" (while this sounds like a pure hardware patent, there are various references in it to logical connections, drivers, programs; in its complaint, Apple said that this patent ""relates generally to providing programming abstraction layers for real-time processing applications"") so vague as to be anything apple wants yet so low level that obviously premempted by every prior serial data receiver which is every analog and digital radio receiver EVER."
