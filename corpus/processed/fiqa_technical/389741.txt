The way Google leased to Apple, it would have cost them big time if they had kept using the Google Maps app. Add to the fact that Google would not release Turn-by-turn navigation, Apple decided to take a risk and build their own. And even though they fucked up, they have the resources get their shit together and still make a profit. I'll be interested to see what happens next.
