Agreed, early in the article one of the owners compares themselves to their german competitors that eat $200+k of their lunch regularly because they lack staff to keep up with demand. Germany does not traditionally drug test every position up and down the chain. They generally only do it if you are responsible for narcotics (pharma), running heavy equipment or handling something that would kill people if you screwed up. If you are a cashier, desk worker or laborer you do not get tested as it is considered an invasion of privacy.
