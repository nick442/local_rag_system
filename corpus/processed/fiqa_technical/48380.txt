> Movie theaters aren't full 99.9% of time I go a lot, I love seeing movies in the theater, most of the time it's barely 5% full. As far as cannibalizing people like me who pay full price, that is negligible, people like me that see a few movies a month are such a small fraction of customers. Others that pay full price will still likely only see one movie per month, but I can't tell you how many times I've been told, or over heard other people saying how the movies are way too expensive to go EVER, unless it's some major event, but even those blockbusters are doing less and less revenue now that people can wait a few months for the DVD or watch it online. I think this model opens up millions of consumers that gave up on the high cost of taking their family to the movies and also allows far more concession sales. If you have 2 kids, it's about $50 just on the tickets, that's not something most families can afford to do very often. Personally, I had always suggested a model where a subscription like this would cover mornings and weekdays when theaters are largely empty for those showings.
