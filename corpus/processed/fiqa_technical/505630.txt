As an option? Isn't it already an option? I mean, I could have sworn I have some apps set that way in my iPhone right now. Maybe they're switching things to that being the default setting applied when an app requests your location? My assumption is that currently it applies the Always option when an app asks for your location the first time .. and then you have to go into privacy settings to downgrade it to only when using app. This might flip that logic - which would be a good idea IMO.
