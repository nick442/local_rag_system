That's a loaded question. Economists can't even agree on an answer from a purely economic point of view. I will say this.. I think that many people who are advocating radical cutbacks in spending (Republicans and Tea Partiers) are deluding themselves in two important ways: 1) That it's possible to balance the budget without raising revenues. I don't think very many economists agree with this premise. Even Paul Ryan's plan to balance the budget, should one take a hard look at the number, clearly show how impossible it is. There would either have to be tax hikes **OR** we slash the military to a fraction of its size now **AND** leave no money for pretty much anything else (like roads, highways, air traffic control, food safety inspections, education, farm subsidies, oil subsidies, etc.). 2) More importantly, I think there is an implicit and fundamental belief among right-wingers that the world will somehow stop what it's doing while the US balances its budget. The belief goes that, once we are fiscally healthy, we will remain a superpower and ruling the world like we have for 100 years. This is fundamentally wrong. I think most people, even Tea Partiers, fail to appreciate how fundamentally important America's debt has been to our history. We have essentially borrowed our way into power. Should the right win the day and put in place radical cuts in spending, America's economic, political, diplomatic, cultural, and military influence around the world will be among to go. The dollar will nosedive and so will our standards of living. Our GDP will not be able to support a a political economy that can maintain superpower status. Now, I do not mean to say that I do not agree with the right. From a purely economic point of view, they may very well be right. I'm not even sure there is an option. In fact, a part of me is ready to accept America becoming what France and the UK are now, still having relatively good standards of living but nowhere near the height of their historical powers. Maybe the world will be better for it. I just don't think Tea Partiers appreciate the ultimate result of what they want to see happen.
