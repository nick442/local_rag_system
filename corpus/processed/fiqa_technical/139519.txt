I'm sorry to hear that. Some people do just get shit on occasionally. But my point was that there's only one factor in that equation you have any control over, so that's the important one to focus on. Blaming bad luck is like blaming goblins; it might make you feel better, but it can't actually help, and may even redirect useful energies into fruitless pursuits.
