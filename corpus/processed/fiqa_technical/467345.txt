Normally, yes, kind of. I don't personally think in terms of 'generating profit' when making business IT purchasing decisions, I merely think in terms of adding value. But in the context of the article: >Before you buy a technology, consider well whether it is going to increase your revenues or decrease your costs? If it would not then there is no point buying it. A DR/BC facility will never generate profit. It will, hopefully, allow you to continue generating the profit you were generating any way, should shit go bad. But even then, your costs are likely to go up. So when I say 'kind of', I mean you're right in that 'profit' can mean more than numbers on a balance sheet, but the writer of the article seems to present 'profit' in those black and white terms. The article appears to advocate something that is not particularly good practice, but deems to call it so.
