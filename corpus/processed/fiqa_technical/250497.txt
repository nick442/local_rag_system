"Have worked in 4 different 'open space' offices, and by far the most distracting noise has been laughter..I'm all for enjoying your work and conversations don't bother me nearly as much, but there are certain I guess, ""types"" of laughter that sounds either forced or exaggerated, and that noise carries very well and to me is wicked distracting."
