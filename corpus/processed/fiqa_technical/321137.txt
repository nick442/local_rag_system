Amazon is much more screwed up than you think. They lose entire pallets of goods in their warehouse and auction them off all the time ( bulq) sometimes if you are lucky they will compensate you for them. EVERY Box on a pallet has an amazon label on it which shows the box number, shipment name, sku and qantity yet Amazon will randomly relabel items without consent or notification and Bo way to stop it. How do I know then? I ask customers for photos of the goods they are having issues with that clearly show Amazon's label over our label. If our label and photo show 100 count blue and Amazon relabel it 50 count yellow. Seller Support is completely useless to assist in this.
