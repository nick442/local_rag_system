The idea of it being one state is kind of unrealistic, in terms of population it would be the same as 10 states. If you were to break the UK up into 10 states and add them to the US then London would be the richest state, many regions would be wealthier than the majority of the states. If you break it down into these regions http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_regions_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita by GDP per capita it shows there would be 7 UK regions in the top 15 states. edit: The link was messed up because it has brackets in it
