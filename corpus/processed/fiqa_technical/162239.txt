Lobbyists wrote it. Its all the things that they want but could never get in an election. Plus, once they are in a trade deal, they can't ever be reversed, even by future administrations, even political upheavals cant change them. Because they give corporations ownership rights to the countries markets that can't be taken away or changed by governments or they have to pay. The taxpayers have to compensate MULTINATIONAL corporations for things like regulations.The trade deals are a new supranational system which elevates multinational corporations to a place where they can sue nations if they change the rules after a corporation has invested some money in the situation. Politicians can do whatever they want *as long as it doesn't effect any multinational corporations business interests adversely.* For example, they can do things which make them *more* profitable, just not less. that leaves them as always having to impact people because people dont exist in this system except as a passive buyer in the marketplace which cannot be devalued by - for example, public services which devalue markets. The country would have to reimburse the owners for the lost profits.
