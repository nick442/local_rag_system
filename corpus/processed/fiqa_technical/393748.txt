I would argue that we don’t have a shortage of STEM resources. Immigration policy hasn’t changed a lot either. What percentage of STEM students are from war torn Arab nations (the ones whose immigration policy has changed) It can’t be more than 10%. As someone who works in the field, it’s largely India and China. (That said, China is rapidly catching up so there is some truth to that aspect of it)
