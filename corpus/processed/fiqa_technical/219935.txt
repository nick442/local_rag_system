checkers should be paid by item quantity/rate they scan. Many o time have seen chatty checkers with a few in their line while the person next to them has moved 3 times the good quantity across the scanner. I also loathe check writers, they wait till the last minute, then ask the price again a few times and I swear use calligraphy to fill out the check - taking more time.
