Indeed. This is the death punch the Chinese have been training for. Remove the petrodollar and our economy cant survive without all that demand. One punch, you neutered the US and its military budget now becomes to large to finance. The cost of imports would also increase destroying what ever purchasing power the average broke citizen has. US would be forced to deal with its budget and cut backs to social programs would cause chaos. Fun times ahead.
