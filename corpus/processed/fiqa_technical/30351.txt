I think the primary reason you're being down voted is because of the way you address people who align themselves with left wing ideology. Let's either call them all foolish, or none of them. I prefer calling them all foolish, one stream lined school of thought is rather repugnant. Anyway, Your points on equality are spot on (theoretically), handicapping applicants based on values that should already be overlooked is introducing a bias to correct another bias, it's a short term strategy and for what it's worth I agree with you. That is, I would if racism/classism/genderism didn't exist in practice. The problem is what is actually observed in the real world, all too often better candidates for a job are excluded in favor for those who are of similar religion or race as the employer, when the cast offs would perform better at the job. It is virtually never the other way around, where someone of a weaker skill set is forced on the job to fill a government implemented quota, and if it is the case, it is also usually done deliberately, choosing a very weak candidate to appeal to the government in attempts to exonerate themselves from those particular laws. My focus point: And sure it's your choice as an employer to bring on whoever you want, that's piece of mind for you, the employer, you've created the company that you wanted, but it's not the BEST IT COULD BE in terms of production purposes for society because the employer hasn't assembled the best possible work force with it's available applicants. It is here that we see there are negative externalities on the public, as inefficiency rises due to class/race/gender favoritism being chosen over ability. Employing people to help create your master vision fundamentally incorporates compromise, for the betterment of society.
