I assume by not-so-good prospects you mean small account clients whose revenue will not justify the time required to close a deal and/or post-sale service. Glad to see you are being realistic about the value of your time vs. what a prospect is paying. A big part of your practice is going to come down to what infrastructure/processes your dealer firm or back office support has. Is yours one with a formal small account policy that assigns servicing to a centralized service center (aka call center)? I've also seen others separate direct at fund vs held in-house (omnibus) based on client assets. Small accounts go direct to at fund and are directed to the mutual fund transfer agent for post-sale servicing needs. The up-front sales charge compensates for the initial consultation and the rest is self-servicing / support by the fund transfer agent.
