> war only exists because other governments exist That's extremely naive. War existed long before governments. Any collective of humans is capable of going to war. > government doesn't actually do anything related to roads, other than use tax money to pay individual companies to build them So how do you remove government from those steps? You think we should have private police forces? You think State Farm or Allstate wants to do that? How exactly would they compete on price? It would not be a profitable enterprise unless it was totally corrupt.
