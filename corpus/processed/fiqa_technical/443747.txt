Why bother? You don't even acknowledge the impact of our oil lust on the rest of the world? Read a damn history book starting around WW1 and Sykes-Picot. But that's the typical libertarian MO. Take, take and take. If you were a true libertarian (most people who claim so are not) you refuse all foreign sources of oil.
