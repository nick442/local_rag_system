"That wasn't really my point. I was countering the attitudes that 1. Landlords vs slumlords - somehow I doubt if the author lives in a real slum with a landlord that provides substandard housing. Why call a landlord a derogatory name for providing you a place to live>? 2. The idea that the ""slumlords"" somehow conspired to artificially inflate, then deflate the quiet and lovely neighborhood. Pretty ridiculous notion in my opinion. Not to mention that buying a home in an area with abysmal schools doesn't seem to be a good idea if you have a ""gifted daughter"", unless you can afford to send her to private schools."
