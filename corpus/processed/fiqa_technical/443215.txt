"Just because they have an ""R"" Doesn't mean much.. There's many different factions among tye Republicans that are at odds with each other.. Apparently they don't fall in line as easily as democrats.. It's also much easier to write blank checks with disregard to cost (like dems did with the ACA) than to write legislation that is budget neutral.. I don't blame them.. The ACA spent years throwing bread to the plebes.. It only made a real fix now difficult.."
