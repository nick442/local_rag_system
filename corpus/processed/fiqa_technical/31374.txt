I think he is saying that the vote was not the reform needed. Some of you will be too young to understand but my only class action that I was in was Blockbuster. I ended up with like $1.45. If I had to guess I would spend about 20-50 bucks a month in late fees. Sometimes it was my fault because if I missed the weird time to return them I felt I might as well keep them for the fees and would be late again. I did not agree to sue them. I just did not opt out. Blockbuster made tons off of me and people like me. The lawyers who really just put people together as a class made millions. The customer is a pawn. That is what I think he means. You would need meaningful reform in the class action space for this to really matter. This is one of our boys are going to be sued and we should help them. Congress has basically protected Equifax downside risk. Yetto address the reality of the fact that the hack impacts the people congress supposedly works for and was caused by gross negligence. Maybe they should be building an RFP to replace them, not protect them.
