If it's true then right now we're in 1937-1938 and you know what happened in the decade after that.. not good. Edit: the central bank in Japan is quietly bailing out the central government by buying up the Treasuries and controlling the yield curve. If that succeeds without a major uprising or violence, maybe there's hope America and Europe can do it too.
