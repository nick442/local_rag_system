"You're right to question that. I would not respect him as much if he didn't have all that money. Business is a game and money is how we keep score. Without the money, he wouldn't be famous enough for me to hear his words. While success can come from an inherited name, luck, or dishonesty, his came from plans and execution. I disagree with you that Thiel is not an intellectual. He may be wrong, but his thoughts on matters are complex and thoughtful. This is evident to me in interviews of him that I have seen and especially in the book that everyone knows him by ""Zero to One"". I think its a great book (obviously). It reminds me of ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" in that it seems to address a higher level of business competition dynamics. Whether you find its points valid or not, a large number of people find it uniquely insightful. I also disagree with you that he is not a tactical heavy hitter. His last minute double-down donation to Trump was more tactical than strategic. He was supporting Trump for strategic reasons. The form, timing, and degree of his support depended largely on tactical considerations. I, and most of his peers, thought he was throwing away money. He wasn't. His feud with Gawker was for strategic reasons. His funding Hogan against them was a tactic and depended on his estimation that it was likely to succeed. >He has shown some very good strategies but they more often than not require a lot of upfront money to be able to weather any temporal bad results. Is rather vague. I would guess you are confusing strategies with tactics."
