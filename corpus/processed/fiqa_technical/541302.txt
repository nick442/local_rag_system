">first is that investors are perfectly rationale allocators of capital. Yes, they are rational, and far superior to the government. > that excess capital is invested - at all It is either invested, or converted to consumption that Hanauer claims to be so important >that taxation (presumably what is considered ""high"") has caused unproductive investing practices, when in fact the inverse is true nonsense, and stupid. unworthy of further comment >have resulted in the incentive for investors to sit on their capital and do nothing to return it to the system. wrong. people don't sit on cash. >that investing profits back into expansion and worker compensation is misallocation of resources. Yes, it absolutely is unless the people in charge have determined that the ROI is sufficient. Without adequate reward, you are literally just burning money. >giving precedence to the relatively elite investor class ensures that capital is allocated according to their whims You mean retail investors and pension funds? yeah, so elite, such whims. You act like stock holders are all fat cats smoking cigars in a country club. >and often times that simply means into their bank accounts. Wow, such retardation: - rich people don't just leave mountains of cash in bank accounts - even if they did, the bank would be using that money to fund loans, etc, so it's still ""in the system"" >i would like others to know that what you are saying is widely debunked, chicago school nonsense You sound like a very pretentious liberal who wants very badly for the reality of economics to not be true because it conflicts with your political beliefs >a few hours of unbiased research will make this evident everything in your post is written is a jaw-droppingly pretentious style, almost like you see yourself as posing for the cover of the New Yorker as one of those fat cats you despise"
