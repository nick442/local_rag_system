"I think a big part of this is sports coverage like he brought up. The only programming I miss from cable are live sports events. Luckily for me my favorite sport, the NFL, has kept games on non-cable television for local markets even when their games are on cable. Otherwise I might actually buy it. What keeps TV in the game though are the contracts and blackout restrictions. I'm a big Wisconsin sports fan. I dropped cable in favor of picking up the MLB and NBA online options. The MLB one streamed game and looked great. The HD was spectacular and the service good. The NBA wasn't as great quality but definitely better than a free stream, plus I could pick up to 8 teams I wanted to watch. However, because of blackout restrictions and TV contracts I could never watch a Bucks or a Brewers game. The sole reason I purchased the products was to watch my hometown teams but the TV contracts prevented it. The NFL AFAIK only offers NFL replay--you can watch any NFL game 24 hours after it has been played. Anyone looking for a change in these policies can look elsewhere too. The NFL just signed a 10 year deal with television companies. Unless those channels want to start streaming the games on their websites it's not going to happen, unfortunately. I personally think the leagues are losing profit because they're losing a large audience. There are plenty of customers who stream games illegally online that would happily pay for a higher quality product, but television is preventing this. Also there has always been the excuse laid out by TV execs that ""we don't know how to properly monetize this content on the internet."" That excuse worked 5-10 years ago. I can't seem to buy it now anymore."
