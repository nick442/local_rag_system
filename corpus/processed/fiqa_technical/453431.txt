I work in logistics and in tandem with Amazon. Automated trucks is a LONG way down the pipe. They are not going to be able to implement that on a large scale for what I would imagine is at least 5-10 years. That's not to say it can't happen sooner, but with where we are at with the technology, that seems to be realistic.
