I'm sure the people at *The Weinstein Company* had absolutely no idea, and had never heard rumors, that he used his position to take advantage of women sexually. /s Hollywood is a chatty Kathy industry. There's a 0.00% chance the higher ups at his company didn't know what he did on his casting couch. So, I'm not sure what good it does for an organization that almost assuredly turned a blind eye has fired the man the turned a blind eye towards.
