I don't understand how that's relevant. If 10 people loan you money and I'm one of them, you shouldn't expect that I will agree for you to pay me less money just because the other 9 agreed to it. I loaned you that money with the expectation that I would get 100% of it back. Others may choose to adjust the terms of their loans, but it doesn't mean I have to.
