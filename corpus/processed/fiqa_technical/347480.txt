"Friedman (and libertarian philosophy) has a lot of good ideas when it comes to the general economy. But, healthcare is one of those things that, in my opinion, should not be left up to a ""free market."" Arguably we do not have a free market anyway, so all the more reason not to hand our lives and well being over to profit seeking corporations. If we had actual competition and the government nurtured good business practices (instead of corruption) then I would have more confidence in deregulation. I think the waste/inefficiency that government introduces does less damage than immoral profit seeking on the backs of sick people."
