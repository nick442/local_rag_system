I really doubt that this is an idea the people who own the working machines can get behind. Also machines taking away work is an illusion. It just changes what work is. I would argue guaranteed income is less important than the means (whatever they may be) for the workforce to effectively train or retrain for what's needed. That said I also feel that people use the term work and 'what makes money' interchangeably and it seems that this is changing.
