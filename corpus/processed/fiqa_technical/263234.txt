Direct from Square Support in an email to me today when I asked this very question: Thanks for writing in. You can certainly use Square for personal use. When activating your account, you’ll be asked how you intend to use Square. You’ll simply need to select ‘Individual Use.’ Don't think we can get more clear than that :)
