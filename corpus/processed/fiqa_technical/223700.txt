what are sick days? what if you're sick beyond those 10 days? You don't get paid? what about those 10 sick days, you do have to hand in a doctors note or something? Is there any compensation if you don't take any sick days? Europe here, we have no such thing as sick days, you can be ill as much as you want, and many people take multiple weeks (eventually you will get fired i guess ;) but as a person who hasn't taken a single sick day in the past year the whole thing kinda bothers me, as i am doing the work of the sick people every time.
