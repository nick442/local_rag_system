Note that this study isn't tracking graduates, just enrollment. Thomas Sowell pointed out that drop-out rates are higher for black Americans in many colleges, and believes that affirmative action is actually to blame - many of these upper tier institutions have lower academic requirements for black Americans applying, so these individuals are, on average, less prepared for that level to college, and drop out. He also felt that these students probably would have been prepared for an institution with lower requirements, and questioned whether it's better to drop out of Harvard or graduate from Brown. If you're saddled with a ton of debt and *also* don't have a degree to show for it, I'd say it's much more likely you're going to have trouble paying it off. I wonder what the figures for black graduates looks like compared to white graduates? If black graduates are at a payoff rate comparable to that of white graduates, I think that would be a fairly telling piece of evidence that it's not, in fact, about race - but about whether or not you graduated at all.
