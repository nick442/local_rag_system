100% agree with this guy. I worked in corporate development with two former investment bankers this summer and they both agreed that banks look, of course, for smart guys, but more importantly they look for smart guys who know how to have a good time and have interesting stories. Make sure it's clear that you are interested in more than just powerpoints and modeling.
