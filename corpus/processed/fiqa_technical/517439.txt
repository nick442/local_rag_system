Buffet doesn't strike me as the kind of man who leaves himself vulnerable to technological changes, especially ones that are a part of a greater whole he's acknowledged as imminent. To think that self driving cars are coming, but self driving tractor trailers are not, is foolish. Buffet isn't a foolish man. If/when Tesla Semis take over, Buffet will still find a way to profit from the change.
