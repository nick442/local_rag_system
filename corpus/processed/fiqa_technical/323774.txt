Targeted voter registration is *everywhere*, that's not very malicious. My college has people going around getting students to register (and that's a good thing!) on an absolutely industrial scale. Of course, I understand that they're not doing it out of the pure goodness of their heart; they want their candidate to win. This is somewhat reinforced by the fact that there's a democratic party office rented out 1 minute from campus..
