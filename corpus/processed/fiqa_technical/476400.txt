What IBM became was a provider of complete solutions independent of proprietary hardware and software. IBM still provided high end mainframe platforms, but it sloughed off anything that put it in a commoditized dead end. It was forced to do this in the 1980s when it almost disappeared trying to force profit from former hardware and software monopolies. The real question is how Microsoft avoids becoming the IBM that almost died in the 1980s and becomes something like or even better than the IBM after the 1980s.
