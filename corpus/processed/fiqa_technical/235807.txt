The debt is owed to banks. So, until people get control of the banks and cease to let banks control the government the answer is no. There are systems in which the currency could be issued by government or in the name of the people, which would not necessitate increasing indebtedness to banks to increase money supply to support a growing economy. As currencies now stand, we are paying a tax to banks in the form of debt for the growth of the economy. The faster an economy grows, the greater the debt. In addition, when an economy shrinks in a recession, the debt does not shrink and becomes more burdensome, stifling its ability to recover. If currency were an asset it would shrink with the economy and pose no burden to its recovery.
