no, i never said forgive student debts, i said give household massive money to pay back the debts. so give students that owe loans pure unadulterated cash. force them to use it to pay their student loans. if the sutdent doesn't have debt, or was responsible and paid it back themselves using their own money, then they get a free cash injection to do whtever they want with it. all's fair and square and beeswax.
