This is the problem. There are plenty of hard working union members and non union members just like there are decent cops. We just see the minority make everyone else look bad. With a union even people in the union don't like the slackers but they have to stand up for them. I've never been a union member (though most of my family are union construction workers) but I believe that they are responsible for a majority of improvements to our working conditions and safety.
