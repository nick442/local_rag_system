What drives me insane is when UPS leaves a package on my porch without even knocking. Every single time they come, the guy places it on my porch and leaves while I am right inside. Sometimes I won't notice it for 3 hours, while the other day I didn't find it until the next morning. It would take 3 seconds to knock!
