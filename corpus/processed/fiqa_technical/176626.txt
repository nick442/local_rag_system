I hate the USPS. The vast majority of the mail I receive is worthless, literally the only things I get that are worthwhile are magazines and things people send specifically to me. Their pricing structure for services is bizarre and confusing, and their employees are generally surly. I ship by other means whenever possible and I think it's ridiculous to ask for more support to stop the gov't from pulling resources. That said, it's also unreasonable for the gov't to forbid the USPS from closing branches. If you aren't going to give enough funding, at least let them accomodate by cutting costs.
