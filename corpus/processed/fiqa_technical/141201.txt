>You seem to have missed half the plan. My suggestion to not charge back hours is meant to work with the idea of giving each department a budget in terms of hours. And what do you do with the department that uses up its budgeted hours by say.. July or August? Do they get to simply ignore that they have gone over budget? (In which case, what use is the budget.) Ooops (guess you missed that little complication).
