>Mad Men, LOST, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones All of these are based on advertising and/or pay subscribers. The number of paying subscribers has been decreasing and advertisers are becoming much more selective about how much and where to advertise. TV networks are essentially distribution channels with some monopolistic power. But, sports teams have learned that having their own channels is more profitable (especially college football). It won't be too long until we see the Seinfeld channel, the House channel, etc.. on the internet. Content makers will want to take out the middle men or reduce middle man profits by expanding the number of channels. In 2000 there was no iTunes, Netflix streaming, nor Blu-ray. I don't know what there will be in 2020, but I wouldn't be surprised if all three of those are basically gone, replaced by innovation and market forces. Consumers want convenience, choices, and reasonable prices. The companies that only want to protect their piece of the market will fail.
