That used to be the case with pursuing a PhD, but now many US institutions prefer you stay with them after the MS and get a PhD through them as well. If you think of it like a job, during an MS the instituion is basically funding your training, and their hope is that they can benefit from the research you produce as a PhD candidate. So it is difficult to find funding for a MS alone, but if you apply as a PhD candidate from the beginning they will fund you through the entire process. There is no contractual obligation, you can leave after you receive the MS regardless.
