I had a question about this but it apparently wasn’t formed in the right way as I got no explanations and only downvotes, so let me try again. Given the massive amount of info you gave, I tried to go through and find the data I was asking for- data behind the projections of such a loss. Perhaps since I’m not a professional economist, It was not immediately apparent to me how to find the data behind the projections. Would you mind demonstrating how any of these sources provide the data behind how such projections are made? Or do you have any other advice as to how I could find an answer?
