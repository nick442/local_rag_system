From what I know it's not that simple for multitude of reasons. 1. Some don't want to make the transition because family/community reasons (e.g. My grandfather did it, my dad did it, so I gotta do it too) 2. Some people take pride in coal mining (e.g. Do hard labor and put the food on the table). 3. Lots of people in these mining/rural areas are afflicted with drug addiction (i.e. cocaine) and are basically unemployable. 4. As the article mentioned, few, if any, training programs.
