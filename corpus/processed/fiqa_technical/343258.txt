"Another great BBC article: > But he said the UK's recovery was **no longer being led by consumer spending**. . > Professor Miles added: "".. So the recovery, very welcome as it is, has been **a bit dependant on consumer spending**."" Then the rest of the article has a load of suppositions from the BoE who are consistent only in being wrong. Finishing up with: > Professor Miles said most members of the MPC believed this because the ""degree of slack"" in the economy was being used up, it was ""quite likely that as we go into next year wage settlements will be a bit higher and wages will start to rise at a rate that outstrips inflation"" Even though they were wrong on this all before. Thanks BBC!"
