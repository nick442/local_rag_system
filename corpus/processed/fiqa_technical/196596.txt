"The benefit of having gold to trade is that there is almost always someone that will take gold when the fiat currency is in trouble. The potential downfall of doing this is that when people think the fiat currency is in trouble, they tend to buy up gold, thus driving up the price. This means that you get less gold for each hour of work you perform (deer-haunch, basket of apples, etc.). Even more, if the financial crisis is limited to only one fiat currency, you have a situation where that fiat currency devalues but others can gain in value as people try to sell their old currency for the new standard currency. If people also sell their gold to buy up this currency, that lowers the price of gold in that currency. For example, let us assume that gold was 1000 dollars an ounce and 1000 euros an ounce. Suddenly, people start thinking that the euro is in trouble, so they start buying gold. The law of supply and demand kicks in (more buyers, same supply, so higher prices) and gold is suddenly worth 2000 dollars and 2000 euros an ounce. If you start buying at this point, you get half as much gold as the person who bought in the beginning. Suddenly, the euro collapses. Stores that used to take euros start demanding dollars. Suddenly, it costs 20,000 euros for an ounce of gold but an ounce of gold will only get you 1,000 dollars since everyone is selling their gold to get dollars. The people who buy gold in the ""panic"" end up losing half the value of their money if not more. The ""speculators"" that bought gold at $1,000, sold it at $2,000, and bought it back at $1,000 now have all their gold back plus the $1,000 the other people lost."
