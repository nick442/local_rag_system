Holy shit man, you must have some deep seated issues to get this bent out of shape about the way people choose to buy their mattress. FYI: most of the major online mattress companies offer something like a 100 day no questions asked return policy, which is a hell of a lot longer than the minute or so people usually spend on the in-store models. Let me name you a few reasons why this “know-nothing millennial” purchases their mattress online: * You don’t have to deal with annoying sales people * You can actually read the good and bad customer reviews about the product you are about to spend 1/3 if your life on * You don’t have to deal with annoying, uninformed, money-grabbing sales people * Consumer reports has a review for the exact model you intend to buy online versus whatever 12 in-store mattress are the flavor of the month * You can get a VERY comfortable mattress for 2/3 or 1/2 the price of an in-store mattress * Did I mention that you don’t have to deal with cost-inflating-so-they-get-a-bigger-bonus sales people?
