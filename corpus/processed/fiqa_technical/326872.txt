First, put the money someplace that is safe - a saving account is fine - while you figure out what you want to do with it. You will obviously want to think about it what to do for a while. A financial advisor could help out, but not that many of them make their money on commission and therefore don't act in your best interest. The ones where you pay them directly are more aligned with your interests. As for how to invest, you have a lot of different options depending on your timeline and your risk tolerance.
