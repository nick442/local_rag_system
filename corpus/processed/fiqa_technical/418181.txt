They don't control an entire market. They're not the only online retailer, they're not the only supplier or producer of a specific item. They do too many things to ever become a manopoly. They're just shifting markets to their side, but they will never have full control. Think of amazon as the Roman empire taking up land. The Romans had great armies they could take almost any teritory they wanted but the bigger thier territory got the more boarders they had to protect. This essentially put a limit on their expansion. Same with Amazon they will take a great deal of the market but won't take it entirely because there is no way they can be the best at everything. The more they expand the more they have to spread out their workforce, R and D cost go up, you have to hire more specialist, they become a jack of all trades mater of none. Specialization always creates the best so unless they can specialize in everything they will cretae a mediocore product that someone else will perfect. Dont get me wrong i think will dominate but they wont be a monopoly. That being said, there is the posibility they try to go political and lobby for laws that stomp out their compatition similar to ISPs. If this goes down then we may have a monopoly form in the future.
