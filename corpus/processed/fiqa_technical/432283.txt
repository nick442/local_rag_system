"First of all, the answer to your question depends on your starting dates and ending dates. So developed markets returns are higher over one period, and emerging markets returns over other periods. So far, there does not appear to be a systematic tilt in favor of one or the other. The reasons are as you said. Emerging markets tend to have higher returns in nominal terms, but developed markets currency movements (sometimes) cancel this out. So watch out for periods of strong and weak developed markets (e.g. U.S) currencies. In ""strong"" currency periods (such as those of the past five years or so), you want U.S. market exposure, and in ""weak"" currency periods, the larger nominal local returns will be fully reflected in dollar terms as well."
