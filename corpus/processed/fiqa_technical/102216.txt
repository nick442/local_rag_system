"What is even more disturbing is the loss of navigational ability. People who dont ever have to drive without the aid of a machine lose their sense of direction. Everyplace in some parts of the country just stops having any deeper, contextual meaning. ""This is where so and so lives"" or ""This is where I skinned my knee in that bike accident when I was 12."" to them its might as well be basically a procedural landscape that was generated in a video game. If people ever watched the Truman Show where every two miles everything- all the stores on the corners, they just start to repeat. In the land of stripmalls, since everything looks the same everywhere, they have no sense of where they are. People might ""go home"" and even go into the wrong house."
