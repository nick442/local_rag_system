Businesses you are already established with may do a soft pull to pre-qualify you for an offer. They store the information and if you accept, may instantly setup and account. You may also see language to the effect that they may do an inquiry (hard pull) - I guess if their data is old. When you went outside of Amazon to Chase, they did a hard pull on their side which is what you saw.
