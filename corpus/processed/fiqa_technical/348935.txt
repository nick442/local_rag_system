"Im not trying to humble brag. I fucking hate it when I see another rich kid acting like they came from slums and worked their way up the ladder or when delusional twats much like yourself believe that you can earn anything with just some ""hard work bruh."" Let me put this in perspective for you.. About every successful silicon valley startup such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Snapchat were founded by kids with very prominent parents. Also, at this point, whats the fucking difference between someone who inherits their money and someone who practically has a trust fund? Again he is not self made. He's just an extension of his parents achievements.."
