I legitimately can't tell if this post is satirical. Ethereum is a very unique technology because it allows for Turing complete computation on its crypto network. Basically allowing for much higher security for data transmission and processing on the web. The reason that the currency is valuable is that in order to encrypt this information and transmit it, you have to pay the network in ethereum. It's had the support of Accenture and is in use by the Luxembourg stock exchange. I think they might know a bit more than the unnamed author of this article who doesn't think being able to inject code into a block chain is unique.
