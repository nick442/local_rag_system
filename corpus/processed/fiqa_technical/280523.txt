">First of all, close to 25% of humans(but I think this statistic is particular to Americans) suffer from Mental Illness(whether they (or their peers) acknowledge it or not). Define ""Mental Illness"", I dare you to come up with anything solidly consistent that would apply to anything anywhere *near* 25% of the population. Psychology is, and always was a way of classifying behaviors without any real scientific basis -- generally as a form of ""social control"" (although it can also be ""social apologia/justification"") -- Cf Drapetomania, etc. The problem with that ""25% of people"" (or whatever percentage someone pulled out of their arse) -- is that it is defined by the group of people who specifically benefit from enlarging their client base. You may as well ask Realtors to define what percentage of people are ""in need of housing changes"" (upsizing, downsizing, buying, etc)."
