This article is better: http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/08/05/the-fight-over-sherlock-holmes-and-how-copyright-changes-pop-culture/ Especially the following paragraphs & points: >>The long-running “House,” whose painkiller-addicted main character owes a heavy debt to the famous sleuth and his cocaine dependency, focused on the relationship between brilliance and substance abuse. Robert Downey Jr.’s turn as Holmes in Guy Ritchie’s films gave the detective a more active relish for the London underworld, with the addition of a talent for bareknuckle boxing. And “Sherlock,” a co-production of the BBC and Boston’s WGBH public television station, explores the intimacy of friendship between men with a tenderness and emotional intelligence that is rare in popular culture. >>**All of this variation is possible because the copyright on Conan Doyle’s stories has lapsed.** We have a rather less encouraging creative example of what happens before works come out of copyright in the current superhero movie landscape: If you have ever wondered why Spider-Man movies keep arriving in theaters on a regular basis, you can look no further than copyright and licensing. Sony, rather than Marvel Studios, owns the rights to the webslinger. But to hold onto those rights, Sony has to keep using them. Otherwise, Spidey reverts back to his parent entertainment conglomerate, as was the case with Daredevil, who returned to Marvel after a stint at Twentieth Century Fox. The company cannot just wait until the public has forgotten Tobey Maguire’s stint in the red-and-blue suit and is hungry for a riff on the character from someone new.
