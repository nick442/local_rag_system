Maybe this video can explain it better. I'm sorry, I don't know how else to explain it. I'm not sure if you're getting it. This video looks pretty informative to me. Admittedly I haven't watched the whole thing. I just watch the first few minutes. Maybe a visual demo will help. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o9AU8MAoq4
