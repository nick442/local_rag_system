Probably not, but if the damage was bad enough that Target gets its lawyers in gear, they can certainly come after you for the monetary damages. However, it would probably more trouble for them than is worth it. A business like target probably writes off millions of dollars for these kinds of things per year (theft, damages, spoiled product, shipping costs, lawsuit settlements, recall, etc.)
