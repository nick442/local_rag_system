Investing in the early 70s would have been fine, trying to pile on the boat after the fact (late 70s, early 80s), those people would lose. The fluctuations then had largely to do with the collapse of the USSR. Parallels could certainly be drawn to modern times, but the main thing is that if you invested early, you could ride out the worst of storms without having to worry about a company or a currency becoming worthless overnight.
