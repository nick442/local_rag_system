"Are you saying that someone putting on Amway Demos in people's living room is making the same as grocery store owner or a real estate investor? People aren't making that much and after a while consumers don't want you to ""teach them about their shopping habits."" I mean at first you're like sure come down and do your demo but after everyone knows about your product, its not as easy. And when you don't make money on the products but on getting people to sell under you, you know its bad."
