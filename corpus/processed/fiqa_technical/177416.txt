Re-read what I wrote. > In fact, **lack of empathy is benefitial or neutral in the fields most likely to be automated**. Spelling error aside, this is saying that those jobs that are more procedural are more likely to be replaced. Empathy isn't a requirement. Not having empathy is sometimes helpful even if there is human interaction. Consider telemarketers or online support. They were replaced since there was a script or common set of tasks to do the job, and sticking to the script even if you were hearing a sob story was useful for the organization. Low-level IT jobs like the one this person is working towards with his associates degree, for example.
