Maybe this just me, but learn to talk like an adult. I know it sounds like an insult to say this, but many interns where I work speak very casually, say 'like' frequently, and end all their sentences with an upturn, like a question. I've worked many suit type jobs, and I find that young people are taken more seriously if they present themselves as adults.
