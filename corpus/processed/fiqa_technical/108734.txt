"We have a local bank that changed to a bill pay service. The money is held as ""processing"" when the check is supposed to be cut and shows as cleared on the date the check is supposed to be received. Because our business checking is with the same bank, we discovered recently that the although the check shows cleared from our account, the recipient has not received the paper check yet - and may not for 2-3 days. We discovered this because the payroll checks we write this way (to ourselves) never arrive on the due date but clear the business account. It appears to be a new way for banks to ride the ""float"" and draw interest on the money. It happens with every check processed through the bill pay system and not with electronic transfers."
