I went to lunch at one a few years ago and it ended up being around $15 with tax and tip. Lunch was mostly bread products. Stuff I could have cooked at home for under $2. Total ripoff. Also, local mom and pop restaurants have $6-$8 lunch specials. The food is ten times better and you can get out for $5 less. There's a good reason why the BWW parking lot is usually empty.
