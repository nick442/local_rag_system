> I've never understood people's willingness--often eagerness--to be unpaid advertisements for corporations..and to pay for the privilege. It mostly has to do with social class. The lower classes are insecure and do stuff like cling to logos to prove their worth. There's a reason why certain products are endlessly bragged about in rap songs and featured in the videos. People want to associate with certain brands and logos to enhance their self-worth. Go to the rough part of town - you will see more and bigger logos than anywhere else. It's nothing but status symbols in the 'hood. People who are more secure in themselves, with good educations or jobs or other accomplishments, don't need to cling to a logo or brand.
