Many services charge prices that do not scale linearly with usage. This is because the service provider has fixed costs that they must recoup by charging a rate with a fixed component. A 5-mile taxi ride is unlikely to cost half what a 10-mile taxi ride costs. Even a half sandwich at a sandwich place usually costs more than half of what a full sandwich costs. In this respect, insurance is no different from many other items you may purchase.
