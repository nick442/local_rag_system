They were manipulating the system. That's distinct from 'cheating'. Target could've shut this down and didn't - in fact, they knew it was happening (even this article admits that) and yet extended the promotion. They may have not understood what was happening but more likely they let it go, saw what happened and will modify their future strategy accordingly. The overall cost was probably not that high - they most likely got more promotion and word-of-mouth than they would've got with an equivalent advertising cost. For every person who goes to the effort of making $5000 there's going to be 5000 who don't, go for the $10 and turn out more profitable and more likely to shop at Target in the future.
