[Amazon Balance Sheet](http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Tearsheets/Financials?s=AMZX:GER&subview=BalanceSheet) [Best Buy Balance Sheet](http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Tearsheets/Financials?s=BBY:NYQ&subview=BalanceSheet) Best Buy has one billion in cash. Amazon has nine. If Best Buy does lower its retail prices, a sector that demands higher margins to compensate for larger fixed expenses, it's over. They don't have the cash to pursue that strategy if they wanted to, and it means that they've given up trying to figure out another way to differentiate themselves. It already is pretty much over. Amazon could open up pop-up stores around Christmas time with it's top 20 products by margin and volume in each category and effectively end Best Buy. But they don't really care because Best Buy isn't a competitor to them.
