Policy aimed at promoting economic opportunity for poor children must be framed within three stark realities. **First, many poor children come from families that do not give them the kind of support that middle-class children get from their families.** **Second, as a result, these children enter kindergarten far behind their more advantaged peers and, on average, never catch up and even fall further behind.** **Third, in addition to the education deficit, poor children are more likely to make bad decisions that lead them to drop out of school, become teen parents, join gangs and break the law.** **Let politicians, schoolteachers and administrators, community leaders, ministers and parents drill into children the message that in a free society, they enter adulthood with three major responsibilities: at least finish high school, get a full-time job and wait until age 21 to get married and have children.** https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should-follow-to-join-the-middle-class/
