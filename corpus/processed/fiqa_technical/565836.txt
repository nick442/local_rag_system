The more educated the person, the less likely they were to vote for Trump. Undergraduates degrees were in Clinton's favor. And any professional or post graduate education was significantly against Trump, Clinton won that demographic by over 20 points. Links below. But age and race were the main factors in voting for Trump, basically old white people. Because of the age gap, it makes sense that income would also be in that favor, as younger people are significantly poorer than their grandparents on average. However, the split is almost 50/50 in every income gap over 100k, so while accounting for the age difference and the education gap, logic tells us that the richer younger people were in Clinton's favor, not just poor people. There are a lot of inferences you can make here, but it was essentially white elderly people and young white uneducated people that were the biggest predictor of one side, and young educated people on the other. With all minority groups also on that same side.
