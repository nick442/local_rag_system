I'm on an M&A team for IT and you should temper your expectations. The due diligence teams (those guys that get a first look) usually don't know enough shit to understand the ramifications for their initial decisions and it just gets worse. The incentive is to underfund the M&A nearly every single time. Projects run long, some shit in IT never completes and dies on the vine after ten years. Management on the A side stops giving a shit, their good employees with the actual knowledge leave almost immediately.. Documentation? None. Process adoption? None. Worthwhile employees? Already gone. M&As should just be renamed Murphys because they are all just real life examples of Murphy's law. How many M&As have I seen? 18. Across multiple fortune 100s. How many were completed by the time the investors were told they would be done? 18. How many were actually done at that point? 2-3? It is literally herding cats. M&As are a necessary evil for markets but they are almost always absolute shit.
