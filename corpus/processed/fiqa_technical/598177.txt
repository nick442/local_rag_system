sorry I disagree, they buy government bonds currently held by private banks (who hold them for account holders), this increased demand for government bonds means that the yield on them decreases, this means the government can then borrow at a lower rate (providing the QE isn't offset by a fall in private demand for bonds as they may be seen as unrewarding in terms of the risk taken), private investors will then turn to other investments offering a greater return, this will then increase the capital stock available and expand output, thus increasing employment
