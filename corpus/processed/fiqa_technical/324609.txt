I didn't mean that money would just be given away. There are so many projects cities need that aren't done because of a lack of funding like public transportation or street maintenance. At least that's been the case in the cities I've lived in, I'm not sure if it's the same for yours. Alternatively they can set up incentives to make it easier to start businesses too.
