> I hope it makes you insanely angry that I [eat Ferrari's for breakfast]. So what? I am a hard core capitalist. I just don't attach the same kind of myopic radicalized ideology to it that seems to be the exclusive standard used today, and I don't condone corruption with peons or elites. So unless your homes were the result of murdering some grannies, or some such shit, what the hell is your point? As for the occupy protesters.. well.. that was just a clusterfuck. So why not respond to the substance, rather than pretend you can pigeonhole my character and politics? Could it be because your objections lack any substance and you know it? Because for all intent and purposes that is what you just admitted to.
