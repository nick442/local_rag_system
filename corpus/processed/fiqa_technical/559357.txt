After reading your back and forth with geerussell, its interesting seeing you bring up WWII, where the concern was full output and employment, just as he is suggesting. If the government wants to, it can take a country mired in depression, with women mostly out of the work force and men unemployed in great numbers, and have near full employment and the addition of women in the work force in a few short years. *And they were shipping a lot of their best laborers and much of their output overseas to be simply destroyed.*
