Oh man. There was a nice place that kept the bar open late. Out of college we'd go there later in the evening (after ten) now and then. The bar tenders actually learned who we were (they weren't a busy place that late) and would rarely charge us for more than a few drinks. We'd order small plates and stuff too. I'd try to tip at least based on what stuff SHOULD have cost so the tip was almost always bigger than the bill. Loved that place.
