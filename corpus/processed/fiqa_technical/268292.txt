Today I'd be fucking pissed. Unless the place was on fire I'd be making a scene and scowling everyone they seated ahead of us. I'd also not be caught dead in a shitty wannabe nice Italian place in Boston's north end. May as well go to Olive garden. It was this place: https://m.yelp.com/biz/dolce-vita-ristorante-boston-2 but about fifteen years ago.
