"My dad uses CenturyLink for internet (DSL, only option available in the ""sticks"") and uses another company for television. I pointed out that he is paying CenturyLink over $75 a month for DSL, when it should be $12.99. I mentioned they are charging for the entire package. He insisted he never ordered any of it, but I just chalked it up to a mistake and got it sorted out by calling them. Maybe he really never ordered it .. Ugh."
