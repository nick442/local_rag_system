Shipping by boat actually takes at least 3 weeks to a month. Add time before that for the supplier to book and pack the container. Add time after until you can get an appointment at the port to pick up your container. It is not a quick process. Also I find it hard to believe they are actually renting whole 747s. I think it's much more likely they are booking **space** on a cargo plane. Otherwise it would be a huge amount of video cards. Maybe they are, but I'm not going to just take someone's word for it. Not that it really matters.
