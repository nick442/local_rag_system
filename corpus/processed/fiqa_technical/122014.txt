">Me: ""they pay it as regular income rather than LTCG"" >You: ""There's no LTCG tax on Roth accounts."" Those two things aren't the same thing. Among other problems, you were referring to tax-deferred accounts and I was referring to Roths. >Me: ""they pay it as regular income rather than LTCG"" >You: ""You're only taxed once on the money"" Again, those are not the same thing. There is no account out there where you would only pay LTCG tax. So paying the tax as regular income RATHER than LTCG tax is not a concern. >Me: ""they pay it as regular income rather than LTCG"" >You: ""The main advantage of 401ks is that you don't ever pay capital gains tax."" Again, the word ""rather"" means there were two possible scenarios: paying regular income tax and paying LTCG tax. This simply isn't true. >I never mentioned Roth or taxable funds Well, those are the only alternatives to a tax-deferred account, so.. >""Though what I said does also apply to Roth"" No it doesn't. >""But please, keep digging.."" Nothing to dig for. This isn't a difficult concept but for whatever reason you clearly don't understand it."
