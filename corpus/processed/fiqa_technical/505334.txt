First off how do you know if they are indeed a scammer? What can they really do with that? Well it depends on the scammer's skill and sophistication. Ideally with your name and address, they would probably send you mail that attempts to scam you. For example, they might send you a check but will require you to do something in order to receive that money. If this scammer is very sophisticated they can get your life's story with that information alone.
