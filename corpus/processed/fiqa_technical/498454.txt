"Why is ""going forward"" any different than ""from now on""? They both mean ""we are at a point, and now we are going to move from that point"" They're just plain synonyms. ""Touch base"" means more than ""contact"" - it suggests a short status report. If someone says ""we will only touch base via email"" they're kinda using it wrong. It's usually something like ""Hey, touch base with me tomorrow morning"" which means ""contact me and let me know how everything is going"" except it's shorter. ""We need to take it offline"" is simply a modern form of ""sidebar."" It's similar to ""table the discussion for later"" but not quite. Incidentally, ""take it offline"" also means ""let's stop wasting everyone's time with this and get back to finishing the meeting"" - you'd think folks would be grateful for that one. ""Please reach out"" suggests asking for help. tl;dr^* : ""Contact,"" ""touch base,"" and ""reach out,"" each have subtly different meanings. If you think they're synonyms, either the people around you don't use them right, or you're not paying attention. ^* tl;dr is a reddit buzzword. But I guess those are okay."
