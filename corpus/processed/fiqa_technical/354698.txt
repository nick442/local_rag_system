http://priceofoil.org/2014/07/09/cashing-in-on-all-of-the-above-u-s-fossil-fuel-production-subsidies-under-obama/ So here I see 21.6 billion dollars on fossil fuels, and it's also a report on 2016. I feel like the commenter below you had a large point when they said that this leaves too much out. And btw, defending our oil interests overseas is indescribably more expensive than a recyling policy (which also comes with environmental benefits). The fact that you think they are comparable is laughable
