>I'm talking about the manufacturers profits and employees. You only talked about manufactures not employees. Tho what employees have anything to do here is beyond me. > Costco tends to use their consumers and distribution access to their advantage and often at the expense of manufacturers. As they should. But as I said, they are not Walmart. Costco isn't going to push a supplier to make their product as cheap as possible because they know their customers don't want Walmart quality stuff. This means they aren't going to push the supplier as nearly as badly as Walmart will. >A large producer like my employer have and will tell costco to go fuck themselves. They do that and they lose any possible profits from Costco.
