Minimum wage goes up --> some workers are eliminated/reduced --> new hiring slows --> wait --> disposable income increases among those still employed --> demand increases --> employment goes up. How is this confusing? If anything still needs to be considered, it's what percentage increase of the minimum wage will most efficiently counteract the corresponding percentage drop in income from related lost wages.
