"Right. The definition of ""made with 100% chicken"" changes depending on whether that particular company sources soy protein and chicken separately and mixes them, vs purchasing it already mixed. The consumer doesn't care if this particular company is putting the chicken and the soy together, all they care about is what's in the package. That's what I mean by the fact that at some level everything with chicken is made with 100% chicken. Legally they can't say that it's made with 100% chicken unless one of the items they purchase from a supplier is just chicken, but morally, biologically, nutritionally and logically it is the same whether they put the chicken into their mixing pot or an upstream supplier does. Lets take a concrete example. This [breakfast sandwich](https://www.jimmydean.com/products/sandwiches/delights/delights-applewood-smoke-chicken-sausage-egg-whites-and-cheese-muffin-sandwiches) is ""made with 100% chicken."" Obviously the entire food product is not chicken, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone walking down the aisle and picking it up thought, subconsciously, that the patty on it was 100% chicken. Is it actually? No. It is >98% chicken and water, and <2% other stuff. But what we are actually supposed to infer from that language is that the company who makes this sandwich purchases ""100%"" chicken, whatever that is, and mixes it with the rest of the ingredients to made something which is mostly chicken. In legal land, that is all that can be inferred from the statement. It's not exactly deceptive, but it's definitely not the clearest terminology that could be employed, and it definitely implies something that simply ""made with chicken"" does not imply. I agree with you that the package almost always has all the information I would reasonably want on it, though, and in many cases it is obvious. That same sandwich lists all of the ingredients of the patty on the back, so the information is right there if you want to go to the small text."
