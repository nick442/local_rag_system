There's a serious mistake in your analysis: granted, in the traditional IRA, you avoid paying taxes on the $5000 now, but you're now stuck paying taxes on $2.2 million dollars when you withdraw it later. Obviously, you'll end up paying massively more than $1250 in taxes on this in the end. As other people have pointed out, if you can afford to cut the $1250 elsewhere in your budget, you could still end up with the $2.2M. However, let's say just for argument that you don't; the question then becomes if you're better off taking the tax hit on the $5,000 now or the $2.2 million later. It also really matters how much money you'll be withdrawing when you retire as well as how you'll be doing the withdraws. Personally, my goal is to be able to withdraw as much per year as my highest salary while working, so clearly the Roth IRA is a good deal for me. An important consideration here is that most people believe that their expenses will go down when they retire, but the majority of retirees in some surveys have indicated that their expenses either stayed approximately the same or actually increased. Also, quick reality check: would the fact that you know you'd be saving $1250 on your taxes by contributing to the IRA actually cause you to contribute an extra $1250 to your retirement? Even if you personally would, I highly doubt that most people, with the exception of people who post on this site :), actually think that way (especially given how little most people actually save for retirement).
