"Someone's (or, a bank's) ""exposure to equities"" refers to the amount of value which has a risk that fluctuates with the equities market (ie: the stock market). In very broad terms, I think it might make sense to say that exposure to equities could mean, for example, owning many rental properties, if the rental market was ""highly correlated"" with the equities market. That is - if house prices go down when the equities market goes down, and if that relationship is very strong, then owning a house means you are exposed to the equities market. However, in the sense it is used there, it seems to mean direct exposure to equities - ie: owning stocks and stock-based funds."
