Much of the absurdity of that amount comes from them adding up all of the time parents spend with their kids, and assuming that the value of that time is the same as if the parents were working during all those hours. As if, if they weren't parents, they would be spending 120 a week at their job. It's a nonsense way to evaluate cost for this situation. Opportunity cost makes sense in business decisions, not in parenting.
