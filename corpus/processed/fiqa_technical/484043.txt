One important thing though, while the experience is generally 90% the same to the rider, drivers may have vastly different experiences with the two companies. As long as there are fares to pick up drivers will probably still drive for a service, but that is another, secondary demographic of users that ride sharing companies need to consider/support/keep happy. And that side of things can have a *hugely* varying user experiences based on how the companies operate.
