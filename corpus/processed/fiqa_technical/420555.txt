Absolutely agree. The more I read on this, the angrier I get. The sale of the shares, the delay in disclosure, the unbelievable abandonment of responsibility from a company that holds the keys to the castle for hundreds of millions of people. It stinks of bullshit. They need to feel the full weight of the law.
