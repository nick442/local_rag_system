Tax rates do make a difference between whether to invest here or in Ireland. The rate of return would be lower in a place where you pay higher taxes, as taxes are a cost. The investment is going to happen, sure, it just depends on where that occurs. And then secondly, the money that American businesses profit overseas stays overseas instead of being repatriated because the taxes are too high to justify paying them before reinvesting the money in the economy. This is a problem because it means jobs for everyday Americans going to another country, where due to Balassa-Samuelson, the other country is already more attractive in terms of labor costs due to our high price levels here in the US.
