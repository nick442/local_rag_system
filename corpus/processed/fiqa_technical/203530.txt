Just Tesla's products today solve it for many households. Solar Roof + Powerwall could run most single-family houses in the US no problem. Basically you just pre-pay your power bills for 20 years and you're all set. The harder problem is electricity for high-density housing and industry. Solar farms solve some of that, but other power sources are a good idea too.
