"I try to think of it as ""present money"" and ""future money."" Right now there's still plenty of present money(present wealth): crops are growing, there's plenty of rubber steel glass and such being processed, people still need toothpaste, etc. Stocks go way up when there's expectations in the marketplace for **future** earnings and production (profit). Debt is issued (read:money is created) when banks and lenders think production and profits will increase in the future. That future profit is what pays for the debt being issued (money being created) in the present. They essentially borrow from the future to create money today, in exchange for a chunk of the future profits. Right now there's so much doom and gloom that everybody thinks future production and future profits will just not be there, so nobody lends, nobody invests, and no money is created, and thus ""money"" just kinda disappears. At least that's how I think about it. Present wealth vs expectations of future wealth. I'm probably wrong though; this stuff gives me a headache."
