lol it's a dying job my man. But if you think about it, an algo is basically a formalized array of someone's personal judgement and trading patters connected to direct market access. I was just lucky to fill a junior role in a shop run by guys who have seen 30 year bonds they invested reach maturity. But yeah, theyre not gonna hire a freshie who doesn't know basic market mechanics, asset valuations, etc. It's just harder now to get gigs like this because the industry has shrunk so much and the role of a trader has shifted much faster to automation than many expected.
