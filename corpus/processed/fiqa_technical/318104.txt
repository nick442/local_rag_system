"No, it literally doesn't mean that. ""GMO"" is defined as being more specific. It's an imperfect acronym. That happens. And no, I don't believe that there's any distinct issue with GMOs. I work in Organics, and I've lived in Berkeley. I've tried and tried to find a single legitimate reason to even be wary of GMOs, and it just isn't there. It's a technique (or a group of techniques). That's it."
