"When lending through Kiva you are not making a ""charitable contribution"" it's a loan so you cannot deduct the amount you loaned out. If you do lose money from your loan you can write off your entire loss same as you would with any other investment. However you should be careful because in the event of a tax audit you need to have the proper documentation in order to prove that loss (I don't know what Kiva provides). So to answer your question, no you would not be liable for any taxes from a Kiva loan."
