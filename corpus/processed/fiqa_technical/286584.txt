"Dunno if you saw the recent NYT article [Trump and the True Meaning of Idiot](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/opinion/trump-and-the-true-meaning-of-idiot.html). It's amazingly not about boring insults but rather a interesting look at the etymology of the word ""idiot"", which echoes some of the themes you just mentioned. It's a topic similar to one I've explored myself in my own writings as [Tax Policy and the Dewey Decimal System](http://netsettlement.blogspot.com/2009/02/tax-policy-and-dewey-decimal-system.html). I think integrating personal goals into societal goals is something we don't all see the same, and push comes to shove on that ""rugged individualist"" thing."
