There's a massive commitment involved, and lots of barriers to entry, sports is just about the perfect metaphor. You have to be pretty smart and you have to commit yourself to acquiring a set of skills that will be mostly useless if you fail to land a programming job. That and the fact that the market changes so quickly that skills you had five years ago may no longer be relevant, while skills that have been out of fashion for 20 years might suddenly be the most necessary. The work is anything but glamorous, tedious, and incredibly difficult to do well. And the skillset that you'd enter college with you could parlay into much more lucrative positions. Microsoft is competing with Bank of America for it's talent, not General Electric, and their salaries should be commensurate with the going rate for that kind of talent. If they don't want to pay, they should offshore, but good luck with that. Microsoft of course knows all this. Which is why they're trying to get away with paying 10k per H1B visa when they know that acquiring the talent that they want stateside would cost them 30x as much.
