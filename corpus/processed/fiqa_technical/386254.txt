"The problem there is that the argument immediately turns to ""why should Podunk Town have the same minimum wage as Major City"", even though the whole idea behind tailoring MW to local economies is that places that can't support the minimum wage of an economic engine don't have to. That's the challenge we are facing in my state and why our legislature won't let areas with higher costs of living raise the minimum wage. Which ends up hilariously bad because the urban poor become even more reliant on public assistance which in turn costs the state more money."
