They weren't a leader at the time. Their office product was poor. It was at best third best. Wordperfect was the defacto choice. Lotus was also popular and very robust. They had no networking until Windows 3.11 so Netware was the defacto network operating system until Windows NT4 started to edge in. They were at best 50% saturated for DOS as DR-DOS was more robust. Microsoft copied all the functionality of DR-DOS into their MS-DOS platform but they were always behind. That's when Windows 3.0 became popular. And those offices that ran Wordperfect, they kept it until Windows 2000.
