">> Because if you are against Trump, you must(!) be for Hillary or the DNC or both. > Nope and I think this attitude is the core problem with American politics. I agree with you that, mostly due to fake-news and terrible ""journalism"", tribalism is the new way for American politics and people: either you against Trump, or not. So, are you against Trump? Yes or no? It seems you are against Trump, on every front, and that would be Ok if you could show examples of actions by Trump that are not good, or, actions you don't agree with. >> Medicare Part-D So, even according to you, Trump wants to reduce drug prices but now, according to VOX (known fake-news anti-Trump ""news"" site) ""he oppose free-market principles"" to reduce drug prices. Well, the amendment by Collins and McCaskill was passed last month and is sitting Trump's desk to be signed soon. Honestly, I am not clear exactly how it works, but it's McCaskill is a democrat. So, I have no clue what VOX is talking about, and it seems that after many years of no action (Obama and Bush), Trump may do something about this."
