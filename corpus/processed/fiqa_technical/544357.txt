> The attempt at nation building was a military venture. No, it really wasn't. That was a U.S. government venture with a significant portion of it run out of the State Department and USAID. USAID alone had some 50k+ contractors (i.e. about 1/3 of all contractors in Iraq) working for it at one point. Due to the fucking retarded nature of funding, I would not be surprised at all to find out that those contractors were counted as DoD despite having nothing to do with the DoD. >Quibbling over how many carry guns versus wash dishes isn't the point, really. It is relevant, and here is why. A lot of the base services provided by those contracted personnel either were not truly required (and in the absence of cheap contracted labor, would not have been done at all - like having other people to do your laundry for you, or to scrub down the bench at the gym whenever you walked away from it) or would have required a lot less people if done by Americans (skilled labor specifically). Those numbers are artificially inflated by labor that was non-essential and by inefficient labor. So while it certainly represents outsourcing, I don't think that the raw body count is a fair representation. It takes a dozen Kenyan guards to do what 2 soldiers would normally do at a checkpoint.
