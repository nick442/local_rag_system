Appear smart. Seriously. Don't talk about finance or ibanking because you don't know anything he doesn't and the odds of you sounding simplistic or stupid are high. Look like a go getter and someone he would want to work with. There are going to be 1000's of kids with resumes that are the same or better than yours, a resume is what gets you in the door (probably got this meeting) but being someone people want to work with gets you the job. TL: DR - Don't be a douche
