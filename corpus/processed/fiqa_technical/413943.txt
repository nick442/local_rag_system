I think the reputation Silicon Valley has will help it maintain it's position. The sheer number of talented individuals already there draws people from around the world; sending money overseas is unnecessary. I honestly don't believe that other countries have pockets of un-tapped talent, because anyone smart enough to have great ideas will go to Silicon Valley. Only an opinion.
