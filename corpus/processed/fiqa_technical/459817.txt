At some point, if you can affect the human condition and affect culture for the better. You do it profita be damned. Capitalism is not helping global warming or social issues faster than it is hurting in a completely open market IMO. It just takes one company to pull the plug and say, this isn't right. If others begin to do these thinks secretly (like if Google returns biased search results for certain hit button topics) then there is a transparency question. We are so reliant on information sources we are limited in ability to cross reference and research other ways.. But to not act against the bad because of fear of potential more bad.. I dunno
