>You assume that the government is a god and all things exist only because of it. You are the zealot here fighting against a competing option and opinion. Every church wants to believe it is the one true church and non believers should be punished for their non belief. Statism truly has become the next wave religion. No, I assume that government is an institution that keeps getting recreated for any society larger than a hunter-gatherer tribe because of how useful it is. If anyone is approaching cultbait status, it would be anti-government believers, who blindly believe that all the benefits of a first-world society somehow magically have nothing to do with the forms of the government selected by that society.
