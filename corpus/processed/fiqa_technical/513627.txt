"I was there for unrelated-to-Walmart work this time last year. The entire region's commerce seems *very* predicated upon Walmart's success. Imagine if Walmart fell how much of that local economy would vanish. Tyson and JB Hunt can only do so much without the retail giant throwing reams of money their way. The University can only support so much. I hate to imagine what they region looks like in 40-50 years if Walmart's well dries up. --- ""Oh, you're moving to NW Arkansas? Big business there. Beautiful drive up from Fort Smith too. What takes you there?"" *""Walmart!""* ..why else move there? It's all hinging on Walmart's continued success. I can't imagine the land value holding if Walmart contracts. *Maybe* you could sell some football-weekend houses to well-off Razorback fans if you're in Rogers or south, but there's been a lot of growth there without many more independent industries in case of collapse."
