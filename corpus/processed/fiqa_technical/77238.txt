"Gimli's Corollary: ""People who aren't successful *love* to hear success explained away as luck"" What a waste of time. Yes, luck *is a factor* in success. And yes, there are people who are where they are solely because of luck. But I'm tired of seeing the hard work, determination, insight, and brilliance that a lot of great people put in to get where they are dismissed as ""oh they were just lucky."""
