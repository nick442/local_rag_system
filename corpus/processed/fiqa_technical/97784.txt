">Everyone wants a solution, so I will provide one. The US government should simply cancel the $230 trillion in derivative bets, declaring them null and void. I proposed this ages ago. I don't really see how they can be anything else BUT ""null & void"" -- I cannot fathom any court actually being capable of enforcement of these ""side bets"" -- and there are plenty of legal provisions (statutory and case law as well as common law principles) that could/would likely cause them to be unenforceable (not to mention bankruptcy proceedings and the fact that ""gambling"" has long been considered a prohibited/controlled if not criminal activity, and with only specific provisional exceptions being enforceable). They are really just self-delusional fictions piled upon fictions -- like children playing and saying ""I'll bet you a bazillion dollars"" and then paying it off with ""kited check IOU's"" -- utter nonsense (and some day it WILL end)."
