Prescribed, sure. I usually don't have a problem with people taking prescribed drugs (except the tragic overuse of antibiotics that in the end is going to kill us all, but that's another issue completely), but I do have a problem with people self-medicating because they've read somewhere that it's good for you. I recently watched a German documentary about Aspirin, where medical professionals talked about the wide-spread (not prescribed) use of Aspirin and how people don't think about the consequences of using Aspirin, because it's so commonplace that they don't even see it as medication anymore. Especially in surgeries, this is a problem due to the reduced clotting factor.
