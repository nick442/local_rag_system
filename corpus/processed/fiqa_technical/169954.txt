"Insofar as a 52 week high indicates a peak, yes. However, the truth is that ""buying low and selling high"" means ""Act a Fool!"" You see, when you buy low, you are perceived to be buying total garbage - throwing your money away and conversely when selling high you are perceived to be a total idiot - selling a winner. That's how people will see you when you are in fact buying low and/or selling high, right? It's those people that (mis)value the asset, right? An asset is worth what the people will pay for it, right? ..And don't forget that holding a loser is MUCH easier than holding a winner. Good luck!"
