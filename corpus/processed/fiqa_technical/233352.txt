"> Just like they do not understand mortality – their brains are literally chemically imbalanced in this way – young people do not understand why it's a good idea to be private. They are solipsistic. I loled. As if a correctly chemically balanced brain can see an ""obvious"" morality. Just goes to show the author must be really stupid. Maybe this comes from the fact that a certain lobe (I'm not sure of this word for word), the frontal one, goes through some weird development which impairs decision ability. Decision ability does not equal morality."
