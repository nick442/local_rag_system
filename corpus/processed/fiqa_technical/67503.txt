Not a financial adviser, but I think there is some amount of debt that's ok. So I wouldn't suggest someone should go $200k into debt for a BA in English, but if you went somewhat into debt, say $30k, for a major with good job prospects and a high salary, it will probably be a good decision. Which is exactly what I did, and it worked out very well for me. I would advise students to apply to lots of schools with different entry requirements and tuition rates, just to see what their financial aid packages are like. Very often if a $50k a year school really wants you, they'll give you some scholarships to make it more affordable. If they don't give you enough, then you may just need to go to a cheaper school. edit: also, if your family isn't wealthy (like mine) you'll often qualify for federal loans. My loans from 2012 are at 3.5% interest, and my financial adviser is telling me to make the minimum payments so I can put more money in stocks.
