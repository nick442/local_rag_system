Too much infrastructure (brand new waterfront promenade and A LOT of new homes). Apparently Stockton is the second hardest hit city in the USA from the 2007 housing crisis. Lots of foreclosures. They were betting that people would move out to Stockton from the Bay Area for housing price relief. Obviously they bet wrong.
