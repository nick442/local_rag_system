This is kind of true, but really if a company needs someone they will find a way to hire. Most time they just let open positions float. My boss has been interviewing people every day for a month but hasn't found the 'right person' yet. Now i see why companies 'outsource' their recruiting to head hunters. I prefer to just post my info and let recruiters call me.
