Ha I'll probably be down voted with this too but, I guess we have a bunch of selfish capitalists in here. Yes, in our current system that situation is luck. No doubt you and your father worked hard to get you where you are today, but there are others working just as hard that wont be as lucky. Your father had a fairly stable career, being an officer. What if you were born to a single mother? Maybe a family that was split apart when the father's job was outsourced? Maybe you were born into a bad neighborhood with crappy schools? How would your current plan have turned out? Yeah, investing isn't like a casino, but there is risk involved. I know about index funds, but as you know a lot of the market has to do with timing. Tell the poor guy who was 65 in 2008 and wanted to retired how that whole index fund investment worked out. Society create a situation for you where you could succeed. We, the tax payers, paid for your fathers career. Your schooling was partially made possible by the government. The government also supports the legal system so you can invest your capital in the first place, and the infrastructure for those companies to succeed. If you want to retire at 35 that's great, however if you are advocated for less taxes in order to do that you are robbing others of a chance to realize their own dreams.
