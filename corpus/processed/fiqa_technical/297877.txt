Real estate. The value of the house where I live going up 15% per year! From 2004-2009. Sold for $92k in 1980 now valued at $524k. Twice the rate of inflation in that timeframe. None of it makes sense nor is it sustainable = asset bubble. In my zip code the median income is $162k and median house value $808k (Source: US Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2012). That averages out 5x annual income. In LA and Las Vegas that ratio is even worse, where most of these HELs and HELOCs are going to blow up. This article is accurate. People use these loans to replace their stagnating or falling wages. And its a lot of people.
