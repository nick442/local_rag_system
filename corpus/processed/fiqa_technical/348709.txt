They could be one step above fast food with just few servers. Red robin had these kiosks on tables but they messed it up by just using it as a pay kiosk and ad center. Allow me to order full menu from there, bring my food and leave me alone until I call someone in the rare case something goes wrong. They save on employee cost, I get service in a sit down restaurant so both sides should be happy.
