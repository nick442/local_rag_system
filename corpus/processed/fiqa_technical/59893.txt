"Yep. So many of these articles could be changed to: ""$Company or $Industry That Has Coasted On Shit Product and Shit Service Surprised By Customer Reaction When Something Better Is Available"". We recently had a contractor offer us a restaurant gift card as a mea culpa for taking longer on a job than originally quoted, which turned out to be for Applebee's. Just doing takeout was an awful experience: the service was shit, the food was shit, the restaurant and floors were dirty, everyone felt ill after eating poorly cooked sodium muck.. It's hilarious/sad to see these executives flailing around searching for the magic answer as to why their business model is cratering and the best they can come up with is ""damn millennials"". I'm willing to bet, by and large, people don't not eat at these places for some kind of hipster cred, but because they want decent food and decent service for the price. Unfortunately, no one with that viewpoint is being listened to in board meetings it seems."
