I think this piece would be great with some direction and editing. The idea of JOINING a start up can be considered a long con. You are not working for yourself nor a cause you created or developed. The pay is very low, the hours are long and the promise of equity might either never be there (Remember Zynga taking back equity?), be poorly constructed (Pay-in options are just like equity right? Right guys?) or worse, might be worthless through no fault of your own. Where will you be if either happens? The idea that you stuck around with a company for 3-6 years in order to maximize your equity value is not only limiting, it can be career damaging. 20 year olds should be trying different careers and gaining a sea of experience. Go out and build up that all important network isn't going to happen in one place.
