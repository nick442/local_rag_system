Here's a reality check. They likely cost on the order of a few million/yr, which is small potatoes compared to what Taibbi makes it sound like. They got caught, and are going to jail. Since Taibbi exggerates at every turn, and demonstrably so, I do not trust his reporting. The bid riggers were charged with corrupting *dozens* of bids from 1999 to 2006. Know how many bids were performed in that time? I challenge you to find out. I bet there was more than dozens issued over that 7 year period. In fact, since there appear to be 400B in new bonds issues a year and the one mentioned in the story was for 300M, if that is representative of the sizes then there are over 1,000 issued a year, for 7000 or so over that period. They corrupted *dozens*! Oh the humanity. Feel free to correct any of these numbers as you see fit. Reading the actual PDF from the charges, one finds that the fraud was no where near as egregious as the Taibbi story makes it out to be. [Here](http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f261600/261602.htm) is the indictment, and [here is the DOJ](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/May/12-at-620.html) press release. [Here's](http://www.bondbuyer.com/issues/121_88/cdr-financial-bid-rigging-trial-1039416-1.html) article reporting on the trial with no where near the sensationalism that Taibbi lives for, an article that actually reports *facts* from the case and makes no innunendo. [Here's](http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2012/three-former-financial-services-executives-convicted-for-roles-in-conspiracies-involving-investment-contracts-for-the-proceeds-of-municipal-bonds) FBI press release. Not a single one of these sources that actually had something to do with the investigation, trial, and conviction includes anything near what Taibbi writes. In fact, other than Taibbi's story and those reporting on it, it appears this is not all the big banks in cahoots to defraud poor bond markets, but a few bad apples that got caught and are getting appropriate punishment. Let me ask you - how much money did they take? The *total* market appears to be 400B in new sales. Some of the charges included something like changing a 5.04% instrument to a 5% instrument, for an item in a 300 million dollar range. If they reaped the entire difference (which is not likely since there were bid rigging which returns far less the the difference in the rigged bid) that comes to 120K/yr for one of dozens. Taibbi himself writes they may have made up to 87K/yr on that one. Wooo - massive theft!. If all were like that, then dozens is approximately 48 * 87k/yr = 4 million a year. The biggest number for stolen money in any of the actual court documents I have seen ranges in the 50-100K range. Please provide better evidence *from actual court documents* and not Taibbi style hearsay. Until then I provided you a reality check.
