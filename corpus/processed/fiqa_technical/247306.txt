If it is a credit card bill, the money goes towards your balance because on all of my cards, the interest for the month will show up as a line item that increases the balance. So all your payment goes towards the balance. This is good because your interest is probably calculated daily, and any amount you can lower your balance will therefore lower the interest you have to pay. Additionally, in the US the CARD act means that you payment must be applied to items with the highest interest rates first. http://www.helpwithmybank.gov/faqs/credit_late_payment.html#drop11 http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/law-bans-credit-card-payment-allocation-trickery-1282.php
