> 1. What exactly happens when I deposit $1000 to the bank? Does it lend to other parties $900 of what I have given them? Yep. > Or it turns my whole deposit into their reserve, then borrows $9000 from the central bank, and lends this sum to their customers? No, the bank can't loan more money than it has in deposits. Note that this does create money because, in this example, the bank loaned someone $900 but it still owes you $1000. > 2. What happens when I'll make final payment on my loan? Is this a different example or are we assuming your original $1000 was loaned to you? Regardless, every time you make a payment on a loan the bank can re-loan that money to someone else. > Does the bank also pay its base to the central bank (+ base interest rate) and keeps only their interests? The central bank has not been involved in this transaction so it doesn't receive anything. > Does the central bank remove from the circulation money it received back? Yes but I think you're switching topics. A central bank's transactions are more about managing the money supply and inflation of a [fiat currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money#Money_creation_and_regulation). Ideally a central bank trades a bank's paper assets for reserves adding or subtracting to the bank's ability to issue loans.
