Reading about the [Bring Jobs Home Act](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/239029-republicans-blocked-the-democrats-insourcing-bill) it talks about how the (filibustered in July) bill would end the ability of companies to take a tax deduction for the costs of off-shoring labor(moving people and equipment overseas). The blog/newspaper articles don't really say much more than that.
