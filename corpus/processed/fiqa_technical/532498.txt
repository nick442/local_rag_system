I don't hate Apple. I own an iPhone and I'm looking to buy a Mac Mini because they are great products. I do hate Maps though, because it was poorly designed and executed. Firing the guy responsible is a knee-jerk reaction to poor product design. Upper management should have demanded that Maps should be as good if not better than what was in place (Google Maps) before release. It seemed like the development of Maps was rushed and not well-thought-out, and now iPhone owners are paying the price for that. Apple still had a year left with their contract with Google - maybe they could have used that year for testing and design modifications before releasing Maps with iOS 6.
