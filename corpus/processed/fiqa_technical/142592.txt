"I think this gets at why some of us are becoming concerned about the volume (or more importantly the portion) of HFT in capital markets these days. You have algos trading based on ""technical trends"" which are increasingly just the behavior of other algos. Rinse and repeat. At a certain point it just becomes a feedback loop. Now, I agree that there's no reason to be scared of HFT simply because its new or fast, which is what I think threatens a lot of people. But the problem is that the economic and social utility of markets arises from their being information aggregation engines. If it gets to the point where most of the price action is driven by algos which are trading solely based on a few minutes of technical data, no new information is being contributed to the price discovery process. Now, it may be that a certain amount of ""meta-information"" can be discovered from pattern analysis of short term technical history. But it seems to me this information is more limited in both quality and quantity compared to the information inputs of thoughtful humans acting on a reasoned analysis of economic and other world events."
