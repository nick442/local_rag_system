The point I'm making is decidedly apolitical: Barney Frank (liberal Democrat) was on the same side of the legislation that Hank Paulson (Republican Treasury Secretary). It's a functional issue/problem of how to keep a banking system from collapsing and support it in the most cost effective manner possible, given the constraints and economy that was spiraling into the abyss. It really has very little to do with politics and is a basic issue of systemic confidence. The bond market and financial actors are signaling that no one has any confidence that Bank of America will be around in 48 hrs, that they will implode like Lehman Brothers. How does the US Government react to that in the most appropriate manner?
