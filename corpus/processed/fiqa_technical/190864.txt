The issue with your claim is that slavery is completely involuntary, whereas I can't think of many cases in which one inherits debt, or could come into it in any other way than signing up for it. When a consumer takes on debt, he/she is consciously making a decision to owe somebody money. The fact that they'll likely have to work (unless they win the lottery) to pay that money back is not slavery; it's following through on a commitment. If everyone was born with $100,000 (an arbitrary amount; it could be just $1), then I think you would have a better argument, albeit still flawed.
