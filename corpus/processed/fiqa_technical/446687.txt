The interest payments received in an account depend both upon on how interest is accrued, as well as how it is paid. The annual interest statement indicates how often interest is paid. It does not, however, indicate how that interest is calculated or accrued. Commonly in this type of account in Canada, the interest is calculated monthly based on the lowest balance you had for that month. If you need specifics, you should check with your financial institution, or check the fine print of the account in question. Good Luck
