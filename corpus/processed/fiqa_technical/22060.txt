I like the Australian “standard”* Best Before: For the retailer: Means the retailer should not complain to the supplier if the product has gone bad after this date. Used by: For the consumer; means the customer should not complain to the retailer if the product has gone bad after this date. Ie it has nothing to do with is it safe to consume it has everything to do with legal liability with a touch of forced replacement. * I don’t know if it’s a standard or just something that producers do.
