Just the opposite, if you can, offer all prices! Make a premium product, and regular one, a lite version, and so on. Capture all price points. The premium version's price gives you anchoring so your less expensive product will appear cheap even if it isn't. This also gives users an upgrade path so the way to full price is baby steps.
