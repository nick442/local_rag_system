Asset prices across the board are at historic highs because interest rates have been too low for too long. Owners/sellers of assets win, and this is primarily the baby boomer generation, and the buyer of these assets loose, primarily gen x and millennials. I'm really not looking forward to at best, stagnating asset prices as interest rates are inevitably increased, or at worst, another crash.
