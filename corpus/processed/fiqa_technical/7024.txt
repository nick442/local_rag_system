I wish congress would consider just adding a lower cost, government managed option by perhaps allowing some to buy into medicare instead of being forced to purchase from a for-profit company. Also, the government needs to be allowed to put a lid of drug prices for change the law requiring them to simply pay whatever price anyone can dream up.
