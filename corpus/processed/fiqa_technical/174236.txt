Title is incorrect. $1000 every ten years, or $100 per year. The author puts the calculations in the article, and while I think the methodology is dubious it is at least transparent. The $1000 was the cost over the next decade applied to the number of workers, which means the annual cost is one tenth of that, or $100. Edit: I said number of households and I shouldâ€™ve said number of workers.
