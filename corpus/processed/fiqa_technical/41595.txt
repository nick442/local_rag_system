"I worked for a large well known corporation as a senior programmer, and was in charge of interviewing programmers. This is in NYC. Out of 50 pre-screened candidates we hired 2. Half of the candidates can't answer the simplest questions like ""write a function to reverse a string"", which every first year Comp Science student should be able to do. And our salaries were good, not $60K. So yes, even in NYC there's not enough talent."
