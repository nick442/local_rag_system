The idea of education has never been to make stupid people smarter, but to make uneducated people educated and ready to serve a greater good as an educated worker and member of the political spectrum. Comparative economics tells us that as the manufacturing jobs that used to be in the US move overseas and equalize the wealth of the world with the people working to receive it. As this happens, jobs in manufacturing will leave the US, and their educated and formerly employed workers with it. My suggestion is that Microsoft takes the already educated, and gives them training to function in a new career in return for guaranteed service in the job they have been trained for. There is no need to revamp any education system here, but only to start a training program which Microsoft would benefit greatly from.
