Do you really think that just because a business doesn't deal directly with the government they have NO interest in policy? Minimum wage laws, parental leave, immigration, regulations.. all these things and many more impact business regardless of direct business with government. It's hard to imagine a business that DOESN'T have at least some interest in what the economic climate the government of the day is creating.
