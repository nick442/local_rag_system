I think that one-sided is nicer for a more professional occupation or aim. If you do decide to go two-sided, I would make sure that the back is something minimalist. As one other commenter said, it is nice to have space to write extra info on a card. Plus, it is nice to be able to tell which side is the front as soon as possible.
