It sucks but sometimes you just have to flat out be an asshole to people. Ive told people to post that drivel on r/Occupywallstreet and leave it out of the business related forums where people actually know whats going on. Sucks but gets the job done. I would encourage you to check out r/finance and see what you think about our stuff.
