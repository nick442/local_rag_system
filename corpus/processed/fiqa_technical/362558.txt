I work at a leasing (financial) company and I completely agree. The only Apple products you will use are the iPhone-if it is bring your own device- or the iPad, if adoption of the Microsoft tablets does not take place. Excel is your best friend in finance and that is why I recommend a PC. No one at our company uses a Mac.
