Honestly, 10 wash trades is next to nothing. I run a small automated trading firm and I get maybe 20-30 wash trades per quarter. You get fined for them but it's not a big deal, preventing wash trades can be pretty hard and sometimes it's entirely out of your control. Canada has much stricter rules about wash trading, the U.S. has more lenient rules on them, and in Europe you can wash trade all you want because honestly it doesn't make much of a difference. Anyhow, just trying to give some perspective that 10 instances of wash trading is not unusual/uncommon, won't have any market impact one way or another, and often happens by accident. If anything wash trades are just a pain in the ass, you end up paying transaction costs for nothing.
