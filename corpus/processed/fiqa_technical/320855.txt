"> the Soviet union was as capitalist as any other country According to the Marxists, capitalism is the ""private ownership of the means of production"". In order for ""private ownership"" of *anything* to exist, one must by definition have the right to ""private property"" ownership, or ""property rights"". I would therefore argue from definition that the only metric to measure the degree a state can be said to be capitalist is to examine the degree by which it respects private property rights. The Soviet Union historically had low respect for property rights, and any system of authoritarianism definitionally has low respect for property rights. One cannot claim the Soviet Union was capitalist as any other country unless you can claim it respected private property rights to the same degree as every other country."
