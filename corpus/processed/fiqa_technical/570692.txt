It depends on the relationship you have with the person. Let's say you're referring your client to him. What if he fails to provide the promised IT consultation service? It would bring in bad reputation to your business as well, right? First of all, you should keenly look into his portfolio and the reputation he has been holding in his work field. If he's a good profile that matches with your clients' project, I have no objection for partnering up with him. Being the co-founder of a digital marketing agency, I have partnered up with the fellow agencies and it worked well in between both parties. If you have more questions, feel free to ask.
