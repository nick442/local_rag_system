Since I work full time I'd have to take online courses. The school isn't some online scam school it's legit, but the costs are much higher there. I've thought about getting a finance degree but I think I have more options with an accounting degree. I'm probably overestimating the costs. I think it would be more around 30k but still. I'm not sure how to get out of the sales trap. Non sales jobs in finance making decent money usually won't give me another look without a bachelor's.
