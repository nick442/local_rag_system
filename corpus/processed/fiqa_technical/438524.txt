One of the brightest network engineers I've worked with went to get his GED while he worked with me since he was a high school dropout. I dropped out of EE, and have been highly recruited because of my experience. My former manager got his experience in the military, no degree.. and another bright co-worker had his degree in film. Sure many of my co-workers have BSEEs, a couple from MIT and Stanford, even had a PhD on my team.. but often you'd never be able to tell who had what. So you are exactly right.. a witch-hunt because of a music degree is bullshit.
