Thank you very much for your reply. I'll look more into the CFA but I have a question - does it require an undergrad degree in finance/accounting to become licensed if you pass? Obviously that's an area that I need to do more research but a great place to start based on your suggestions. If I take it in December I'll be 5 months from my masters. In that case it makes more sense to complete the masters because quitting that close to the end really throws a lot away. I know counseling isn't specific to the field, but people skills seem to be the cornerstone of every career. Thank you again for taking the time to respond. I feel like a small fish in a big pond. The earning potential is shiny, but I'm more interested in a career that is not as emotionally taxing and that tailors to my skill set, critical thinking, and love for evaluating/speculating/problem-solving.
