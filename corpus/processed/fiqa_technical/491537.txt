Is there a risk buying a used car via a proxy if I pay the actual owner? Everything seems to be in order except one thing: the actual owner (X) is out of the country, and the car is being sold by his relative (Y). Yes there is risk. The risk is that the money never makes it to the actual owner. You have a piece of paper that claims to give permission to sell the car and the contact info for the real owner. The risk is that it was forged. Or that some other part of the chain of trust is forged. Maybe the car is stolen. Maybe this is part of a more complex scam and you are only a small part of it. The risk is that you end up having to file a police report after the real owner reports it stolen and the car is taken from you; or even worse you end up under arrest because they think you are the thief. With tons of cars for sale why risk it? Of course if the deal is a bargain, that may be designed to make you ignore the flashing warning light.
