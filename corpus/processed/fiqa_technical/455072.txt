Welcome to food service. I honestly don't know a chain restaurant run differently. You get shat on as a server. The entire system is rigged to use you as the flex point, the breaking post. Food wasn't good? The waiter gets punished through his pay, not the restaurant. The food was late? The waiter's pay get's punished, the restaurant get's their full payment. The host screwed up? Comes out of the waiters tips. The business isn't doing well? Mine as well dip into the servers tips, so we can pay EVERYONE $2.13 instead of minimum wage.. So really, you have an enormous power to treat their employees better. Tip more. But some how, I don't see America tipping more.
