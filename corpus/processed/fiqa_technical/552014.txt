Wrong. If an industry needs 3 widget makers, and there are only 2 widget makers on Earth, their salary is going to be dramatically higher (and thus cut into margins) than a world where 3 are needed but 30 exist. To claim that supply and demand doesn't exist in the labor market or isn't a primary driver of wages is so fallacious that it's nothing short of retarded.
