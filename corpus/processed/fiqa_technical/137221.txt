"All this ""dirty laundry"" talk is really dumb. I'm very close to someone who was in a boar meeting 2 weeks before this happened and I can tell you that all this is justa result of Pandit not getting along or not living up to the expectations of the president of the board. He told Pandit he didnt think he was doing so good, Pandit told him he thought he was doing great and said ""if you dont like it I can leave"". 2 days later he was gone"
