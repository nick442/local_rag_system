Keep eye contact throughout the interview and prepare answers to questions like: what is your greatest weakness, why are you interested in this company, how can you add value that other candidates can't. I'd suggest doing thorough research on the company's mission statement, vision, and product history. The more you can lace in info about their company during the interview, the better they'll like you.
