I'm a farmer and it'll be interesting to see what impact this has on the fresh aisle. A lot of farmers get into the organic market because the margins are better than conventional, but the costs AND risks are a lot higher. If the hit is solely on the Whole Foods/store side, it'll all be fine. But if they come back to the growers that [typically see less than 10% of the dollar spent at the grocery store anyway](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/charts/58353/food-prices_fig03.png?v=42835), it'll be interesting to see who is willing to stick it out in the organic sector.
