You can do the Roth IRA, but I think your income is too high to take a deduction on the traditional IRA. By the way, this is the 2015 tax table - You look like you are in the 28% bracket. A good place to be, but I'd be putting more money pre-tax in the 401(k) and consider converting in years that your rate may be lower. It's easy to get married, buy a house, and that same income puts you in the 15% bracket. The truth is, no one can project 5 years out, let alone 40, and a mix like you have is as good an approach as any, even if I'd lean more pretax. Remember, your $4400 match is on the pretax side, so you are close to 50/50 as is.
