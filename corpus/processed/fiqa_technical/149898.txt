"I think the builders need to get their heads out of their asses and see who is actually looking to buy a house, and what sort of house. There is a new development of two-story duplexes that was built near me 6 months ago; they are asking $595,000 for each *unit*. Everybody that walks by it says ""Are you shitting me?"" For $250,000 they would be nice houses. The builders are wondering why they aren't selling."
