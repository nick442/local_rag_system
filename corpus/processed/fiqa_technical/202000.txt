"the financial community hates him because he teaches people who don't have financially-responsible parents how to think properly about money and how it works. I've read the books and it's not remotely about ""getting rich quick"". It's about showing people the patterns of thinking that seperate the haves from the have nots. The more snide remarks I see about this guy, especially on financial forums, the more I realize the value of his originals texts."
