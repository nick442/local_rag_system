I live in Japan now, and it is well known that almost all young people move to Tokyo/Osaka at some point in their lives - and the major cities are soaking up the populations of smaller towns around them - so even with a declining birth rate, larger regional towns are growing (and new housing and development happening) as the rural villages are basically abandoned en masse. I wonder how the perception of “moving to California for work” - which was very common when I was young 30 years ago, compares to the “moving to Tokyo” feeling in Japan. Tokyo has always kept growing and adding housing/apartments (similar to suburban sprawl as it overgrows Saitama), vs the very tight housing market for San Francisco - but people plan to leave Tokyo at some point.
