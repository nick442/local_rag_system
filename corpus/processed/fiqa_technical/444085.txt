"I'd imagine it would only be a ""threat"" or interference in an election, if a person could prove that only people who voted for Obama were laid off. Otherwise it is just a blanket statement that says, if X candidate wins there will be lay offs due to laws that will be enacted. A better way for him to say it without being so politically charged would be to point out the specific laws and taxes that would affect his company and then allow his employee's to go determine how the candidates at large support/oppose those laws and taxes. edit: For example: ""Law xx.xx.xx which is currently slated to go into affect on xx/xx/xxxx requires that companies of our size pay an extra xx% of revenue to the government. Due to this restriction I will need to lower labor costs in order to maintain a profitable company. If you feel this law should not be enacted I encourage you to contact your congressmen and do research on where your current presidential candidates lay their support."" Still has the same message though."
