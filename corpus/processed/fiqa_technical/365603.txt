Completely different. Canadians can be deemed non-residents by severing their residential ties with Canada and emigrating to another country, and no longer required to file unless they have certain sources of Canadian income. *See* http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/living-abroad/taxation No such classifications exist with US citizenship. You file a return no matter what, even if you haven't stepped foot in the US in decades.
