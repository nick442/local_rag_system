"I think the nuance you're introducing here is probably as close as you're going to get to acknowledging Bitcoin's price action isn't ""just"" about ""chinese money"", despite your first comment on the topic. If you're predicting that Bitcoin's market value will take a hit when China announces restrictions on bitcoin or its surrounding ecosystem, you're spot on. Bitcoin already takes a nosedive whenever China makes a sneezing noise that vaguely sounds like ""bitcoin."" But high volatility is not the same thing as collapsing. If you're waiting for a bitcoin collapse, don't hold your breath while doing so."
