"That article is over a year old and at the tail end of the largest recession in 50 years. It is based on Census data, but since they don't say which data it is not clear where they got their information. Do you have anything from this past moth or so? Looking at the Census website, [here is the Census page with data](http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/), and if you open the top link titled ""Table H-1. Income Limits for Each Fifth and Top 5 Percent â€¢All Races [XLS - 45k]"" you'll see that there is a slight blip in income level but as of 2010 almost every quintile is wthin $1000/yr of an all time high. Feel free to browse and analyze their datasets, but it does not look bad. So let's find more recent data: BLS tracks such items, such as the [National Compensation Survey](http://www.bls.gov/ncs/tables.htm) , the [Labor Force Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswktabs.htm) and the [CUrrent Population Survey](http://www.bls.gov/cps/tables.htm#weekearn), among others. I am too tired to dig through this. I already posted the Census data, and it is old and shows signs on increase, and plenty from BLS that I have dug up in other posts shows that real income most definitley has not declined for *decades*. At worst people have incomes similar to 2005, and it seems most quintiles are back to an all time high for real compensation."
