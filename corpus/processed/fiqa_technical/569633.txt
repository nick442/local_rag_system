"We can also all sit back and bitch about how there are no jobs! No one is willing to pay for services anymore because everything is ""free""on the internet. You have billions of dollars flowing to startups with <100 employees. Monetizing the internet outside of advertising would be a boon to the economy and jobs..people just can't see it. If everyone paid for things, you know like pre-internet..we would probably have better quality stuff. For example, News has suffered..laying off all the real journalists. Google would be forced to actually compete with companies vs. Giving everything away free. That creates employment opportunities for other startups to compete in a fair environment vs. Trying to acquire millions of users on no revenue."
