"> But what exactly are the new jobs that will be created? Nadella says to expect “people on people jobs.” These require skills that demand significant interaction, such as eldercare, In other words, low paying undesirable boring jobs.. until a robot can do those jobs too.. > “So much of the last 10 years has been consumption … now is the time for creation -- like in [building video game] Minecraft, with [Microsoft Paint spinoff] paint3d,” .. to make money for the platform owner (Microsoft who owns Minecraft) and almost nothing for you.. and you can do this ""creative work"" only in your 20s or 30s.. after which you are outdated and not so creative.. great job security. I never heard of people becoming millionaires from creating apps on Google/Apple, youtube channels or all the other ""creative"" channels. **BOTTOM LINE: the whole purpose of Robots and AI is to take jobs and work away from people! Simple as that.** **Currently, millions of low skilled people have to do work done by robots and highly skilled people do the work done by AI. With robots and AI, either you are totally useless for any work (low skill people) or lose you job/income (highly skilled).** I am not against robots or AI, but I think they should be regulated. For example, all customer service (i.e. talking to a human being) must be done by humans, where AI is just a tool to help that customer service human. Another example, every group of robots doing work must be supervised by a human who gives them instructions what to do and how to do it."
