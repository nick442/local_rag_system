Amazon is beating Google at releasing voice assistant products. Owning both a Google Home, an Amazon Echo and two Echo dots, I can say that the Google Home is way closer to being a virtual assistant than anything made by Amazon. My echo is good at controlling my smart home but that's about it. The Google Home has the intelligence and information of Google behind it and you can ask it random questions and give it random tasks and it knows what to do. The echo fails 4/5 times with things like that. All it's going to take is Google adding more functionality to the Home and it will easily leapfrog the Echo. Edit: spelling
