I don't own a business but I am a manager for a large IT company (globally dominant). I refuse to be dishonest in business and am lucky to work for senior management that shares that view. We win some, we lose some. We are as transparent as possible, keep our commitments, and seek deals that drive value for all parties. Sometimes I am deeply frustrated by the lack of integrity of others and the benefits they seem to reap. But my reputation is excellent, my clients know they can take me at my word, I can look my kids in the eye and know that I walk the walk about my guidance on morals, ethics, and character, and I will someday die having spent my career in an honest and respectable way. Could I make more if I was full of shit? Maybe. Is money worth that price? No.
