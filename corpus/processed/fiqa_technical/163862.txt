When I go to Niagara Falls, for example, the towers on both sides pick up my phone. I'll be standing fully within Canada and get a 'welcome to the US' text, and vice versa. This is known to happen and usually isn't a big deal. The article talks about roaming in a neighboring country, so it doesn't really clarify if it's simply near border connection as I've described, or if the phone is supposed to have connected further in the country.
