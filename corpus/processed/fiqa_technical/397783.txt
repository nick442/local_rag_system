If this is true, can you explain to me how this deal came to originate itself? My thoughts are like this: Tim's looking to expand and grow their company and market share, looking to join or merge into a company. RBC and Citi step in and help Tim's find the perfect pairing with respect to their priority as a company. RBC and Citi then help Tim's sell themselves TO BK? The real question is: since 3G Capital are really the ones that are pulling the strings on this deal, are they just outsourcing all the analysis work to Lazard JP and Wells Fargo? P.S I would really like to know more on how deals like these are handled and who does the advising/analysis for who, and etc.
