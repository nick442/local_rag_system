That's not true - insurance companies can manage that risk and look to Re-insure that risk with very large pools of risk capital through reinsurance. Government agencies traditionally have not looked to buy insurance but are now starting to insure such catastrophic risks. I believe the NFIP has some sort of excess risk cover such that if losses are greater than $500 million, then it triggers a payout from large private insurers.
