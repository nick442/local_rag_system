Owing taxes to two or more levels of government isn't double taxation. It's a feature of the American union. I'm not for this bill in general, mostly for the timing and the loss of the highest bracket, but both the state and federal governments have to generate revenue, and basing rates on pure incomes with a few loopholes as possible is the most progressive way to do it. By owing taxes unadjusted for other taxes paid, there's more incentive for states to lower local taxes and to balance state programs with federal programs, and for state reps to more fairly redistribute federal transfers instead of targeting states with (usually artificially) low local taxes and fewer state programs (usually Republican).
