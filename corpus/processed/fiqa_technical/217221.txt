That's a very biased and narrow article. Only thing preventing me from buying one is their really mediocre interiors. It doesn't feel like the interior matches the price range. My Mercedes has a better interior in the same price bracket. Also when you do the math, in my state you don't come out ahead for the premium you pay. Even after the incentives kick in. Also the lease buy back value is a lot lower than the ones on my Mercedes. When you put all these things together, it's still better to get a MB/BMW/Audi/Lexus/Infiniti
