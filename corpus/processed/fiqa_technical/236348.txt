One representative I spoke to suggested moving the money into a new IRA, making up the difference from my own pocket, and then asking for a rebate a tax time. Will this work? That's probably the only thing that will work, and you have to do this ASAP: you have 60 days from the distribution to complete the deposit. Make sure to make up for the withheld 20%, and deposit into the IRA the full amount, and make sure to give all the relevant information to your tax preparer to ensure you do get the withheld 20% back as a tax credit. You can check with your current 401k plan if you can deposit there, but in many cases you cannot. IRA is a safe bet.
