Right. It's free market when it works, and help subsidise me when it doesn't. This tax is already paid by European airlines operating in Europe; and European airlines have to pay American taxes when they operate in the USA. The finding was that *American* airlines have to pay *European* taxes when they operate in Europe. However you're right that *this* could be the straw that broke the camel's back, you're wrong that we need to let Americans preserve their delusions. Let it crumble, and maybe the shareholders of the survivors will assassinate the next CEO who recommends a race to the bottom. By the way, [of course the TSA consults airlines](http://www.tsa.gov/press/releases/2011/1004.shtm). I can't imagine why anyone would think otherwise.
