Is this true though? I mean say if you increase taxes for the wealthy to 50% you'll end up with the state that certainly has significantly more money. But the trouble is the state hasn't been very good at spending it. Look at the kind of stuff they get up to with the cash they have now. They fight wars, build massive jails and involve themselves where it's none of their business. Do you really want them to have more money? I'd be less concerned if they proposed higher taxes for stuff like basic income but I don't see higher taxes just by themselves as really being helpful.
