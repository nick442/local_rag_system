I personally keep my LinkedIn and personal website updated and go to plenty of developer meetings. Fuck stagnation.I'm not about to work in a field for a single penny less than I make now. If I was doing development the company culture should be better and management should be respectful of my time at the least, but trying to work for the pittance they try to put out is ridiculous when you know your skills will earn them double what you make (or more.)
