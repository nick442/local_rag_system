you will start to see this from every country, as things get more global, countries are going to want to make sure people arent hiding taxes from the government while enjoying all the protections a state has to offer. Like military, intelligence, protection from unfair trade practices,. heck look at the us gov going up to bat for exxon against chavez and exxon avoids paying taxes in the US on their profits, like most multi national corps. states that see outlays straining against lack of revenues, and the distaste that comes from raising taxes, will go after those they think are avoiding them. No one really cares when you go after people hiding money.
