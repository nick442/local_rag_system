Then they keep putting artificial burdens and excuses on WHY they can't produce phone records . . . they want to redact their customers. Yeah - discovery fucking blows. They still have to do it. Then tragedy strikes supposedly and their hard drive crashes . . . and a parade of horrible things happen just to them . . . at the worst possible time. Repeatedly. I'm not buying it being too simple. Why? I'm confident that even though I don't know anything about Florida law . . . discovery deadlines aren't within mailing days. Their story sounds so implausible it hurts. They said there was a complaint filed within 90 minutes or thereabouts of a threatening letter . . . even if someone was on that electronic system you'd never get a response in 90 minutes so what are we missing? Plus - they KNEW they were moving? And mail forwarding did *nothing*?? And they **knew** there was an online system . . . but they *never* did anything about it This whole thing stinks of: should have gotten a lawyer.
