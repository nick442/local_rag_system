>As an employer, why would I not want to hire someone who is philosophically similar to me? Because this isn't an issue that should come up in the work place at all, it's extremely unprofessional. It also leads down a very dangerous road of employers demanding religious and political affiliation in a time when people will claim to share that just to get a job. Unless someone's a zealot you're unlikely to know what their exact position on many issues is and you may be surprised to find how many people with different opinions you actually gel well with and work productively, though I completely understand where you're coming from I don't think the link between having the same opinion and having productive chemistry is as strong as you believe.
