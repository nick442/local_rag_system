"I was reading this and then looked for uppies/downies because I thought I'd written it.. I don't want to ""manage"" or be an executive. I just want to be respected for my work and really good at what I do (which I am). After that, I want to get paid for the work I do. I'm a workaholic because I love what I do. I love tackling challenges and solving problems. My hobby *is* my job, so banging away at something on the weekend while my wife is in school is just fine with me. And as an hourly consultant, I'm perfectly happy getting paid doing it. I also like the subtle pressure to actually produce things - it helps keep me focused. (I actually annotate what I've accomplished each day on my time sheet, which I think makes everyone happy) I'm working about the same hours I worked on my last gig. But I've just about doubled my pay."
