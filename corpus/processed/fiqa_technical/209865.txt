Are things getting better yet or are things still a mess? I have heard people say that right now is a 'good' time to take out a loan, and that it is a buyer's market in real estate. Something to consider here is what intentions do you have for the real estate you'd buy. If you intend to sell quickly, then selling into a buyer's market doesn't sound like a great idea. While real estate may be cheap, there can be the question of how long do you think this will last? How much of a burden on time and energy are you expecting to take if you do switch residences or buy an investment property? But more specifically, are there any hidden details that come with taking a loan out when interest rates are low that I should be aware of? I'd be careful to note if the rate is fixed for the entire length of the loan or does it adjust over time. If it can adjust then there is the possibility of those adjustments going up.
