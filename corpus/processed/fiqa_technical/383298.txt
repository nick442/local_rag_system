"That's kind of the untold story of China, everyone seems to think that all that they are about is cheap this and cheap that. Just a bit of a personal anecdote, but I'm a bit of a clotheshorse myself and on my first business trip to Shanghai was able to have some tailored clothing made there. Not only was the cut and finish as good or better than anything you'd get in Europe or N. America, but the price was significantly less. I quickly noticed that a lot of the Chinese made garments selling locally were many times better than those ""imported"" ones bearing western brand labels, even though they were also produced right there in China. So yes, I am most definitely of the mind that the cheapness/lack of quality of the products we have available to us in Europe and N. America, and made in China, are a direct result of our own indigenous companies hosing us so as to really fatten up those margins. Suffice it to say, they do in fact have quality control, however, if you want to pay them good money to make shit products, they'll surely oblige you."
