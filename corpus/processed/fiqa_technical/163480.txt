I'm all for universal health care. It costs less and everyone gets covered. But You can't call it capitalism currently when the government makes laws that's kills competition. Ask any Pharmacist and they'll tell you how corrupt the FDA is. What we have now is far from capitalism. Capitalism gets a bad wrap but nobody bitches when you have so many smart phones to choose from. What if hospitals had to list prices? How much for an X-ray? I have no idea how much that shit cost. It's good for everyone to know prices but the system makes it less transparent and that's on purpose. People blame capitalism but they mistake it for how the government runs things.
