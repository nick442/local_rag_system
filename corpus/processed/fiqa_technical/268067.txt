"I purchase next to 0 processed foods every month. I'd go with maybe a few ""extras"" every month that I enjoy (granola bars, cookies, whatever). I spend MUCH less on food (and eat WAY more) than anyone else I know. You really think that that box of corn dogs is cheaper than a couple pounds of grass fed beef? When you do the math, and figure out that you only eat 4-8oz of beef in a sitting, yet you eat 3 corn dogs, it becomes clear what the better option is. The problem isn't a lack of money, it is a lack of education in basic nutrition."
