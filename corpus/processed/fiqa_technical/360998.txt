>and tobacco ($6-8.50) are quite expensive. :-/ Tobacco is usually $15-$20 here (for 20-25). Used to be more like $8-$12, before we introduced our incredibly heavy tobacco tax. Edit: Also, a $11 crate of beer is incredible. You literally cannot buy a six-pack anywhere in this country for that price, barring occasional specials on pisswater.
