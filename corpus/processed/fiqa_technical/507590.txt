Why does it matter that 400 people were put out of work? Why does business have to be about giving people jobs? This frustrates me to no end. Our quest to put people in jobs is not how we should see things. Trying to justify jobs is backwards thinking honestly. Look at government systems like NASA. The space shuttle turned out to be a disaster in terms of costs, and same thing seems to be happening with the new SLS program. Why? Because congress was more concerned about keeping jobs than actually doing the job at hand. I really want to believe that the world of business is not going to devolve to that level. I realize this is a rant, so feel free to report/downvote me.
