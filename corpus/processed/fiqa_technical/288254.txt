Cripes, did anybody think to proofread it in all that time? It has random spaces in the middle of every other word. From the executive summary it looks like a fairly optimistic overview of transhumanist goals (which I've been aware of and supported for years now, thanks kindly) without anything that should cause you to flip a shit as you have here. There's nothing inherent to human enhancement or future technology that suggests less privacy or liberty for individuals - in fact a lot of human snooping, minding, and emergency decision-making can be replaced by automated systems with memories kept short by law. If all you're concerned about is the potential abuses by tyrannical governments then you're never going to welcome any technological change in the future and you probably find yourself at odds with most of the advances from the 20th century. Tyrannical governments can ruin and abuse *anything.* Any ex-Soviet will tell you they can be just as nosy and suppressive with pen and paper as with computers and nanomabots. The control problem you seek to address is tyranny, not technology. I'm skimming through this bloody massive document and not seeing anything so horrible that unfamiliarity warrants accusations of mental deficiency. It looks like five hundred pages of breathless futurism with plentiful concern for privacy. Point me toward the bug up your ass or I'm just going to write this off as luddite fearmongering.
