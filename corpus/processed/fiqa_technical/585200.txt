Impossible to tell. When companies merge, they generally seek to eliminate redundancies. Some people will probably be laid off. Just because you're low on the totem pole doesn't mean you will be laid off. For example, if you work in maintenance, the homes will still need to be maintained - but the company might not want double the maintenance managers.
