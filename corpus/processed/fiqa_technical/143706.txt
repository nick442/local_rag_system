A tax on organic (food) waste will probably be the only effective lever. Perhaps cataloging food waste produced at farms, to try and tune in some synergies in the food industry. I know some large Australian Universities are investing heavily in this space. Waste to resource type projects, using bio-reactors and the like. Composting the residue to put back in to the productive lands is also a big part of reducing and improving outcomes.
