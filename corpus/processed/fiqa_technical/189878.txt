You're 100% correct here. This is without a doubt on me. But it's still absurd do to me making a mistake about one large transaction bringing my balance negative, every small transaction past it is getting hit with a $35 dollar charge. Multiple transactions that a few dollars become an almost $50 dollar purchase a pop. They're making a killing off of people trying to make a living.
