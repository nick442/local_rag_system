"So a guy that went to a shitty college moved to an $800 plus per month apartment in Manhattan to be an actor and applied for low skill jobs near minimum wage. That's the shittiest plan I've ever heard. “When I first walked into Express, I said, ‘Oh my God, this place is awesome and there’s music and it looks like a happening place"". Anyone want to claim that he's not an idiot?"
