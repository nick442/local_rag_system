Fundamentally, there are two differences between traditional and Roth: 1) With traditional you pay the tax rate that's in effect when you draw it out, with Roth you pay the tax rate when you put it in. Assuming the same tax rate this is a wash. 2) As a Roth contains after-tax money this lets you put more in than you could with a traditional. This is only a benefit if you are in a financial position to put more in, though. If you can't come fairly close to maxing your contribution this gains you nothing.
