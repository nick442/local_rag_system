Chaos theory is two essays combined as a book. It's short. You could probably read the whole thing in under 2 hours. Also [here is a print version](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html) of David Friedman's theory. I do have a longer, more detailed explanation, but it's in video form (about an hour).
