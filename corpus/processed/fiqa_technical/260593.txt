The bank loaned you money. They have lien on the property. They have filed paperwork with the local government regarding that lien. If you want to change that paperwork you need them to cooperate. They need to make sure that their interest in the property isn't jeopardized by your actions. Their investors demand that their money be protected. They charge $100 for that service. The quit claim deed tells the world that you are giving up ownership in the property. Are you sure you want to leave the interpretation of your actions and intent to a corporation and the legal system. With only seven years left on the mortgage you most likely have significant equity in the home, even if the value of the property hasn't gone up. Don't you wish to protect that equity by spending $100?
