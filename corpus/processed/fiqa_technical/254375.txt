So your complaining taxing stocks, hurt stock holders who make more money because they hold stock that gets paid from people's payouts? How about that stock holder stop being a whiny bitch because the pennies a stock he lost because other people's stock was taxed, created thousands of jobs that put 50k a year into their bank.
