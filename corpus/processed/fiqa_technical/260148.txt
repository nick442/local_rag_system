Ah, yah, even if you worked in the US if it was your own time and you aren't charging the org you work for you would probably be good. And no, it's not unethical as long as you aren't using your position for profit. IDK the laws of your region, obviously, but in most cases in the US I think you'd be fine. edit: I missed where you said you hired a lawyer. That definitely would have been my advice. If you're cleared by a lawyer, you're definitely good and should enjoy the fruits of your labor worry-free!
