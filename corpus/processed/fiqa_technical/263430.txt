I couldn't agree more. It's a shame the music industry is so ripe for disruption. Similarly to what on demand, and netflix did to the dvd industry. However because of the immense music catalogues that the industry has, any disruptive technology like spotify has to pay heavily for the music, no matter how great the idea is.
