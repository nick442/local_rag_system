Yes, I am currently an undergrad student majoring in Finance. I have a strong interest in Accounting and Economics (Macro). I have learned earlier today that due to the fact that people now live longer, our government spending increases (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, etc). But unfortunately, the funding that it draws from does not increase at a similar rate so the funding for other major aspects such as R&D, Education, etc are being cut to offset the increase in government transfers. Granted the Feds never spent much on education, why is it that the funding for R&D in terms of percentage is so minuscule? Would it not be in each government's best interest to funnel money towards education, infrastructure, research & development, etc? I'm sorry, when I learn one thing, about twenty billion other questions pop up (could be related or unrelated to what I had just learned)
