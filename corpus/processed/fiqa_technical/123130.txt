"And that is exactly where the problem lies, you yourself admit you work like a horse, that you constantly are trying to improve yourself. Do you think you are the only one? Don't you think a million others are doing the same things? This is exactly where the problem arises, its a race to the bottom. Oh just learn to code, just learn another language, blablablah. That will hardly make you more competitive if a million other people are doing the same thing. Honestly, you cannot expect a million people to go through higher education again, you can't expect millions to improve their skills in a world where there are more people than jobs, in a world where everyday automation makes another chunk of the population permanently unemployable. And yes, never forget the token rich person. One random person managed to escape poverty? Ok, let's ignore all the data showing that social mobility is virtually non-existent in todays society, the system most work, if one out of 4 billion people in poverty managed to escape. Why is it such a radical idea that in a world where there are more people than jobs, in a world where food roots away, medicine keeps waiting on the shelves and many ""gentrified"" houses are empty while right next to them there are homeless people, that in such a world, a person is entitled to some food, shelter and medical aid?"
