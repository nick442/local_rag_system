Yes, it's good the economy is doing well. Hopefully it helps the many dissatisfied Trump voters. It would be nice to see some of the anger dampen in the country. The truth is that this data still *mostly* for Obama's economy. Trump's budget didn't start until Oct, after Q3 finished. So this report is for the time when the federal government was operating under budgets passed during the Obama era. Economies have enormous momentum, and this one is still following its long established trajectory. You probably should give Trump credit for regulatory changes, bully pulpit leadership, and those sorts of things. So he definitely should get *some* credit, it's hard to know how much. The stock market rally is very likely in response to expected tax cuts from a GOP government (although if you draw a line for the stock market starting in 2009, we're still on the trend).
