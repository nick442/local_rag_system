What you say about the history of clothing is true.. but we're not going backwards. Modern society is not going back to having one or two outfits per person, made with local/regionally-produced cloth. What we need, in fact, is MORE cotton sourced from poor countries like Burkina/Cote d'Ivoire/Cameroon/Mali/wherever, and much less tariff protection for inefficient, expensive cotton made in rich countries (ex. USA). That would benefit Western consumers AND developing-country producers.
