"I think your logic is flawed when you say CD's are ""better than records"" I hope you are not talking about sound quality..Unless you are working with Blu-ray quality audio files on those CD's (which I can assure you are not going for 25 cents to $1). Again assuming we are not talking about Blu-ray quality CD's compress the audio file down thus sacrificing the quality of the sound. your cited source even says "" are many examples where a vinyl record may sound better than its equivalent CD for extremely specific reasons. Conversely, there are many CD's that may sound better than a vinyl record for specific reasons."""
