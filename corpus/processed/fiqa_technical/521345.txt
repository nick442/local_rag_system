"I think there-in lies the rub. There is certainly a point at which job/income loss outweighs the disposable income gains of a wage increase. That's what I'm suggesting is the only thing left to study. Figure out that ratio, and you have a the secret to solving America's stagnating wage crisis. As to the ""roundabout way of creating job growth"", I guess I just believe there's no other way..well, more specifically, increasing demand is the only reliable way to increase jobs. If you have another way to increase demand (with government policy) I am open to hearing it. Either way, we're having the right conversation - not getting trapped in the self serving lie of ""trickle down""."
