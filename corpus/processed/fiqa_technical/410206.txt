Yeah this is what I thought too. The article referencing 'The Big Short' is kind of just fear mongering, the crisis was horrible and the movie did well to reflect that but the entire crux of the story was that credit ratings agencies weren't transparent and the market was being rigged. If regulation is good then there's no reason CDOs are a problem.
