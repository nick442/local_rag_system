"According to the article, I think the operative word is ""train,"" not ""push."" Essentially companies are looking for ""unicorns"" that don't really exist. They expect the market to offer up people with an exact certain skillset, at a certain price, at a certain time. And *free* markets simply don't work in that manner. Another thing that I did not see this article address is that there really is no loyalty within companies any more. Companies view people as a commodity (but yet don't believe in the free market principle surrounding a commodity), instead of treating people as a resource. Hence people are ready to walk away when they spot a better opportunity."
