Or you can just acknowledge that labor, especially in cases like this with zero barrier to entry (no skill, education, or training requirements before hire) and a job that any marginally able bodied and able minded person can do, has absolutely no power. Literally anyone that can think and move at a basic level can do their job, they have no bargaining power. Not acknowledging that isn't support, it's just denial.
