"Whole Foods has been taking a beating. It used to be **the** go-to place for ""healthier"" products and it positioned itself as an elite brand. But now most supermarkets offer much greater healthier selections, often at cheaper prices. Trader Joe's is expanding and stores like Costco offer the opportunity to buy everything at once, whereas WF is limited in its non-food/non-healthcare products. Their targeted market, yuppies with disposable income, are all flocking to these competitors. I feel like WF is the type of place you go now just to pick up a few things or perhaps one certain item that isn't carried elsewhere. To me, it is a dying brand, so to hear it called undervalued is somewhat funny."
