Did you consider AppleCare? http://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone.html very iPhone comes with one year of hardware repair coverage through its limited warranty and up to 90 days of complimentary support. The AppleCare Protection Plan for iPhone extends your coverage to two years from the original purchase date of your iPhone. This was only a flat fee of $69 (or at least it was when we bought our iPhone 4 models) which seems much more reasonable, particularly if you're planning to keep your phone for a while. (and remember that iPhones magically turn into iPod Touches when you stop using them as phones, so their useful life is a bit longer than most typical smartphones)
