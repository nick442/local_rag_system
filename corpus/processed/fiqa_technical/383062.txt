I don't know about that, but I do know that organized labor is dying a natural death due to automation. The transition is gaining speed over time and it is inevitable. This fixation with the old patterns is what is fundamentally wrong with progressives: Going back to what worked a century ago isn't going to address the problems we face now. Better that progressives go to fundamentals like defining societal values to be achieved and engineering new methods to get there instead of insisting that society as a whole wear old, ill-fitting shoes. So, for example, instead of betting the farm on labor unions, look to basic income fixes along with population growth controls. Labor unions might still play a small part, but that will diminish over time. As concerns the Democrats and labor in the 1970s, labor unions screwed themselves for a generation with the over-bearing strikes of the 1970s. Personally, I think labor unions in the U.S. chose the wrong path when they decided that striking was the best way to deal with ownership/wealth sharing problems: They should have gone the collective buyout and ownership-by-worker methods of dealing with the crony capitalists -- the world would be a different place now.
