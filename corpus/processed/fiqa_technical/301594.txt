"People like to call it ""Chinese State-Sponsored Capitalism,"" but it is absolutely not capitalism. Capitalism doesn't allocate capital to build cities for which there are no residents. It doesn't pick winners by deciding who is best at bribing government officials. We may not always like what the invisible hand deals us, but the idea that central planners are better at allocating capital than an ecosystem of individuals acting in their own interests just doesn't make any sense. The more I learn about the world, the more I realize how little I know. Expecting humans to be smart enough to understand and manage something as complex as an economy is akin to expecting present-day doctors to design a human body that rivals a natural human body in form and function. I understand the need to occasionally intervene and mitigate some of the harsher aspects of nature, but when you take the stance that central planning is superior to a free-market system (or as free as possible given our inclinations towards empathy), you are basically saying that humans are capable of beating nature at its own game. That is an audacious presumption. I have seen zero evidence of that being the case now or at any point in the past."
