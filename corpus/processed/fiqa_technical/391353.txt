"> they find that it is in-line with the 91.8% increase of unemployment rate vs. working age adults. I have another problem with this number. It comes from this statement: ""Between October 2008 and July 2014 the working age population grew by 13.4 million persons, but the US labor force grew by only 1.1 million"" You can get the labor force by adding two series, LNU01074597 (Civilian Labor Force - With a disability, 16 years and over) and LNU01074593 (Civilian Labor Force - With no disability, 16 years and over). In Oct 2008, the numbers are 6,284 and 148,728, for a total of 155,012. (all values are in thousands) In July 2104, they are 5,648 and 151,924, for a total of 157,572. That's an increase of 2,560. So the labor force grew by 2.56 million, not 1.1. I think they are computing a meaningless number but they're not even using the right numbers as input."
