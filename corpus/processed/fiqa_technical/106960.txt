The big picture is terrible. It is beyond repair. If the FED wants to stand in front of the coming train, then goodbye to the FED. As Bernanke prints more money, credit will deflate even faster! Who would want to lend money to the US government and the US consumer who has already displayed inability to pay. Consumers consume, go into debt and go bankrupt. Only producers prosper. That is not us. Government intervention into free markets to save obsolete industries is delaying the recovery. Instead of getting further into debt, we need to re-align our economy to focus on what works. Our problem was debt to begin with and we are doing more of the same to fix the problem. It won't work. Kondratieff Winter has started!
