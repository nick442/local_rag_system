Wow, hard to believe not a single answer mentioned investing in one of the best asset classes for tax purposes..real estate. Now, I'm not advising you to rush out and buy an investment property. But rather than just dumping your money into mutual funds..over which you have almost 0 control..buy some books on real estate investing. There are plenty of areas to get into, rehabs, single family housing rentals, multifamily, apartments, mobile home parks..and even some of those can have their own specialties. Learn now! And yes, you do have some control over real estate..you control where you buy, so you pick your local market..you can always force appreciation by rehabbing..if you rent, you approve your renters. Compared to a mutual fund run by someone you'll never meet, buying stocks in companies you've likely never even heard of..you have far more control. No matter what area of investing you decide to go into, there is a learning curve..or you will pay a penalty. Go slow, but move forward. Also, all the advice on using your employer's matching (if available) for 401k should be the easiest first step. How do you turn down free money? Besides, the bottom line on your paycheck may not change as much as you think it might..and when weighed against what you get in return..well worth the time to get it setup and active.
