">The guy still gets his. If you have 10 cars, and the government takes 4 cars. For most people with 1, 2 or no cars, they'd say, SHIT! You've still got 6 cars!! But if you could sell the company, reduce liabilities (there are certain liabilities beyond a certain size, so say above 5,000 employees you must pay a certain amount additional in medical insurance costs, that incentivizes reducing employees from 7,000 to 4,999.) and move to a tropical island and keep your 10 cars, What would you do? Still Give the government your 4 cars? and then what if you think and know the government is notoriously inefficent at distributing those cars to those who ""need them"" and you know 2 are lost in transportation and 1 is lost to administrative costs so only 1 of those cars is given to people that need it--- how would you feel that the government took your 4 cars? You'd be upset. >Real CEO's figure out how to make more profits under given circumstances. You mean like offshoring and setting up tax havens in other countries? YAY! GM and GE! >Whiny children complain about it not being fair and fire all their staff out of spite. It's not in spite, it's purely a business decision, just a lot more frank and honest than most companies are who bullshit and white wash serious issues they are facing. >If I was a shareholder I'd be worried. That's what you don't get, he is the sole principal of the company, he is the shareholders. The buck stops with him. >Not about Obama but about the loose cannon CEO that is threatening to devalue my stock out of spite because he doesn't know how to run a business properly. Being the principal he is the sole decision maker--- you think he'd screw up his 40+ year old company that has been his life's passion over spite?"
