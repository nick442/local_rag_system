Unoriginal movies that focus on franchises, sequels, and reboots. I came of age in the mid 80s, which seems to me to be a golden era of movies. When I was a senior in high school in 1984, my friends and I would pile into a car and just go to the movies. We didn't know what we were going to watch or when it started, but we knew there would be something good there, even if we had to watch Ghostbusters for the second time or The Terminator for the fourth. Maybe Gremlins, or The Karate Kid, or Beverly Hills Cop, or A Nightmare on Elm Street, or Amadeus, or The Temple of Doom, Romancing the Stone, Sixteen Candles again, Dune, or The Last Starfighter, or The Neverending Story, The Natural, Starman, Firestarter, or Night of the Comet once again, Revenge of the Nerds, Spinal-fucking-Tap, or the Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, Dreamscape, Splash, or fucking Repo Man!
