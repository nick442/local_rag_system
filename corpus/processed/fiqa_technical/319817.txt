Summarized article: Huawei and ZTE, China's two largest telecommunications companies, disputed the findings of a report by the House Intelligence Committee which determined that both companies pose a national security threat. The report determined that using equipment from Huawei and ZTE could provide opportunities for Chinese intelligence services to tamper or spy on US telecommunications networks. Huawei and ZTE failed to cooperate with a year-long investigation and to fully explain their relationship with the Chinese government, according to the report. Additionally, the report noted Huawei's pattern of illegal behavior in the US, including intellectual property violations, immigration violations and bribery and corruption. Committee officials intend to refer their findings to federal law enforcement agencies. In response to the report, both Huawei and ZTE said they fully cooperated with the congressional investigation and called the findings baseless. They also deny they are controlled by the Chinese government. Additionally, Huawei said it believes the congressional findings were predetermined in order to impede competition and block Chinese telecommunications companies from entering the US market. Although Huawei often refers to its business operations in the United Kingdom to show the company's integrity, Huawei has been consistently passed over for contracts in the US. Huawei was also blocked from bidding on an Australian national contract in March. * For more summarized news, subscribe to the [/r/SkimThat](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkimThat) subreddit
