I'll try just about anything generic. I haven't had the best luck with off-brand coffee, though. One thing to check side-by-side is the ingredient list. My wife is sensitive to some ingredients so that plays into what we buy. Sometimes the generic brand has ingredients that she can have, but the name brand doesn't.
