Well I doubt that it has no effect. It will happen regardless, but it will be slower. If the minimum wage was much higher, big companies would invest more in R&D for automation. Automation companies will also have more customers and therefor will make more revenue and produce more units/projects and the price of automation will go down more and more, causing more companies to join in and not hire 15$/hour people who work less efficient than 2000$ robots on 10$/month.
