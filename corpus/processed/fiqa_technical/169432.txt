"That's the problem with capitalism. It doesn't seem to recognize any conservation principle. People may be employees when they're working, but when they're off the clock, they're customers. Maybe not at the same place where they work, but at some other business somewhere else. As a whole, businesses must pay employees in income what they expect to receive from customers in revenue. Otherwise the economic ""circle of life"" ends. What we've been seeing for decades however is business taking ever larger pieces of the pie, while employees/customers see their incomes wither. This is where government comes in. Taxation of the wealthiest individuals is the economic pump which takes the accumulated wealth and puts it back into circulation."
