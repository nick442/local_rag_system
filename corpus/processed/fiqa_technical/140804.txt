"In general, moving averages never seemed that much better for drawing trends, just removing volatility. However, in this case, they do seem more relevant because the moving averages seem to at least remove the noise of many of the other ""revisions."" Comparing the intial numbers to the previous weeks' revised figures is hardly an apples-to-apples comparison, because there is more data available on the previous weeks' figures."
