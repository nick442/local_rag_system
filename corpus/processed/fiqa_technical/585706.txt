Some employers offer commuter benefits that allow you to pay some commuter costs (trains, parking, bikes, vansharing, etc) with pre-tax money (up to $120ish a month). Employers commonly use companies such as WageWorks to provide this benefit. This would lower your taxable income by over $1000 per year.
