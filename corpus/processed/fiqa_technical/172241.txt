Public infrastructure poisons people. Nestle never sold a bottle of water tainted with lead. People are buying solar panels privately to get away from public utilities. Privatized roads are safer and less congested. Private companies are leading the charge on renewable energy and infrastructure. We became the fattest country in the world by privatizing our food supply, not nationalizing it. When you provide something with public funds, you get less of it and pay a higher price. Give the consumers choice in how their money is spent, don't force it on them like a fucking racket. Abolish all taxes.
