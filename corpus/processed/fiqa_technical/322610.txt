"OTOH, Walmart seems to be doing just fine. KMart just hasn't been able to get its act together. Walmarts are bigger, cheaper, and cleaner. Sears, like most general department stores these days, is struggling against small niche players. Their historical strengths of tools (Craftsman) and appliances (Kenmore) have been undercut and out-inventoried by larger, more specialized stores like Home Depot and Best Buy. Their historical catalog business has been totally destroyed by the internet, which they were far too slow to embrace. They have no ""identity"" anymore. 35 years ago when I bought my house, I bought a refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, a clothes washer & dryer, and a vacuum cleaner from Sears. The current incarnations of all those items (except the clothes dryer, which I almost never use) came from Best Buy and Lowes and Amazon."
