"I can agree that Youtube is hardly pure in the matter, but you also have to remember that takedown notices have been served for really stupid things too - for example, Prince serving that random nobody woman a takedown for having a video of her baby dancing to ""Let's Go Crazy."" The song is BARELY understandable over the din of the baby, and the clip is like 45 seconds long at best - yet somehow it angered the Purple One and his lawyers."
