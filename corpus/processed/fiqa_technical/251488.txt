The rich pay more in taxes. It would be hard to cut taxes in a way that *didnt* help the rich. I'm more concerned with what it does for the middle and lower classes. I don't care that much if it helps the rich. EDIT: Okay, so let's say you give the top third of the population (by income) a 1% income tax cut. The middle third got a 5% cut, and the bottom third got a 10% cut. In dollar value, the rich are still getting a larger cut, simply by virtue of how much they pay in taxes. Someone made a point about property tax. Speaking very generally, poor people rent and rich people own. So a property tax inherently benefits the wealthy, because they own more property. Certainly any kind of corporate or capital gains cut would benefit the wealthy, since they own the corporations and are more heavily invested. Even a sales tax cut would benefit the wealthy more than the non-wealthy, simply because they spend more money. But what frustrates me is how hung up people get on the fact that something is good for the wealthy, (such as with the headline of OPs article) as if we should actively try to avoid helping anyone rich. As I stated above, I don't care that it helps the rich, as long as it's helping the rest of us, too. And if the rich are getting a bigger benefit than I am by virtue of being rich, I'm not bothered, because I can do math.
