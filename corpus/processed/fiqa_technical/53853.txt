"If anyone on Reddit actually knew anything about what it takes to run a business let alone a construction business they would keel over their keyboard in a panic attack. It's gonna cost 500 just for the permit. Not to mention you need to pay the state every year to take a test to say you are even qualified to ask for a permit. Then they have the highest unemployment insurance out of any industry then they have the highest liability insurance rates aside from doctors. Then you have to pay someone to accept your dumpster full of old roof garage. Then you all of your office overhead and supervisor for the job. Then when you do all of that really well and make a profit now you can expect to pay 30% taxes on what's leftover. Everyone on Reddit thinks small business operates like Apple and Google dodging billions in taxes by being global. The truth is small businesses are like the ""poor"" people they employ. On a macro level they pay the brunt of the taxes in proportion to earnings so the 1% of large companies can dodge theirs."
