Look at my link. You are 100% correct, except for about four of the reviews. Those four each have someone with more than one friend and more than one review. Again, you could potentially (knowing the social graph) get a situation like this to occur with astroturfing, but it's far less likely. That having been said, look at Monica A. Explain to me how she got filtered. She's the one gigantic red flag that shows that Yelp is intentionally stuffing this business. I have a decent Yelp score (have a lot of reviews and friends) and have always wondered what would happen if I were to review this business. I won't, since I haven't used them, but I'd love to know whether my review would be Monica-ed.
