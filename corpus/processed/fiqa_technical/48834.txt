Well they did not seem to be able to shoot down the two that flew over Japan and those were definitely a threat, so it seems to me the only non-threatening missiles they seem to be able to shoot down are the ones they fire them selves I am starting to wonder and its starting to seem the missile shields might just be another big military boondoggle.
