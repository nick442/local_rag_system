Nice ad hominem attack. You are basically acting like people that work minimum wages are lesser people and undeserving of things, like owning a house. Maybe someone enjoys low skilled labor like working at a cafe or working with their hands. There is nothing wrong with that. That doesn't mean they are lesser than you and/or incapable of owning a house, they just may not be able to afford as nice of things. Jesus, if you have to assume the worst of people to bolster your argument, then you have fucking terrible argument.
