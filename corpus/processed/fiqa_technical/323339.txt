No, I really do. Things break at least once a month, and never get fixed. The worst one was the bathroom window that broke from opening it..3 weeks later, and several pieces of cardboard and duct tape later, it finally got replaced. And the slumlords I rent from now are no where near the neighborhood that I moved out of when I could no longer afford my house. The cost of living went up, and our pay went down. That is not the specific lending bank's fault, indeed. But the economy is crap, and crap runs downhill. I didn't know how bad the schools were in the place we lived formerly until she'd been there for a couple years. The schools here..despite the neighborhood..are excellent. Tldr: We were making more when we bought the house. But it was a 50,000 house that someone stuck a 100,000 price tag on. Lots of hidden problems that got glossed over in the home inspection.
