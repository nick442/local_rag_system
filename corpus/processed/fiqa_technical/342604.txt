Just read that citi is planning to return 132% of their expected earnings to shareholders over the next year in the WSJ. How does a bank return more to its shareholders than what it makes? Also banks requesting payouts in these stress tests of 100% of expected future earnings. Am I missing something? Doesnt make much sense to me. Hope someone sees this thanks.
