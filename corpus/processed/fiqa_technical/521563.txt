"I mean this - your thought process is tied to *something*. If I say ""soda"" a lot of people will have a preconceived notion of what that product is and how it tastes. It doesn't really matter which product comes to mind but I can guarantee that notion isn't a tasteless clear liquid with a generic label that says ""soda"" on it."
