"You're refuting his point about a known disadvantaged minority with county level data.. Compare the people. The whole 4th paragraph of my previous reply. You convince someone that ""a known disadvantaged minority"" is a misnomer by citing individual level data. Instead you cite county level data. Have a beer and relax a little; you're arguing with stranger on the internet not setting actual policy. Cheers!"
