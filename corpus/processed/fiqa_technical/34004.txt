That's the kind of joke a dad says to his adult son about his mom or a group of guys says on a golf course. In a public forum, to a female board member, while Uber is in a shitstorm of bad PR especially about potential sexual discrimination of their employers AND drivers, yeah. I don't think the joke it particularly offensive, but Uber is in damage control mode and that was really poor timing. And I think we all agree timing is very important in comedy.
