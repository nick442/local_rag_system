Wow, you really just turned this discussion to make make this all about you. And not only that, you've cherry picked only certain things you want to refute, actually one little thing, and overlooked most of my last comment. I think that says everything about your argument that you avoided most of mine.. Whatever, go keep living in your echo chamber.
