There's a wholeeee lot of stuff like this selling these days. Stickers, crystals, even $150 crystal dildos. Talk of healing, feminine energy, and chakras abounds. It's nothing new, really, but it just seems to be something that's seen a lot of mainstream attention lately. Sometimes I wish I could be a placebo-slinger, too.
