"> I don't get why our free market economy relies on constant and continuous growth in producing goods/services. Doesn't this contradict the entire point of economics in that there are scarce resources ? Hmm, it's a good question. I think my answer would be that economics doesn't require continuous growth, politics does. Ideas that politicians sell us like ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"", social security, and supply-side economics need continuous growth to work."
