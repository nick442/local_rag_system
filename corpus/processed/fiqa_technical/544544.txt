Theres an interesting dynamic in play: transaction fees vs. block reward. The last few years running up to the present have seen a much greater inflationary supply than demand can sustain, leading to the swings of a speculative asset commodity. As block reward diminishes and fees start to sustain the economy more, we will see much more stability, hopefully allowing more liquidity to flow in and remain there. As this occurs, bitcoin starts to behave more like a currency.
