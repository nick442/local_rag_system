Yup, there is the temptation to go out to bars etc, but you can always invite people back to your place instead for studying and drinks, if you really need to do that.. (oh ya.. if your jurisdiction doesn't allow drinking at your age, I guess it won't be an issue, I keep forgetting how it works some other places)
