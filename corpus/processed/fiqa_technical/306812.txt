Not only did it not explain *why*, it didn't ask if declining DAUs are surprising. My gut feeling is that these 'casual' games have a very short shelf-life, and that declining DAUs are not a cause for concern. Failing to replace old titles with new titles is probably the bigger problem here. The implication is that Zynga got lucky with its first few hits, and does not really have a strategic advantage that allows it to consistently produce hit games.
