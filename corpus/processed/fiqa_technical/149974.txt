Fiscal dominance occurs when a national debt has reached levels such that a nation is unable to pay it down with taxes and requires monetary policy support in order to stay solvent. In such a situation, it is difficult to control inflation because raising interest rates can make it impossible for the government to pay its debt. Japan's inflation was/is extremely low, and that was/is why fiscal dominance is an advantage for them. Not sure if this is applicable for the US.
