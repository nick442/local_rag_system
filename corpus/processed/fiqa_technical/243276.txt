"There's another line of business based on the theory of perpetual incremental growth. It's called a ""pyramid scheme"" In the longlongago, there were two general types of stock: growth stocks and income stocks. Growth stocks were generally smaller businesses that were still, well, growing. You didn't expect much of a dividend from them because they were reinvesting profits into growing into new markets. The focus was on capital growth. Once a company got fairly large and mature, then the expectation of capital growth tapered off because back then reasonable investors recognized it's insane to expect that a company can grow forever. Then, while there may be some ongoing capital growth, the major focus was on dividend income - getting a piece of the profits a large, established company could pull in. The dotcom (among other things) broke that. People got obsessed with capital growth and instant returns. The idea of a decent yield over time became laughable. Instead a company had to show a percentage year over year growth or they got filleted by Wall Street. If you put one penny on the first square of a checkerboard, then two pennies on the next, then four pennies on the square after that.. once you fill the entire checkerboard how much money do you have?"
