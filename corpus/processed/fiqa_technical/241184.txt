How accounting heavy was his economics degree? I majored in economics as well and my program did not require any accounting or excel work, which naturally made things very difficult when trying to cross over to finance. Its obviously possible, but if he is weak in these areas that is definitely something he should focus on. If you don't know accounting you are basically dead in the water the longer you wait.
