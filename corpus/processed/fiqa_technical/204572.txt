"Ok, here's the final statement from me. Think about it in the future. > Your views are highly racial and not based on facts. You know very very well that I do not hate ALL(!) Muslims! [Here are facts about Muslims](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6f7y9l/stats_the_left_doesnt_want_you_to_see/) Fear of Muslims is not ""Islamophobia"". It's a fear grounded in reality. On the other hand, your view about Muslims is a baseless theory, just based on events in the last 24 hours. Christians don't go on killing sprees during lent. Jews don't go nuts during Passover. Why do Muslims go all ""Allah Akbar"" during Ramadan? Hence, ""Islamophobia"" is a word invented to Silence ANY Critics of Islam. Do you see any problems with Islam and/or how it's practiced? If yes, would you tell a criticise a Muslim over that? Any problems you see with Jews or Christians? > A Moron heres your speech translates it to beat up all muslims because they are the terrorists and will do so. Plenty of morons in Poland, Japan, Hungary and Norway. Also in Germany. Where do you think the morons beat Muslims? **Where do they already hit Muslims, according to you?** You said it yourself: Germans beat Muslims. Is it going to stop? Do you think it will be reduced if more Muslims come over? > They actually do have a big Problem with antisemitism and this Problem needs to be addressed. LOL!!! Honestly, as you probably know, many many Germans are antisemitic, past and present. How is Germany, up until recently, doing addressing this issue? Success story? The same method will work to address antisemitism among Muslims? Auf Widerehesen!"
