">I don't see how employing more middle class workers would accelerate, say, the microprocessor research leading to better phones. Seriously? You don't see how more money in the hands of poor people and middle class people wouldn't accelerate a luxury commodity market? You don't see how more and more people would buy more expensive phones rather than the bare necessities if they had the means? I'm not talking exclusively about the middle class, btw, but also about the poor. In fact the mobile phone market is a great example of this, because it's a product that people only tend to have one of. Even the richest people aren't going to consume that many, as long as they have the newest, best phones. The richest 10% is not enough to make up for the rest of the market who own used or outdated phones. Wealth redistribution would almost certainly ensure a boom in the phone market, since they'd be able to afford to upgrade their phones more often, and buy the better models when they do come out. >I also don't see how we are at a point in resource distribution that only the rich can afford things. As far as I can tell, poor people have a tremendous amount of wealth compared to the poor of 500 years ago or even 100 years ago. For 100-500 years, you're probably right. But I'm not talking about the last 100 years, I'm talking about the last 30-40 or so. Every statistic I've seen indicates that the middle class and poor's purchasing power has stagnated severely while the rich have continued to rise, and it's put enormous economic strain on the middle and lower classes. >What would a ""stronger economy"" do? Use more fuel? Produce more knicknacks for consumers to waste money on? Provide better quality of life for its citizens. That's the whole point of the economy. Right now it's not doing that, it's broken. That's why we need to fix it."
