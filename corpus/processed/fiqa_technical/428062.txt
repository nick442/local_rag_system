"No he wont. He is a very good business man and has been since he split from top rank circa 2006. Like most fighters, before 2006, he fought under a promo company, Top Rank. He would get his guaranteed purse for fights and that was that. Instead of taking an $8M payday, he decided to cut out the middle man (Bob Arum) and bought out his contract for ~$750K and decided to promote the fights himself (Mayweather promotions). Instead of just getting his purse, he now got a cut of every revenue stream involved in a fight (PPV, Tickets, broadcasting rights, etc.). After this, he ""Co-promoted"" fights with Golden Boy since they had a license. He would still retain control and get his cut, but then he got his promoters license and stopped co-promoting entirely leaving himself with an even bigger cut. He has a stable of fighters who fight regularly and he gets revenue from that, he has a strip club, a clothing line, music stuff, marketing/brand firm, and of course a crap ton of real estate. I heard he will be opening up a marijuana dispensary soon. He will have more than enough money to last a life time even at the rate he spends it. Edit - Now Pacquiao is a guy who will be broke very soon, or already is. He fought a no-named boxer with like 17 fights under his belt this past June in Australia (and he lost) to little fan fare."
