I would speak to your employer about direct deposit into one of your local casinos. Its a simple matter of then arranging to purchase said lottery tickets with the casino's chips. For a small convenience fee, I would imagine you could also arrange to have the casino automatically convert the chips to lottery tickets, redeem the winning tickets for you and give you a weekly report of your winnings. Hope this helps.
