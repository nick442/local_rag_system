Yes really. It has been a while, but I believe most of the premium burgers at McD are more than $4.50 without fries and drink locally. Some of the places I put above them could be called greasy spoons. But their buns are better quality and less sugared, the meat is better quality and not overly salted and peppered, they didn't drop a tablespoon of mayo on the poor bun, tomatoes and onions are fresher, the lettuce is closer to green than white. I don't think their burgers are truly bad, just that even the premium burgers are completely unremarkable.
