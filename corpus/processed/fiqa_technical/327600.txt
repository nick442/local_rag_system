I recommend opening a UTMA investment account with any of the major discount brokerage firms (Schwab, Fidelity, etc) and making regular deposits into an index or target fund. Have the statements sent to your niece's address so she can see the growth over time. The custodian of the account will have control until she turns 18 or 21, then she will have full use of the money. You have other options (like a 529 account), but those come with restrictions on how the money can be spent.
