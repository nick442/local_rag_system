Im gonna make up some numbers for this teaching moment. 2011: $60,000 2012: $50,000 2013: $100,000 2014: $70,000 2015: $60,000 2016: $75,000 2017: $90,000 2017 is the highest number since 2013. But before we had 2017 data, we only had up to 2016 data. In 2016, 2016 was the highest number since 2013. We couldn't say the same about 2015 though. In 2015, 2014 was the highest number since 2013. Such short timetables are kinda ridiculous to even claim. This type of number is only meaningful if its a big number of years like biggest deficit since 1953 (60ish years ago)
