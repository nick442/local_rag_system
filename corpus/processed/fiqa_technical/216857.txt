Even here, the government can do simple laws to eliminate this: require to report any work done for the organization outside the country and tax it. Why it has not been done until now is, **AS YOU CAN SEE**, the government care more about business saving money rather than protecting the middle-class. **You can also tax robots!!** That's not done either.
