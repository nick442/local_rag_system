">When you work, you are creating value. This is incorrect. Not all businesses add value to society - there's a reason capitalism function based on ""profit"" and ""loss"" signals.

This is the reason that hedge fund managers and CEOs pay so little in taxes..most of their compensation is in stocks and bonds, taxed as investment income. If you were paid in gold, i'm sure you could claim the same. Because investments are fundamentally different from money. They each serve a purpose - money is a store of value, while investments are risk-taking strategies to increase value. >That's sillie: i'm emotionally invested in a gift economy. I accept a fiat paper standard. You appear to be afraid of what would happen if people were allowed to voluntarily choose what money to use, without government interference. Anyway, I've lost interest in this discussion. Have a good day."
