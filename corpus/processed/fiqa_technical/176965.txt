I am a little sympathetic to that point in some relatively rare cases, but it definitely does not stand for regional flights that are only like 1-2hrs, which account for much of govt/business air travel. Most people are still capable of leading a high-quality meeting or presentation after 1.5 hrs in coach. For longer flights, they could fly coach the day before and then spend a night in a hotel, which is often both cheaper and more refreshing than business class direct to the meeting.
