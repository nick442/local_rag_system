Amazon has their amazon fresh project going on in Seattle for the last few years and it's pretty awesome if you don't care about saving money (food is more expensive, not on sale, no coupons, no loyalty card program, etc.). Not sure if they rolled it out into other cities yet but this will give them the ability to roll out into any areas that already have a whole foods and give them an already in place supply chain. They will also be able to sell all the whole foods brands though amazon specifically the vitamins / supplements which is a massive money maker for the company. [2016 annual report from whole foods](http://s21.q4cdn.com/118642233/files/doc_financials/2016/Annual/2016-WFM-Annual-Report.pdf) * 431 stores, 17,800,00 square feet of store space. * total sales of $15.7 billion.
