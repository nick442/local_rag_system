"I think you hit the nail on the head. If the stock price is sky high, all else being equal (again this is put off as an ordinary assumption, but is a pretty damn big one.. as you can't even just look at PE to help, as there might be a high growth rate etc/other circumstances.. but I digress), you would be better off issuing stock. As the stock price goes lower, (aebe) it becomes less attractive to issue equity. Even if you have a case in 2, it might make sense to go for 1, and then potentially issue debt in the future to fund a buyback (when the stock is lower). But this is all dependant on what the company thinks it will be willing to do. One of the major considerations would be the tax situation, as equity is ""after tax"", and debt is ""before tax"", as they say."
