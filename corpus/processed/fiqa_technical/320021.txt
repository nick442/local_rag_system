Sorry if I came of harsh, I've spent the last few years starting small businesses, and that's the most consistent message I've come across. Ideas don't get bought. I know your research seems valuable to you, but these companies likely pay $3-10-50k for massive research studies that come in the form of custom written books. Your work has to be unique, thorough, and well presented on a level that can compare to be valuable to them. It would be far easier to sell them an existing client base, a phenomenal team, or better yet, defensible IP.
