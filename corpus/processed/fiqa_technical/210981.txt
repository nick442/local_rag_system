You have to go deeper into smaller subs. The big subs have a majority of simpletons and biased hippy views. Most think they are astute when they aren't very educated with the matter. It's unbelievable. I was recently down voted to oblivion with the correct comment and the other person was upvoted to prominence with the wrong comment, but it's similar to the hive mentality. It's cool though because it clearly proves a giant point. That point is you do have an edge over the general market.
