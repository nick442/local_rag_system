Here's another thing to consider: do you go to a top school? If not, do you have top grades and the desire to send thousands of cold networking emails to strangers? If not (and, in this economy, even if you do fulfill those criteria), it will be difficult to break into fields like investment banking and sales and trading, which are typically the most desired destinations in finance after college. Those jobs can lead to a very financially remunerative career in that you can leave after 2 years and work at hedge funds and private equity firms. However, very few people can get to that point. If you're good at CS, you could actually make a lot more money going that route. Or you could also do a programming job for a financial institution like someone in the comments was talking about, which would likely pay well.
