"I think you underestimate the power politics and favoratism play in teacher ratings and the impact of local school systems. Until/unless the us moves to a national system then the notion of ""good"" and ""bad"" teachers is entirely up to the officials who oversee the teacher and thus more a matter of politics than any sort of absolute rating. Indeed I'd suggest a quantiative rating is not only infeasible but impossible."
