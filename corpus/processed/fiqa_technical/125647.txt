"Can you show me evidence to support the claim that this website is ""checked by multiple sources"" and ""maintained by media reviewers""? Also how is ""it rings true"" anything other than saying it's true because it confirms what I already believe? From the methodology section of his website: > **Disclaimer**: The methodology used by Media Bias Fact Check is our own. It is not a tested scientific method. It is meant as a simple guide for people to get an idea of a sourceâ€™s bias. > MBFC News was founded by Dave Van Zandt in 2015. Dave studied Communications in college and over the years has focused on personal research in media bias and the role of media in politics. His expertise is that he studied communications in college. Communications is a required course in most colleges, giving anyone who attended college for one semester the same level of expertise in that field as him, including me. Let's see who his contributors are: Dennis Kelly - Professor of Religious Studies Dr. Michael Allen - Professor of systematic theology Faith Locke Siewart - Photographer Aaron O'Leary - middle school teacher According to the website itself. None of the content creators on the website have any history or expertise in media, communications, media research or any relevant field. Also, they admit in the disclaimer that their methodology is not a tested scientific method, which means it isnt a methodology at all, and it isn't subject to peer-review or fact-checking like you claimed. The only evidence for the legitimacy of this website, is that it confirms what people already believe. You can't get mad about being called fake news when you're essentially using some dudes blog as a source."
