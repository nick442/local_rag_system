"In this environment, I don't think that it is advisable to buy a broad emerging market fund. Why? ""Emerging market"" is too broad.. Look at the top 10 holdings of the fund.. You're exposed to Russia & Brazil (oil driven), Chinese and Latin American banks and Asian electronics manufacturing. Those are sectors that don't correlate, in economies that are unstable -- a recipie for trouble unless you think that the global economy is heading way up. I would recommend focusing on the sectors that you are interested in (ie oil, electronics, etc) via a low cost vehicle like an index ETF or invest using a actively managed emerging markets fund with a strategy that you understand. Don't invest a dime unless you understand what you are getting into. An index fund is just sorting companies by market cap. But.. What does market cap mean when you are buying a Chinese bank?"
