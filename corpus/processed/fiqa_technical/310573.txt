Having a flimsy, 9 digit number with no validation that you didn't opt out of yet, did you? Because you can, just ask the Aumish. If you think a national ID would be the start of the government knowing everything you do, you're sorely mistaken. The TSA already knows where you've flown. The IRS knows where you live and have lived. Oh, and your iPhone/ Android knows everywhere you've ever been since you first bought it, which is readily available via subpoena. Whatever it is, your privacy was just violated far worse because of the lack of proper, nationally recognized, ID.
