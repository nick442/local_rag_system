"The fact is that the annual debt expenses to annual revenue is the key figure at any point in time (as well as a model of how these change dynamically). Since optimal annual tax revenue is roughly proportional to GDP and since annual debt expenses are proportional (a function of yield and changes over time) to debt level .. the debt/GDP ratio has been used for a long time as a reasonable yardstick. > Also, keep in mind that by borrowing in it's sovereign currency, the US has an enormous amount of monetary tools to handle the debt if it ever became a problem. Most of those tricks come with increased yields (the ""currency risk"" portion of the yield on sovereign debt) .. and, so, don't actually help in the case of a death spiral. Ask Brazil or dozens of other countries. That thinking is also part of why LTCM failed (LTCM assumed Russia would print money to pay off debt instead of defaulting). [Also note that the only reason Greece short-sightedly increased their debt was because, for once, the ""currency risk"" component was small. Thus, while their debt expense / income level was reasonable with low yields .. as their debt/GDP increased, their yields increased to reflect the greater sovereign default risk. It's why debt/GDP would have been a *better* measure for Greece that a flow based measure.] IMO, the only reason the US isn't already in deep shit .. is because the US dollar is the de facto reserve currency. This is probably keeping the US yields 50bp-100bp lower than they would otherwise be (.. in which case our debt payments would be closer to 20% of government revenue)."
