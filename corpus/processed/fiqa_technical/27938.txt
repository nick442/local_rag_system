Is it an unattractive offer many buyers would shy away from? Buyer who have specific plan may skip getting into such deals as this would be an hindrance to resell the business. Others who are not sure, may buy it for to make money in future. Does it seem like a justifiably fair way to sell a domain, while keeping a stake in it? This is preview of individual opinion. There is nothing fair or unfair in such deals. Is this even done, or has this ever been done before? Possibly. I don't know. Other Aspects: Although this may appear as a good way to cash in on upside, it is not always easy. If magic goes to court and establishes that you were a squatter just to make windfall without any plan, the contract becomes void. If the other party some how manages to make say 1 billion from this site, they would have enough lawyers and accountants to structure the business. So they way it would quickly get restructured is ABC Inc will buy Magic from you with the contract. ABC will give this on lease to XYZ for a consideration of $100 per year as usage. XYZ will make 1 billion. So your share is limited only on $100 royalty paid to ABC.
