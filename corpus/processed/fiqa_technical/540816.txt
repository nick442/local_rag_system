"Price is decided by what shares are offered at what prices and who blinks first. The buyer and seller are both trying to find the best offer, for their definition of best, within the constraints then have set on their bid or ask. The seller will sell to the highest bid they can get that they consider acceptable. The buyer will buy from the lowest offer they can get that they consider acceptable. The price -- and whether a sale/purchase happens at all -- depends on what other trades are still available and how long you're willing to wait for one you're happy with, and may be different on one share than another ""at the same time"" if the purchase couldn't be completed with the single best offer and had to buy from multiple offers. This may have been easier to understand in the days of open outcry pit trading, when you could see just how chaotic the process is.. but it all boils down to a high-speed version of seeking the best deal in an old-fashioned marketplace where no prices are fixed and every sale requires (or at least offers the opportunity for) negotiation. ""Fred sells it five cents cheaper!"" ""Then why aren't you buying from him?"" ""He's out of stock."" ""Well, when I don't have any, my price is ten cents cheaper."" ""Maybe I won't buy today, or I'll buy elsewhere. ""Maybe I won't sell today. Or maybe someone else will pay my price. Sam looks interested.."" ""Ok, ok. I can offer two cents more."" ""Three. Sam looks really interested."" ""Two and a half, and throw in an apple for Susie."" ""Done."" And the next buyer or seller starts the whole process over again. Open outcry really is just a way of trying to shop around very, very, very fast, and electronic reconciliation speeds it up even more, but it's conceptually the same process -- either seller gets what they're asking, or they adjust and/or the buyer adjusts until they meet, or everyone agrees that there's no agreement and goes home."
