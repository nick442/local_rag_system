"**Betteridge's law of headlines** Betteridge's law of headlines is one name for an adage that states: ""Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist, although the principle is much older. As with similar ""laws"" (e.g., Murphy's law), it is intended as a humorous adage rather than the literal truth. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.23"
