The customers were punishing local businesses. Impotent rage toward anyone they could find. It was canceled orders and political lectures to anyone that could hear. I assume they were no longer going to participate in a Democrat's economy. The owner didn't ever discuss politics or say or do anything to make waves. The girls that sold the jewelry were just smart enough to put on makeup and smile. There was nothing political about the place. It was just the day after election day.
