I've often thought that would be a great idea for pensions here in the states, specifically municipal pensions. Like a particular town could invest a small portion of it's money into local businesses and real estate. That would benefit the local economy and incentivize pensioners and workers to patronize those businesses. Does anyone know if this is done anywhere?
