Yes, you're right, both sides should be considered, however I have a gut feeling that although Amazon has created opportunities for some people to sell on their platform, it has taken far more opportunities away from other people. Amazon runs $136 **billion** of gross revenue through their system. Those are sales that would have been made somewhere else if not through Amazon. Now a lot of those dollars likely came from other large retailers - Wal-mart, Costco, Home Depot, etc. Let's pretend that they did not though. Let's say that you want to own a bookstore and you want to earn about $40k per year. Let's say that you can expect a 10% margin. That would mean that you would have to sell $400k worth of goods to make your money. Amazon runs the equivalent of 340,000 such stores through their site ($136 billion / $400,000). So those are 340,000 opportunities for people to earn $40k per year from a retail store. Of course it's not that simple, and as I mentioned, a lot of Amazon's sales came from larger stores, but I wanted to map it out that way to illustrate that Amazon very likely takes away far more opportunities than it creates (it had about $13 billion in profits in 2016 - those are profits that didn't go to small business owners).
