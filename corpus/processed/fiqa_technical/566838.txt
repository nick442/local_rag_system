It's got nothing to do with whether or not it's true or painful. It's about intelligence, or more accurately, the lack thereof. Your comment was incredibly stupid and showed all the wisdom and maturity of a middle-school student on the short bus. It was so stupid that my stupid-ometer broke trying to measure it. How do you even manage to tie your shoes in the morning, you fucking idiot?
