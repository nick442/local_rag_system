"In other amazing news, people don't pay attention to things they don't care about. Want to make sure people pay attention during meetings? Ensure the people in attendance actually have a good reason to care about the subject matter, have a say in it, and then keep it focused and short. Most meetings don't follow these guidelines, and far too many of them are largely just chances for a few people to herd a lot of people into a room so they can feel self-important while talking. When planning a meeting, first ask yourself if you couldn't simply write an email or publish a document that covers the same material. If the answer is no, then ask yourself who _really_ needs to be in the meeting to give input, and who can be given a summary & chance to ask a few questions after the fact and do just as well as if they'd attended. I can't count the number of ""important"" mandatory meetings I've taken part in where my biggest contribution was simply checking in in the first place. Without fail, every one of them could've been handled without me there, summarized in a brief email, and would have left dozens of man-hours of labor unwasted."
