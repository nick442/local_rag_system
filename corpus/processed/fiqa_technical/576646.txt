Marketplace was my jams. Listened every day for years. until the whole hating on Trump thing began to consume Kai Ryssdal and the whole APM Marketplace team. Even Molly Wood! It became hard to trust a team so heavily biased and distracted so I unsubscribed and am hoping for a return when they're back to doing what they used to.
