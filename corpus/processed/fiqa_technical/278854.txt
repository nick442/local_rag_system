While the tone of the article isn't the best or the most informative the general premise of bid-rigging and collusion is still a problem and wait till all the swaps/derivatives come to light that were sold to european municipalities also uncompetively and collusively (if the europeans have balls to press charges). A lot of the products were offered with clauses that disallowed the muni's to check the market prices and some had even collusion (I will dig up the link when I find it).
