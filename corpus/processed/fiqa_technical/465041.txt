"Is there any particular area of business that you have interest? What free resources do you currently use (general web browsing)? Here are some magazines out there that I find interesting: * **Fast Company** - $12.99 / Year / 10 Issues - Magazine focused on tech, innovation, leadership and design. I don't subscribe, but I regularly purchase Fast Company, Entrepreneur,and Inc. when I am traveling. They make for a perfect airplane read and I typically find great takeaways or clip articles from it. * **Entrepreneur** - $11.97 / Year / 12 Issues - Obviously by the title this is catered to the entrepreneurial mindset. It provides informational and inspirational stories from entrepreneurs and for entrepreneurs. I enjoy reading this and probably read 3 or 4 issues per year. I'm not a regular reader, but at times I have felt like content may run lean at times. * **Inc** - $12.99 / Year / 10 Issues - Inc. feels like a blend of Fast Company and Entrepreneur. The articles are aimed at the business owner for starting and running operations. * **Businessweek** - $5 / Year / 12 Issues - I regularly read Businessweek, but primarily on their website. I have picked up issues occasionally which are great, but their web provides a fair amount of access. They seem to have a nice blend of news and unique stories about specific companies, products, and investment. Recently they had interesting articles with fair depth on the CEO of Burger King, and the history of Sriracha. * **Forbes** - $24.99 / Year / 26 Issues - I love the volume of content that Forbes provides and they seem to have a nice mix on a variety of subjects. I use Forbes as my frontpage of the internet for business in conjunction with several others. I actually feel like Forbes and Businessweek provide a perfect blend of business news with shocking little redundancy. * **Harvard Business Review** - Wasn't able to quickly see a price. I reference HBR a fair amount in regards to business discussions and think they provide excellent research material and information. The writing style and layout isn't quite as captivating as some of the other magazines such as Fast Company, but the quality is excellent, * **WSJ** - Obviously putting out a high volume of content, but you definitely pay for it. I know a fair number of people who read it, but I actually have never known anyone to subscribe to it if that makes sense. All the readers I know either receive a subscription through their work or university. I think that shows the content is valuable and quality, but it might not justify the cost you have to pay for it as an individual reader. I use a variety of websites to get business news, general education, and help me overall to understand the business world. Specifically from the ones listed above I check Businessweek and Forbes daily for morning or lunch reading. Forbes in particular does a solid job due to all of their external content contributors. Seems like an interesting way to provide content if you can curate it correctly. If you're more interested in the finance/investment world then I think Yahoo Finance and CNN Money are great. Focusing specifically on investments then I really enjoy the content I get from Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha. Some articles get pretty deep in regards to finance and investing, but overall I think they give great insight. I read BusinessInsider, but I'll be honest I feel dirty. Sometimes I find an interesting piece that leads me elsewhere to research more. The content is primarily distributed in a ""Buzzfeed"" style format which has some questionable headlines and less professional content (""7 Crazy Facts That Sound Fake But Are Actually True""). In Summary, I think you could learn a good amount on a variety of topics while staying plugged into news and developments in the business world for free. I'm sure a few other people will chime in with other great sources that I didn't capture and some that I didn't even know existed. I would start by reading a few of these sites I listed regularly and continue posting in this sub to help us keep the conversation going!"
