"Actually I think the TL;DR is ""Don't rush to fill a position out of desperation, wait for someone who's the right fit. Hiring the wrong person quickly is way more costly than waiting."" It is a click-baity title, but I think the most glaring offense for me is actually the idea that they're glorifying someone who's personally interviewed every person at the company, which incidentally is only 70 people. For as many people out there that think this is an amazing feat of entrepreneurism - really getting in there with his hands on even the fine grained details - you can find just as many people who will think this is quaint and know it won't scale. When he's at 500 or 1000 employees is his time really best spent doing this? I actually think the diversity you'd get by allowing a team freedom to hire after a certain point would be more beneficial provided they have a grasp on corporate culture."
