I just passed my 7 with a 90%. I used Training Consultant as main source and supplemented with Kaplan Qbank. Personally, i think the Qbank is outstanding, it pretty much covered everything that you will see on the test. I would recommend to fully utilize the Qbank and try to get your average score to around 80%. The kaplan material is slightly harder than the actual test, so you can expect your real score to be around 5-7% higher than what you get doing Kaplan exams. Good luck!
