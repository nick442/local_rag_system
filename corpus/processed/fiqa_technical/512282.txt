You can't just emigrate from a country like Pakistan to the USA, Canada or Australia; they will refuse you entry to their country. E.g. for the USA, even if you're are skilled enough that an American company will hire you (which is obviously the first step â€“ so called 'economic refugees' are sent back immediately), you're a long way from obtaining a green card. Right now, Pakistan isn't even allowed to participate in the Green Card Lottery. What you also need to consider is that the cost of living in those countries is a lot higher. There are websites, like this one which allows you to compare them between cities all over the world. So while you would earn a lot more money, you also need to spend a lot more.
