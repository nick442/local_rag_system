MBA here. I had a relatively well-paying job with great benefits and tuition reimbursement. I ended up leaving it for a much lower-paying job though. Why did I do that? I was miserable. The job was to do only as I was told. Also, they changed my project scope to something completely different after 4 months. I also was in a terrible city with no friends. I hated my job and eventually I hated my life. I've since moved back to where I went to college. I hate that business publications talk about MBA's like we're all mindless robots looking for the highest paycheck at Goldman Sachs. I'll gladly take friends, a better location, and a comfortable salary over anything else.
