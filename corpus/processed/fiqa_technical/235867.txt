Ah. So if you don't work hard and don't succeed it's because society failed to scoop you up and give you a helping hand. If you do work hard and succeed you're a workaholic. Since I finished school I dropped 55 pounds and spend about six hours a week doing vigorous physical exercise. Statistically, if anything is going to kill me it's probably going to be a car accident on the way to work.
