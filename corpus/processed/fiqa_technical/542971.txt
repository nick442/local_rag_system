For the record I am not the one that downvoted you because you raise a decent point/opinion. However, you should consider the impact this has on the rest of us. Many employers have already said that they are not hiring people because of concerns on what the ruling means for them. That could have been a ploy to pressure politicians to back down from it. However, that probably wouldn't explain everything. They are going to paying more for insurance when hiring no doubt. That isn't good when we are already having a hard time getting them back to work. So I wouldn't write off capitalists concerns so easily. Secondly, they aren't going to be able externalize it anymore than before unless they are forced to pay for part-time workers and others previously exempt. I didn't read enough on this to know one way or the other. However, if workers aren't getting anymore coverage from their employers then the added cost (higher premiums) wouldn't mean much for any of us. Actually they would still be externalizing the cost. Instead of the government picking up the bill it would be Americans who aren't getting insurance from the employer who are forced to pay for the penalty.
