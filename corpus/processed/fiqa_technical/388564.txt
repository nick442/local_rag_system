Ok. So mum and dad is the government and the child is the citizen? Or is it that mum and dad is the past and the child is the actual government? Our problem is that we managed our real estate so well that we never got a recession on it since the 1990s. That and immigrants only wants to live in the VA area or GTA. The rest of the country is fine. I live in Montreal and you can rent a nice apartment for less then 1k a month 20 mins from downtown and a house is still 400-600k.
