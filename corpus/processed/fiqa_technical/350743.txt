It is, but most people don't have the need or the ability to attend a private school. There's a good, cheap option in plenty of states. Many of them also have a tuition assistance program available if you keep good grades. I'm only familiar with a handful, but look at UC, UGA, Auburn or Alabama, UF, FSU, USC, UC Boulder, Texas, Texas A&M.. I'd wager that most states have a great option for the average person, and it's sometimes the best in the world -- look at Berkley for many hard sciences or Auburn for their veterinarian program. Sure, if you want to be a doctor, lawyer, veteranarian, investment banker, or chase some other professional career you might want to attend one of the top universities to make the right connections, but if those are serious considerations for you in high school your family probably already has the money to be able to afford that.
