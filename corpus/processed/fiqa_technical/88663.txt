"Except that Shamu is the Sea World brand. This is like if for some reason people got angry about Mickey Mouse, would Disney surrender that icon? Sea World has been built on Shamu, and Sea World executives will estimate that were it not for the orca shows, their park would see massively reduced attendance anyway. They may have hard numbers, they may not, but if they see their attendance shrinking less than they think it would shrink were the shows not there, then they won't do it. The idea of ""we'll be the good guys then"" won't sit well with executives, because they can't quantify it - will they be the good guys, or won't they? They've already made an enemy out of the animal rights people, they may think the animal rights people will just want more out of them after getting some concessions, so they're going to dig in and not even start the concessions. They may be destroying themselves, or maybe their business model is just being destroyed by moving technology and social progressions. Bullfighting-ring owners had to deal with it in Spain, Sea World has to deal with it here. Sorry, sometimes this happens to a business."
