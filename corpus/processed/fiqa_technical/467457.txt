Mayweather is the promoter so he pays himself and doesn't rely on win/lose bonuses. Every single aspect of the fight he makes money on from the ticket, PPV, merch, even concessions sales. Mayweather's purse is expected to be at least $100 million, and will be the same win or lose. His earning power for future fights mike take a hit in the extremely unlikely scenario that he loses.
