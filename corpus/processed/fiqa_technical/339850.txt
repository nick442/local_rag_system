Now I've heard the word is that Netflix plan being split was so Netflix could keep streaming HBO and Starz content. Once the online content got so popular that people where no longer using HBO or Starz streaming programs or actually paying to see the channel. By splitting the service it brought them back down in numbers streaming to keep that content online. Did it upset people? Yes. But I'm a lot happier having my content then nothing at all. As for quickster? That was just stupid. Keep it all under netflix, and keep offering both sides of the stuff.
