He was sure upset. From his point of view the government is the end all for everyone. I just can't agree with his implied supposition that the government is totally responsible for Burger Kings success, and therefore they should be ashamed that they don't want to pay more in taxes. There has got to be a compromise on corporate taxes that would prevent such moves in the future. Although Mr. Moyer would probably prefer a state-run Burger King with the courtesy and efficiency of our beloved TSA or IRS.
