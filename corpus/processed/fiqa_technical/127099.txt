No they invest in growth so immensely that they eat up all their profits. When you hear about Amazon buying their own planes and starting their own delivery and drones and buying Whole Foods, etc. All of those things cost money. Money that Amazon is making. But they are spending almost all of it. Therefore showing little profit. For years investors didn’t understand Bezos style and they expected earlier returns and year after year he didn’t deliver But year after year the company grew and so did its revenue. Not a ton has changed although they are more profitable today for sure.
