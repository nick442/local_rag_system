"You've got a 3.9 GPA, numerous awards, and your dream internship is at an insurance company? On top of that, one small and narrow minded enough to impose it's political and religious ideals on its employees?!? What useful information are you hoping to take from this ""dream"" internship? How to pretend to be someone else? To fulfill your grand aspirations to sell insurance? Sorry, I know you came here looking for interview advice, but I'm not going to blow sunshine up your ass. I'd be wary of any company that touts it's conservative ideals as a condition of continued employment, but it's especially ridiculous to work in the insurance industry. It's entirely unsurprising you got an interview after only 6 hours. You're wholly over qualified, find something better."
