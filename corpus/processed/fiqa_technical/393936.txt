Umm no. 2.14 B Shares outstanding.. First day had a peak to low of (41.68-38.27) of 3.41. Unless UBS got over 100M shares and roundtriped them 200m of volume. This number is not possible as FB had 580,587,742 of total volume. It's highly unrealistic that UBS accounted for about 35% of volume in one day. UBS would have to have longed a large holding in FB for some time to have lost this much.
