If he has the budget to get a vehicle wrap, I suggest it. I currently work for a company that does them and they're a billboard on wheels. My boss has gotten tons of business from his vehicle alone. The wrap paid for itself ten fold. Edit: I just now clicked the truck photos. Dude, wrap that whole thing if you can. Seriously. A good wrap will pay for itself in no time at all. When the truck isn't being driven, leave it somewhere viewable on a main road.
