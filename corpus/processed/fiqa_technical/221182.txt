Just skimmed the article, but any mention of Uber/Lyft's role in this? I've gotten so many rides in relatively newish Chrystler 200s , and always wondered why anyone would every buy one since it's consistently ranked last in the mid-priced sedan market in almost every metric. My gut feeling when I read the headline is all those Uber/Lyft drivers who bought a brand new car to start driving left and ending up having to default on the car.
