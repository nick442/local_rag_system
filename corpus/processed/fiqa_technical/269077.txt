It is called trailing interest, and you can read about it [here](http://www.extracreditcards.com/trailing-interest/). edit: IIRC, the argument is that resulting total interest charges are lower for the customer calculating the interest this was as apposed to whatever the alternative is. The sneakiness is that you don't expect to owe another $1.50 on the next statement, neglect to remit the payment on it, and boom, late fee. I used to encourage my clients to overpay their account when trying to achieve a payoff.
