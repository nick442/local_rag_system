You can pay a lot in that store, but there are very reasonable prices. If you cherry pick sale items TJ's is no more expensive than any other store. Who knows the sales better than the employees? Also, grabbing a few things after work without making another stop is very convenient. Throw in the employee discount and those are definitely good enough reasons for employees to shop at their store.
