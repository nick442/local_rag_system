It's the RT that I think they are referencing in this article. Was a total clusterfuck and waste of money. Was over priced, heavily underpowered, and wasn't what people thought of when they consider buying a Microsoft product (wide ranging compatibility). The pro is a viable product line still. It has a different market than standard tablets and has a whole lit more potential functionality. Its a good product that fills several niche markets. It won't make Microsoft nearly as much as apple makes on their iPad line of products, but it provides a good foundation for Microsoft to rebrand itself.
