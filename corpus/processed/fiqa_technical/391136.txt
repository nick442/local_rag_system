Actually I'm pretty sure the final round she is refering to is a superday which is definitely the most difficult of all the rounds and is the one that tests actual intelligence at the job the most. Even giving her credit for that though, I do agree with you that she seemed impressed by something substandard. However, I would just be cautious in ruling someone out just because a few of their numbers are off.
