I operate machinery and drive for work but if I was drug tested I would fail.. Yet I am not stoned at work. Am I more dangerous than my Co worker who comes in hung over everyday still smelling like booze. I get stoned at night, eat some Cheetos and go to bed. Why is what I do in my spare time a concern. Marijuana stays in your system for like 30 days, just because you test positive doesn't mean you are stoned.
