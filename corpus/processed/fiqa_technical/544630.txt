"Designed by Apple in California, manufactured in China. At this point in time Apple has more employees in the US than in the past. They never really moved jobs overseas, mostly they just spun up work overseas because that's where all of the components of the supply chain were. When you say ""hey.. I want to start cranking out devices. I need to know how fast you can turn if there's a design change late in the pre-production stage"" and the best answers you get are from makers in China, that's where your work goes."
