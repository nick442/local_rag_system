If you don't want to employer a smoker, that's fine. It's pretty common in my secondary line of work to not even employee cigarette smokers. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily the best policy for all jobs, or that it should be a default policy without further examination. I'm judging this based on time spent working in call centers when I was younger and going to school. I was in workforce development at the place I have in mind, so part of my job was tracking productivity. They tried so hard to screen for marijuana, but still failed pretty hard, but ended up with so many people who were addicted to opiates and/or using meth. Ideally, the perfect work force would be totally drug free, have no medical or mental health conditions, and all have experience and intelligence. But in a metro area that ranks in the bottom 10 for educational achievement, and where $10-12 an hour is considered good pay, that's not what they're going to get.
