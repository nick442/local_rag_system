I'm confused - I don't see your original post, and I wasn't referring to you in my post, so your answer is confusing. But I know student housing often sucks; my son just finished 4 years of living in student apts. But i also know the student tenants often suck, too. I would have hated to own the apt I rented in college, and have tenants like my friends and I. And some of my son's friends were total tenants from hell who cared not a bit what they did to the place.
