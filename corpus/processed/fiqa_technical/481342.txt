">The problem the C suite is now realizing is this: I don't think they fully realize it.. not yet. They might be *beginning* to get the tiniest bit of a clue. >Once the baby boomers leave, that ""shortage"" will drive up prices/wages for those with the necessary skills. It always happens when there is a labor shortage (revisit the .com boom of the late 90's). The thing is, what will REALLY increase is the cost of labor ""serving"" the demographic bulge of retired/dying boomers. Nursing Home Attendant: *""Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Baby Boomer, you want your bedpan cleaned TWICE a day? My, my you must be made of money, because that'll be an additional $100k a year -- 3 months in advance of course. And you say you want a sponge bath EVERY WEEK and not just once a month? Well, that'll be an extra $50k a year.. again, paid in advance of course. (Oh, and as a hint -- if you want them to do a good job and be nice to you while they bather you -- well, it's always a good idea to slip your sponge bath nurse a $100 tip each time; otherwise, they can be a bit crude & rough you know; it's just so hard to find and keep good employees these days.)""*"
