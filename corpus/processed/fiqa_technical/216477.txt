It's interesting to think about but there are only two huge franchises that Disney doesn't own, that could be used for instantly recognizable content in every age group. Harry Potter, and Nintendo. It would be interesting to see if Netflix or Amazon makes a bid for one of these companies just as a pure blocking play to Disney.
