> How would you value a bond? Very basic approach is TVM. This should have been taught in your first year accounting class. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money > How do you value an option? Using the Blackâ€“Scholes options pricing model. BS opt pricing model is one (typically the entry level for teaching option pricing) stochastic model you can use. It has limitations due to certain assumptions made (such as constant vol) but you're correct, you can value an option with it. > How would you construct a yield curve? Draw a graph with maturity on the X-axis and yield on the Y-axis. So that's how to draw an xy plane.. yes you're correct. That doesn't answer how to actually create a yield curve. The most simplest approach of creating one is to bootstrap the curve using the spot and forwards.
