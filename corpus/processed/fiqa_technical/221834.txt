"It's in the last paragraph after the video. Frankly the whole article is less than objective. That's cool, I guess, they're entitled, but I only thought it silly to assert that McDonalds didn't succeed because the food is shit. It's been shit for decades. EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS. I lived in Northern Spain in the nineties when my particular area got its first McDonalds. Since I was the only American most people knew, we all went there for its inauguration, a little mini-event to have fun. They pitted their Basque food against this McDonald's thing that was supposed to be so good. I chuckled internally, because there is NO comparison. McDonalds vs. a chuleta served during cider season or even a hamburger you make in your house? Comeon. So anyway we all order Big Macs and afterward they all said in disgust, ""That was shit. Why do you people eat this shit?"" Haha. I told you it was shit. Why do Americans eat it? Right of passage for young males? I don't know really. Anyway, they all expressed their universal scorn, but the place was booming and continued to boom. Sometimes people just like foreign different stuff once in a while, I guess."
