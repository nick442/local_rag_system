Yes I certainly enjoy Perry Mason , also Colombo . Also NCIS and Burn Notice , and not forgetting a lot of the oldies - Miami Vice , Hart to Hart , Maverick .. . I certainly wouldn't mind revisiting quite a lot of the old detective shows . There is also the science fiction - Battlestar Galactica , V , Alien Nation - all the original series . And then there is all the UK series - Only Fools & Horses , A Touch of Frost , Wycliffe , Last of the Summer Wine , Dads Army , The Professionals , Foyle's War etc . However these can be obtained on DVD - hence why bother with TV ?! - except for the expense .
