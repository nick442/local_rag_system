I mean, I've made perhaps 2000% on them simply buying low (whenever I remembered bitcoin existed and saw that it was only a few hundred USD) and then selling when the news reminded me again that it existed and was hitting 1k. Which is where I dropped ship this last time too, unfortunately. Also, unfortunately I never bought more than a few coins and didn't go into Ethereum at the beginning of the year, thinking it was dead. Still enough to pay for some vacationing. Basically everyone I know has had the same experience with them - so 295% seems really low.
