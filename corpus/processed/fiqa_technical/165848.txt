From what I hear, usually not. Get an amortization schedule for the property, and see what the savings on the interest rate is. Then see what the interest versus borrowing less is. The consider that you can invest the buy down money, or better yet use it as down payment and borrow less money. Typically (as experienced by wife who use to be a loan processor) the buy down did not save any money, and just made the broker a bigger commission.
