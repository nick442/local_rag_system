"Its fraudulent because it is feeds on new investment to pay the old investors, the EXACT definition of a Ponzi. And it now is contingent on the faith of the US, as with most other debts. There is no ""trust fund"" of this wealth sitting waiting for us if the USA fails. But do tell me, how is SS not a ponzi scheme? Does it not use new money to pay the old? If the new money ran out, would it not default on its debts (in the future)? And what part of the constitution says the US government should collect some of my wages and save it for me for later? You do know, some people have opted out of SS? Even the US government will not take the fight to court. They know its a sham."
