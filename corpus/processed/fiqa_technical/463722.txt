"You must have missed the results of the last partial audit called by Congress. What you are linking to is the laughably incomplete audits by the GAO. Here, [**take a look at what the last ""audit the fed"" bill uncovered.**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/dec/02/us-federal-reserve-bailouts-multinationals) even after it was watered down in the Senate. >In a statement, Sanders described the revelations as ""jaw-dropping"", adding that ""based on a four-hour examination"" of the transactions, ""we have learned that the $700bn Wall Street bailout signed into law under George W Bush turned out to be pocket change compared to the trillions and trillions of dollars in near-zero interest loans and other financial arrangements the Federal Reserve doled out to every major financial institution in this country."" >The documents detail short-term loans to Goldman Sachs of nearly $600bn; nearly $2tn to Morgan Stanley; $1.8tn to Citigroup; nearly $1tn to Bear Stearns; and some $1.5tn to Merrill Lynch. > >Sanders said he found it ""most surprising"" that huge sums were used to bail out foreign banks and corporations. ""Has the Federal Reserve of the United States become the central bank of the world?"" he said. > >""I intend to investigate whether these secret Fed loans, in some cases turned out to be direct corporate welfare to big banks that used these loans not to reinvest in the economy but rather to lend back to the federal government at a higher rate of interest by purchasing treasury securities,"" he said. This isn't just Ron Paul going after the Federal Reserve to expose their corruption.. hundreds of members of Congress have co-sponsored it. Are you going to try to ridicule them too?"
