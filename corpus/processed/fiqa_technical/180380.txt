I took the BAT after my first semester of my freshman year. At the time I was winding up my microeconomics class. While I lacked the classical schooling, I've been investing for the past 3 years, so I'm pretty familiar with stocks, bonds, derivatives, and the like. I ended up scoring in the 50th percentile, which I was pleasantly surprised by. The test is a mile wide and an inch deep. The math is incredibly easy, and it's all very straight forward. What got me was the accounting. I had no accounting experience beyond just examining a very basic balance sheet from time to time.
