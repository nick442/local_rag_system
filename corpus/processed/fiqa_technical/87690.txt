Fan? Nah, I mean I own an ipod but whatever, it's just an mp3 player. More to the point, I'm just not a presumptuous prick and I try not to get all emotional about some dude who ran a company, *ONE WAY OR THE OTHER*. You're just as bad as every asshat that was writing WE LOVE YOU STEVE post it notes on apple stores, you're just the other end of that spectrum, but still just as much of a dick.
