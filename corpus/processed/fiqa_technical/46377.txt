I agree. I don't really see a good argument (not that there isn't one to be made) in the article saying how this is unusual or illegal. Why did the managers sell such a small amount of their holdings? Could they have sold more? Is this selling behavior and scheduling at all abnormal? The article fails to address a number of important questions.
