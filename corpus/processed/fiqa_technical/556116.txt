last time I checked this market the cards themselves were pretty cheap, the decision was really more about the POS system and how to tie everything into customer loyalty / marketing database etc. so, first / easiest choice, see if your POS vendor has a recommendation. Make sure you understand any tech requirements for the reader / cards but they are pretty common and simple. second, more advanced - use this as a step to get into loyalty marketing / reward cards etc.. that involves a lot more software and training but pays off.
