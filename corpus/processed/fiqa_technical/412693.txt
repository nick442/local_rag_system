Yep. It's psychological. Same thing with Amazon and shipping costs. I don't pay shipping with Amazon because I let them take a few days to get the product to me. In reality, I absolutely do pay for shipping, but it's indirectly baked into the cost of the product itself. It's great seeing the cost upfront when deciding whether or not to buy it. It sucks to see one price then get hit with a ton of BS charges when checking out.
