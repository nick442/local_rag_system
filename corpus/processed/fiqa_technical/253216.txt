BAM set up HBO GO, and they're still using a flash player.. had to enable flash in chrome to watch the GOT premier. BAMtech is bad with the front end, which spells disaster with a kids service. Even with all BAMtech resources firing on all pistons to get the service rolling it's gonna be a slow roll out. Let's not forget that Netflix came to fruition because it was easier than pirating. Different market with children, but so many are content with YouTube. I know this is a land grab, but I would be surprised if this pays off in less than five years.
