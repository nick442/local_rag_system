Applebees went to crap in the recession. Raised prices but didn't improve quality to match the restaurants that were charging those prices. Now local bars tend to be cheaper than Applebees for better food, with better drink specials. Nobody is going to Applebee's at 11pm to socialize at a tiny bar in a restaurant that is dead empty.
