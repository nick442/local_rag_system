Pick a hotel/casino and get the rewards card. I only go to the Borgata, and I have never left without having a room compd for my next visit. I go a few times a year and have only payed for a room once. Usually I get a couple hundred in match play, some slot $ and free buffets too, but the free rooms that are actually nice is why I go back.
