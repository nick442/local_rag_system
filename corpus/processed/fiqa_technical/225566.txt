When I was in Los Angeles last, it was crazy, WiMax 4G EVERYWHERE. In San Diego there was absolutely 0 WiMax. I've been on 4G maybe 10 times in over 2 years and each time reminds me how bad 3G sucks. I recommend not using 4G until you have a network in your area as it's pretty depressing to go back.
