This suggests that AlphaGo Zero may be learning a strategy that is qualitatively different to human play."" > He points out though that the roughly 5 million training games of self-play it took for AlphaGo Zero to beat AlphaGo is &quot;Vastly more&quot; than the number of games Sedol had played to become a champion. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/77able/workers_in_the_wealthier_nations_are_facing/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~230884 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **AlphaGo**^#1 **game**^#2 **play**^#3 **learns**^#4 **Zero**^#5"
