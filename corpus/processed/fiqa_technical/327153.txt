I think the part that you aren't seeing is that many people earning minimum wage aren't at the start of their careers, where they don't have a lot of financial commitments and are able to move fairly easily. If someone is earning that sort of wage, but has rent to pay, kids in school, elders to take care of, that minimum wage job can often be 1 of their two jobs they need to stay afloat. Taking time off one of the jobs to go study is simply not part of the equation. I don't think what you were saying is false, just a very thin subset in a range of possibilities. Potentially, you can't peer outside that range to se that there are thousands of stories that don't fit the bill.
