I grill potential employees when they add “Level I Candidate” to their resume because such a statement requires little effort and proves nothing. Many people (correctly) assume that participating in the CFA program shows that they are a more qualified employee candidate. Therefore, some will simply register for the test, without really committing to the program. It is easy to weed out the resume padders. On the other hand, someone that declares they are a Level II or III candidate has proved they can commit to and pass the first test. We still discuss the program during the interview, but most of these people have already dedicated hundreds of hours of their time to the subject and eager to talk about their great accomplishment. I am not too sure about the number of charter holders that are sought out by regional banks.
