"First, contact your credit card company and explain the problem to them, to ensure that they never pay any money to this company. Second, research the US postal code. Somewhere it says that if you receive unsolicited goods in the mail, they are a gift to you. Then it becomes a question of whether you went far enough in the subscription process to commit to the subscription. Third, reread the fine print on the web page. ""By clicking submit, you agree to deliver us your firstborn and a herd(?) of baby goats."" Finally, armed with information from the previous steps, call (maybe better to do it in writing by sending a letter to) the company selling the magazines to let them know their mistake. That the transaction was never completed and that the failure of the transaction led you to believe that the subscription was never agreed upon. And that you never received a confirmation. Let them know that you do not wish to continue receiving the magazine. If you're on the hook, having clicked submit, then find out about their cancellation policy. Hopefully there's a cancel any time policy. If so, pay for the first couple of issues, then write it off as a relatively inexpensive lesson on subscriptions, fine print, and reading and keeping copies of contracts. 50 bucks an issue for a monthly magazine sounds expensive. Is it a trade magazine?"
