> In other words, one might conclude based on this data that it's the smartphone, more than any particular transportation service, that's greatly disrupting city mobility.. Why haven't official taxi companies (if not cities themselves) invested more time and energy into developing smartphone-based services? My local taxi service has an app from which one can hail a cab and pay for the ride. But the app is shittier, the service is worse, and the ride is more expensive. I swore off of cabs when it cost me more than double to make the trip back compared to what Uber charged me to get there (my phone was dead). Then I recanted and took a cab from the airport because it was easier than waiting for Uber. Well, that cost me about a 50% premium and now I've sworn off of cabs again.
