Given the way people act in reality, I think this would lead to people buying ponzi scheme currencies, or preferring the ones with the best advertising budgets or aesthetic look, or otherwise getting constantly scammed. I certainly don't think people would usually save in the best reputation currencies, and if they did, I figure those currencies would get new management once they became successful, who would sell them out for short term gain and be just as prone to printing their buddies out of bankruptcy as the government. If even nation states, who have a very strong long term interest in maintaining good currency, play all sorts of shenanigans with it, I see no reason to expect bodies with shorter term interests would do a better job.
