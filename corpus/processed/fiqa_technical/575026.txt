">I bet we worked less as hunter gatherers. Definitely. IIRC, there's quite a bit of stuff written about this. This thread surprises me. I really thought Reddit would be like ""yes! And people under 40 too!"" Personally, I don't think humans are made to work jobs. We are made to acquire wealth which makes working jobs tolerable. So, if we could change the way we get wealth or minimize the time spent at jobs, we'd all be better off in the long run."
