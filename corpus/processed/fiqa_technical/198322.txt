"Before the internet, there were these things called ""BBSes"". Bulletin Board System. They were usually privately operated, the software ran on a single personal computer, and most of the time they had 1 phone line connected to them. There were thousands of these systems in every state. Visitors would call the BBS phone number and connect in a 1 to 1 conversation. The user would then be presented with all sorts of menus and interactive experiences, usually with ANSI colored text. The primary feature of any BBS was the forum, called a Bulletin Board at the time. But many BBSes also had other things. File sharing sections, games, etc. Basically everything that the larger internet is used for today. Possibly the worst thing that happened to the Internet was the dot com boom. As a result of a tiny few people getting filthy rich, it has created a different landscape where large corporations are kings and it's very difficult for smaller community projects to find the sort of success they would otherwise enjoy. If the internet were not so ruled by media giants like Google and Facebook, you would see a lot more smaller sites and communities, similar to the BBSes of old. They would have more personality and the experience would probably be ""better"". So no, Soundcloud doesn't matter that much. Soundcloud started as a small website, and they deserve to exist as much as anyone, but every time a media giant on the internet collapses, we see dozens of small startups take it's place, and the result is often ""better"". There is definitely value in having a central repository, I wonder if something like Soundcloud could exist decentralized. A lot of smaller music sites with preview and purchase features that form a sort of meta-network."
