">You understand the purpose of insurance, right? It's ok to tax the rich but not ok for them to cash in on insurance? You understand that no employees pay for this ""insurance"" right? The rich employees don't pay for this benefit, the employers do. That being said, this is not something that is an easy question to answer. One one hand if someone is out of a job then the black and white answer is ""yes"" they are absolutely allowed to use these benefits. The other hand if this person has the ability not to utilize these benefits because they were able to create a savings(either by investments or simply saving) then why would they need to use it? I think that using this specific benefit should be a last resort, Not one to use because you don't want to use any of your money. Not that im saying this happened but again, if someone is making this kind of money, one would think they should have the wherewithal to have an emergency savings fund for this exact situation. There is nothing inherently illegal about this, however it is, IMO, morally questionable."
