This is interesting, but only looking at SF will bias the results. I have lived in and visited several big cities and SF cab service is not representative. In places like Chicago and New York, there are cabs swarming the streets. Unless you are out in the suburbs, it's typically much faster to just hail a cab. Uberx and Lyft provide an extra benefit from being cheaper and better service.
