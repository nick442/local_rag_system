"Are “auto income generators” scams or alternative investment channels? I wouldn't go so far as to say that these are scams so much as grossly exaggerated marketing claims. If it sounds too good to be true then it usually is. Auto auto income generator, for example, hosts a site that you can use to produce revenue from ads. In order to get enough traffic to generate the amount of income they promise you have to put in a lot of work, hardly making it ""automatic."" I can't find anything on auto bit coin builder, however. They promise to pay out an outrageously high fixed-return with vague descriptions about ""investments."" This is purely speculation since there is not very much information about this small site, but it may be a ""pyramid"" or ""Ponzi"" scheme. They promise a return higher than traditional investments, offer extra incentives for referrals, and offer a list of excuses for why funds may be pending even though the transfer happens ""INSTANTLY"" on their end. The fact that they only deal in crpytocurrency may also be an attempt to remain anonymous."
