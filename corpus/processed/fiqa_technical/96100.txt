All right wing corporatist propaganda bullshit. Stop watching fox news or whatever right wing douche you're listening to. The minimum has been raised many times in history. Every time there was this propaganda as to why we shouldn't and every time we did there was an era of prosperity that followed. You have literally no proof other than regurgitating bullshit. Automation will happen regardless.
