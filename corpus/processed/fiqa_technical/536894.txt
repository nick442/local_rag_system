"I think maybe a disconnection of understanding of friends? I could see a lot of women thinking ""I have so many friends, they all love me, and will totally get rich with me!"" Personally I know for a fact I really only have like 4 friends and they sure as hell wouldn't join a mlm with me. I think dudes may be more in touch with the fact the 800 people on facebook aren't really our friends?"
