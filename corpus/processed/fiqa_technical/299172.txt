Yeah..or they simply don't like eating shit on a bun. Don't try to turn this into some jingoist argument. McDonalds is shit, and its about as American as french fries. I know its hard to believe, but there are places in the world where you can still get decent ingredients for home-cooked meals at a good price such that there is no reason to ever want to eat at a McFranchise.
