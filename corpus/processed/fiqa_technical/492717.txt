Neither the left nor the right truly has ever understood what the silent majority is. The silent majority is composed of people marginally attached to both sides of the aisle who do not give a single fuck and are just trying to live their lives. This is where the faux outrage, the historical revisionism, the censorship, and the aggressive one-sidedness of the new alt-left falls flat,on its face with the American voter.
