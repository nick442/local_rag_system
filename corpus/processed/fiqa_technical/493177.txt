"Although I only cited product quality, I'm trying to think of examples of companies that incorporated and then immediately improved product quality, fostered good will, and treated its employees better than when they were private. None come to mind, can you think of any? Perhaps ""almost always"" was a bit of hyperbole, but in matters of cost vs. quality I'd expect publicly traded companies to prioritize short-term shareholder profit (or be sued by said shareholders.) Private companies can have more of a vested interest in the good will of their employees, product quality, and can make decisions that benefit themselves and society long-term because they do not have this fiduciary responsibility. Have you ever seen the documentary [*the Corporation*](http://www.thecorporation.com/index.cfm?page_id=46)? They make a compelling case that if corporations were people they'd be sociopaths (according to the ASM.)"
