To be honest, if the world goes tits up, then bitcoin would be my first safe haven. No hassle getting it out the country, no heavy industry of war to maintain, no chance of governmental instability affecting my holdings. Imagine being a Syrian right now. Would you not have been off far better if your life's savings were in bitcoin, and you didn't need to worry about your money when you wanted to seek refuge in Europe? Imagine being Ukranian, living in the Crimea and *not* being a Russian. That military support behind the Euro means absolutely nothing to you then. bitcoin is enforced by the people using it. We all have skin in the game, and we all want to safeguard your holdings. Therefor, it is in our best interest to keep the protocol running. It is this very aspect of cryptocurrency that liberates us from third parties having to 'enforce' the value of the currency.
