The deadline for submitting a claim was September 4th, 2016 - therefore you are no longer eligible. That being said, you probably did not miss much. According to the settlement notice you can expect to be paid about 14 cents per share, on claims exceeding $10 (below $10 you don't get paid). Read the settlement notice for more info.
