What about Hulu? The networks got scared and then freaked out when it turned out to be more than a small niche market that was interested in it. First they ordered new episodes be released on Hulu later and later to try and force people to watch them on TV. Then they took down older episodes to try and force people to buy DVD box sets. And entire networks that were initially onboard with Hulu have done a re-think and pulled all their shows. Just because it's actually a popular platform. Which is, ironically, not what they wanted Hulu to be. And going forward, the cable conglomerates are going to be even more powerful players with NBC and G4 (OK, who gives a shit about G4?) now owned by Comcast. Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, makes a huge portion of their money from their cable and satellite TV businesses. Those guys will never, ever play ball with a pick 'n' play online TV distribution model along the lines of Steam. Not until cable and satellite are no longer profitable. And that is a long, long time away.
