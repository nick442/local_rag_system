I've seen Target stores with some strange layouts in buildings that they didn't build themselves, and those stores have succeeded, so I wouldn't necessarily blame the reuse of existing buildings, in and of itself, as a factor. My local Target is a former Montgomery Ward store, and has a somewhat unorthodox bi-level layout because of this, especially when compared to two bi-level stores that Target built themselves in nearby towns. But all three stores are successful. Target's problem with buying out the Zellers leases was that they had too large of a store footprint before they were ready to service it. If they had started small with one or two locations and then built up gradually, they would have probably been fine, working the bugs out on a few stores vs. 100+ stores. A Zellers acquisition could have happened later on.
