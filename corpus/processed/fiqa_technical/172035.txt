Cancer patient here. One thing that’s important to distinguish is incidence rate compared to prevalence and mortality rates. We’re living longer, so more change to get cancer. We are also living longer *with* cancer, so for example with the one I have there are more people than ever with it, but that’s because they’re not dying so quickly now. Stats can be really misleading. In general there has never been a “better” time to get cancer than now.
