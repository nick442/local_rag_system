"Quick Lowes story.. I just shopped at Lowes for the first time a few days ago. Found the BBQ I wanted (Broil King Baron 440) available there. It was cheaper at Sears but since they are another dying large box retailer and don't answer their phone, I decided to go to Lowes when their Customer Support team said they would price match. When I got to the till with my ~$900 purchase and showed them the website for the price match, they said they weren't sure if they could do it because it said Out of Stock Online. 15 minutes later and a call to the boss and they said ""Sorry we cannot match the $584 sale price at Sears, but we can offer you 10% off Sears' original price of $649."" Quick math shows that 10% off $649 is in fact $584. So you have to go out of your way to say you cannot do the price match but actually you are doing the price match. Accidental customer service. All of these stores that do business this way are slowly dying. The only reason I'm there is for customer service. I can usually order online and it will be easier and most likely cheaper. An immediate price match would be a great customer experience and would likely lead me to venture back to Lowes in the future. Instead I left feeling like they didn't really want to help me out but accidentally did."
