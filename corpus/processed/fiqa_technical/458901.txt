"If you look at the visuals of the video it's fairly clear that Keynes is presented as a misguided party-boy and Hayek as a ""boring"" but sober dude. The actual conversations surrounding the different theories are a lot more complicated and a lot less clear-cut on who is right. Personal belief: The reality is that different crises are caused by different things and so we have the different macroeconomic theories. A model that captured every single possibility would be impossible to work so we instead have several different simplifications of reality and try to see which one is most applicable currently. Unfortunately people tend to pick one theory and try to bash it into every problem that arises. The same way that armies fight the last war, economists fight the last recession."
