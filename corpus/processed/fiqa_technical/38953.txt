>Sounds like bullshit. Silicon Valley is largely research and development, not manufacturing. Saying that you'll replicate the success of software engineers earning $120k a year by bringing in more $50k a year manufacturing jobs is misleading at best. Today it is largely research and development but a few decades ago there was a production manufacturing capacity to it that was by in large far greater then what remains today.
