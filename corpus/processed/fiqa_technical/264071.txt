The real question you should be asking is how much should tax dollars, and govt in general, really be responsible for? The only reason you think it might be acceptable to increase taxes on investments is because you want more money going to govt and to whatever you think govt should be responsible for doing. Well, I probably think it should be responsible for less. And there are likely to be folks who think govt should do even more than you believe. Who's right?
