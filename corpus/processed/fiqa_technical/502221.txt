> Are you worried at all about the $5 trillion in bonds held by the FED? I'm not, no. It's just been an asset swap. In place of $5tn worth of bonds that the non-government used to hold, we're now holding $5tn worth of reserves. Now whether you have $1mn worth of bonds, or $1mn in your bank, your net financial position is the same. You can buy a $1mn yacht just as easily either way, for bonds are one of the most liquid assets in existence. So why should swapping bonds for reserves, slightly more liquid but of the same value, be of concern to anyone? Who cares if our asset makeup has shifted from T-Bills that trade for their face value to Federal Reserve Notes that trade for their face value? >Is there any precedent for a country canceling that amount of debt ever and kept reserve currency status? Firstly, I don't understand this obsession with being the primary reserve currency. New Zealand/Australia/Canada/UK - these countries all manage just fine without it. Secondly, as the world's largest economy and with 200mn+ taxpayers all seeking out USD and heaps of very desirable exports and USD-denominated assets, the USD is always going to be highly sought-after and a pillar-stone of any assortment of reserves. > I was just watching a documentary about WWI and Keynes said at the outset the war would have to stop after a few months because each side would run out of money. Governments of the day simply [ceased convertibility to gold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard#Impact_of_World_War_I), because guess what - whilst a country can run out of gold (and gold-convertible money), it can never run out of its own free floating currency. Again, just look at Japan - if it were possible, they would have eons ago.
