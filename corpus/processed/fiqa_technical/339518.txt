"The problem is ""what would have been"" without regulations. A good cause and effect is the Durbin amendment to DFA - they randomly regulated interchange debit card transactions (win for Walmart, loss for banks) so it no longer makes sense to offer free checking to poor people. WMT wins, banking loses, poor people lose. The other issue is maxing out regulations actually makes the system more frail as it promotes consolidation in the sector. Consultants love it - tons of free, easy, no thought work."
