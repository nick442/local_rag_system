i've ordered on-line for store pickup a handful of times...WHAT A FUCKING NIGHTMARE (and i even tried multiple stores to see) always one person working, disappearing for 5-10 minutes while trying to track down orders, 10+ ppl in line. the last time i just left and vowed to: NEVER AGAIN, fuck you Wally World
