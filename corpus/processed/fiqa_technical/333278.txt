"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/ebay-will-now-match-amazons-walmarts-and-others-prices-on-over-50000-items/) reduced by 70%. (I'm a bot) ***** > At any time, eBay says there are &quot;Tens of thousands&quot; of items offered through the Deals site, with featured deals updating at least once per day, beginning at 8 AM PT. In case you somehow missed how this launch is a response to the looming Amazon threat, eBay&#039;s announcement about the new price match feature hits you over the head with the comparison: it makes special note of the fact that there&#039;s &quot;No membership required&quot; to access eBay Deals. > Ebay says it will only match prices on identical items sold online on a competitor&#039;s website - and yes, the item must be currently in stock at the time you request the Price Match Guarantee. > &quot;Our eBay Deals selection has grown exponentially since being launched in 2011. The prices are already extremely competitive, but if a shopper finds it for less, we&#039;ll gladly match the price of our competitors,&quot; he added. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6im07b/ebay_will_now_match_amazons_and_walmarts_prices/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~149398 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **eBay**^#1 **Price**^#2 **item**^#3 **Match**^#4 **Deals**^#5"
