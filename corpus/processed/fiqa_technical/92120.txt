Fair point, but I'd submit to you that the European system has demonstrated its flaws. You claim it is better than the U.S. system, which in terms of ease, quality or value, is probably the case. But, the unsustainable costs in the Eurozone are driven by healthcare and entitlement programs, similar to the U.S. and other developed nations. What happens when Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal are forced to default or leave the Euro? Do you think the healthcare quality, ease and value will remain as it has been?
