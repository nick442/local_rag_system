Corporations started dumping pensions in the 80's and 90's. I noted at the time that that while the original hiring incentives had been to take lower wages in lieu of the promise of a pension; they did not raise wages after they dumped the pensions. I think that the move was in part because corporate interests realized that through their pensions were about to control corporate America.
