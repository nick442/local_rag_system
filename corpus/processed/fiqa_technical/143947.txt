Socialism is not mentioned anywhere in the article, and price controls existed in human civilization before socialism was a concept. Secondly, stocked supermarkets are not the same as population's well being. I was in Soviet Union in the middle of perestroika when the system went from everybody having money and there was nothing to buy, to supermarkets having everything and no one having cash. The quality of life was actually going down precipitously for vast majority of the population, and they didn't quite recover to this day (although there is absolutely no shortage of $3000 lingerie sets at fashion stores on Tverskaya).
