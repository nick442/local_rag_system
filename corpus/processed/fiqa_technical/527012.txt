Training minimum wage employees and making them fear getting fired is not a sound business model alone. Minimum wages, minimum expectations. If you expect quality from people but don't treat them with quality, well good luck. In the real world, you get what you pay for. There's only so many people willing to work at minimum wage. Those people aren't going to care about your business.
