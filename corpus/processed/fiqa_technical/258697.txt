In theory, yes. In practice, long ways off. It is hard [for a robot] to put clothes on a hanger and sort them. It is hard for a robot to take shoes out of a box. It is hard to pick and sort Kiwifruit, grapes, and strawberries. While it is hard for a robot, these jobs are necessary and extremely easy for a zero skilled and zero educated human to perform. You can't even teach a monkey to do these jobs because they will become violent within a few minutes of performance. At this point only a human has the temperament and innate abilities to do mindless work that requires dexterity. In reality, I agree. . The US government should be offering Grand Challenge rewards for fruit picking machines and gardening. But that would put a million poor immigrants/people out of work that would otherwise cause serious political upheaval.
