As pointed out, these machines are hardly new and in wide use by other carriers/airports. Staff are still needed as some boarding passes may not be readable (mobile phone one's for example) and they still have the bag nazis to ensure only one carry-on in economy. The turnstiles can even issue seat changes and upgrades.
