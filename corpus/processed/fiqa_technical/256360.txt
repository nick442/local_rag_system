Probably not the greatest move. What are the returns to video games? Fleeting at best. You're great at Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 - wonderful. Then they change a few things and you suck at Call of Duty: Ghosts (don't believe me? Go over the COD threads and read all the posts from people complaining how each new version is worse than the last, because they rocked the last version and they suck now). You've gotta train for each new game; in the meantime kids are all the same age while you're getting older. Your reflexes won't be getting much better, and in all likelihood they'll decline long before your retirement. What are the returns to a successful finance career, on the other hand? Well, here on /r/finance I probably don't even need to get into that. Needless to say, if you're learning the principles of finance and applying those consistently over time, the returns can be enormous.
