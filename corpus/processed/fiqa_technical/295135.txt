I understand equity financing. Do you understand microeconomics? Can you explain to me how selling a product that has market value of $4 and a COGS of $10 is sustainable? Amazon's losses were about building infrastructure to allow reduced costs. Their products sold at a loss tend to be loss leaders (people buy thousands of dollars worth of digital products on Kindles and Fires they purchased for less than cost). That bears no resemblance to Uber's model.
