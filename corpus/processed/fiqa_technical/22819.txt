That was a quote from the article itself.. There's a good link involved in that excerpt.. Read it.. Job lock is a real thing.. That's the only reason people remain at the large corporations that treat them just like a number and don't give a crap about them.. People work for large companies with fucked up schedules, commutes and often health detrimental duties.. Yet they don't want to adventure to the unknown where there's a chance they will not get the same benefit package.. As anecdote, I live in Rural Washington state, a lot of Union people travel to Seattle for work.. This is a very long, and stressful commute, I-5, 16, and 405 are not fun.. Some of them will spend upwards of five or six hours a day just on the road.. when you ask them why.. It's because of the pay and the benefit package.. when you factor in the extra hours of driving, the pay really is not that huge of a difference, and the toll on your body that that kind of commute takes is horrific.. But they wouldn't dare look at small companies Closer by that may not be able to offer them the pension, and health insurance plan that is mandated when working for Amazon, or building for JP Morgan.. So they just give in, become a number, and on paper, and empirically, it is a net gain.. But the intangible effects on their psyche, happiness, are quite clear..
