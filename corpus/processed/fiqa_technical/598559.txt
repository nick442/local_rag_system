Hey i work in the finance sector at management level. For the role you are applying for time management is a must, make sure you have some well prepped solid examples to go through. Same with stakeholder management, try to think of examples where you've had to influence the opinion of others. Has the firm given you a structured answer format to follow? If not i would recommend you follow the STAR format for each question as its easy to pick up.. Situation, Task, Action & Result.. Try to throw in what you learnt from each experience too. Remember to take have some questions ready that you would like to know about the role or company.. Questions like 'what would success look like in this role' are always good. Good luck! Got to go for food right now but feel free to contact me if u need any advice
