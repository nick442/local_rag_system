prob not the one with 22 years on the job though. Ive seen this a million times. There always seems to be a Fran in the multitude of articles over the years about min wage or fight for 15 or unionization. Its always some mom with 2+ kids that has been doing the same job or type for 10+ years. How can you not even be a fucking shift supervisor after 2? Manager after 5? Because.... They dont want that. See if Im just a dumb line worker I dont have to be responsible for jack shit. I clock in, I clock out. Done. They might have to relocate or gasp experience change!
