Well, the problem with putting a group of people in charge of something so substantial is that man is corruptible. The individuals in charge will change over time and eventually corrupt people will be in charge. It's inevitable. > If you were in charge, what action would you take? If I were in charge of the Fed or if I were in charge of designing a brand new monetary system? If I were in charge of the Fed, I would immediately stop the creation of this funny money, make all of the Fed's account books, publications, meeting minutes and all other info public information. I would invite a full audit of the entire organization. I would then hold the people accountable for any fraud that turns up. Then I would simply abolish the organization. I believe local banks can better set lending rates just as local store owners can set better prices than a single federal organization. Interest rates would reflect actual demand for loans, not reflect the secret personal agenda of some arrogant, elitist bureaucrat. If I were designing a new monetary system, I would combine the obvious benefits of a gold/silver standard with the openness and decentralized nature of a currency like bitcoin. I would create a published and predictable increase to the money supply that could not be changed, and would grow just enough to avoid constant deflation as economies expanded. Most importantly, I would advocate and encourage the creation of alternate currencies to allow honest competition.
