1. Unfortunately it's pretty key to have *something*. School isn't that useful as a screening heuristic, especially for business majors, so 98.5% (approximately) of the value add comes from what you did while there/immediately after. I get the value in not wanting debt part but the world is what it is. 2. Go after the alumni network. Most schools have an internal job board. That can be something and it's a filtered environment. 3. You can try for an internship that's for juniors. Write a cover letter explaining your situation and why you think you'd still be a good candidate. 4. Other skills? VBA is nice. For an analyst in general my understanding is you need decent but not exceptional computer skills and rock solid Excel/research ability. Learn to write coherently and in a fact driven fashion since many, many people struggle with that. 5. Depending on your major, take a post-grad class or two in accounting/finance at a local university and talk to professors. They may have contacts and it could open doors.
