I guess I didn't fill in all the holes at first, but what I'm implying with this system is that the company bonds would be the currency of the territory, as monetary policy would be decentralized and be replaced by competing money supplies that firms and individuals would be free to choose from and switch between at any time, whether they prefer an easy or tight monetary policy at any given moment. At this point, the bonds would be the most liquid thing around, as you could repay your bonds in the bonds of another, and any one of these bonds could be used to pay taxes. It's a scenario I've been working out because I see the drawbacks of centralized money laid out by F.A. Hayek in Denationalization of Money, but I don't think a gold standard would be sufficient in today's world. (Most of the scenarios I've planned this out in assume the scenario of a perfect competition market, where all firms breakeven with expenses, and the role of researcher and developer is taken up by the government, so life improvements can still occur over time.)
