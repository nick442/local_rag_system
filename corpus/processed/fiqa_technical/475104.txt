The debt is a problem but IF (and the key word is if) other nations are lending to us at rates we dictate, then that is not a problem. But if our own banks, Central Bank, and the like are buying it then the problem is being kept on our shores. The issue is with fractional reserve lending, one will always have this issue but if other nations give us items/services for paper/pixels we send them why not continue.
