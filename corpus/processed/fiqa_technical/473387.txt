Wait I'm confused maybe you can explain I'm in the federal reserve and I buy a hundred pounds of coin material for 180 dollars. I put that material into a magic penny machine and get a hundred pounds of pennies. My hundred pounds of pennies will now have a value of 100 dollars. I had a hundred pounds of mass worth $180 and now have a hundred pounds of mass worth $100. Where did the 80 dollars go?
