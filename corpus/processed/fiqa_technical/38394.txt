In addition to the difference pointed out by Dheer (see also this Wikipedia link), another meaning is that Private Bankers are those people on the bank staff who deal with personal accounts and people who wish to deposit money in the bank, while the people who use the deposits to loan money to businesses, underwrite bond issues etc are called Investment Bankers or sometimes Merchant Bankers since these staff members deal primarily with merchants, or invest the bank's deposits in various ways.
