No one put regulations in place before they were needed. Let's not be a fucking moron. Corporations were abusing shit and when the government got sick Of their shit they put regulations in place. They didn't just decide to say 'stop building a house if you see a turtle so we can move it' if contractors were not killing endangered turtles. You're just ignorant as fuck. And by the way, were already going to hit below 2005 emission levels in the next few years due to free market.
