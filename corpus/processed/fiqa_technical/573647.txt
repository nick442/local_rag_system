That's BS man. The retailer is supposed to be visually confirming signatures! That's their freaking job! PIN numbers are LESS Secure because retailers do not provide a visually secure place to type them in. It is Waaaaaay too easy to watch someone typing their pin. Especially with the ceiling cameras that many stores place above every register. Signatures are MORE secure because they are more difficult to forge. The only reason signatures might be inadequate is because retailers are failing to hold up their part of the equation. They don't want to do their jobs so we should change for them? Screw that. The hypocrisy in this country I swear to god.
