This isn't about laziness but rather brand recognition. Someone who wants to buy coke will be looking for the classic red can they always get, while avoiding the swill that is diet coke. Subconsciously they may even associate the white coke cans with the inferior taste of diet coke. The consumer might even select a case of Dr. Pepper because of this.
