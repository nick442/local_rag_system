Although Amazon and Whole Foods encompass less than 2% of the US grocery market, I'd be curious as to whether antitrust regulation could be relevant here or to any part of Amazon's business. As Amazon monopolizes, it actually benefits customers via lower prices and more free Prime perks - so the basic definition of a monopoly would have to be adjusted to apply.
