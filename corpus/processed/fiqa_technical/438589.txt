How exactly would these companies be broken up? They also don't fit any meaningful definition of monopolies. Facebook has plenty of competition from Snapchat and Twitter and there is always a new upstart that can come along. Google has competition in nearly every venture it's invested in besides search. But the thing is that these companies don't make their money off of any of that: they make it all off of advertising. And in the advertising space, the two companies compete tooth and nail with each otherâ€”along with all the other ad companies that they've largely beat out.
