More exactly, it would be beneficial if government spent on something that increases economic productivity. The problem is, how can the government determine what is a good investment vs a bad investment? Even restricted only to building infrastructure, how does it know which bridges are good and which are [bad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravina_Island_Bridge)? Government has no good method of determining this. They make political, not economic decisions and listen to whoever lobbies them the best. This idea of economic calculation is how [Mises' predicted that socialism/communism would utterly fail](http://mises.org/humanaction/chap26sec1.asp).
