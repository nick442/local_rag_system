"But it isnt how countries work. Republicans constantly want to pretend a country is a business or a home budget it isnt. And I dont get why people dont remember that Bush ran on the fact that he was a businessman and that gore was the out of touch guy who was in politics all his life. how did that work out? the country isnt a business we cant fire our citizens and hope they get new citizenship in a better country. we cant carve off missouri and sell it to mexico to get rid of some of our less profitable states. The US is not a business. and last if you say ""thats just capitalism"" then perhaps we should examine if we want capitaism in our SOCIETY. If that is good for SOCIETY. I mean if you are just going to send all the jobs over seas to were workers are cheaper, then all you are doing is asking america to go into a state of decline until all of us are willing to take the same pay as some guy who lived in a hut in middle of africa all his life. Personally I dont."
