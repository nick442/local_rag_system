"part of living in a dynamic world, unfortunately failure to accept that leaves you in the dust keeping that same mindset forever-- personally i think that outsourcing will forever be a popular solution to profit maximization without altering our corporate tax laws. ..however with adequate adjustments to tax incentives, some of these large corporations could be taxed properly and stop claiming they are generating their profits ""overseas"" all the while dodging our socioeconomic responsibility of contributing to the system. great read- thanks for the share"
