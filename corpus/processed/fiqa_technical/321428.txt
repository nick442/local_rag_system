Yes, it's a gross over-simplification, we can certainly agree on that. You don't need a degree to make a good living (defined as 50k+ work for you?). This is a popular lie that was fed to young people, which aided in creating this student loan crisis in the first place. Truck drivers, construction workers, skilled laborers in general, etc make good money. Right put of HS, of course it can be difficult to land one of these jobs, but working as say, a dock worker for $10-12 for a few years and working your way up to a higher-paying job is a fantastic route to take- in this case that would likely be a truck driver (this requires some school and a license, but every semi-major company will pay for that if you've been working for them for a few years and they can trust you). The issue that is far too prevalent is that kids either aren't getting a reasonable education or they aren't graduating from HS- topics for another day probably. School costs have gone up because the govt was garunteeijg a loan to everyone with a pulse. I'm with you on education. Public education is an abject failure. We have failed to educate our youth and minimum wage laws price those poorly educated, unskilled youths right out of the job market. I'll leave the rest of the third paragraph alone as I think we differ in fundamental values that neither of us are likely to change and a discussion of those values would be exausting.
