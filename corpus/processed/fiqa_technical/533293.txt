Second mortgages were also a popular way for home buyers without a down payment to borrow 100% of the money, but avoid certain extra fees if they borrowed all the money from a single lender. For example, to borrow $100,000 on a house would incur something called PMI (private mortgage insurance). So to borrow $100,000 to buy my house, my payment might be $800/month, but I would have an additional $100/month of PMI to pay. (These numbers are totally made up and not based in math in any way) So instead of that, borrows might get a first mortgage for $80,000 so they don't have to pay the PMI and get a second mortgage for the difference. This can be beneficial if the second mortgage payment is less than the PMI for borrowing 100%. As far as I know they aren't as easy to get these days, like any loan you need to be qualified and I think 100% financing is probably harder to come by. The negative connotation is no worse than any other loan. I am personally against borrowing money, but if you had big medical expenses, major home repairs or some other emergency I could see it justified. Probably not for a big vacation or for new car though.
