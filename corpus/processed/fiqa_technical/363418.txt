On the Canadian side of it, there are a few people I've spoke to about this that are not happy about it either. Tim Horton's is a very Canadian brand, and some are upset about an American company moving in. This happened in the 90s with Wendy's and there was a big public backlash then, although there are still a few Tim Horton's/Wendy's combos to be found still.
