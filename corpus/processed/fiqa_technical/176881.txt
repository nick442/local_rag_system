If you're wrong it is worse for the children. Artificially quadrupling energy costs in a vain effort to lower temps will kill more people by demolishing economies and restricting access to food and water. I hope for global warming as it historically coincides with relative human prosperity. The little ice age was marked by human suffering and famine.
