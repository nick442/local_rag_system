According to your scenario then, if Gen Xers are making less money then they'll also be working longer, thereby keeping millenials out of those jobs for even longer, thereby reducing millenials' earning expectations even further. The Gen Xers are already in a better position because they are more likely to have experience in a given industry; the millenials often lack even that, and in addition they are likely to have large student debts (because they paid more for college in the first place) and no way of paying it back. I really don't see how the generation attempting to enter the workforce now has any advantages over their predecessors. Everything is stacked against them. I'm not saying it's good for other generations, but it is worst for millenials. It will probably be even worse for future generations.
