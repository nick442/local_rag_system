> How do you feel about those English majors in community college? If it is free, or very cheap then it can be really great for those that love learning. Nothing wrong with majoring in English at community college, no different from spending time learning about Fantasy Football, or going to history re-enactments. Just don't kid yourself it will make you more employable. It is a hobby, and just as valuable as any other hobby.
