"> This is horse shit. You're citing liberal propaganda as fact. ""Cited as the anti scientist president."" By whom? Just liberals with their dress over their heads. Did you say ""By whom?""?? Have you been living under a rock? And, even then, do you not know how to google? Nearly every science oriented magazine and organization has described Trump as anti-science: 1\. Scientific American ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trumps-5-most-ldquo-anti-science-rdquo-moves/ ) > **Trump's 5 Most ""Anti-Science"" Moves.** The president-elect has taken what is widely seen as a hostile stance toward the scientific community .. 2\. Union of Concerned Scientists ( https://psmag.com/environment/a-brief-survey-of-trumps-assault-on-science ) 3\. Science .. *the magazine* for the American Association for the Advancement of Science .. the worlds largest general science organization (https://sciencemag.org http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/what-trumps-nominees-have-said-about-science-their-senate-hearings , http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/hundreds-rally-science-demonstration-near-aaas-meeting , and many others). And many other news organizations: 4\. Worst anti-science president ever. http://www.newsweek.com/trump-expected-be-most-anti-science-president-ever-519226 5\. Trump anti-science policies imperil the world http://www.scmp.com/business/global-economy/article/2094269/opinion-trumps-anti-science-policies-imperil-world 6\. President Trump's War on Science. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/09/opinion/sunday/trump-epa-pruitt-science.html 7\. Trump has launched a blitzkrieg in the wars on science https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/mar/28/trump-has-launched-a-blitzkrieg-in-the-wars-on-science-and-earths-climate > This Nature article is junk, it's just an opinion piece, a few quotes from literally who, and a random bar graph. That was a news piece, not an opinion piece. And that doesn't matter anyway. The result is the graphs which are from the UCLA HERI study. There was also a Pew Study done in 2009. http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-4-scientists-politics-and-religion/ But I don't know why you're arguing .. because you summarized my point (poorly, I may add) with: > Trump won on income and was inversely proportional on education. This was basically my point. You would know that if you actually read what I wrote. I say ""basically"" here, because: 1\. You confused ""inversely proportional"" with negatively correlated .. or proportional with a negative proportionality constant. Certainly you're aware that ""inversely proportional"" actually means a relation like y = C 1/x + k. 2\. ""won on income"" is just poor phraseology. Polls suggest that Trump had a slightly higher edge (2% vs. Hilary) for those whose income was in the higher tiers (most tiers above $50K/yr income). Polls suggest that he was strongly disfavored for lower incomes. Of course .. it's best seen in the poll I linked into my first post on this page. > Jeez who would have thunk it, lifers post docs are bought it on their liberal academic surroundings. As if that was indicative of intelligence. Most of your sentences above had poor grammar and, at first, I suspected some advanced Russian bot. But this is atrocious. Try to express yourself in complete thoughts. Read what you wrote .. it's complete garbage. I almost didn't respond at all since it doesn't deserve a response."
