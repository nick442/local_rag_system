I definitely agree with this. Before I could get federal or state loans I had to do this online orientation and while you probably could skip most of it and click accept I actually read through and am competent in how the interest works and how even though not paying until after graduation is an option that'll increase my total loans by like 50%. Almost every other student I've talked to with student loans has little to no knowledge as to how interest works and how it applies to their loans. And the choosing what to study. Because while it is nice to study something fun if you can't practically get a decent paying job in your field then you have a lot of knowledge and nothing to do with it.
