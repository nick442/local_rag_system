(I'm a bot) ***** > Onshore wind costs fall fast, and offshore falls faster. > Around $6 trillion of new investment in wind and solar power between now and 2040 will reshape the world&#039;s electricity markets as we move from a system where coal, gas and oil-fired power plants make up over 60% of capacity, to one where solar and wind are the two largest categories, and where fossil fuels make-up less than a third. > In Germany, new onshore wind and solar already appear to be cost-competitive with new coal and gas; in China today, coal is the lowest-cost, new-build electricity generation, but in 2019, onshore wind gets cheaper, then PV follows two years later; in the U.S., cheap natural gas makes it the lowest-cost source of new electricity right now, but by 2022-23 PV and wind both begin to beat it; and in India, new solar PV starts to look cheaper than new coal, across the country, from 2020. ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/6kchsc/energy_to_2040_faster_shift_to_clean_dynamic/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ ""Version 1.65, ~155602 tl;drs so far."") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **wind**^#1 **New**^#2 **solar**^#3 **coal**^#4 **Gas**^#5"
