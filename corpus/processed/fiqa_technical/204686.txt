"Look at the graph in the article and one of the legends say ""Thinking their funny"". > I understand your cynicism of bad products, but how will people find out about your good product? It's actually easier than ever today because today you can easily search for what you need and you are exposed to media more than ever. There also tools to show specific ads depending on the viewer location, keywords and data on the user. The challenge is that few bad companies selling junk and crap have huge advertising budget and overwhelm the users who search for one thing and get TONS of ads for something they did not even search for."
