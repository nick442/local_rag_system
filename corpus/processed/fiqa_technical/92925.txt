It would be difficult, but it's a statistical task, and you'd need to refer to a competent statistician to really get a sense of what sort of certainty could be derived from the available data. I believe that you'd start by looking over your state-by-state data on a granular level to try to find if there was any persistent correlation between Amazon's market penetration in a particular area and employment data from the retail industry. With regards to Ma & Pa's complaint, you're sort of wrong and sort of right. Obviously they have no direct knowledge that online retail was responsible for the decline in sales that they saw. In terms of sustainability and mismanagement, however, they can show you their books. If the business had been established from some time it would be easy to see whether it had indeed been a sustainable business model in prior years. Sustainability and mismanagement, however, are Scotsmen when it comes to reasoning about causes. In measuring the effect of Amazon's entry into the market on local businesses, we can just as easily use a model that assumes a perfect market, that inefficiencies on the part of Ma^1 & Pa^1 would lead them to be displaced by Ma^2 & Pa^2, and that on average Ma^x & Pa^x manage their business sufficiently well to extract an optimal return on effort. If circumstances are such that the role of vendor is not fungible, and the supply of Mas and Pas does not respond to the demand for family stores, then I don't actually know how to do the math, but on the other hand I do recognize a smoking gun.
