WFC shareholder here. I bought up a ton more during last summer's scandal. The reason people don't switch banks is because it's a huge pain in the ass. Take myself for example. I have a savings, checking, credit card, and brokerage through them. If I were to change, Id have to pull all my money out, put it into a new bank, and resetup all my autopayments. Im not even sure how my brokerage account would work. Would I have to sell everything to move it? And face a huge tax liability? Im not sure. It's really just not worth it to me. And the more money you have with a bank, the less likely you are to do it. When I was younger, I switched banks 3 times. I had money in two different banks, and switched them to a credit union. Then the credit union pissed me off, so I pulled all my money out and switched to Wells Fargo. But that was when I was still a teenager so my accounts werent very complicated yet.
