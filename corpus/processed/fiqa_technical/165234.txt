It's not non-zero but, in a resource extraction economy, the prices of those resources is critical. Alberta, which produces a lot of expensive oil, needs the prices to be above a certain amount or there are major problems. Prior to 2008, everything was wine and roses. After the crash, the elected government has been crying. Instead of funding everything through oil royalties in a surplus, they've made cutbacks and run a sizeable deficit most every year since. The lower prices has resulted in slowed construction and cancelled projects on the oil sands, which reduces the jobs, which undercuts the only positive to practically giving the oil away. This is with $32 billion is subsidies for oil and gas each year. Reduced jobs and money means less demand for real estate, which tripled between 2003 and 2008 and has mostly held steady since then. With rising interest rates on the horizon, many Albertans could lose 25%-50% of their wealth. If an oil produces wanted to hurt Alberta, increasing production enough to drop the price of oil by $5-$10 could do it. I know it's a tall order but there are certain countries and/or organizations that could do it. The US govt, for example, could have its oil barons and military hawks team up to subsidize production enough to sink Russia in the name of national security. It may not make much sense but neither does ethanol from corn and look where that is.
