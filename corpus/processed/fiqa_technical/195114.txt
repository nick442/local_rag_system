there is a trend to decriminalize weed. when weed is no longer a crime to grow, who is going to pay you two cents for a small handful of it? answer: nobody. and then what will your stock be worth? the word shit comes to mind, lol. it is a weed that manufactures itself, and the only reason that it has any value at all if that only certain people are allowed to grow it. and, even if it isnt decriminalized, what happens when this medicinal bullsht takes off and the cigarette companies start selling packs of joints for twelve bucks? again, your stock will be worth shit, and everybody that invested in weed will be high and upside down.
