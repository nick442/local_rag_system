I half agree with you here but I understand why they do this. It would be better for innovation if they actually created new ideas but rebuilding or improving ones that exist to make money is also a good move. It may not be entirely ethical depending on what you believe the meaning of that word to be, but they have enough cash to do this and succeed at it. $80 for amazon prime, In my opinion, is ridiculous. If you pay 80 bucks for this you would have to order a lot of stuff in order to make that up. My guess would be about 10 items over the course of a year, probably more. If google can do it cheaper I would go with them. A massive hurdle is amazon customer loyalty.
