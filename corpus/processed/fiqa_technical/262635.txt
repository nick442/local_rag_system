Disney is an extortion racket and has been for a long time. They're the reason that copyright laws are so messed up, they're trying to claim copyright on clear public works etc... This is very similar to Apple, or Netflix's arguments with the content producers. There are now no distribution costs (or relatively none) and Disney believes this is another way they can screw the customer and extort more money for the product. Amazon is innovating and attempting to pass the savings on to the consumer. This isn't news. Businesses have pricing disputes all the time, and Disney will suffer for this. Proof is in the pudding, The Beatles didn't exist on iTunes for a long time and the Beatles suffered more than iTunes. People didn't stick with a disc-man or carry any other mobile devices to listen to their legitimate Beatles songs. They just stopped listening or acquired it illegally. Netflix is still going strong despite missing a LOT of premium content that the producers think netflix can't survive without. They're holding out for a payday that won't happen. Disney is doing the same. It won't work.
