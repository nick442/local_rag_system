"Your argument is everything like the faucet. [You wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6msutw/tech_firms_unite_for_net_neutrality_protest/dk4q7vr/): *""Which is, for example, why my current Comcast service is ""unlimited bandwidth"".""* Your faucet entitles you to unlimited water. I say unlimited water because you cannot have ""unlimited bandwidth""; bandwidth is actually fixed by the properties of physics. You meant to say unlimited flow through the bandwidth that's available. I addressed that directly. Yet you saw fit to make another douchey (**in bold, this time**) comment in response. Have a downvote."
