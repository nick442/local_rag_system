how long have you been there? what could be interesting - rough it out a bit more - possibly asking for more work, hopefully that will help - but let the relationships and working relationships build a bit more, then ask if you could possibly spend some time shadowing other people, or, under the title of 'learning' or 'gaining experience about the field' get yourself into different parts of the company, etc. this could add to the learning, and to the possible enjoyment a lot. also - why did u take this internship? are u perhaps interested in working in big finance later? then this might be something worth holding on for. *edit- editing occurred
