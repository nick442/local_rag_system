The deadline for recharacterizing the 2010 roll over was October 17th 2011. What was the deadline to recharacterize a 2010 rollover or conversion to a Roth IRA? You had until October 17, 2011 (because October 15, 2011, was a Saturday), to recharacterize your 2010 rollover or conversion to a Roth IRA if you filed your 2010 tax return on time, including extensions, and regardless of whether you requested an extension to file your 2010 tax return. For example, even if you did not request an extension to file your 2010 tax return and actually filed your return on or before April 18, 2011 (because April 15 was a holiday in the District of Columbia), you had until October 17, 2011, to recharacterize your 2010 Roth IRA rollover or conversion.
