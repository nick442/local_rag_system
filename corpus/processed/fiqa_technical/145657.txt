Depends on what you're selling and to whom? If you want attention you need to win over the gatekeeper. I remember a colleague who would always drop off nice chocolates (in person) to the receptionists and support staff on a regular basis for clients they were interested in (they sold financial products to the C-suite). It worked wonders on getting in person meetings with the decision makers. It also helped that the colleague was genuine and pleasant to deal with.
