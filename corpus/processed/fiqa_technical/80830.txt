"Because Google recently decided that they will not provide Maps for free to partners who use the data, and Apple was the largest Maps user. Cutting the Apple created Maps app that used Google data and forcing Google to release their own app basically means Google goes from cashing checks from Apple to having to create and support an app all on their own dime. Also, do you want to guess why Apple Maps w/ Google data didn't have features like Turn by Turn Navigation? If you guessed ""Google didn't allow Apple to have it"", you guess right. Apple had to do it not only to try and reach feature parity, but to prevent themselves from having to pay their biggest competitor to use Maps data."
