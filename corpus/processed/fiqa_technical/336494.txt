[The website you mention](http://managementconsulted.com/consulting-jobs/2012-management-consulting-salaries-undergraduate-post-mba/# ) has starting salaries for those with undergrad degrees at $60,000, and as I mentioned above are not including bonus or 401k match. My information is 5 years old now and is not too far off. $60k to work 100 hours a week is not worth it, at least not to me. That's why I recommended to get his/her MBA so they can get into the business at a six figure salary. Source: I've been in the financial industry for 5 years now.
