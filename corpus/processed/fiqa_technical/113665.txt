I've never been involved with an HOA, but in organizations that I've been involved in, we had 'building funds', which were a dedicated part of the membership fees devoted to building up money for an event, building maintenance etc. My church when I was a kid had a heat fund in the summertime. Build up a fund, and spread the projects around.. that's the affordable way to do things. But you need good governance, otherwise you end up with some yahoo blowing the money on something frivilous when there is a sparsly attended meeting.
