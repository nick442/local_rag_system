"Europe was more advanced technologically, which was probably the main reason, if we want to go into reasons why that was so, we could really go down a rabbit hole on this one. To be fair, they did try with the caliphates, granted that was not ""Africa"", but it was the ""closer"" portions of Africa with Spain and even France being invaded, and same goes for central/eastern Europe. the Ottomans were in Eastern Europe all the way until WWI, and I guess still technically occupy the Istanbul area. Isn't Albania also majority muslim? Also didn't the Kosovo conflict start as a Muslim genocide (I have no idea, just watched behind enemy lines, which is probably a reallllly crappy source of historical facts)"
