Never heard the minimum wage teacher one actually. . . . sounds weird enough to be plausible to me. I use this case whenever a client starts asking about discharging student loans. Usually telling them it is a challenge and no guarantee for a quadriplegic to prove undue hardship rather quickly conveys the point of how unlikely it is to get their student loans discharged, and that their situation likely does not suck enough. and your out on a limb comment got me to smile. . . i have to admit.
