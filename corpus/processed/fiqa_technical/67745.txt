That is a pretty sweet setup. The few months I was on contract with an oil company they had a similar arrangement, although not quite as good as that. This is a different situation though. I'm sorry, but I don't think that as many people can do what needs to be done on an oil rig as can be trained to be a cop. I personally don't think they should be compensated at that level.
