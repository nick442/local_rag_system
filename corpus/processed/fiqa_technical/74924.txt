I think the problem is that for a desirable job you'll often have two equally qualified people but one has a job and one doesn't. It always looks a little bit better to hire someone away from a competitor than to hire someone out of the jobless pool. This is why it is important to give employers a tax credit for hiring the unemployed. It takes that above equation and shifts it a little. It also signals to society that it is important to get these people back in the workforce.
