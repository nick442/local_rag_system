Incorrect. Dividends are paid after tax, so whether they pay them or not has nothing to do with tax avoidance. Additionally, dividends have little to no impact on the market cap of a company like amazon. On top of all of that, amazon does not pay dividends at all, they invest their cash back into themselves to grow. This strategy reduces profit, and the growth drives up their market cap and drives down their cost of capital as a result.
