Did you just completely skip the link I posted earlier about a company working on this very thing? Also, you keep on moving the targets to continue your objections. You were the one that said $12/hr. I showed how a machine could be a cost effective alternative. People are working on these machines *right now*. It may take a decade for market penetration, but this is happening. I don't expect my level of job to be impacted by it for a long, long time, but there will be pressure applied to the job market itself.
