The fact that this is what’s being reported is horribly misleading. At the bottom of the same page of that report, there is data intended to show the difference between the pay rates in genders. This data accidently proves that individual incomes are still stagnant and that the reason for our increased household wages is that more people per household are working, and part timers are working longer hours. Following is how this conclusion is drawn: The section titled “Earnings of Full Time, Year-Round Workers,” can be used to find 2015’s average income per full time worker, and 2016’s average income per full time worker. The 2015 data shows that men made up 57.51% of the full time, year round working population (63,887/111,098) and earned $51,859.00. Women made up 42.49% of the full time, year round working population (47,211/111,098) and earned $41,257.00. This means that the average income for a full time, year round worker in 2015 was $47,353.69 (51,859 x .5751 + 41,257 x .4249). The 2016 data shows that men made up 57.34% of the full time, year round working population (64,953/113,281) and earned $51,640.00. Women made up 42.66% of the population (48,328/113,281) and earned $41,554.00. This means the average income for a full time, year round worker in 2016 was $47,337.11 (51,640 x .5734 + 41,554 x .4266). So while the news is reporting the increase in household income, the average income for a full time, year round worker actually fell by $16.58 in 2016.
