Agree with you here. I had to hammer in that concept for all our upcoming IT projects ~ most of these guys just never think in those terms, but frankly, that's the main way we decide on which projects to invest in with a limited budget. How the hell else am I supposed to put it? Results is only half the picture - huge results with even larger costs doesn't automatically make it a good idea.
