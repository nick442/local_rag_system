"From my limited experience with foreign exchange.. Money is a commodity. people buy it and sell it like other products. if ""money"" is in demand the price goes up. this is the case when a countries stocks are hot, and you need to purchase that countries currency to buy that stock.. I've also seen the currency rise on news and speculation. Many years ago, I administered foreign receivables.. My job was to settle letters of credit from Britain.. I remember on one ocassion Margaret Thatcher said something to upset the markets. her remark caused the price of the UK pound to fluctuate."
