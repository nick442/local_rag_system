A good manager sets up systems, so you hardly have do to direct anything yourself. Manage by exception. Trust, ask employees how things can be improved(they will have better knowledge of the task) and let them implement it if it's good. At our place, we have visual management things on TV screens so everyone knows what's going on, metrics etc. People are constantly trying to improve the performance of system without management pushing for it. Empathy is highly important in management. You have to feel what they feel. The last thing you want is disgruntled employees. Good luck getting people to do things well, when they think you are a dick. You can't demand respect.. By definition. You gradually gain it by being good at the job, and making their jobs feel better. If you can find out what people's real skills are then design the role around them. Don't force people into strictly defined roles. This is why people get fired. They're in a job that doesn't match their skills. Nothing worse then knowing your shit at a job, but unable to move to a job you think you are good at.
