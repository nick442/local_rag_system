Hey man. First of all, having a firm understanding in SE is a blessing! Finance firms are actively looking to hire with software engineering skills from tech. The closer to your background skills, the easier it will be to get a job. If you don't want to be a programming drone for Goldman, i'd say algo trading or being a quant at a hedge fund would be an awesome gjg. If you definitely want to do investment banking (m&a/ibd), focus on spinning your story and background targeting tech companies. Just make sure you know why you want to go into finance and that role vs SE. Make sure you truly try to understand what investment banking/algo trading is and can explain it to your grandma. Above all, network, network, network. Good luck.
