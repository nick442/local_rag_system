I currently have a T-Mobile and Verizon phone. Dropped calls are a much bigger issue with T-Mobile than Verizon. However, the Verizon line is significantly more expensive. The other big variance is customer service: T-Mobile's never seems to want to help; about 1 in 4 calls to them is pleasant. However, Verizon's is a bit better. I know Verizon has a terrible rep about customer service, but I haven't had a terrible time (maybe I'm just lucky).
