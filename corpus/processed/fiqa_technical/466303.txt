No, given the circumstances, no tax due. The fact that the wife wants cash makes my next comment moot, but for others - An IRA in either flavor belongs to the individual and cannot be gifted as such. But. Under a QDRO, a Qualified domestic relations order, the account may be transferred as an IRA. For a spouse who doesn't need immediate access and would prefer the gross amount and continued growth, this might be preferable to getting the cash. For a pretax IRA, cashing out the whole account can be costly compared to the partial distributions each year.
