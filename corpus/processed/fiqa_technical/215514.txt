I've always thought, how could they afford that expensive real estate at the end of those dumbbell malls (the ones with the largest stores on either end) for almost all of their stores? A store like American Eagle is so much more profitable by area and are in the middle of the mall. Not many people really think about Sears as being the 'best' in any part of the market.
