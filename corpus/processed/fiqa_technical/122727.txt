I feel like this would be less controversial if we used a different term. Its like an RF mirror. I don't know exactly how this tech works, but the gist of it is the implant reflects RF singles in a specific way so that it can work like a key. I would love to have this in place of my drivers license, credit card, etc. It would be so convenient. To open doors at work, doesn't really save me any hassle, because i can just put an RFID card in my wallet. It'd need to be broader in scope for me to have any interest in it. I think much of the outrage here is people not understanding the tech. This isn't a Dr Krieger mind control chip.
