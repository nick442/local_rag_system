I suspect that the economics of online information supply tend towards natural monopolies, and that it was inevitable from the outset that you would eventually only ever have one Amazon, or Facebook, Google or Twitter in the running. One of the few things that Steve Bannon says with which I might agree is this idea of regulating Internet platforms as though they were utilities - they just exercise too much sway over popular opinion for control to be vested in private individuals.
