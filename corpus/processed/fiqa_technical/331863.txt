"It's a nice thought, don't get me wrong. Pushing decision making power down to levels that can correct issues quickly is great; especially in smaller organizations. The big miss with this line of thought is that all of Tesla's 33,000 employees actually know who / where to go to solve their issues in the first place - they don't (nor do they in any large organization) which is why you have organizational structure. Also - the author states at the end ""I worked for one non-profit with this environment and then consulted for a half dozen others; none of them had this sort of communication."" I would have puked if I weren't laughing so hard - how that experience is relevant to the article regarding a large, for profit enterprise is beyond me. I am sure it impresses people at Starbucks though."
