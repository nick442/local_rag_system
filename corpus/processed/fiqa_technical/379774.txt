You keep claiming higher taxes will do X when history shows you that's not entirely true. We need to both rein in spending and change where the remaining money is spent in the budget. We also need to take the wealthy at a higher rate so that the 'burden' is equal to the proportion of wealth in this country that they own. Framing it as an either/or is a logical fallacy.
