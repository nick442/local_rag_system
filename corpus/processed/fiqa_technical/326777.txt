I swear on my grave that this is exactly why I got into automation and the technology behind it. It's booming, and there are a stupid amount of jobs at all levels. >First year out of college 70, then 100 the next. I was offered another job via networking last winter so this year I made 80 but I work at a much better pace and have much more control over what I do, and I don't have to travel. I used to like all the travel though. I'm just following through on another offer this week which is another raise with more perks. I graduated in 2008 during the deepest part of the recession. It's not bragging because none of you know who I am. Frankly I'm not sure what to think.
