Germany does a hell of a lot more trade with the US than they do with Russia so if Putin thinks impacting Germany's trade can impact their foreign policy, the U.S. has Russia beat by a mile.

But more often than not it just pushes those countries in the opposite direction. Why else is NATO right on Russia's doorstep these days? Right now, Russia is banning imports from Georgia (principally Georgian wine) because they don't like Georgia's western leaning government. And all it is accomplishing is making Georgia even more anxious to join the E.U.
