You can transfer to/from bank account. First, you must establish communication between PayPal and your bank. This has been my experience. Login to your PayPal account and do the following. Step 1. Click My Account tab, then choose 'Profile' Step 2. Choose My Money, Bank Account. There you can establish your bank account. Step 3. After you establish your account, you will receive confirmation deposits to your acct within a few days. Step 4.
