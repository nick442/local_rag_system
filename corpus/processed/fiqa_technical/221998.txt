For most people the standard deduction makes all of those itemized deductions (like state taxes paid) moot because they add up to less. If he's doubling the standard deduction, then you'd need a lot more things to be deductible before it would be worth itemizing. As for what you're proposing, It sounds like it would be beneficial to a lot of people. I wonder what the total tax revenues would be for it.
