I'm more of a free market man myself. BUT, I do understand the balance of regulations, the problem is heavily regulating can actually cause market failure as well. There is a balance some where, as to what the laws say today? I'm not sure, but I think they should be altered. Commercial military isn't a bad thing they pay good wages to ex rangers and SF guys as far as I'm concerned. There's always going to be good business decisions that aren't good for humans, look at how people are massively advertised to, Companies pay psychologist just to figure out better ways to market. It's about getting people more informed, so that those negative companies die out from demand declining. This is how you keep an economy stable, when you are changing laws left and right it causes more speculation.
