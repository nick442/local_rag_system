Ultimately all these will pale in comparison to the cost of choosing a place where Amazon cannot get talent to move. I work in the field, and I'd never move to a city for Amazon. I love to cities for the industry presence, but never one company. If you moved to Baltimore, took out a 1 year lease and took a job for Amazon, how fucked would you be when Amazon fired you in a month? Very fucked. Almost anybody you'd go work for would be a significant step backwards. Now imagine doing that in San Jose. You'd get a raise on the next job and they'd invariably treat you better, because Amazon is a meat grinder that consumes youth and enthusiasm and outputs misery, isolation, and competitiveness. Recruiting is a massively expensive endeavor and tax breaks are nice, but it takes a large ecosystem to generate the candidate pool and attract an outside one. Tax breaks are awesome but I'll bet Amazon doesn't pay any anyways.
