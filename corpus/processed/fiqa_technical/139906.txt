I'm pretty sure his secretary pays a higher rate, not higher amount. The argument they're following the law and if you don't like it change it really kills me. When you spend money lobbying for a change to the tax code how can you then claim you're just following the law? It's ridiculous there are 7 tax brackets below &450K yet only one above it. I know families right on that line, work closer to a million and some that blow that away. They live completely different lives and should not be paying the same top tax rate on earned income.
