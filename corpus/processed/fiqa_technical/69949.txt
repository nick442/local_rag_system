I did not expect this! However, upon review, it is quite sad, really. Being top 20% requires only a bit above 100k in family income. That means that two working parents on 50k+ is in the top 20%. As a Norwegian, I am geniunely shocked by this. Your top 20% earns no more than an average middle class or upper working class family would earn in Norway. If memory serves, our prices are on average 20% higher than US prices, so that still doesn't explain the discrepancy. Still, it was interesting to see the high variance in incomes over time. I presume that can explain why stress levels are so high in the US.
