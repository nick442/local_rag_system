I've definitely seen a lot more small businesses pop up where I live (Silicon Valley) as I was growing up. In a busy, urban environment people really do like convenience. And in an age where people dislike the power of huge corporations, a small business is a good f-u to that sort of status quo. Also the title is a little misleading since it mainly talks about the issues restaurants are suffering from lately. I could see a lot of more people ordering online in this day and setting. And of course, it's a rich-people thing because the food can also be quite pricey.
