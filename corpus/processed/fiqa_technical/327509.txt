I think it comes down to whether you are happy with the investment choices in the 401k. If you are, there is no reason not to invest there. Additionally, it doesn't have to be an either-or choice. You can invest up to the maximum in both accounts. BTW, congratulations on thinking about retirement at your age. I wish I had been in a position to do that.
