"I would start with actually talking to the collection agency. Say what you are saying here, namely: ""I'm willing to pay the debt if the creditor can prove to me that I owe them"". You can also talk to the health facility, ask them for information or records. You can start there and see what happens. Once you are ready to pay the debt you can negotiate to have the negative mark removed from your report. It really depends on the collection agency. They could be reasonable, or the could be total scum."
