Amazon uses their AWS profits to subsidize all their other businesses. They can afford to sell groceries at a loss until most of the competition goes out of business. It's good for consumers in the short term, but I wouldn't say it's capitalism working as intended. Unprofitable businesses are supposed to fold, not be propped up indefinitely by deep pocketed investors. It's monopolistic behavior without the monopoly, which I don't think we've ever seen on this scale before, so we aren't sure what, if anything, to do about it.
