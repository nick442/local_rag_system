"Welsh had pushed the stock about as far as one could by using GE's capital as collateral to borrow money at rates much lower than banks. So GE was able to out bank the banks for many years. The problems with this all came back under Immelt. Welsh sort of shit all over the culture of technology and engineering and Immelt was never able to recover that as the capital business fell apart. The company really hasn't been able to make good choices. Anything they buy does worse. They need to stick to markets with a high cost of entry and long lead development times. This is very contrary to the ""Silicon Valley"" tech world of today, but it is where GE has remained successful (See GE Medical and GE Aviation)."
