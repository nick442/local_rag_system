I would give him some credit for not screwing up and over spending too much. He has run up his secret service costs so they need more money that hasn't shown up but that is really a drop in the bucket against the budget. He hasn't passed any legislation that effects the budget yet. And mid year really doesn't matter they should have a pretty good prediction for the debt this year that would be a more telling number.
