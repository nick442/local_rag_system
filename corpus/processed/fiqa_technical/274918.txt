>Man is a social animal. He generally is; but he doesn't *have* to be. Not in anything like way that the aforementioned bees are. >The survival of our species has been only made possible by our acceptance of our co-dependency. Au contraire. The social co-dependency (within limits) has served to both allow the species to thrive, AND at the same time, has often severely limited and constrained us. The vast majority of human history has essentially been one of cyclical feudal-fascistic/crony-capitalistic -- monarchical governments in collusion with an elite of rentier-landowners who together control commerce -- growth during the early post anarchy stages, and then followed by later implosion as the system ossifies (with socialistic aspects implemented in an attempt to maintain power in the face of a growing mob).
