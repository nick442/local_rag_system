They could have just lowered the price of the car. They were selling a 75 battery at this price with just some digital handcuffs added so that the previous 75 battery people wouldn't get sour that the car they had bought at a certain price was now cheaper. It's DRM. If the hardware can do more but the software deliberately won't let it, it's DRM. If you're fine with this practice then you're fine with it. I don't like it at all. You don't have to agree with me. P.S. Will space ships from SpaceX in the future be like this too? I used to want a Tesla model S, but now I don't. I don't want a car that someone else controls. Unfortunately many cars today are like that.
