There are a few ideas: 1. Basic income allows consumers to keep spending. 2. Consumers spend money saved through new tech, at things that require lots of human labor. 3. The government pays business to take care of people. 4. Maybe businesses will be a new kind of entity , one that doesn't seek to make money, something new we'll think about. Maybe something like today's non-profits. 5. If consumers got $1B in salaries from businesses, and spent $1B in salaries at businesses, did businesses get anything from consumers ? maybe the money is just a fiction ,and we'll find some other fiction ?
