One thing to consider: the Apple service plan covers replacement of the battery in addition to the normal things you expect. Since the battey is not consumer replaceable, and, according to what I hear, is almost certain to wear out within the two year life of the phone, and is more expensive to have Apple replace than the extended coverage, it's probably worth it. (Disclaimer: this was told to me by my son who used an iPhone for two years before I got mine. I haven't independently verifies his facts. This also applied to the 3G and 3GS. I'm just assuming it's also true for the 4.)
