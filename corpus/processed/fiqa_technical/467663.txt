"The formula is actually as follows: (0.06571441 * V^2) + 15 * V, where V is the value divided by 1,000 which gives us AU$ 23,929 You find the same value using the calculator you linked to if you select ""Investment"" instead of ""Primary Residence"" or uncheck ""I am a first home buyer"" Edit: I don't know how they determine the $AU 821, it might be worth calling them. From looking up the First Home Owner Discount, it looks like no stamp duty may be due if you qualify for the discount: From 1 September 2016, the Northern Territory Government introduced increased stamp duty assistance for first home buyers who purchase an established home in the Northern Territory up to the value of $650 000. The First Home Owner Discount (FHOD) is a full stamp duty concession on the initial $500 000 value of the home, which equates to stamp duty savings of up to $23 928.60. For established homes valued at more than $650 000, a stamp duty saving of $10 000 is available until 31 December 2016. source: Department of Treasury and Finance"
