I have run Noscript and a version of ad blocker for years. Google is not doing it for us but to protect their precious ad revenue. Less intrusive ads might not get blocked. I also really hate the ads that blink. That is what got me started on ad blocker. All I can say is that it's about time that some restraint was used to keep the visual and auditory pollution down.
