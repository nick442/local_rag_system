Yup, I was in the same boat. I ended up refinancing and making home improvements at an inopportune time. I've been following things much more closely now. The one I'm thinking of is has a guy drawing in blue, and is not the RSA Animate video (which is just marxist conjecture). I watched the other video linked above with the flowchart in white on black, and it was excellent as well. If you have questions, you can ask as well.
