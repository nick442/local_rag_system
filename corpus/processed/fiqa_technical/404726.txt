"Most personal loans in the US are for the purpose of purchasing some tangible object (usually a house or car) and that object is the collateral for the loan. Indeed, the loan proceeds are usually paid directly to the seller without passing through the bank account of the borrower, and the seller delivers the title of the car to the lender, or a mortgage lien is recorded on the real property. Except possibly in the case of a refinance of a home mortgage, there is not much cash from such a loan to send to a friend to invest in his business, whether in the US or in India. These types of loans are ""relatively easy"" to get. Much harder to get are unsecured personal loans. Unless your friend has a very friendly banker, getting an unsecured loan of, say, $20,000 ""just for the heck of it"" is not easy. Some reasonably well-off people do manage to get such loans and use the money to invest in the stock or bond markets, in which case, the interest paid on such loans can be deducted on Schedule A (but only to the extent of the actual investment income; any extras can be carried over to the next year). So, will your friend be investing in your business or making a loan to your business? and do you anticipate that your business will generate any investment income or interest for your friend? If not, and your friend still wants to finance your business (while making payments on the loan in the US), then your friend must really like you a lot (or have faith that a few years down the road, you will be able to sell your business to GoAppTel for mucho big bucks and pay him off very handsomely)."
