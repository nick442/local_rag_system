"It wasn't new, though it may be unused. Contact the seller, and amazon, and complain. It should still be under manufacturer's warranty, and you do have the receipt to prove when you bought it.. But if you want to register (makes getting service a bit easier, but mostly puts you on the company's mailing list) the seller owes you that and/or an unopened package. As far as ""why"" goes: It may be as simple as someone having ordered, looked at it, decided they didn't want it after all, and returning it. Or it may be an attempt to claim a rebate, though generally those require part if the box to prevent that. Or maybe they swiped your paperwork to give to the previous person to complain. Or the manufacturer could have missed packing it. Or.. We can't tell you which."
