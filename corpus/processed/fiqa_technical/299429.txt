This is why anti-monopoly legislation is horse shit. The only people who complain about monopolies are small, inferior, less-efficient businesses. They're the reason why anti-trust legislation came about in the first place. Why would you want smaller, inferior, less-efficient businesses in the first place? Let market forced dictate who is best. Competition will either create a new market or successful business, or force the monopolies to innovate to keep up.
