"From a tax/legal perspective, any income is taxable no matter how derived. On the other hand, if you're asking, ""When has my hobby crossed over from being something that I do on the side to something I should consider doing full-time?"" Different set of answers. Firstly, do you want to place that burden on your hobby? If you're doing it purely for fun, do you want to ""marry your mistress""? Once you start depending on it for income, the money you earn is no longer fun-money and must now be used to pay legitimate expenses, taxes and other commitments. Secondly, will it support you or will you need other side projects? Consider your total income package now, including whatever you make from your hobby. How much would change if you switched your commitments and, perhaps, lost some of that revenue? Lastly, if you started your hobby to be a break from the routine, what will now break you from the routine of your now ex-hobby? All that said, if you're genuinely pleased by the income and overall profitability of the hobby, excited by the opportunities available and see a engaging and stimulating new career ahead of you then go for it."
