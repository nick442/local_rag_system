Alright it's been a little and I just realized I haven't kept you guys updated Everything went perfectly well. I met the guy I was supposed to meet in front of the store, I queued up with everybody else and the guy handed me discretly 650€. We went in, I bought the shoes, I gave them to him and he stayed inside the store because he was waiting for an uber and outside there was a lot of people who wanted the shoes (80 of them in france) so yeah, I just walked out with 430€ in my walled and here I am, doing perfectly fine with money in my wallet :D End of story, or not because i'll be watching out to other shoes so I can do the same again and apparently 650€ was like waaay underpriced
