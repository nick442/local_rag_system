In 20 years who will give a shit, what seems important now is Morgan & Stanley's repeated buy calls for an obliviously failing economy, that is plagued by deep defaults and half baked Central Bank decisions more targeted towards political win points than economic stability and growth. It is obvious Morgan is getting a little shrill, whats the exposure and whens the Margin calls sweetums? cause nobody is buying and you are stuck with it
