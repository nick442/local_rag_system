No, my argument is that our system is designed to allow the executive and judicial branch to legislate if the legislative branch can't. Legislate might not be the appropriate word, but a decision from the executive branch becomes defacto law if the judicial branch determines that: 1) legislation exists allowing the executive branch to make that call (as is the case with NLRB) or 2) it doesn't conflict with current legislation. After that point its up to the legislative branch to pass a law that negates it. That is just a fact of our system of government.. yes its fucking anti-democracy as hell, but (IMO) its less terrible than having no legislation passed.
