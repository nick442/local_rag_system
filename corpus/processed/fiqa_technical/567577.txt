Personal loans are typically more expensive (have higher interest) than mortgages, because they are not backed by an immovable asset. So you should reconsider the decision to not want a mortgage; it would be cheaper. Aside from that, once you get a personal loan, you are free to do with it whatever you want; this includes sending it to your parents, buying something, gambling it away in Vegas, or take out cash and burn it. So, yes, you can. Sending money from the UK to other EU countries should be easy and simple, once it is in your account, your bank can help you to make the transfer. I assume you understand that if your parents walk away with the money, you are left holding the bag. You are taking the full risk, and you will have to pay it back.
