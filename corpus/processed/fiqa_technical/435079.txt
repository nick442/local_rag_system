"Why not both? I have been working and studying at the same time since I was 13.. for all purposes, when I finished high school, I was working and studying part time.. until I got my B.Sc in Computer Science and Masters in Business Administration (MBA).. developed my career and now I am a senior executive making excellent money and supervising many people. In retrospect, I want to tell you that the degrees did not help me at all in my career in the sense that did not teach me anything of significance for real work and career life, nor did they lend me my first jobs. However(!), without a degree (piece of paper), I could not advance to my current position because ""degree required for this position"". One more thing, very important: when I studied for my MBA, and worked full(!) time, I had no choice but to take night classes (City University of NY, Baruch College, one of the best business schools in the country). **This was the best experience I had in all the of my college studies!** Why? Because all(!) the professors who teach in the night were working in the morning in their normal jobs - none of them were tenured professors. They were real business people, grounded, know what they are talking about, and they were teaching because they loved to teach and share the experience and knowledge. **Do you understand what I am saying here?** So, I did not get the theoretical nonsense from them. They actually taught us what really happens, the real approach to things, and the real issues to address. P/S: My son is following my way. Since he was 11, he works in the areas he like (Minecraft) and he made money since then, running classes, getting to know people in the field, getting experience, getting work ethics, etc. If he wants to go to Harvard, fine with me, but I think he just need to go to ""reasonable"" low cost college to get those pieces of papers called ""Diplomas""."
