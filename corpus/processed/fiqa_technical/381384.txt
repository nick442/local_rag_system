He literally wrote a 1500 handbook on trusts and was a trust counsel at a huge bank for a long time so I definitely don't doubt his words. In one month I've learned what feels like an absolutely insane and mind blowing amount. I'll ask him after next class though to clarify what he meant. But he was also for sure talking about commercial purposes like mutual funds and stuff too. Edit: Im only posting here because a lot of stuff he says goes over my head as I am still a student and learning about trusts lol
