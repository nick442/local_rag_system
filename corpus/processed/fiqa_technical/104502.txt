Yes but unfortunately not only are Sears and K-Mart big employers, but they are often anchor stores in malls, meaning that if they close, pretty much every store in the mall is going to take a hit, and then the mall itself could collapse. I suppose this drives gas prices up, as people now have to drive more to get their shit. So buy Shell, is I guess what I'm getting at.
