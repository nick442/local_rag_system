"You don't need an ""MBA"" to evaluate the performance of a bar. There is usually a dumb ratio for any industry which sets the expected turnover and bottom line. Basically one figure that can be given to an experienced bar owner and he'll know that the top and bottom line should be. Not knowing the bar industry, your area or grade of location etc I'd guess cost of sales (i.e. drink), you apply that against the typical gross margin % and you'll know what the turnover figure should be, and apply it to the typical net profit % and know what the bottom line should be. Wouldn't surprise me if an experienced guy could figure all that out just from the floorspace area and rent, with a bit of local knowledge. It should go without saying that if these are underperforming, it doesn't tell you why. Maybe your manager is swindling you, maybe he's crap, maybe the owners took crappy decisions like inappropriate fit out, crap marketing, crap location, etc, forcing manager to price low. Also bear in mind that the average includes all the really experienced bar owners so it can already be a tough target."
