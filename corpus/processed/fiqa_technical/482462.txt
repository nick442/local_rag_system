As a business analyst, a tool I've picked up recently is Tableau. It's a powerful reporting tool that can build powerful dashboards which are great for presentations. If you have an academic email, you can get a free licence otherwise I believe it's around $3000. The bank I work at pays contractors $100,000+ for a single dashboard which can be built by a single person in a few weeks with some basic knowledge in the tool. It's a very versatile tool, I have a friend that tracks his fitness data with a Fitbit and then creates visualizations to date with his friends. I use it to import massive data extracts from multiple sources and then link common share points to build visuals that are put into a dashboard and reported to executives monthly. It's very interactive and that's why the higher-ups love it.
