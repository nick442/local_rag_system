"If or when you ""own"" your land outright you need to try and get the land patent on it. That is the supreme form of title to it. It goes back to when the land was acquired by the U.S. (from Britian, France, etc.) by treaty. Treaties trump even our Constitution. When you have a land patent.....IT'S YOURS! That link is to my site but this was so relevant that I had to include it. Hope y'all don't mind."
