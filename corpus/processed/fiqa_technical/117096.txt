I wonder if there will actually be a two-way debate on this. Discriminatory pricing is a tried-and-true financial and economic concept that is widely employed to great success across the globe. Even utilities have variable pricing based on needs and demand. Net neutrality is actually a threat to one main subset of the economy: The free content model. If your business model does not account for the cost to deliver your content, and instead relies on free distribution, then it's the business model that is questionable - not the model of distribution for cost. Something to think about. I welcome a debate here.
