Stores have been using fake markups for centuries--this is nothing new. It isn't anymore deceptive than any other business practice that has been around forever. I know a story in the UES of Manhattan that has had a going out of business sale since at least 2010. This is no PSA; it's an attempt at some viral marketing from yet another online clothes retailer. Yawn.
