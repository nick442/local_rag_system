I feel like the author doesn't have a clear message. On the one hand he is saying that Robinhood users should be long-term passive investors, the he turns around and criticizes it for not completing trades fast enough and having too much slippage. I think that we need to be very specific about our goals. If the goal is to make as much money as possible, sure, Robinhood is a poor tool. However, the vast majority of people are only at the point that they need to save more. If then our goal is to get more people to save more then it is a great tool. It lowers barriors and makes it fun. More importantly, the limits of Robinhood are obvious to anyone who starts to take the next step and increase their gains.
