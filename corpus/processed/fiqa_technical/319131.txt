You were the one who started the government talk. > No. Our taxes allocated the resources necessary for us to have roads, power, and all the nice facilities we use. The rich benefited from the government offering them the jobs to build these things. Or did you forget about that part? I have no idea what lead you to believe that I said these businesses that do work for the government aren't getting paid, but in large part the money they are being paid with has been borrowed from the financial sector. I've told you this three times now, but you seem completely unwilling and overall too ignorant to absorb the information.
