>U.S. consumers continued to shun passenger cars in favor of larger pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. Curious to why the shift away from passenger cars. Especially to trucks. SUV's and crossovers I get as you get the same amount of seating as a passenger car but more cargo space. I wonder how much longer the sports/muscle cars will last with this trend and that people favoring hybrid and electric engines over straight up petrol ones.
