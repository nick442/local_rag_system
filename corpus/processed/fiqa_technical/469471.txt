> They have created a system with healthcare where we pay up to three times more per capita than any other western country. Yes, and it really sucks, but you kinda have to buy health care .. you can skip it and hope to not get sick, but sooner or later you will. You don't need to buy entertainment though. And if you do buy it, you can always vote with your money. Stop going to movie theaters, stop buying or even renting DVDs .. stick to one cable provider or Netflix on demand or something and it will hurt them. > an additional tax refund A tax refund is just a tax refund, if you don't give them your money there will be nothing to tax anyway. > taxes to storage media. Yes, some countries do that, and I think it's OK in principle .. the problem is that I doubt that we can find a fair way to distribute that revenue. It's still peanuts though, especially today when we don't really buy that much media anymore. When is the last time you bought a blank optical disc? It's been years for me! But anyway I doubt that such a measure would stand a chance of passing in the US. It would be quite absurd to fund the MAFIAA with tax money while you don't even fund public healthcare. I'm not sure what you mean in the edit, it doesn't make much sense.
