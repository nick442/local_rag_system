[Peapod](https://www.peapod.com/) already do that. They deliver perishables along with non-perishables and non-food items. They have refrigerated trucks, refrigerated compartments in normal trucks, and specialized containers for keeping things cold. My girlfriend and I used to use them somewhat frequently (before we moved to an area they don't service) because otherwise, we'd be burning two hours to go grocery shopping due to traffic and crowds. [Schwan's](http://www.schwans.com/) does something similar, though it's not actual brick-and-mortar store goods. They have refrigerated trucks, and we frequently buy frozen goods from them. Schwan's have been around since the 1950's, as well, so they've more than proven that the process is viable. I don't doubt that there are other similar services already, as well, but these are the two that I know of and have used myself enough to comment on (and recommend) them.
