"I don't know, 'death nail' sounds kind of cool. Imagine it in a mobster movie - ""You have failed us for the last time, Luigi, and earned.. *the death nail*."" (Then the mobster hammers a black nail into Luigi's skull and leaves the corpse in front of the apartment building as a message to the others.)"
