The President, Democrat or Republican, has very little effect on the growth or performance of an economy. The Federal Reserve has the largest impact, followed by Congress. Interestingly, if US government spending was not frozen in 2010, the US would have grown closer to the historical average of 3%. Government spending, which is controlled by Congress, brought down GDP growth.
