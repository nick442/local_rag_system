"It's not at all different from anything that happens in reality. Everybody deals with risk and uncertainty, everybody worries about the future, and everybody puts their best mind to bear on it. You gamble, you hedge your bets, you try to do your best with what you've got and what you're willing to give up. People who aren't in the financial industry can also think about their goals in a fine-tuned, strategic, mathematical way. Being able to accurately model reality is useful for pretty much everything. The way in which it is actually totally different is not addressed. People who deal in derivatives can do a very precise job of predicting the future. So can astronomers, bullfighters, and migratory fish. The difference is that people who deal in derivatives have the ability to leverage reality to obtain a preferred future reality in a uniquely influential way. The guy is acting like investment banks live up on a mountain and look at tea leaves and send down memos about securities once a year. >Changing the shape of the graph is in some loose sense the business of the financial system, particularly the big investment banks, which are sometimes thought of as ""dealers in risk."" So are drug dealers. But the guesses investment banks make about the future affect the actual future of investment banks in a way that isn't available to, say, cobblers, so they are dealing with much less of their own risk than most people. >Buying and selling derivatives means consciously trafficking in risk and uncertainty, in a relatively uncut form. This makes it interesting to people who don't buy or sell derivatives for a living, but who are curious about risk and uncertainty. It also makes it interesting to people who are curious about why their lives are affected by the the risk and uncertainty of people who trade in derivatives."
