Same thing happened to me in the express checkout lane recently. Her total was less than $20 - I can't imagine writing a check for such a small amount. I get it, old habits die hard, and some people are adamant about tracking their finances manually and carbon copies make that pretty dang easy, but I wish more businesses would stop accepting checks to hurry their extinction along.
