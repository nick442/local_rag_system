8 years ago most of the people in the workplace wouldn't touch Aldi, last year I noticed people loved it and the topic was what a rip off both colse and Woolworths was. Mindset has changed and as cost of living has gone up people are looking to blame everything they can. People have resentment saying I can't believe we had been paying 1 $150 and we pay $80 and keep on bringing it up.
