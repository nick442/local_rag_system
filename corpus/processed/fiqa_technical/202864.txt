What do you mean by professional? Seems like you want to hire people to work and you to manage. This is fine but your costs will rise significantly. Seems like first you need more business to hire more people. Be careful that your market can support a larger buisness. Ive heard of many 2 bay car garage types going bankrupt after moving to a 4-6 bay because they couldnt keep the bays full 100% of the time
