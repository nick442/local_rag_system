M$ management needs a serious shakeup. I'm a windows fan but holy crap they went to shit over the last few years. Their hiring policies and constantly firing the bottom 10% of employes creates a backstabbing environment. Windoze 8 is a sad joke, the app store is a pile of unmoderated trash full of fakes and scammers. What were they thinking? Or perhaps they were not. Maybe they can poach a few executives from Apple who are looking for a challenge. If they could find a happy medium between windows 7 and osX, WITHOUT any tablet support they might be onto something.
