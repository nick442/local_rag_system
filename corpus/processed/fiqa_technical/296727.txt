"This is a legal business concept, as long as you don't misrepresent the source material. If you want to rebrand the items, you'll need a contract with the manufacturer. I would contact the sales dept at the manufacturer, and see if you can become a reseller/partner (many companies have ""certification"" programs, where you will gain cheaper prices for products if you undergo training on them) or even sign a rebranding deal. Ask for a reselling discount on the trains/accessories (20% isn't unreasonable in software- I'm not sure about the model industry), then buy from the manufacturer instead of the store. Hope it works out for you!"
