I like both. As a kid, the Bass pro catalogs were just as worn out as the Playboy magazines. Now that I can buy online, it is even better. I can't keep myself from going into a Bass pro every chance I get, and they're prices have almost eliminated the smaller shops which don't really have a place in the retail market anymore, expect for conveincece with their other services like equipment repairs, taxidermy, fresh bait, local guides, and equipment rentals.
