IMHO these people need to understand finance. I think Dave Ramsey is the best for this kind of situation. They need their butts kicked. What kind of parent spends money on playing cards when they have a child and not a place of their own? Answer: Parents that needs to grow up. Most of all they probably have an income problem. I would assume that the husband stays at home because he does not earn enough to justify quality child care. Okay how about he cares for a few other kids and turns watching one kid into an income stream? Duh? Giving them money will only hurt them in the long run. They are holding onto childhood, avoiding becoming adults. No amount of money you can give them will dig them out of their rut, in fact it may only prolong it. MTG is an intellectual game. If he spent half as much brain power on earning a living, the could probably be well off, and earn enough to have a tidy budget for gaming. Sorry Yamikuronue, but I disagree with your first comment.
