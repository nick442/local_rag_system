>We are the second most charitable country on the planet (source: world giving index), if Granny can't find support, she isn't really looking. Americans donated $212 billion to charity, sure, but the total Medicaid budget was $553 billion in 2016. The amount of support charity can provide just isn't as great as the amount public assistance can provide, and how could it? You will always get more money out of people when you point a gun at them than when you ask nicely. >The support is there for those genuinely in need. I like how your assertion has a built-in way to move the goal posts. If she can't get support, then it *must* be because she didn't *genuinely* need help. >And, the money goes further because it doesn't have to pay bureaucrat salaries. Do you not know how charities work? They have bureaucrats too, and they don't work for free.
