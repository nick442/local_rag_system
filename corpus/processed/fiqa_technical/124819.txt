> The Japanese experience actually tells us that they could never unwind QE. ..exactly. I suspect the Fed thinks that it's somehow different (this time it's different.. we're different.. The Japanese insist that they're different) and the Fed is probably going to tear its anus trying to shit 5 trillion out of its book. The real question is: how long. Time and pressure. It either makes diamonds or earthquakes and tsunamis.
