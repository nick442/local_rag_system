Yes, Better Place was a massive failure, in Israel (also Japan). As an Israeli I can tell exactly why: greed, and unreasonable prices and charges (literaly, charges of electricity and money.) The fact that Tesla is trying the SAME thing is showing you that this is the only way to have an electric car drive for a long distance. Personally, I think that also Tesla will fail with this battery exchange program. Only what happened with Standard Oil will work: a government mandated ONE standard for how to refuel a car (i.e. standard size and design of batteries to be exchanged for any Electric car.)
