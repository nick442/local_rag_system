"There is something to be said for government-funded high risk R&D. Startups which receive SBIR grants are much more likely to reach commercial success. Also, ""high-tech"" firms receive far less of their funding from private sources since they are generally higher risk. Because much of our recent growth has been in high-tech industries and because most high-tech startups get funding from public grants we have seen an increased importance of programs like SBIR. Just to substantiate this claim, here is a [source](http://www.springerlink.com/content/a684510qk6600666/fulltext.pdf) which shows that high-tech firms with less than 1000 employees in the US receive on average between 33-39% of their funding from public grants. In comparison, in the UK it is 6-11%. It is no coincidence that America has led the world in both public R&D spending and innovation."
