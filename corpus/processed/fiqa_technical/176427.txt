">Provide better quality of life for its citizens. That's the whole point of the economy. Right now it's not doing that, it's broken. That's why we need to fix it. That checks out. >For 100-500 years, you're probably right. But I'm not talking about the last 100 years, I'm talking about the last 30-40 or so. Every statistic I've seen indicates that the middle class and poor's purchasing power has stagnated severely while the rich have continued to rise, and it's put enormous economic strain on the middle and lower classes. Average hours per worker has increased versus 30-40 years ago. That and better technology means we are more productive than ever. Production is great. Maybe it's too great? If you slowed production, maybe you could prevent wealth from collecting in a few hands so quickly? Wouldn't that be a ""weaker economy"" rather than a ""stronger economy""? How exactly would you implement that, short of a rebellion? Here's the crux of your problem. America got incredibly wealthy from WW2. This is why 30-40 years ago, there was a rich middle class that was stronger than it is today. This was not ""the economy's"" success. This was luck (or strategy, depending upon how much government planned it out)."
