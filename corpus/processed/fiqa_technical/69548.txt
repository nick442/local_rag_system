I will not use an iPhone with the current screen size and wasted space around the screen. If someone gave me an iPhone I wouldn't use it let alone pay for one. They are soo outdated compared to even the S4, not to mention the S5. I actually chuckle to myself when people pay money for them. Apple should be giving them away like they are flip phones.
