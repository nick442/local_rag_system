One way rentals are crazy expensive. My wife and I got hit with a 8+ hour layover in Atlanta to get home to Norfolk VA and decided we'd just grab a car and drive. At least we'd be doing something and not sitting around an airport. It was gonna be about 40 bucks for the rental, but an additional $300 drop off fee to drop at another location! We noped out of that real fast.
