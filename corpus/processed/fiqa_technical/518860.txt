One reason that a bond can be significantly less than face value is because people are seeking better investments elsewhere, so for example if a bond doesn't mature for another 10 years, that 20% increase in face value isn't very attractive when compared to say leaving your money in the stock market for 10 years. Another reason could be that the credit-worthiness of the issuer has collapsed and people expect that there is a fairly good chance they are not going to make the payment. This could be what you would see if for example it was a one year time until maturity, but it has a value of 40% of the face value. There is a risk, because they can simply not pay. For example people who bought Greek bonds.
