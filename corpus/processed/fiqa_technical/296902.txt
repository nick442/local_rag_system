"> Is a guy stabing a Muslim because he thinks he defends his country a terror attack ? What about a Muslim stabing a guy because he thinks they destroy his culture ? To me both are acts of terror ! Well, the only question is about ""cause and effect"" and quantity. Do you think a rightwing would attack Muslims if they did not attack westerners? Do you think rightwing attacks are more than Muslim attacks? Are they even 1% of all attacks and harm? **What would happen if Muslims would never get attacked in Germany, even if they attack Germans?** (Check history books for the answer.) > E.g. i have nothing against refugees BUT they making terrorist attacks rape our women and are highly unhygienic by shitting in the streets"" That is a 1a grade hate speech and pretty much your opinion as far as understood you. Who said I have nothing against refugees? Of course I am against accepting ""refugees"": hardly any of the ""refugees"" are from the Syrian war. Almost all of them are economic migrants from mostly countries which are not Syria. Accepting refugees hurt them more than help, because instead of trying to fight their oppressors or try to improve their situation in their location, they take the easy choice of running away and making the situation even worst in their homeland. You never heard about foreign aid? You need to take people into your country instead of aiding them in their country? Note: if tomorrow, a catastrophe happens in Chile or Italy or Kenya, I will be glad to take as many of them into Germany because, for sure, they will try and succeed to integrate into the German society, customs and way of life. No chance they will start terror attacks against Germans and Sharia courts. > Please try to see that such things are damaging to the society and lead to mobs with pitchforks trying to restore ""order"". Prevention is the best medicine! Why, to begin with, cause damage to society and many problems by accepting ill-fit immigrants? **You are the one that is not open minded!** You see all the problems, caused only by refugees, and you want more refugees. Sorry to say that, but you are brainwashed. Please reply, I asked several times: > I say ""terrorist attacks are carried out by Muslims"" .. **Do you think I think all Muslims are terrorists?**"
