"Creating a better interface is simply not difficult. For users of Windows on desktop machines, it really wouldn't be that difficult to ditch some of the screen-saving efforts that are deliberately aimed at tiny handheld devices--or at least provide options to do so. Desktop monitors are now larger/cheaper than ever--why pander to a small-screen environment when the result forces users to learn a new interface that frankly doesn't even benefit them? I agree Microsoft needs to address the handheld/tablet niche, but they don't need to force everyone into their daffy interface when they don't benefit from it. Plus, as recw has said, the interface is split, with several sets of data files (like IE bookmarks). Same with the skype interface, same with the tiled interface for email which may or may not include your local/cloud installation of Outlook, plus ""Email"", plus online access for email. It confuses the hell out of the Boomers I work with, and that confusion is not necessarily the Boomers' fault--the interface was changed for the sake of change and they cannot realize any benefit from it on their laptops/desktops. Some versions of Windows 8 come on hardware that doesn't even have touch-screens! Stupid."
