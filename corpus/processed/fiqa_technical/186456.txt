Then why didn't you counter that? RP's budget is contingent upon gutting cabinet level departments and defunding a laundry list of government agencies, including some very effective ones. Criticizing my tone is just a shoddy dodge that's *every bit as arrogant* as what you read as my condescension. So: 1) Which 20% of diseases should the CDC stop researching? 2) How, exactly, are we going to keep planes in the sky, certify and inspect aircraft, manage routes and air traffic control, without the FAA? Even if we pretend that the FAA doesn't address a clear market failure, how will the problem be solved privately without passing undue expense onto consumers? 3) Without the FCC, what's to prevent me from building and dialing up a transmitter to bubble out any station I don't like? What's to stop anyone from just jamming anyone else? Do you think the police are suddenly going to take on the burden of enforcement? Please, take a good look at RP's budget. Again, while I agree with many of RP's criticisms of many policies, I don't agree with his solutions. There's too many unanswered questions, and the many things he's pushing to be eliminated are either impractical, or politically/economically untenable.
