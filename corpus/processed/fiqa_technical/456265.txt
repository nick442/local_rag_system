Your premise is flawed so I'm going to say you have no clue what you're talking about. Apple is a hardware company first and foremost. Always has been, and likely always will be. So when they see the market they see software as something to give away because software sells hardware. They make their bread and butter selling computers and device. Not mobile me accounts or OS X or iLife upgrades. Microsoft is a software company through and through. When they see the market they see a world full of computers that can run their software for a fee. But that well is drying up, manufacturers are leaving. So what does MSFT do? Get in the hardware game themselves. Because hardware sells software. That's the one and only rational they were willing to drop billions upon billions of dollars into Xbox and make it into an ecosystem. Sony's problem is that they grew so big they're too big. Most people only see the surface consumer stuff, anchored by fancy TVs or PS3, but they do so much more within B2C and B2B. Hell, Sony makes, produces, sells, distributes, plays, stores, transfers, enhances media content on various levels. But they're not best of class anymore on any level and the groups don't work hand in hand. The company is melting down the same way America is melting down. Weak central leadership, competing ideology (how can a company that makes movies sell movie players?), and exponential levels of complexity. Throw in the multinational field Sony operates in versus the much fewer countries Apple and Microsoft operate in and it's a gigantic mess. I have a head for systems and big orgs but I do not envy the man that has to push that beast along.
