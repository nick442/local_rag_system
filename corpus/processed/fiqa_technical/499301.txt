This paper makes the rounds every so often and I HATE IT VERY MUCH. No one has EVER EVER EVER estimated standard deviation by taking an average of abs deviations, because that would be stupid, further, realized vol is a very different beast than implied vol. AND FURTHER, the models are fitted to the data, rather than fighting the tape and fitting the data to the models. Most people working with these instruments are trying to figure out the prices of unknown derivatives based on known derivatives - the models just help interpret findings and estimate what's necessary to hedge a position.
