Saying that tighter gun laws is the same as taking away your guns is the same as saying that tighter drunk driving laws is taking away your right to drive. It's the kind of rhetoric that shows you are unwilling to be reasonable. I like this speech [from Obama](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/obama-to-gun-owners-im-not-looking-to-disarm-you) on the topic. >First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks’ guns is just not true. >And I don’t care how many times the NRA says it. I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I have been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. >And at no point have I ever, ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it’s just not true.
