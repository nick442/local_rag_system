I don't think these currencies need large scale adoption to exist or go up in value. Even if only 0.2% of middle and upper class people own bitcoins it can go to 100000$, simply because the marketcap and value of bitcoin is more than the $ amount invested in it because of holders and longterm supply deflation.
