>The scariest part of this single program was that its millions of quotes accounted for 10 percent of the bandwidth that is allowed for trading on any given day, according to Nanex. Am I jumping to conclusions? if this was done at a scale ten times larger wouldn't that stop everyone trading for that day? How do you locate who's doing it? Can we stop it or just hope they don't power trip? Wouldn't it be obvious who made money off it if they do decide to use it for that reason? Lots of questions because I'm a noob.
