Find a mechanic in the area that will, for a fee, do a pre-approval inspection. Then when you call the seller to inquire you can ask them to let you take the vehicle there as part of your test drive. I'm not sure how many RV mechanics there are that don't work for a dealership, and those that do may be less inclined to assist you in purchasing from a private party. You could also have a friend or family member who is a mechanic or good with vehicles come along. Also, the seller may not want to bother with the extra hassle, and if it really is a good deal, they likely won't need to. Of course, the other option is to just test drive it and trust your gut. This doesn't sound like a huge risk at 2K. Even if it breaks down right away and can't be repaired for a reasonable price, you could scrap the vehicle and hopefully make up a significant portion of the purchase price.
