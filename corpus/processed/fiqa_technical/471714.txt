I apologise, I'm not implying they won't make it into the industry. I believe Apple, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and/or Uber will all have major stakes in that market. The issue is, only 1 of those companies manufacturers cars. Even if Apple or Uber have the customer base to make the vehical cloud work, they aren't car manufacturers and will need to buy someone's self driving cars. Ford appears to be one of the few traditional car manufacturers that understand this. They're all messing with self driving cars, but they're the only one I'm aware of trying to pivot to being a mobility tech company.
