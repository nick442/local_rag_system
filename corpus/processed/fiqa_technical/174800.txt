200 is not normal. 140-160 including signing bonus, stock compensation, and base is doable if you go to the big tech companies. That said, it’s like getting into an Ivy League.. most wont. I’d say 100-110 is common in the Bay Area. To clarify, this is new grad. For experienced folks 200k total comp is common.
