Since there's no UBER or Lyft in VANCOUVER BC I tried out some taxi apps that did this, the wait times suck and the apps were clearly outsourced to the same company and essentially just recolored for the different company because it looked nearly exactly the same. When I hailed the taxi via the app the first app failed then their phone number didn't work, second app showed a taxi being a couple blocks away which mysteriously vanished as soon as I requested a taxi, showing no taxis near me. 2/10 would only do again if I had no other choice.
