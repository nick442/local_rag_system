"> I've done the math Look, your random assertions are meaningless. Show your work. Edit: Oh, and by the way, compare the bay area (which has a federal [""low income"" limit of about 105k](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/04/22/in-costly-bay-area-even-six-figure-salaries-are-considered-low-income/) with [the rest of of the country](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il2017/select_Geography.odn) where the low-income limit is closer to 40-50k for most states. 200k is also much more than 120k."
