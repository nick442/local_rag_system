Then in USA you need to buy the lists I guess. But if you have lists on your own you just remove the forbidden numbers from your list by syncing the 2 lists together in Excel for example. If you are calling from a public source like white pages then you need to double check each customer first. For example if you have a product that's for everyone then you don't need lists and can only read all consumers in a city. If you sell something that is good for the whole family then by calling one person you can sell for everyone. A good trick to maximize order value on B2C sales.
