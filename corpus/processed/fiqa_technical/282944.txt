Well yeah, and I personally feel that way. But I thought they were being extreme, and making unsupported statements can weaken the credibility of their cause. Zero correlation means that you can get done in 5 hours what I can get done in 40. Now, your productivity per hour will certainly be higher (you'll prioritize ruthlessly, automate aggressively, and work with incredible focus, maybe you're more creative and find higher value services to offer), but if I'm even a quarter as productive on an hourly basis, I'm doubling your weekly output.
