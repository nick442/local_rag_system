Can I Send the money back to my personal account of my mother/father in India? Yes you can. Do I need to pay any tax here in US or my parents back in India? There is no tax in India to your parents as it's treated as gift and is tax free between close relatives. In US you would need to pay gift tax if amount is more than USD 16000 a year. See other questions on this site for gift tax rules in US.
