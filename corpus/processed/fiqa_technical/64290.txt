Quite an interesting communication concept. I wonder if this opens the floodgates so to speak, and inhibits work production. Imagine Having to field unlimited additional emails from people outside of your own dept who perhaps don't know/understand how your dept operates/functions. I wonder do they find themselves answering non stop elementary questions, and, also having to field the negative Nancy's (no offense to anyone named Nancy haha) who just want to complain. I also wonder, once you get past the flood gate stage, could this be highly effective. Cool topic nonetheless
