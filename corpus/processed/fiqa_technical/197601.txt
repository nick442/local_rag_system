"Thats why I think its really funny when everyone says Bill Gates or Carlos Slim or anyone else like that is the ""richest"" in the world. It's all a floating benchmark based on that day's stock valuations and known stock holdings and has nothing to do with liquid cash or assets. I'd be more curious to know about old European money such as Rothschilds, old country royalty and the true value of Rockerfellers assets."
