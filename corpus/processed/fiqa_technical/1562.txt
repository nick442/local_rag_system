But now you're suggesting that the losses made by Starbucks are all because of expenses made by expanding into the market. If that were the case, then, well, I doubt the management would think the UK branch is operating on a healthy basis. Also, the point the article is trying to make is the losses are *not* just from expansion into the market. No, Starbucks in the UK is healthy and profitable, and the debt costs are inflated by bringing in debt from abroad; debt that has nothing to do with the operating and expansion costs made in the UK, and yet it lowers their tax rate. This moving around of debt is a scheme only suitable for large multinationals, and I think it's very fair to ask if your tax system should allow such practices. After all, the smaller coffee guy on the corner or your local three-store branches don't have the ability to perform such write-offs, and therefore pay a significantly larger tax cut.
