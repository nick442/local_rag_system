Actually she is. I've been on IR calls many times before and this is different. She is trying to maintain control because Marcato is trying to out the CEO, make bdubs do more franchises and so on. What she is saying is that they are doing everything right, the industry is the only one to blame and that Marcato is incorrect in saying they underperformed.
