"Washington Post's website is cancer. Shame on whoever decided that was a good way to run a website. Looks like a geocities website from the 90's complete with popup ads and anti adblock nonsense. But anyway. I like how the article cites Bill Gross. He is the star of one of my favorite stories in recent financial history. In 2011, during the debt ceiling madness, the S&P downgraded the US credit rating in an unprecedented move because they felt there was too much political turmoil for us to pay our debts on time. Bill Gross was the manager of Pimco's fixed income fund at the time, the largest bond fund in the world - I don't know how much, but probably hundreds of billions AUM? Gross was, and still is, one of the world's leading experts on FI securities. When the credit rating was cut, he predicted investors would flee from riskier US debt. He basically sold the entire fund's considerable holdings of US treasuries and fled to cash. Then the market did something absolutely crazy: it bought *more* US debt after our debt rating was cut. Prices went UP and interest rates went DOWN. It was insane. I remember seeing Gross on MSNBC or whatever right after it happened and he basically said ""I'll be damned man, whodathunkit?"" ¯\\_(ツ )_/¯ That's when I officially 100% lost faith in active fund management and went to index funds only. I've always felt that there is very high efficiency in securities these days due to the free flow of information and enormous processing power to analyze it. That being said, the flight to index funds will probably tilt the ""balance of power"" in the other direction, and increase inefficiency, which will produce lower hanging fruit, and then stock pickers start winning again. Maybe markets will reach a natural equilibrium; or maybe we'll just see the tide come in and out every few years or decades or so."
