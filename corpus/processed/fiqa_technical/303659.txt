The short answer is yes, electrical vehicles make logistical sense. The batteries aren't quite where they should be to really push the market, but the lifecycles are high enough, and the batteries themselves can be recycled. There are two major advantages that electric has over oil. The first is that electricity is abundant and can come from many sources. This means that a car can be running on power from coal, wind, solar, hydro-electric, or any other source of electricity. This also means that the cost per mile driven is generally lower than the cost of a gas driven car. Another big advantage is the national security it offers. If electric were to really enter the consumer market in a big way, the dependency on countries in the Middle East and Africa would be lessened. It would also ease some of the competition between nations like China and the United States over natural resources. Of course their are problems with electric cars as well, and they aren't even close to replacing gas for use in heavy machinery.
