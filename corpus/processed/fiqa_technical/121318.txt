It's doing a better job of the last non-socialist government. The hilarious thing I see whenever I talk to Americans is that every socialist country is compared to the first world so it must suck. But there has never been a first world socialist country, and comparing Venezuela to other petro-states, like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria or Russia they are doing a marvelous job of not murdering the opposition and/or all their religious minorities.
