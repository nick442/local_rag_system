"The actual process of ordering food is probably one of the easiest processes in a restaurant. What's not so easy is understanding the movement of your inventory and ways to minimize your waste to maximize what you order and reduce shrink. That comes down a lot to auditing your product (multiple times a day, even). Make sure before you approach the owners that you develop a business plan. Jumping the gun too early and trying to get in on their operation will come off as naive. You have to deliver the value of having you as a partner/main franchisor. Check out the movie ""The Founder"" if you want to see some of that in action (and check out a pretty decent movie to boot). Business owners usually talk numbers so learn to speak their language once you're able to get a grasp on the finances of the business (which you'll more than likely get to do once you get more management experience)."
