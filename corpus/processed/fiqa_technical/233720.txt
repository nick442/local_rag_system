It is not at all clear to me (and a lot of users) that Microsoft made the right tradeoffs. There is zero reason to hide things away in corners on desktops and laptops like we do on phones (which have a dedicated home button to take you to a known place). Throw in two different set of IE bookmarks etc, I don't think Microsoft was even trying. Add the love for windows brand to the point a casual user can't keep track of what it represents, a bad reception of all things windows was the most predictable outcome.
