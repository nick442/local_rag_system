">Yeah, that's what I meant when I said 'fellowships'.. freemasons, oddfellows, that sort of thing.. Yup. I just wanted to elaborate on your comment, and make certain it didn't get dismissed as some ""religion only"" thing by some anti-religion ranters. The plain truth is that when it came to *urban* areas there were at least as many secular ""fraternal order of _____"" (be it ""elks"" or ""buffaloes"" or whatever) societies. >the sort of orders that inevitably get labelled as part of a conspiracy to take over the world by christians whenever they realize church attendance is down. But at the same time, whenever anyone nowadays suggests that ""private charity"" can take care of anything, those organizations get lumped in with and lost in the ""anti-religion"" (and more specifically the anti-church, anti-christian) aspect by people who seem to think the only possible ways for ""charity"" to exist are either via work/unions, or via business/rich folks (""philanthropy"") or via religion (and thus religious tyranny) or via government & taxes (and thus bureaucratic/political tyranny). Few people REALLY understand that the vast majority of ""charity"" was (back before ""welfare"") largely independent of all of those things -- just people who organized for common well-being."
