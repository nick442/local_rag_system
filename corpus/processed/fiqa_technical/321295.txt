"GE have two problems as I (a GE alum) see it. 1. Short-termism in middle management. If you're a middle manager at GE, you're desperate to make ""E Band"" - the named Executive rank. To get there, you can't be in your role for more than three years, but ideally two. So you won't begin, support, endorse or participate in any project that won't see measurable financial results in >24 months. That's lunacy. What this means is that to show ""impact"" at GE, middle management bash together some flimsy band-aid for a real problem. They'll generally call it a ""template"" or a ""best practice"", even if it is neither. They'll put it on the GE intranet as a ""workflow"", and tell everyone to use it. Then they'll call that improvement project complete, and move on to their next job. 2. Matrix environment. Currently in vogue, I get it. Here's how it's poison to GE. There are middle managers in GE who report to three different people, and have no-one reporting to them (or very few people). Therefore, to get anything done without resources of your own, you have to go around begging and borrowing other people - under the guise of ""matrix environment"". That has two issues: firstly that it relies on the influencing skills of the middle-manager (don't get me wrong, influencing skills matter, but they're not the #1 skill required to move the needle), and secondly that it relies on the bandwidth and the ability-to-say no of the resource. Busy people say no, and busy people tend to be the best. Weak people can't say no, and they tend not to be. All this gives GE fairly crappy solutions to fairly fundamental problems. tl;dr: Incentives and Organization at GE lead to sub-optimal outcomes."
