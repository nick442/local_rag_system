Hmm.. I'm sure setting up an entirely new market would be really easy and wouldn't be met by serious backlash from extremely rich enterprises that like the status quo. /sarcasm I picture that option even more monumental of a task than a small company trying to set up as a new ISP in a city where a large telecom has a majority. It's nearly impossible thanks to all of the money that the large telecom can throw at maintaining its current market share.
