I think the personal information part of this is key. Anyone that's tried to operate a home business understands the catch-22 of advertising your home address. My home phone rings all the time with salesman trying to lease me copiers and sell health insurance plans. I also don't want the damn FedEx man at my front door at 8:00 am with a priority package. I'm also an attorney and I don't want needy clients showing up at my house. My point is, Facebook sells my personal information and I prefer they wouldn't. LinkedIn sells my commercial information ad I prefer they would.
