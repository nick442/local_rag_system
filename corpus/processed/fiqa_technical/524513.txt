"Yeah, you're right. Which is interesting in this case anyway, in that many analysts were highlighting the lack of fundamentals supporting the IPO price. To me, that speaks to the willingness of the underwriters to ignore that lack of fundamentals, and perhaps base the value on something else (e.g. ""Zuck's a wunderkind, he'll figure it out""). I guess my point is that the lack of foundation (that the market has since priced into the share price) was not hidden from the underwriters."
