"In your shoes, I would pay off the mortgage with the after tax investments and be done. You have different goals than I do in that you want to keep the debt. So, I would start calling mortgage brokers and asking for someone who does ""manual underwriting"". Manual underwriting essentially means they use common sense and look at your situation for what it is instead of saying ""income=10K means disapprove mortgage"". It may be that your situation is different enough from mortgage guidelines that you can't now get a conforming mortgage (i.e. one that is readily re-sellable to another mortgage holder). If that is the case, you can look for a small bank or credit union that would be interested in adding your loan to their portfolio and not reselling it."
