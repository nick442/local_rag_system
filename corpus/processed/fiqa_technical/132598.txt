Part of the TJ's business model though is that they are almost always placed near a larger full service store. The idea being, you shop at JT's first to save money, and they only sell items with a higher margin which accounts for the higher wages they can pay. Then, if you still need a specialty item, you run next door. The less choice option doesn't work as well in isolation, so saying everyone should sell less items and only high margin items so they can pay more would leave us with stores like Trader Joe's, with the same selection as Trader Joe's. And a relatively undeserved market. Once everyone has the same selection again, they have to start competing on price which means someone will open a TJ, pay their people shit and sell the same things as them.
