Well, it probably has something to do with the fact that they're not really fully opposing SOPA; they just provided some lip-service on that issue because they were losing business, and people are not fooled. They're not sorry; they're just sorry that they got caught supporting something as terrible as SOPA. But really.. Why the hell would people use GoDaddy in the first place? There are plenty of registrars and hosts that offer more for less, have a better reputation, and don't have to resort to whoring out T&A to get business. I've never viewed GoDaddy as something I would seriously use.
