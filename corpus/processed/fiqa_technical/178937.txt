"The statement ""America has no manufacturing"" is always meant as hyperbole. However I keep reading of people who seem to actually believe it in a literal sense. I remember once posting in an internet forum (probably Reddit) that if the US Dollar drops, US manufacturing will be in greater demand around the world and help exports. Someone then came along and replied ""But the US doesn't manufacture anything any more!"" in a sort of helpless arms thrown in the air way."
