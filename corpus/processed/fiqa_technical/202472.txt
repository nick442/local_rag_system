Because of things this article doesn't go to that I've read other places. 1. Britain didn't have elections in Hong Kong for decades at the request of Communist China. 2. Britain started really democratizing Hong Kong before the handover to get some facts on the ground to try and have a better representational system in place for the Chinese handover. 3. Stuff in Hong Kong used to get done under the British. 4. Now with newly empowered representation and politicians who don't necessarily trust the Beijing government, opposition to development and policy issues is happening, and less is getting done in Hong Kong vs. other major mainland cities.
