"My Schwab panel has the following options: As an example, when I go in to ""Wire Transfer,"" it prompts me to select which Schwab account, then Domestic or International wire, then amount etc. This will likely depend on the brokerage, I don't think Scottrade or Zecco/Tradeking was this integrated. Personally, I keep brokerage funds pretty well segregated from the remainder of my finances. I transfer money in and out from a more used checking account to keep the accounting more simple."
