I lost 5 years to my mental health, as well as many many people in my life (being bipolar has all sorts of nasty side effects, both on the up and down). It can be beaten. I promise you, it can. I'm not here to promise you that you can be an astronaut or president, but then again, most people don't end up there. Even with that said, I'm not telling you it's impossible. Don't let anyone tell you that- because if you listen, then they're right. My depression was beaten through forced activity. Sitting idle let the cobwebs thicken and the blood pump ever more slowly. By forced I mean one small productive task every 10 days- such as going to the grocery store. There were some days I ran out of food and couldn't bring myself to talk to a stranger on the phone to order delivery. Dark days. Hang tough. Mental health is just below the surface of society, but I'm hoping the national conversation starts soon. So many of us hide this terrible burden and our healthcare system is failing everyone. Don't lose hope.
