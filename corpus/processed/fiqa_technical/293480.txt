Not the only one, no. Definitely a good one, though. That would send huge reverberations throughout that space and you'd see other companies racing to upgrade their security. That would have a significant net benefit for the US consumer. However, I don't think that Equifax should go out business unless it can be shown that people suffered or will suffer enough damage for that to be reasonable. We don't know who has those numbers, do we? That's part of the case. If they're already being used against the customer base (and that base is ~1/2 of the US), then going out of business actually seems like the appropriate scale of punishment, as it's effectively the death penalty (or at least a life sentence).
