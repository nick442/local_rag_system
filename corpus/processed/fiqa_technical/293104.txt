"Everything post 2009 (actually late 2007 through 2008 since that's when the financial crisis occurred) has also been a ""unique once-in-a-lifetime circumstance"". QE on this scale is unprecedented. The only time it's been done before is by the Bank of Japan in the early 2000s and that has been proven to be ineffective. Now you've got the US, the UK, and the EU all doing it."
