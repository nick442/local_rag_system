"What you want is called a ""car wrap."" A designer can get a template for your truck, to have exact measurements of its dimensions. Then he creates a full color design in Adobe Illustrator or whatever. Then he prints them in waterproof, colorfast inks on a Mutoh inkjet printer onto shrinkable plastic with an adhesive backing. Then a guy carefully pastes them all over your truck. It's easy on flat sides, but they have techniques to seamlessly cover every surface of the truck, including the curved bits like around the headlights. It looks [something like this](http://www.capitalwraps.com/blog/bid/37088/Florist-Vehicle-Wraps-Bloom-In-The-Effectiveness-And-Visibility). But FFS please get a serious designer who does quality work, and not some amateur that produces an eyesore. Good graphics are good advertising, and costs good money to make."
