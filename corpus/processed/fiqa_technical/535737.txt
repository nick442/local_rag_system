If your investment returns are the main variable you use to determine if your advisor is doing a good job you are using his or her services incorrectly Also, if you are using a good advisor, he or she needs to know how your investments are doing, not you. However, my thoughts are based on the idea that you can't go it alone. If you are not among the people concerned about the market, waiting for the market to go down 'so you can find a better buying opportunity', or making one of many other novice mistakes, I'm not speaking directly to you with my comments.
