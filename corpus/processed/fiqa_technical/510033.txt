"Funny, all the stats say the opposite and that the majority of CEOs and the too earners are gaining more and more and the rest of people aren't making anymore or are actually making less. There is plenty of money to go around and this whole ""poor CEOs and small business owners"" bullshit is a dismissive argument by conservatives to distract from the falling wages and widening economic gap statistics. If a company is making little to no profit, how about they quit blaming their minimum wage workers and find a better business model."
