"Something I found helpful when I learned this, is to just use Excel to expand the series. So start with A1 as ""175"", then in A2 put ""=175+(A1*1.004308)"" and paste that same formula down for a few hundred rows. You'll find your answer on A216. Most non-math-centric people don't have an intuitive grasp of how exponents (aka ""compounding"".. and never mind the natural logarithms this is all derived from) behave; but you can play with the numbers ""unrolled"" in Excel to get a better idea of how they work. That formula is just applying 0.4308% interest every period (row), and adding in a fresh $175."
