> Not only that, but corporate subsidies and military spending far outweigh medicine expenditures Factually not true. Medicare/medicaid spending alone is 60%+ greater than spending on defense. The country is going broke on medicare/medicaid, not military spending (no matter how wasteful). Why are the major hospital networks in the US swimming in cash and seeing record profit levels, post-Obamacare passage? Duh.. excessive government spending without regard for risk or value/price is a boon to the industry, just like 'free money' was a boon to the housing market in 2004-2007.
