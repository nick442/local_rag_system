"> Kenyes wrote explicitly about deficit spending, and the repayment of those deficits. The denomination of the currency, floating or otherwise, is besides the point. It's not at all besides the point. A government can run out of gold. It cannot run out of its own free-floating currency. When it comes to borrowing, whether or not you can be unable to service that debt is **very** relevant to how much interest you pay. As Japan cannot run out of yen, Japan can borrow yen very cheaply - despite books that don't make a lick of sense if evaluated like a business. Because the US government cannot run out of USD, the US government can borrow USD very cheaply - even if there isn't any credible plan to ""pay down the debt"". Lenders quite simply don't consider the US's revenue/expenditure before loaning the government USD, for if you're not willing to loan USD to the guys that issue it, what *are* you going to be willing to do with it?"
