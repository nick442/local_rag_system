solidcopy, my point was that during the 4 transitions listed above, people had the same fears as you do today. What would all the horse workers do? What would the whaling industry do? That would the secretarial industry do? What would the switch board operating industry do? Society as a whole has benefitted. 1. With cars, you can now travel faster and longer than a horse and its much cleaner. 2. With incandescent light bulbs, you now have better lighting and you don't have to kill whales for it. 3. With computers, you have the ability to communicate with people from all over the world and our productivity, entertainment, and lives are better than ever. 4. With automatic telephone switch boxes, long distance calls now cost nothing when we used to be charged upwards of 10 dollars a minute. All those people eventually found other jobs. There isn't a society of unemployed horse people, whaling people, secretaries, or switch box operators. They were all able to transition.
