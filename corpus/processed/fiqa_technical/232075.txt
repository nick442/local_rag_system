Yes, they have tried with Google Shopping but nothing came out of it. I really feel they are these big dinosaurs corporations who can't adapt to new business model. Outside of their web apps they have not done much really. Gmail hasn't improved for years. The so called gmap improvement are bs, it's just some improved stuff.
