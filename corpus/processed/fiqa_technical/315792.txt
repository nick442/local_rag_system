It does have to do with supply and demand in a sense. My salary, as an engineer, has relatively little to do with the supply and demand of the parts my employers company makes. My salary does, however, depend (in part) on the supply of fellow engineers that have comparable skill sets to mine and the demand that companies have for engineers with comparable skill sets to mine.
