"You're entirely correct. It's one of those ""broken window"" fallacies. Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, James B., when his careless son happened to break a square of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact, that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation - ""It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?"" Frederic Bastiat's 1850 essay, ""That which is seen and that which is not seen"" is still the best and most beautifully-written of such explanations. As you point out, a gain for the construction companies is more than offset by the loss of life and financial expenditure of the insurance companies. Plus, it is never possible to quantify the entirety of the loss in terms of opportunities foregone (""that which is not seen""). People who were about to do incredible things but now gone. Property, of any nature, no longer of use to build on or perform service. Any replacement comes at the expense of other opportunities."
