"I'm told that the analysis and arriving at an answer with a good attitude is the correct response and not the precise answer. Bad answer : What? That's impossible, go fuck yourself, asshole. Better: Well, I have a Expedition and its cabin is about six feet across, ten feet deep and four feet high, so lets say 400,000 sq inches (rounding means your cool, right). About a third of the space is taken up by seats and what not, so 275,000 sq inches free. Lets assuming we pack the balls in there tight from the sun roof. I figure a tennis ball takes up 4/3(3.1416)2.5"" each, so lets say 10. So 27,500. I'd order 30,000 to be safe and have a well stuffed SUV. Do you want the engine compartment full too? Too much: Same as above but ""so to test this I was able to cram 27895 without damaging any of the plastic SUV parts, and allowing for the sun roof to close."
