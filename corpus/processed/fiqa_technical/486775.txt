I'm torn. On the one hand, it will be nice to see kids wearing stuff that doesn't make them look like walking advertisements. On the other hand, the much smaller apparel company I work for has been avoiding placing it's logo prominently on it's clothing since it's inception (I think it's a fantastic logo too). I don't want the added competition.
